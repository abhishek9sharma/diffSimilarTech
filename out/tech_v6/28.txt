width	height
wpf setting the width and height as a percentage value

1900082
folder	directory
works because the boost root directory contains a folder called boost and that folder is either in your default include path or you did something like

1900096
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are correct

1900098
google-chrome	firefox
i can have dynamic height only tested on google-chrome and firefox by adding this function to last line of onshow

1900099
width	height
maybe you did that in your own implementation of init i don t know but it may very well be that your view has a frame of 0 0 0 0 and therefore 0 height and 0 width

1900234
ant	maven
i√¢ m busy converting an existing project from an ant build to one using maven

1900234
ant	maven
i ve had a look around on the internet and some people seem to do this i think using ant within maven and others with the maven plugin

1900234
ant	maven
i d prefer to avoid mixing ant and maven

1900264
punctuation	words
so when im prsing text with input n n it is grouping in punctuation matches - in other words space and space.

1900320
ant	maven
well there is the maven hibernate3 plugin if you don t want to mix ant and maven which is a good idea here imo

1900320
put	get
so if you put your mapping files in src main resources they will get copied into target classes during the process-resources phase which is invoked by the plugin and things will just work

1900343
retaincount	dealloc
if you are absolutely sure that you had sent equal number of alloc or any message that increases object s retaincount and release messages for your object and dealloc method doesn t be called anyway it will be more complex

1900427
ubuntu	linux
works smoothly on win machines even on slower ones but flickering badly on linux which installed to a decent machine tested on ubuntu only

1900429
yacc	bison
the most significant difference between yacc bison and antlr is the type of grammars these tools can process

1900429
yacc	bison
yacc bison handle lalr grammars antlr handles ll grammars

1900429
yacc	bison
yacc bison generate table driven parsers which means the processing logic is contained in the parser program s data not so much in the parser s code

1900447
versioning	upgrade
if you don t want to upgrade the appserver or to change the servlet api versioning declaration in web.xml then you need to live with the fact that you cannot use the element

1900460
post	get
i tryed to imitate browser firstly get newticket page and then generate post request with headers like browser generates.....but programatically i have 200 ok from server but this newticket doesn t appear at list of tickets

1900613
integer	unsigned
well we recently made a timestamp format where time is stored in a unsigned 64-bit integer as microseconds from 1970

1900614
width	height
edit 2 just to add more details to the situation when the positions fo rsetting are passed in they are passed in as a of the screens current widht height so basically setting position x would be pos x as portion of screen screen_width where screen width is the width of the current screen itself

1900643
child-process	spawn
if you are spawn a child-process it is quite hard and you d probably need to use each browser s specific api it won t be the same between ff and ie for example

1900656
srp	principles
injecting such a serivce registry into each class works against the single responsibility principles srp because once a class has access to the registry it is too easy to request yet another dependency than originally conceived and you will end up with a god object

1900699
webclient	httpwebrequest
use httpwebrequest class or webclient class to check this

1900704
hide	show
but i do not need the id to show up in the actual list....anyway i can hide this or just not display it

1900718

1900788
getter	setter
both classes have setter and getter methods for all fields and default constructor constructor which takes primary key as argument

1900794
floating-point	integer
depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

1900794
division	multiplication
the same goes for multiplication or division

1900825
cos	sin
you are building two perpendicular vectors which are added to each point and scaled with sin cos multiplied with the radius

1900837
children	parent
if you want to save the parent without saving each of the children you need to map it something like i can t remember the exact syntax

1900859
translation	localization
note by the way that translation is not localization

1900896
getter	setter
this way is done so because until with the current el 2.1 version you cannot invoke methods with other signatures than standard getter and setter methods in the upcoming el 2.2 it would be possible

1900969
xslt	xquery
java-based nonsql data stores like existdb use xquery to transform database entries with xslt to any other xml format including xhtml

for most data types int decimals double dates and boolean there is a very strict format

1901162
udp	tcp
assume i have a reliable udp library and want to tunnel arbitrary tcp connections over it

1901162
udp	tcp
if the 4-byte id is new it makes a new connection to its local tcp socket and sends the data and spawns a new thread which receives any replies from the server and forwards them through the reliable udp connection with the appropriate id

1901212
int	boolean
you can easily pass int floating point numbers boolean objects it s all there

1901293
postgresql	mysql
the app has only been tested with mysql but it should fully work for postgresql with few adjustments

1901294
put	get
secondly what is the most appropriate way to get asp.net mvc to put json data into a javascript variable

1901346

just put that in a file called lib tasks testing.rake and it will get picked up when you next run rake test or other test-related task

1901483
min	max
is there a simple clean way of determining at compile time the max and min values for a variable of some otherwise unknown at the moment integer variable or type

1901492
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade patch cannot be installed by the windows installer service because the program to be upgrade may be missing or the upgrade patch may update a different versioning of the program

1901508
vb.net	vb6
when you say you ported from vb6 to vb.net that means using new concepts and adapting new methods of doing things

1901515
min	max
see this question maximum value of int - you can also use min in the places where the answers used max

1901519
entity-relationship	entities
which describes some ways to map entity-relationship model entities and relationship into the relational model tables and foreign keys

1901553
matplotlib	scipy
if this is for plotting scientific data i would use numpy and matplotlib combined in the scipy package

1901583
min	max	minimum	max
the numeric type of your variable is used to find a specialization of that template class that will provide the maximum value via function max and the minimum value via min in addition to several other facets of the type

1901585
submit	submission
i have a form that i submit after submission i reload the page and appears the following message

1901619
post	get
alternatively you can keep it an http post and have the server send a redirect in response to the post telling the browser to send an http get to a separate page

1901620
width	height
try setting an setting an explicit width and height on your image element

1901627
post	get
take a look at the post redirect get pattern

1901641
int	boolean
if it matches exactly the number you want return to your template or the extra variables are simple structures like int or boolean then i guess there is no point in explicitely returning them as this requires more work

1901689
urllib	httplib
this is an unfortunate side effect of the way urllib and httplib work

1901689
urllib	httplib
httplib urllib won t preemptively send authorization which is unfortunate

1901705
firefox	safari
so far i found this is best and works in ie 6+ safari 2+ firefox 2+

1901772
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this varies wildly depending on your web server but if you are using apache 2.2 put this in your httpd.conf or .htaccess

1901784
jar	war
i m packaging a war with a number of legacy jar dependencies in it for the sake of keeping this simple they can not possibly be altered or excluded from the deployed war

1901808
google-chrome	firefox
edit firefox and google-chrome are not using messagebox so technically they should be following the browser ui language settings though i don t have a french install to test it on

1901850
ubuntu	linux
i want to write a programme in python on linux ubuntu linux 9.10 that will keep track of how many key presses per second minute i make

google-chrome	safari
although the above answer seems to be correct it does not work in webkit browsers safari google-chrome

1901923
super	extends
if you do not want to extends a super class with the common code you can try to use delegation and wrap the common functionality let us call it subwidgetloader

1901970
ant	maven
i use build scripts to checkout from svn and download files into dirs that are mapped to subdomains like test.clientsite.com i work primarily in java and use ant and maven but i think you can use whatever scripting language you re familiar with

1902051
width	height
as a result some content that spans the entire height or width of a form will be cut off

1902077

1902089
iboutlet	ibaction
4 attach iboutlet ibaction event handlers to your class and wire up all the button events touch up inside to your class event handler methods in ib

1902091
put	get
use the onitemdatabound event handler and make the link an asp.net hyperlink component that way you can then get the values you wish to put into the query string from the item.dataitem parameter and simply append then to the link.navigateurl property

1902104
union	distinct
union will only give you the distinct values concat will give you the union all

1902131
width	height
setting these values just messes up the scaling rather than resizing the form so you instead have to do calculations so you can set the normal width and height properties

1902164
nant	partcover
i had to go through a number of steps to finally get partcover working when calling it from a nant script

1902164
x86	64bit
next again if your os is 64bit and you use nunit or another test exe with partcover you will need to invoke a version explicitly compiled for x86

1902209
public	protected
you can override a protected method with a public one

1902209
public	protected
you can t override a public method with a protected one

1902270
filtering	grouping
i was thinking about adding a expression field to the permission table so that when accessing a certain resource the filtering is applied in fact it would be a little more complicated i would have to apply each filtering of the grouping to which the user belongs joined with an or

1902287
distance	polygons
does anyone know of a way to fetch all polygons in a mysql db within a given distance from a point

1902287
distance	polygons
the actual distance is not that important since it s calculated for each found polygons later but it would be a huge optimization to just do that calculation for the polygons that are close

1902297
umask	mkdir
this solution also has an issue with mode mkdir may fail when directory exists but doesn t conform to umask so you might want to check that as well

1902303
inherited	subclassing
inherited works because everywhere you can use the base class you can also use one of it s subclassing

1902404
pull	push
have your monitor thread sleep for 50 or whatever milliseconds lock the buffer and check for flags pull out what s needed unlock the list and push the data out

1902417
dictionary	map
are you trying to map a pair of integers to a dictionary

1902417
dictionary	map
if you are trying to map a key consisting of a set of values to a dictionary can be useful in memoization and dynamic programming you need to declare your own comparer to compare the contents of the keys rather than solely considering their references

1902452
folder	directory
anyway ntfs uses btree directory structures so you really could place all in one folder

1902456
hide	show
i would rather have some sort of client side pagination where we can hide show contents than going to the server and doing a databind every time

1902467
post	get
if you need help finding the problem you will need to post more specifics ideally the smallest example of real code for both ends of the connection you can get to exhibit the problem

1902474
put	get
the project url is when you create an account and put your issue into the prokect s bug tracker you will get help there

post	put
i am importing various formats of piped data and my end goal is to try put the different data into a suitably normalised data structure but need to do some post processing on the data to put it into my model correctly

1902588
put	get
if you put the above in a file called log4j.properties and put that file in your classpath you should get tons of debug output from c3p0

1902601
typedef	typename
the typename keyword is presented to enable context-free nested typedef s

1902611
margin	height
what that site essentially does is make the footer stick beneath the browser edge and gives it a negative margin that has the same value as the footer s height

1902622
width	height
uchar image- imagedata + height image- widthstep + width

1902622

1902633
nunit	mstest
i m also planning on axing mstest as i ve found it to be buggy and will use nunit instead

1902713
realloc	malloc
if you check the signatures of malloc realloc you will see that you can achieve correct memory allocations without dreaded pointer

1902787
post	get
i have a controller that should add a person to the db but in the form i have fields for two kinds of person and only one should be add then when i post it verifies if it is a pf type 1 or pj type 2 person then i do the validation stuff based in the kind of person it is that s ok but even if i don t add any error because the form was completely fed i get errors from the other fields but i didn t say they are required in any place why does mvc add an error like this

1902792
opera	google-chrome
but in other browsers like mozilla google-chrome opera and so on it works

1902794
getter	setter
java has the concept of a bean which is a class with a no-arg constructor and getter setter methods

1902797
int	chars

1902808
width	height
aspect is the aspect ratio of the frustum its width divided by its height

1902853
nexus	artifactory
i would err on the side of creating more artifacts instead of fewer and using a repository manager like nexus or artifactory to manage them

1902868
textview	imageview
i assume that you have custom layout for listview items and this layout consists of button and some other views - like textview imageview or whatever

1902868
textview	imageview
my custom_row.xml file is relativelayout with button of id button textview of id text and imageview of id image - just to make things clear

1902883
allocator	stl
it s probably better to defer to the clearer and more generic in terms of stl containers push_back rather than apply premature optimisation - if a profiler is highlighting a push_back as a hotspot then the most likely cause is the memory allocator which is best resolved through judicious use of reserve

1902888
google-chrome	firefox
i found identical results in firefox google-chrome and ie

1902926
hfs+	ntfs
hfs+ and ntfs both do which will cover a majority of users

1902994
min	max
write a loop that goes through every element and compares min max values with your arguments

1903042
touchescancelled	touchesended
should i free the individual points in touchesended touchescancelled

1903068
rel	attr
so it d just be #confirmdeleteitem attr rel this .parent attr id .dialog open

tunnel	vpn
then use the tunnel to establish ssh vpn

1903264
post	get
for the search information you could use get instead of post

1903278
put	get
you could either put in a call to session.refresh inside your getperson method to always get the most current state from the database or you could expose that functionality through your own refresh method

1903296
post	get
one way around this is to use a get request instead of a post

1903296
post	get
as a side note - whether using a get or post you should think about whether you need to use the session in order to cache your results in order to prevent an unnecessary database call

1903296
post	get
edit there s some good info on forms post get requests and the differences between them here including info on the redirect after post pattern which addresses this issue

1903305
glfw	sdl
next there is the windowing system native ones win32 cocoa ... or libraries built on top of it qt glfw sdl sfml .

1903339
put	get
i have left joined the two tables and put a where clause to get me the y and null instances those are easy

1903344
for-loop	loops
otherwise throw in a before your for-loop a couple more prints and a check inside your loops just to more finely try to pin-point the source of the problem

1903479
children	parent
i m looking for a clean way to filter the children of a parent in a has_many relationship without hitting the database and thus reloading the db s view of the objects back into the app

1903479
children	parent
returns all the parent s children that have a attr value of foo in the db but because it hits the database again any children that have had their attr values set to foo before being saved will have their db values restored thus overwriting any changes

1903518
pull	push
the advantage of git over something like svn is that it utilizes a pull model instead of a push

1903528

from here i would have a series of if statements that access my jpopupmenu object and perform the modifications necessary to hide show specific jmenuitem

1903590
width	height
i assumed that i only needed to set the layout height and layout width to something other than fill_parent but it still shows up as a black screen that completely fills the screen

1903594
many-to-many	one-to-many
my understanding is that you can make any many-to-many relationship into separate one-to-many relationships by adding an intermediate entity

you re going to have to communicate the loss of the client tcp connection to the server side across your udp tunnel and the opposite if the server should happen to close the connection first

1904079
tunnel	packets
if your client-side of the tunnel detects that the client application has closed its tcp connection it sends a connection-terminated packets for the corresponding connection id over the tunnel

1904112

ant	maven
the first relates to the fact that this is a fairly big project and so i ve split it into multiple maven modules to mirror the original ant multi-directory build

1904232
letter-spacing	font-size
so for a short heading a short heading would have a larger font-size and letter-spacing to fit within one line

1904386
folder	directory
i have an array that lists folder in a directory

1904386

1905089
opera	safari
well firstly simplemodal works fine in safari and opera and everything is layered correctly

1905090
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints

1905091
equals	gethashcode
because you want to use the reference type as a key in a has table you should also override the gethashcode method so that objects that are equals produce the same hash code

1905114
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to run a very simple browser detect script and it executes just fine in safari and google-chrome running on a mac but doesn t execute at all in firefox

it gets the browser name and version right for the browsers i test on-ie safari firefox opera google-chrome

1905256
tripledes	rsa
there s a complete example on msdn although is uses rsa and not tripledes

1905276

as other answers have mentioned providing the name of needed jar in the manifest.mf file of the jar that you invoke is one way to resolve your problem

1905301
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
you should be using a hash function that is specifically designed for hashing passwords such as pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt

getattr	setattr
note that the currently accepted answer will if the attribute doesn t exist already have called hasattr setattr and getattr

1905593
getattr	setattr
this would be necessary only if the op had done something like overriding setattr and or getattr -- in which case the op is not the innocent enquirer we took him for

1905593
getattr	setattr
the setattr call should be followed by return value so that it doesn t fall through to return getattr ....

1905597
getter	setter
both department and departmentid will have setter and getter methods

1905653

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the general rule is that anything which is new to html5 is and will be supported by firefox safari google-chrome webkit and opera

1905946
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
furthermore test all your code on opera firefox msie safari and google-chrome to get the best feel for true cross-browser compatibilities this will help you determine the best markup for the job at hand

1905984
folder	directory
decompile all the classes put all the java files ordered in the proper hierarchy directory for package etc. and then add them as the source of the original jar by right clicking the jar file - java source attachment - external folder

1906080
put	get
if you are just looking for get and put just use curl

1906088

for-loop	arrays
what i did next was i declared a pointer in the for-loop starting with the pointer p1 which went through every item in the arrays until it reached pointer p2 - printing item s value

1906276
range	max
you need to express the allowed range some other way by passing a max length

1906293
free	malloc
you could wrap all your calls to free and malloc with your own functions in which you also supply for instance in which file and at what line number each allocation is done

1906337
post	put
if your web service has a resource that isn t side-effect free it changes something in a database you should use put post or delete put for updates post for creating and delete for delete as the http specs state the gets shouldn t have side-effects

1906337
put	get
similarly put and delete should be safe to repeat if you get an error back or the network connection times out

1906439
ldf	dbcc
means i have mdf and ldf files of one database how can i check integrity like dbcc checkdb when database is online on sqlserver

1906441

when you go back in the browser history safari and afaik firefox as well doesn t request the page again

1906493
ubuntu	linux
i was looking at how to capture global kepresses on ubuntu linux regardless of what window has focus

1906525
min	max
i was thinking about writing generic functions for basic math operations such as min max etc

1906542
stdout	stderr
also i took the liberty to send the warning and notice messages to stderr rather than stdout thinking you probably want to separate those

1906596
folder	directory
does anybody know why this function cant find the path to the directory in this php file but it can in another php file in the same folder

1906597
post	get
you access any post get data with the params hash

1906669
getter	setter
there is concept called property in objective c 2.0 which does similar task this basically add getter and setter method for the data

1906682
datediff	difference
datediff returns the difference between dates in milliseconds

1906758
x86	64bit
i ve got a win32 process that is compiled and packaged in both 32-bit x86 and 64bit x64 variants

1906790
rss	feed
the bbc has some rss weather feed as do yahoo

1906793
profiling	debugging
however you can use profiling to debugging what s happening in the database

1906813
getter	setter
use an additional getter setter instead also known as virtual attribute

1906835
put	get
just get the data in json format and put it into the dom

1906884
children	parent
but is there any simpler way to children application just ignore everything on its parent configuration

1906899
width	height
so if i set the width and height of the new image the function must fit the uploaded image and mantain aspect ratio in the new width and height

1906935
put	get
when i put it in somewhere at random i get the error expression expected however when i look at the examples i am working from they do not look like expressions so i am very confused

1906979
children	parent
since the children are divs they will fill to the maximum width they can which so happens to be the width of the parent

1906979
children	parent
to get some of the parent to show around the children try setting the size of the children to something less than that of the parent or try adding padding to the parent

1907011
inherited	subclassing
the associations should be defined in the parent class so they can be inherited by the subclassing

1907046
opera	firefox
haven t tried it in firefox or opera

1907046
firefox	safari
you can quickly hide the options again by using the blur focus method in the ondblclick event and if this method works in firefox and safari i still think it s the best solution considering most people don t double click select boxes

1907050
direct3d	directdraw
as directdraw is now deprecated it s maybe preferable to use the direct3d functions

1907050
direct3d	directx
you can check the validity of this code by forcing the software rendering in the directx control panel by checking the software only checkbox in the direct3d tab

1907071
post	get
so this class will handle tcp handshake and will have methods that override what i send on http get and post like do_get and do_post

1907093
accessor	properties
as the filepath properties is an accessor properties so i can t change it s value

1907101
onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown	onmousedown	onmouseup
onclick onmousedown and onmouseup will not help you to prevent the selectbox from opening

1907105
nant	cruisecontrol
i wanted to display some error messages in the console of cruisecontrol using nant

1907151
int	chars
so they had int for arithmetic and chars for string storage

1907151
int	chars
to this day i code almost all my c programs like as if there were no type other than chars and int

1907151
int	chars
this reflects that chars were meant for chars storage strings and int for arithmetic

1907151
int	chars
an int is always signed but with chars you can not be sure

1907171
int	double
as for int and double being added the int gets turned into a double immediately then the above applies

1907185
width	height
the resize then crop approach compute the aspect ratio of the source image and use it as a constraint to create an intermediate image which is going to be larger than the destination image either in width or height - finally crop the intermediate image to the destination dimensions

1907200
many-to-many	one-to-many
it s been a while since i ve played with many-to-many mappings i usually just map as two one-to-many relationships but i believe that if you use use a different construct for example a set which does not allow duplicates you should find that the behavior is different

1907205
innodb	myisam
mysql myisam engine supports full-text search but i will use innodb

1907214
int	double
floats and double are built-in types just as int is

1907216
expression-blend	silverlight
this will depend on what languages you are using for development but with a ui design tool like expression-blend you can develop a ui shell quite quickly in this case in wpf or silverlight

1907217
width	height
the height and the width was originally 100

1907225
swt	swing
if you used swing and now you want to start with swt this book shows you the differences swt eye for the swing guy

1907235
width	height
find out the aspect ratio of the box compare it with that of original and calculate either width of height for the new image

1907262
children	parent
tree root is first row without parent and there is always order that parent is declared before its children

1907275
folder	directory
i could use new folder - linked resource but i would prefer to keep the projects independent of the directory structure the developer happens to be using

1907306
dmalloc	google-perftools
jemalloc ccmalloc mpatrol njamd dmalloc and even google s own google-perftools

1907312
getter	setter
is there a better standard way to create getter and setter in java

1907312
getter	setter
it is quite verbose to have to explicitly define getter and setter for each variable

1907318
int	boolean
instead expressions in the java programming language that operate on boolean values are compiled to use values of the java virtual machine int data type

1907318
int	boolean
the above implies although i may have misinterpreted it that the int data type is used when operating on boolean but this is a 32 bit memory construct

1907318
int	boolean
why is a byte or short type not used as the proxy for a boolean instead of int

1907340
rtp	sip
as sip is only use for session initiation you ll also need a library for audio streaming an rtp library

1907347
getter	setter
most ides provide a shortcut for generating the code eclipse right click - source - generate getter setter although i realise this is probably not the answer you are looking for

1907373
getter	setter
with netbeans just start typing get or set where the getter setter is to be replaced and call up auto complete ctrl+space it ll give you the option to generate the getter or setter

1907382
getter	setter
another if you have a lot of objects that need this is to write your own code generation tool that takes a base class and produces a wrapper with getter and setter

1907382
getter	setter
imo behavior classes with getter and setter are a code smell

1907430
equals	icomparable
implement icomparable see so icomparable and equals and then loop through each list building the required two output lists

1907442
integer	fractions
integer and fractions parts of each

1907452
uniq	comm
comm -12 sort first.txt | uniq sort second.txt | uniq

1907455
getter	setter
if you have lots of objects with lots of booleans then you can use bit-fields that are managed via your getter and setter

1907492
gridview	sqldatasource
i know this is easy with an sqldatasource control but i lack that luxury and i am having trouble switching from my itemtemplates in the gridview to the edittemplates when i fire the gridview s edit event

1907537
jar	war
i fixed it by copying the jar file inside the lib folder project war web-inf lib

1907570
put	get
stick it inside a function definition and put an yield output_part in place of the output.append line to get a usefull interator

1907613
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
does anyone know if there is a checkbox list for a dropdownlistfor in jquery

1907668
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
malloc free calloc realloc

1907670
folder	directory
myapp is the iis directory in which the folder controller is.

1907716
free	malloc
from your list you ve missed new and delete - some say never to use malloc and free

1907724
catransition	subviews
it s very simple to do using subviews and a catransition

1907741
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
malloc free calloc and realloc are all probably more advanced than what you need to worry about

1907742
getter	setter
that s the work of the ide to generate repetitive verbose code as getter setter

1907753
hide	show
that would allow your existing controls to be ignorant of the refreshing stage and allow incapsulation of the progress-visualization inside the adorner and the chunk of code that is required to show hide the adorner layer

1907765
onfocus	onblur
this works perfectly in ff but none of this works in ie when i say none i mean onblur and onfocus

1907772
google-chrome	firefox
in this case after clicking add new button ie will give exception unknown runtime error while google-chrome and firefox will work

1907798
width	height
keep in mind this only calculates the width and height you must call imagick yourself to actually apply these calculations

1907809
post	get
if your goal is simply to get it working and are able to change the database scheme you could go with this post

1907814
getter	setter
i ve scoured the net and found some solutions however it is hard to distinguish which is the correct latest .net 3.5 way given the colourful history of getter setter and managed c++

1907836
accessor	properties
in c++ cli you cannot control the accessibility of each accessor method separately when you use the automatic properties syntax

1907860
free	malloc
first of all you should never delete a malloc ed pointer and never free a pointer created with new

1907860
memset	calloc
calloc similar to new + memset allocates memory on the heap sets it to zero

1907860
free	realloc
realloc attempts to resize a block of memory or creates a new block block of memory and copies the old data free ing the old pointer

1907885
yacc	bison
i always recommend this page to people who want to learn lex yacc or flex bison

1907910
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qt python bindings pyqt is a flexible and mature framework that can certainly do that take a look at qgraphicsview and qgraphicsscene for example

1907913
wsimport	xjc
wsimport uses xjc from jaxb to create java files and the documentation here indicates that changing the character encoding in the xml file should suffice although i have not tried this

1907927
innodb	myisam
though it can be configured to talk to mysql automatically sphinx is really a separate tool to myisam or innodb

1907927
innodb	myisam
otherwise you can take a hybrid approach with myisam and innodb

1907927
innodb	myisam
put all your canonical data in the proper innodb tables and just use myisam for storing fulltext searchbait

1907927
innodb	myisam
you then have to make sure you update the myisam tables from any new text inserted into the innodb tables after a successful transaction

1907931
google-chrome	firefox
no problem in firefox and google-chrome also

1907934
addition	multiplication
just something for you to try but this would only make a difference for large matrices seperate out your addition logic from the multiplication logic in the inner loop like so

1907934
addition	multiplication
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop

1907942
xslt	xquery
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

1907951
xslt	xquery
xslt and xquery do two different things

1907951
xslt	xquery
xslt actually relies on the functionality of xquery take a look at the tutorials on www.w3schools.com

1907968
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
as far as the malloc free calloc realloc these are just functions like any other commands in these particular cases functions included in the stdlib

1908051
width	height
if these width and height values are wrong fill in the correct ones and make the appropriate recalculations

1908051
width	height
if .card doesn t have fixed width height it may still work but i m less confident and you won t be able to get the bottom text to go to the very bottom of the card just below the top text

1908053
width	height
in the code below you first load the image then create a new image with the new width and height grab the graphics object from it and finally draw the old image onto the new image

1908073
force.com	salesforce
you can also negotiate with salesforce over the pricing but afaik there are not people building mass market applications based off of force.com largely because of these issues

folder	directory
how can i modify the function to return only the folder names of the given directory

1908291

i prefer to use google analytics since it would save me a lot of work but i would use another script or put in original code to get the following

1908318
pull	push
in my case my push provider pull rows from a db table and sends them at the time specified

1908326
stateless	stateful
you can create a stateful session bean that holds your cache and pass this bean to your stateless bean method

1908455
getter	setter
this expects a property bill_sent with a getter and setter in the billdoc bean

1908481
hide	show
another option is to use the show and hide methods

1908497
gina	winlogon
once you create the proper gina dll you can register it here hkey_local_machine software microsoft windows nt currentversion winlogon ginadll

1908498
int	double
javascript doesn t have int all numbers are actually double

1908500
vb6	vba
and since vba vb6 doesn t have shared methods it doesn t really matter if you prefix with me or not

1908501
int	chars
the short answer is no since a single chars takes the same storage space as an int

1908524
int	double
ipv4 uses only 32bit addresses so javascript should be fine using double which gives you an 52bit int part

1908532
rtsp	sdp
it s an online radio stream rtsp in the sdp format

1908560

i have vb6 dll which i am referencing in vb.net i am calling the following function in it

1908730
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitableview is inside a uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller all of which are being created programatically

1908733
xslt	xquery
both xquery and xslt rely heavily on xpath

1908733
xslt	xquery
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

1908733
xslt	xquery
if your input is based on more than one xml document you are pretty much stuck with xquery if your output is not xml based you are pretty much stuck with xslt

1908743
profiling	debugging
if you want to know this for debugging optimizing reasons look for a memory profiling

1908746
folder	directory
depends what you re looking to do exactly - you could create a virtual directory underneath your site that maps to the directory hence the folder will seamlessly slot in as if it was located in your application sites directory

1908747
width	height
i think you have to subtract 1 from height and width on for-loop

1908778
subclass	abstract-class
either it is an abstract-class which you must subclass and provider the implementation for a specific method which the controller will call whenever it needs its data

1908783
width	height
i just finished reading yslow recommendation to always define the image dimensions height width to improve html rendering performance

1908783
width	height
what i do know is that the height will never be larger than 200px and the width will never be larger than 300px

1908785
int	chars
for example add an int column to your table as well as the chars 36

1908876
xslt	xquery
the majority of the functionality of xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 overlaps and for the most part they are similar languages with different syntax a little like c# and vb

1908876
xslt	xquery
xslt is a lot more verbose but its templating features add a lot of functionality that can be fairly cumbersome to replicate in xquery particularly making small changes to node trees

1908876
xslt	xquery
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

1908881
width	height
setting the max height and width of an image in the css will make the img tag resize the img based on the contraints but if you are using a backend scripting language like asp.net or php you an use their img libraries to scale the image on the server side an either save then to the hard drive to use later or resize on the fly

1908904
folder	directory
note that you can select an existing folder or create a new one to contain the content for the virtual directory

1908922
addclass	removeclass
jquery has functions toggleclass removeclass and addclass

1908972

i think this would work and it would handle primes up to 2 the largest unsigned integer you can represent

1909061
post	get
i didn t want to post the whole thing that might just be too painful to look at but you get the idea

1909072
maven	pom.xml
if the open source project in question uses maven as the build system there is a pom.xml file in the root of the project and you have maven installed you can run mvn eclipse eclipse to build the project files for eclipse to use

1909075
put	get
as strawberry says jade doesn t put any restrictions on your database use so long as you can get at it from java

1909156
post	get
from the responses it seems that this is pretty common so i ll just post what i do to get around the issue for now

1909156
folder	directory
the way that i get around this issue is just to publish the files using clickonce to a folder locally and then ftp the files over manually excluding the crystalreport install directory that is created

1909179
put	get
when drawing state diagrams how do you know which states get put in boxes and which states are for the transition arrows

1909182
width	height
the reason for specifying the width and height of images is that the browser will know exactly how much space the image will take up

1909184
versioning	upgrade
on this site you can download any versioning of the iphone ipod touch firmware thus no need to pay 10 for the upgrade

then you can show hide as necessary and position the inside content correctly

1909365
portrait	landscape
it also a good practice to hold the size of an image list that contains landscape and portrait format

1909385
sfdc	force.com
force.com is absolutely a paas offering making sfdc more than a crm saas player

1909397
onfocus	onblur
all event handlers in the web app are added with element.attachevent which means the onfocus and onblur properties which i believe are the ones i want are not set

1909411
client-side	server-side
in most instances client-side and server-side code are written in different languages javascript python so validation code has to be written twice

1909411
client-side	server-side
so my question to you is how do you manage issues related to code duplication in projects where the client-side and server-side languages are different

1909455
folder	directory
i need a script that will delete all files from a ftp directory and then upload a folder on my local machine to that same ftp location

get a cheap server any 1u with a dual core processor and 512mb of ram will do and put it at your remote location

1909472
asterisk	ivr
configure your asterisk dialplan to receive calls from your sip account to your ivr menu

1909472
asterisk	ivr
now if you are looking to save money and have the most cost-effective setup for your remote ivr i would recommend throwing up a second asterisk server on site at your client location where the pots line comes in and throw away the pots line and just setup an iax2 trunk between your client location and your hosted server location

1909472
asterisk	elastix
if you would like to learn more about telephony and asterisk especially if you are going to use it for your business you may want to use a simple free asterisk distribution like trixbox ce elastix or asterisknow

1909484
post	get
you ll note if you click the button the web service is called and everything works even though post and get have been removed

1909484
post	get
if i alter the web.config and add the get and post protocols back in this error goes away - but then it allows access to the web service remotely using get which we don t want

1909544
fflush	gets
then try to fflush then activerecord nhibernate understandably gets unhappy that there are now two taxcalculators with

1909579

it seems that it can catch my touches in the touchesbegan method but it doesn t always get caught in the touchesmoved method

1909593
emacs	textmate
have the new window create a new emacs process not just a new buffer so that i can manage and navigate multiple projects similar to how textmate does it using one emacs process for each project

1909642
post	get
i m sure google will get you equivalent blog or forum post explaining how to do a joomla or modx integration

1909737
folder	directory
it run from bin debug folder so you need to go up two levels and you ll be at your project root directory

1909754
decimal	ieee
you are getting 5.97999954 which is basically the answer as best represented by ieee floating point which is a binary format that cannot exactly express every decimal number

1909757
puts	fflush
setting to a true value fflush the currently selected filehandle and puts it in unbuffered mode

1909760
mousemove	mouseup
it seems that mouseup events are only fired when they are not in conjunction with a mousemove

1909760
mousemove	mouseup
how can i have mouseup fire when mousemove is completed or how can i inspect the mousemove event to determine that the left mouse button is now off

1909776
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseup event is binded when the user clicks mousedown this forces it to fire when the user lets go of the mouse button no matter how much it s moved

1909798
jobs	cron
i want to start using cron jobs

1909798
jobs	cron
our cron jobs are managed manually so we don t always remember which cron jobs we have scheduled to run

1909802
margin	height
the drawback i see in this method is that with css you have to know in advance the height of your content so that you can apply a negative margin of half this height to the floater

1909805
iboutlet	ibaction
alternatively if i separate the views into multiple xibs how can i have them reference the same controller object for their iboutlet ibaction

1909813
hide	show
note i don t need cases to show the scrollbar since the richtextbox handles that part fine after i hide it sigh

1909814
domcontentloaded	onload
i chose not to replace the body onload event on purpose instead i m using the new domcontentloaded event that the old browsers don t support if you need old browser support you can use any other load event to initiate prettyprint for example jquery

1909833
jobs	cron
the one thing that you could consider doing is using a different bootstrapper which would reduce the cost as you don t bootstrap the views which the cron jobs have no need for

1909840
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it s used by uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller and many other properties rely on it for example the navigationcontroller property

1909842
submit	submission
i have thought of having separate datacontexts for the two tables doing submit on one before the other but the i guess it will be very slow submission for each row

1909884
restructuredtext	textile
some source code hosting platforms like github and bitbucket also will display markdown and similar text formatting languages textile restructuredtext √¢ as html

1909889
hide	show
then inside your code when you want to change views just use the sethidden method to hide one and show the other

1909889
iboutlet	ibaction
object for their iboutlet ibaction

1909920
width	height
you can then position it absolute and set its top and left to 50 and the margin-top and margin-left to the negative half of its width and height respectively

1909997
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox and ie

1910013

i d like to put the wrapper divs in a control so that i can use them in a .aspx view page and not have to look at all the mess required to make fancy corners shadows but still get the benefit of seeing the results in the designer

1910089
vbscript	jscript
asp with jscript is 100 times better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache

1910095
pop-up	dialog
i have a timer in my website which would pop-up a modal dialog with a count down timer count down for 2 minutes if the user is inactive for 20 minutes

1910107
ubuntu	linux
i d like it to work on linux ubuntu if possible

1910124
children	parent
it seems to me that when you use relationships in hibernate jpa that using relationships like onetomany can have a performance boost on reads because only one database call would need to be run to get a parent entity and all children entities

1910142
fish	zsh
note that in some shells you need to quote like zsh and fish

1910156
xstream	dom4j
i d recommend using hibernate with your pojos and use something like xstream or raw dom4j for doing your xml serialization to and from the pojos

1910175
wadl	wsdl
following on the comment above about wadl you can also try wsdl 2.0

1910184
post	put
for example if your application was a message board a malevolent user could put up a post with embedded html that would load a remote javascript without the user s knowledge

1910248
post	get
as i understand it xml.sendandload uses post not get so i don t understand why this shows up in the log as a get

1910248
post	get
using a get request when the post

1910248
post	get
data in a get post hybrid format

1910403
vsto	add-in
i ve created a vsto 2.0 se add-in for outlook 2007

1910405
google-chrome	firefox
i found the following worked in ie firefox and google-chrome pc only don t have access to a mac just now

1910406
jobs	cron
cruisecontrol.net writes two log files one for debugging and one for its cron jobs

1910409
google-chrome	safari
the website that i m currently working on is having a few issues with webkit browsers google-chrome safari etc.

1910444
fast-forward	merge
i wondering whether i can cook something up with git-read-tree -m --trivial to get the fast-forward merge out of the way then do some magic with git-merge and a custom mergetool that simply copies the remote file to merge

1910460
client-side	server-side
so it s a good candidate for both client-side and server-side validation

1910542
integer	fractions
that means that the 16 upper bits of a glfixed represents the integer part and the fractions is the lower 16 bits divided by 65536

1910586
getter	setter
the text function works as both a getter and a setter

1910616
lisp	scheme
and as a slightly bizarre suggestion might i suggest lisp or scheme

1910634
printf	fgets
if you plan to use ansi standard c you ll need fopen fgets and printf to do what you want

1910646
uiview	subviews
customize the uiview in ib to your hearts content and then you load it as a subviews in your view controller with something like this

1910665
width	height
here is the code used to set the width height of the form image

1910692
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i m trying to do the following i have only a scriptmanager and an updatepanel with empty contenttemplate on a page

1910698
inherited	properties	public	protected
a child class inherited all the protected public and published properties functions and procedures of its parent classes

1910722
calloc	malloc
when you pass the address of some data to a thread that data s lifetime becomes unrelated to execution of the parent thread so your only real choice is to allocate the memory for that data in way that decouples its lifetime from execution of the parent thread -- allocate with something like malloc or calloc

1910736
post	get
basically it s doing a post with get

1910808
qhash	qmap
qt also provides it s own map implementations - qmap and qhash

1910859
udp	rtp
matt h mentioned that rtp over udp packets can be checksum ed so that if they are corrupted they will get resent

1910859
udp	rtp
in asterisk for example you can enable disable checksums on your rtp over udp traffic in the rtp.conf configuration file with the following line

1910862
post	get
but as far as i can see this option would not be ideal because when the page first loads it has to do an ajax post get request

1910884
int	chars
if you create an int chars or any other pod type it isn t initialised to zero so why should a pointer

1910895
oncreate	setcontentview
i have an nocontentviewactivity which has no content view i did not call setcontentview in the oncreate of my activity

1910936
maven	m2e
try creating your eclipse project with mvn project m2e or use the maven import option under import project

1911035
width	height
the width of each character and height of each line for that matter is rounded to the nearest whole number of pixels with no error correction

1911063
richtextbox	textblock
rather than use a textblock take a look at using the wpf version of the richtextbox

1911068
post	get
i bet if you read that post you will get ideas about how to improve upon what you already have working

1911125
directx	gdi
in windows there seems to be at least two ways to get to the frame buffer gdi and directx

1911125
directx	gdi
the problem is that in order to use gdi or directx it seems that you must be running a gui application and then from this application you can call the appropriate gdi and directx functions

1911131
maven	m2e
using m2e my fallback in these situations is to do maven update dependencies and then maven update project configuration

1911136
width	height
problem was the variables for width and height were globals that got changed elsewhere in the application when the main form was resized they usually keep track of the onscreen displayed image but i had used the same variables inside this procedure to track the memorystream bitmap width and height

1911136
width	height
once i localized the width and height variables everything works as expected

1911148
jobs	cron
this approach may not work for you in your situation but you might use cron jobs to call a php script that loads the required information then caches it to a more speedy data source xml or database

1911151
csla	.net
i am using mvc .net in a distributed environment with csla and i can reference httppostedfilebase from one of my web layers eg website.mvc but i cannot reference httppostedfilebase from a separate layer lets call it otherlayer.web

1911175
gif	png
of course you need to swap the mime-type in case the file is a png or gif

1911215
postgresql	mysql
in this context mysql databases are analogous in function to postgres-schemas insomuch as postgresql lacks off-the-shelf cross-database functionality that mysql has

1911215
postgresql	mysql
in summary postgresql fully supports schemas but lacks some functionality mysql has with databases while mysql doesn t even attempt to support true schemas

1911277
super	extends
basically super corresponds to write semantics and extends corresponds to read semantics

1911286
many-to-one	one-to-many
but if this fails why don t you map it as a one-to-many instead of many-to-one with a foreign key in the order table reusing the taxcalculators

1911296
filtering	grouping
one option is to create a new grouping or filtering in vs.net parlance to make it obvious which grouping of files are affected by the particular settings

1911305
for-loop	arrays
maybe in a arrays where all element are there and start at zero 0 to x it would be faster to use a for-loop

1911365
inherited	properties
if you inherited from the object now then all you need to do is to inherited from your complex object and change one piece of code as well as add the new properties and your done

1911423
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
also x needs to be null terminated or you need to replace strcpy with strncpy or memcpy and pass in a length

1911459
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m mainly interested in google-chrome safari and firefox and other standards-compliant browsers

1911482
spaces	linefeed
to include tabs cr or linefeed in attribute values without them being turned into plain spaces by the attribute value normalisation algorithm you must encode them as character references

.htaccess	httpd.conf
put the above code in your httpd.conf if you have access otherwise you can put it in .htaccess

1911591
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
see a demo here runs on safari google-chrome and more or less on firefox too

1911650
vsto	add-in
the proof-of-concept is a managed com add-in and not using vsto but a very similar approach should also work for vsto

1911675
ant	emma
i created an ant build file specifically for the build chain target with help from the emma doco

1911685
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox allow multiple cores to be configured and 64-bit guests

1911690
sudo	passwd
in the first case why does sending the passwd work with sudo but not with ssh

1911696
tabcontrol	tabitem
put the stackpanel s in each of the tabitem s in a tabcontrol and suppress any drawing of header so the tabcontrol selection can be mapped directly to the combo selection

1911719
fadein	fadeout
so i m trying to make the div content1 fadein when i go with my mouse over the div logo1 content1 should fadeout when my mouse isn t over logo1 oh and the content div s have visibility hidden on the css

1911719
fadein	fadeout
i ve tried this code but it didn t work for me i didn t add fadeout because i dont know where to add it after i ve used fadein

1911750
post	get
when you post you will get just 1 value the one checked like this

1911793
maven	pom.xml
when you run as maven install it will run your pom.xml script employing the external maven instance you specified but when eclipse performs some of its internal stuff it will continue to use the embedded maven instance whatever version it is

1911793
maven	m2e
as far as i know when you install m2e you are implicitly defining which internal maven instance you will have which is exactly that one packaged by the plugin

1911847
put	get
if you just strip the scripts put your text into a div and then evalscripts that ll work across all brwosers so scripts get executed exactly once

1911919
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1911958
post	get
tamperie a tool to tamper with http get and post and a sandbox where you can play around with

1911959
firefox	safari
you ll find that in safari that those divs don t exist anywhere because they re not positioned properly for webkit whereas in firefox they do show up

1911968
folder	directory
such a handler must be registered in hkcr directory background instead of usual locations like hkcr directory hkcr folder etc

1912021
int	chars
its the pointer arithmetic based on the pointer type whether its chars cptr or int nptr when you increment cptr++ will move one byte and nptr++ would move 4 bytes assumimg chars takes one byte and int takes 4 bytes

1912027
getter	setter
the getter always returned null and the setter had no effect

1912033
fadein	fadeout
however i dont see any connection between the hover on the logo and the fadein and fadeout of each content which would be like this

1912033
fadein	fadeout
logo1 hover fadein content1 and fadeout content1 when the mouse isnt over logo1

1917953
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1917976
int	chars
if possible php treats all incoming vars as an int first of all so if the text files are of predictable length 24 12 12 chars that i can see then 0000000974 will be correctly parsed as being the int 974 without having to resort to trim

but text output doesn t work this way you can t set the width of a line of text and have the system compute the height of it

1918478
int	chars
the exttextout api call takes an optional int array of chars origins as the last parameter

1918478
int	chars
multiply all chars positions by this scale value and round them to the nearest int

1918478
width	height
this is untested and may contain some errors or oversights but hopefully this would allow you to smoothly scale the text width independently of the text height

1918515
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add
so pointlessly multiplying by zero is just the first step in the following steps the multiplication is actually needed to add the new digits to the end of the number getting accumulated

1918558

1918567
jax-ws	jax-rs
get familiar with ejb 3.1 servlet 3.0 jpa 2.0 the java persistence api hibernate being one implementation jax-ws jax-rs maybe jsf this may still be controversial but i think that the new servlet 3.0 api makes any advice about web frameworks irrelevant so.

1918764
composite	memento	facade	memento
finer-grained patterns like state command factory method composite decorator facade flyweight memento template method are perhaps more common in group 1 code but often several design patterns apply not to an object as such but to different parts of an object whereas in group 2 code patterns tend to be present on a one pattern per object basis

1919710
google-chrome	firefox
this method actually works in the embedded browser as the javascript is retrieved and executed but it does not work in other modern web browsers s i tested against google-chrome ie8 firefox 3.5

1919760

1920438
serializable	deserialization
the qhash serializable just outputs the key value pairs but the deserialization constructs a hash data structure

1920438

it works as it should but i am confused as to why the correct values are coming out of max instead of min

1922748
min	max
it s preventing me from going off the top of the screen again from max instead of min

1922748
min	max
now the actual values are coming from max and the maximum values are coming from min

1922748
min	max
so because i had no clue here is what min and max do

1922764
comparator	comparable
you can use comparator to compare objects that do not implement comparable or enforce a different sorting strategy

the cmake language syntax isn t great but a declarative build with odd syntax beats an imperative build in python

1930142

you can get udp type behaviours over unicast tcp pubsub

1930483
udp	tcp
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

1930483
udp	tcp
if you really really really need to use udp and lazy acks and so on then you could strip out rabbitmq s tcp and probably pull that off

there is sprog which lets you graphically build processes out of parts get url - process html table - write file and you can put perl code in any stage of the process or write your own parts for non-programmer use

fwiw you may want to consider disabling client-side caching only while enabling server-side caching by using httpcacheability.serverandnocache

1931592
width	height
to fix it you need to either set the width and height in the html or with javascript

1931708

eurekalog	madexcept
how would you compare madexcept to eurekalog as an exception handler for your delphi application

note that add and multiplying work fine since two s compliment numbers just work

1931915

1931969
symlink	realpath
by using two dirname s and i ran realpath earlier to remove the symlink from the path

1931976
put	get
in short those environments need to be nested in arbitrary ways maintained between instances of user interaction a define x 1 typed at the scheme repl should presumably result in the user being able later to type in x and get back 1 as the value put inside objects modelling scheme functions since scheme functions close over the environments they are created in etc

1931987
cos	sin
this creates a sin cos pair per iteration

1931987

1932247
implements	extends
of course all of the classes could implements the interface but that seems redundant because the children of the abstract will inherit the interface because they extends the abstract class

1932303
mp3	wav
as long as you re doing this as a batch job rather than use lame as a library just use an existing command-line program to convert the mp3 to a temporary wav file that will be much easier

1932303

since this is a batch job anyway if i were you i would write out a bmp file a really easy file format and then use a command-line program like imagemagick s convert to turn that into a gif

1932316

how can i have the hide function execute while the show function waits for a go ahead

1932349
implements	extends
provide the concrete classes that either extends from the abstract class or extends from another class and implements the interface

1932349
implements	extends
by doing #4 you ensure that all classes that implements the interface can be used - if you were to use the abstract class instead then classes that implements the interface but do not extends the abstract class cannot be used

1932349
implements	extends
the one argument for having the abstract class and the concrete classes implements the interface is that if you were to later change the concrete class to no longer extends the abstract class then you could forget to also implements the interface which in some cases could break the code without the compiler complaining

1932371
inline-functions	inlining
to make inlining possible in the absence of unusually clever compilation and linking facilities the definition√¢ and not just the declaration√¢ of an inline-functions must be in scope √¢ 9.2

1932373
getter	setter
as a rule of thumb i usually inline only getter and setter

i m having same problem but seems the answer is that you should use jeditorpane or jtextpane instead of jtextarea

1932754
inherited	properties
generally you don t set this directly due to what microsoft has taken to calling dependency properties which as far as i can tell are exactly the same as ambient properties which is to say that unless you set them explicitly they inherited a value from the immediate container which may in turn so inherited

versioning	upgrade
make sure you take dvyjones s advice and upgrade to the latest versioning of rails.

1934168
int	chars
these would be great by themselves if i were transfering either 16 or 32-bit int or if the chars in the string being sent were multiples of 2 or 4 bytes

1934168
16-bit	64bit
we can t be sure that the wordsize on the sending machine is not 16-bit or 64bit right

1934180
int	chars
as you can see i ve added a real chars array to your print-out of an int

1934180
int	chars
your multi-byte int is indeed stored in different byte order on the two machines but the chars in the chars array have the same order

1934185
division	modulo
it s the modulo as mentioned which returns the remainder of a division operation

1934214
inherited	subclassing
it is strange that they are inherited to subclassing

1934235
ddms	adb
you can get a java stack trace via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse which will help you pin down your error

1934241
listadapter	listactivity	listadapter	viewswitcher	viewswitcher	listactivity
i wrote a view class based on viewswitcher and now i want to write helper classes for the view like known form the listview listadapter listactivity and so on

1934293
multiplying	division
there s of course a limit to how much times you can do division on a floating point before you start getting the same values but that can easily be solved by periodically multiplying all the order fields by 2

1934311
put	get
this is the common way in c++ put class declarations in .h files that get #include d in .cpp files that then actually define the functions

1934341
firefox	safari
i then have a jquery .click function that fires a simple alert at the moment to test for functionality - this works as expected in safari but for some strange reason the .click will not fire under firefox

1934378
portrait	landscape
the image data is always landscape however the native camera app on the droid produces portrait images ok

1934381
versioning	upgrade
if you have upgrade to .net v4 then delete any older versioning from windir microsoft.net framework and try again

1934387
pull	push
the push vs the pull approach

1934404
post	get
you want to make your search get based instead of post based

1934404
post	get
this is because clicking a link is always get based so it s easier to change the search submit to get than change the links to post since that requires a fair bit of javascript

1934478
spaces	delimiter
one thing to note is that as you know while will handle spaces and for won t but by sending the output of find with null termination and setting the delimiter of read to null you can also handle newlines in filenames

1934479
put	get
simply put your css into a folder and either put images into deeper folders beneath it or put images into a parallel folder to your css and use a single .. to get to the images relatively

1934486
hide	fadeout
you can of course finetune this a bit more and make hidespopup hide the popup gradually with a slow opacity fadeout and if the users moves in while it is hiding you stop the animation and set the opacity back

1934496
gtk	gdk
there seems to be an incompatability with gtk gdk shipped with f12

1934529
button	checkbox
after checking unchecking into the new checkbox column of the dgquery rows i will click a button to save into a database only the rows i checked

1934574
put	get
it looks like you re trying to convert the string to a date the other way around so you can get the seconds from it and put it in the text area

1934579
unsigned	short
for instance sqlite_unicode.c line 1861 contains integral constants greater than 0xffff but are declared as unsigned short

1934587
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have some pages on my local machine accessed via localhost that are horribly slow to open load using ie8 but very fast using firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1934592
pascal	delphi
i learned it that way in turbo pascal but delphi and the free freepascal still support this today

1934641
accessor	properties
i am mutating my properties through a couple of accessor

1934652
put	get
i really tried to put together as much as i could for people to get rolling

1934676
unification	inference
type inference in a statically typed language refers to a system that can deduce types for program terms without programmer assistance typically using a hindley-milner-style type system and unification

1934676
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml both have type inference

1934684
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and it will work on firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie8 ie7 and 6 are not important

1934691
touchesbegan	touchesended
this is a hack in that it s not truly handling touches touchesbegan touchesended etc. but it works

1934710
hide	show
the jquery hide show effects can be a bit strange with table components however

1934738
tinyint	varchar
phone phoneid int pk contactid int fk number varchar sortorder tinyint

1934742
getter	setter
the skill class just has some setter getter basically so i removed most of the annotations but the foreign key one

1934771
post	get
pull jquery in to your project and look at its get post methods documentation

1934777
folder	directory
you can use the full qualifying path or copy the file folder structure into the debug release directory

1934787
put	get
if you want to implement this yourself you need to decide when to get the start time--you can put a script tag at the top of the page which may execute before the content has rendered on the onload event which will wait until all images and scripts have loaded or something like the the jquery ready event which occurs when the dom is ready but doesn t wait for resources to load

1934809
vb.net	vb6
i d say vb6 is still ok for throw away prototyping and probably better than vb.net in that regard

1934814
post	get
after i get back from holiday travel i will post my code

1934832
do-while	break
the only modification i made to his code was to use a do-while loop instead so it would not skip the element where first loop break

1934837
integer	unsigned
yes 0x2284a is indeed larger than 0xffff which is the largest a 16-bit unsigned integer can contain.

1934851
post	get
when you get past the items above post another question about the details it mainly involves a couple of special controls

1934872
pascal	delphi
as for using it in delphi all i know of is how to use it in free pascal

1934885
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
so provided you haven t changed the collation of your string columns in your table from case-insensitive the default to case-sensitive the following code should work

1934908
hash	md5
so far i ve concatenated the information and computed a md5 hash of it using the .net classes i cannot use the new vista enhanced api functions as we target xp still - .net 3.5

1934914
django	turbogears
my team however is evaluating gae for use on an all-new project and our existing experience is with turbogears not django

1934930
apache	nginx
look into mod_xsendfile on apache or equivalents for nginx etc if you like to use django for authentication

1935000
mouseup	mousedown
on the mousedown event this code starts a repeating timer every 500ms in this example that is cancelled as soon as the mouseup event occurs

1935061
ingres	firebird	ingres	postgresql	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql	postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql	informix	firebird	informix	ingres
in this way if gae works for you great if it does not you can move your code to a different db sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql firebird db2 informix ingres and - soon - sybase and mongodb

1935112
qevent	qobject
define and implement bool mainwindow eventfilter qobject qevent

1935141
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
should work on google-chrome firefox and safari on windows too

1935145
int	double
you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space

1935154
cpu	processors
on these processors non-aligned access causes a processors exception which - depending on cpu os and settings - will cause a process crash or just a lot of work for the os

1935165
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you need something that works cross-browser firefox google-chrome safari and ie you could look at firebreath

1935172
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you decide to go the plugin route firebreath is a project that lets you create a plugin that you could do rendering from that will compile to be both an npapi plugin firefox google-chrome apple safari and an activex control ie

1935178
stateless	stateful
the reason why we chose to use a stateful bean over a stateless bean was because we need to open a database connection to an unknown database and perform queries on it

1935181
findwindow	setparent
look for findwindow getclassname and setparent at

1935187
opera	firefox
after installing latest updates firefox still crashes opera keeps alive

1935188
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a website on my localhost and i m trying to get a sqldatasource to populate my gridview but it gives me the error data source name not found and no default driver specified

1935194
quicksort	heapsort
i ve checked quicksort merge sort heapsort d-ary heapsort insertion sort selection sort all do not answer the requirement which leads me to believe there s a need for a specific algorithm for arrays of length 5

1935240
memcached	apc
i am using memcached for cacheing objects but would like to add in addition an opcode accelerator like apc

1935240
memcached	apc
memcached for cacheing my objects and apc for code acceleration

1935259
webclient	webrequest
i have a few programs which use webrequest not native webclient and i see throughputs in the near mb s range with resources in the 10-20mb range coming from half way around the world

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached does not have any bytecode or php acceleration features which is why i would run it side-by-side with apc or xcache

1935341
ubuntu	linux
i am now migrating most of my apps etc to linux ubuntu 9.10 to be precise

1935342
int	double
if this reasoning is correct i wouldn t expect to see the same pattern for value-type properties int double datetime ...

1935366
post	get
2 make sure the user doesn t get to like dislike a post twice

1935429
stateless	stateful
say whatever comes to your mind in terms of security application type stateless stateful db calls or anything else

1935445
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
there are some attempts at mvc in some js frameworks mainly sproutcore and javascriptmvc

1935450
post	put
i d put indexes on the two main columns player id and post id which is critical to the next bit

1935450
post	get
i d then use a joined query whether in a stored procedure in the code or in a view to get the post information

1935487
free	strdup	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc	strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc
on calling free you should call free once and only once on the non-null values returned from malloc calloc or strdup

1935492
int	double
why you re using a double is also a mystery unless you want to process really large files - i d be using an int or a long for that

1935521
firefox	safari
however when i run this in firefox and safari latest versions on mac the name is not returned

1935655
super	extends
here you can see the difference between super and extends

1935657
vim	emacs
although vim or emacs have steep learning curves and are not for everyone

1935658
addition	multiplication
i know that the standard construction of f is to take an irreducible polynomial f of degree n in gf p and then view elements of f as polynomials in the quotient gf p x f and i have a feeling that this is probably already the right approach since polynomial multiplication and addition should be easy to implement but i somehow fail to see how this can be actually done

1935675
super	extends
a mnemonic he uses is pecs - producer extends consumer super

1935675
super	extends
pecs - producer extends consumer super

1935680
gridview	objectdatasource
i have an asp gridview bound to an asp objectdatasource

1935689
dictionary	map
anyway the output of map prepare_menu_item _dyn_menu_items would need to be a dictionary to be passed to your views by a helpful context processor the figuring out of which it being the slightly tedious bit here i ll leave to you

1935747
webclient	webrequest
on the other hand while making a c# crawler we found the webrequest webclient api to be very heavy on cpu usage and ultimately unsuitable for crawling

1935824
width	height
when using body factory the width height radius parameters are supplied to calculate its moment of inertia only

1935824
width	height
the body class itself doesn t have width height fields or properties

1935824
width	height
the geom class rectangles circles and whatnot doesn t have width height radius fields or properties either

1935842
gridview	repeater
if you re disabling viewstate not using any postback controls within the gridview and not doing paging sorting then you re probably better off using a repeater

1935842
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
if you re using .net 3.5 you could also investigate using the listview which to me seems like a repeater gridview hybrid

1935923
post	put
so i believe you have to set that content type and put the contents of the tracking file in the body of your post

1935978
google-chrome	firefox
you cannot do a real firefox add-on preferences box nor much serious google-chrome stuff

1935994
phpunit	simpletest
if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit

1936004
g++	gcc
did you use gcc instead of g++

1936018
subtraction	add
don t know any specific article but i think the rationale is simply that this way you get the number of resulting elements via simple subtraction 1-0 1 instead of having to add 1 there which you would forget half of the time anyway

1936024
move	drag
i move the dialog open method from draggable drag to draggable start

1936043
redmine	trac
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

1936049
g++	gcc
edit if that all doesn t help - maybe there is something wrong with your g++ gcc installation

1936073
addition	multiplication
addition and multiplication is relatively straightforward here

1936127
ireport	subreports
if your report is complicated and have many subreports and subdatasets its better to go this approach since ireport will make it quicker and easier for you to design and maintain later

1936151
mouse	keyboard
a push button emits the signal clicked when it is activated by the mouse the spacebar or by a keyboard shortcut

1936214
folder	directory
this will copy all .jpg files from the current folder to a new folder and preserve the directory structure

1936227
width	height
note prior to iphone os 3.0 uiview instances may have a maximum height and width of 1024 x 1024

1936282
groupbox	panel	groupbox	flowlayoutpanel
other controls which by design contain other controls like tablelayoutpanel groupbox panel flowlayoutpanel etc

1936282
inherited	properties
all have a container properties you can access to get their immediate container but making sure you have the final container in their inhertance path that s not a form requires some code to walk-up the inherited tree which is demonstrated here

1936351
cvs	svn
excellent cvs and svn plugins including diff and compare a patch creation and application utility and sychronize views that make parallel development far friendlier

1936372
awt	swing
the code is based on old awt painting techniques which should not be used with swing

1936378
sum	floor
e.g. if the sum average of the saturation is less than x it s a floor plan

1936382
boost	allocator
i should add that this is an unmanaged app and needs to stay that way - it needs to be highly performant makes extensive use of templates boost custom allocator internally developed thread serialization etc

1936395
listview	gridview
note both vb and c# never show the objects or events of elements that are placed inside naming containers gridview listview

1936415
hide	show
but the splash show up even when login show and i have told the splash to hide

1936417
nltk	opennlp
you should use a natural language parsing toolkit such as opennlp or nltk

1936423
hide	show
also the load event fires before the form is show so you re calling hide before the form is show in the first place

1936427
webkit	gecko
i would like to provide several implementations of that widget - one based on gecko one on webkit and one basic on regular gtk.textview

1936430
gif	png	tiff	png
logos are more likely to be jpg png or gif floorplans are possibly going to be tiff or other lossless format - but that s no guarantee

1936440
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
if you want the calculation to happen automatically you possibly have to subclass qscriptclass and re-implement the properties accessor function

1936480
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
observablecollection implements both inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

1936598
public	protected
my solution is to create an interface that provides the public access points for the protected methods and then subclass the manager class and mix in that interface

1936598
public	protected
the public method will then call its super s protected method

1936616
bash	zsh
note that afaik the construct is not standard but seems to have been supported in both bash and zsh for a while now.

1936653
width	height
a common misconception is that the rectangle defined by the swf width and height is a crop boundary

1936653
width	height
this also happens when resizing a standalone flash player window in your operating system or when embedding a swf into a html page with width and height set to greater values than what was defined in the swf when publishing from flash cs3 cs4.

1936657
width	height
that tells us that we want an image width of and similarly an image height of

1936666
post	get
my code uses http get and http post and i am using a restful service on the gae

1936686
implements	extends
create a class which extends httpservlet implements the doget method move the java code from the jsp file into this method map this servlet on a certain url-pattern and your problem should disappear

1936764
ubuntu	debian
both work well but upstart is more manageable more tools but requires a newer system ubuntu fedora and debian is switching soon

1936815
post	get
you can certainly on the server render only those interface components available to the role and restrict access to the methods actions invoked by client-side javascript or via post get

1936818
width	height
i have a number of images of very differing height and width that i need to display in a web application s dialog box

1936827
put	get
i want to fire off an asynchronous request to go get each of whatever 1 and whatever 2 from the server and put it in place of #content#

1936870
width	height
consider forcing them to thumbnail formats of fixed width height and add a link onclick to show the full image in a dialog

1936903
ienumerable	iqueryable
if the underlying object doesn t implement iqueryable then an iqueryable is returned that proxies the calls to the underlying ienumerable

1936913
int	chars
essentially is there a way to store a int into a chars array or output an int using printw

1936928
int	chars
the itoa function converts an int to chars

1936944
put	get
edit it seems i did not explain the problem enough clearly but i get nice answer about the map object which easily put together what i needed

1936960
ienumerable	iqueryable
however one difference between my use-case and rob s however is that i don t return iqueryable from my model and all queries i run with .tolist after them then returning an ienumerable to ensure that my query is executed when the model s method is called

1936979
hash	salt
if you can guarantee that all users will never reuse passwords and that none of their passwords will ever be of a form that it is computationally feasible to precalculate colliding hash for then indeed the salt is little additional benefit

1937027
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can use a skew transform in firefox safari and google-chrome

1937055
stdout	stderr
if you want to capture the output of any script then on a nix-y system you can redirect stdout and stderr to a file

1937063
stdout	stderr
just redirect the subcommand s stderr to get mixed into its stdout

1937117
put	get
also i ve put a 300ms timeout because i think it s best to have this sort of thing so that if you accidentally mouseout you have a short window to get the mouse back in before it hides

1937120
jquery	scriptaculous
drag drop mechanism is relatively easy with jquery or scriptaculous we use both so i am willing to accept an answer that uses either of these two

1937144
aggregate-functions	sum
to get the benefit of a group by clause you need an aggregate-functions max sum count etc

1937185
hide	show
one is to capture the mouse moving over it make it transparent undecorated or otherwise acceptably out of the way and when the mouse moves over it show the new frame or panel and then hide that when the mouse moves out of it

1937190
maya	blender
hello i need to implement four views splitters like in maya 3ds max blender or other similar modeling tools

1937203
ssl	https
now in my implementation security is a must which means using ssl and having https based openids

1937206
textarea	textbox
i ve included code for my textbox textarea counter i put together

1937225
width	height
basically this will create a gradient box that is the same width and height as the bounding rectangle of the line you will be creating

1937242
accessor	properties
using properties accessor in initializers is considered bad form since it can cause kvo notifications to be sent out for a half-baked instance

1937263
stdout	stderr
having the console is good for debugging since it is where stdout and stderr are output to by default

1937276
virtuoso	tdb
for example you could use a store like virtuoso or a jena based store jena sdb tdb to do this basically any store that supports the sparul language or has it s own equivalent

1937303
pbkdf2	salt
it effectively just applies pbkdf2 repeatedly with the same password and salt but also an iteration count

1937316
int	double
it s getting used to thinking about the world less in terms of primitives like double int and strings and more in terms of objects that represent better abstractions that encapsulate and hide details from clients

1937327
ferret	sphinx
it seems that the community has pulled back from ferret and the two primary contenders are sphinx and apache solr

1937340
ddms	adb
look at logcat via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

1937370
postgresql	mysql
related to your database choice i d seriously look at using postgresql instead of mysql

1937370
postgresql	mysql
in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

1937440
gif	png
you can t find this in png or gif files

1937515
post	get
it cuts the browser window in half horizonally and the bottom half is also divided vertically and you can see the get and post messages as well as the complete header information that is sent to the server from the browser across the internet

1937521
hash	md5
so far i ve concatenated the information and computed a md5 hash of it using the .net classes ...

1937521
hash	salt
however i d suggest using a salt which is a cryptographically random number to add to your user data then hash that data as it makes your data much safer against dictionary attacks where hackers use well know terms and variants to crack passwords

1937585
ready	each	mouseover	mouseout
used jquery in document ready function to auto-select deselect the text inside the span each time mouseover mouseout fired

1937595
daemons	launchd
it automatically launchd a daemons and the daemons forks an instance of the shell

1937638
superclass	subclassing
as i understand it subclassing is not encouraged because objective c allows a subclassing too much access to the internal workings of its superclass

1937662
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
the other is inherited virtual public then defining a static const member that points to a dynamic memory region via new malloc calloc etc would result in a double free error

1937686
bazaar	git
bazaar has a launchpad pseudo-protocol lp that able the user to operate in remote branchs without write full launchpad location i m searching a way to create my own pseudo-protocols in a way like this similar to git

1937756
portrait	landscape
in the caeagllayer docs apple states a bit clumsily that you should make the rotation within gl itself when drawing landscape content on a portrait display you should rotate the content yourself rather than using the caeagllayer transform to rotate it. they don t explain why but i ve read in multiple places about a noticeable drop in performance

1937782
mouse	keyboard
it would be really difficult to train her to aim a mouse or find keys on a keyboard

1937803
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 safari firefox google-chrome i get a perfectly good layout ujsing an outer div to enlose two boxes

1937892
opera	safari
works in ie opera safari - basically gives you firebug s functionality in any browser

1937897
width	height
now you can set the height and width properties on the form elements so they all fit on the same line and even expand to fill the available space if needed

1937903
put	get
when i put mimetype in an if statement i don t get the desired effect

1937905
verilog	vhdl
i m pretty sure that fpgas are programmed either in vhdl or verilog

1938012
rss	feed
i m trying to publish rss feed from a site

1938012
rss	feed
googling for a solution to this problem i came upon something called mrss - an extension to rss by yahoo which allows you to embed videos inside feed

1938048
unix	solaris
i m interesting in high precision time on unix particularly solaris running on a sun sparc machine

1938068
stdout	stderr
ruby has great features for working together with other unix tools through popen stdin stdout stderr argf etc. yet it seems that increasingly rubyists are opting to use ruby bindings and ruby libraries and build monolithic ruby programs

1938071
accessor	properties
properties declares accessor and or mutator methods for the given properties

1938106
profiler	aqtime
it is actually an amazingly good profiler similar to aqtime with wonderfully great profile results

1938165
int	chars
that is call the stringbuilder int constructor instead of the default constructor passing an estimate of the number of chars you plan to write

1938192
switching	screens
it would be better to use something like gnu screens to maintain a vim and bash session simultaneously and it s easier to switching than

1938226
width	height
edit and then set the size of your frame f.setsize width height

1938284
verilog	vhdl
like others have said most fpga s are designed using vhdl or verilog

1938295
int	chars
next consider the difference between a chars and an int again

1938295
int	chars
which besides the utterly absurd but innocuous semicolon is trying to sum the chars i to the int n -- that won t work

1938295
int	chars
to turn chars 7 into int 7 and so forth

1938305
lisp	scheme	lisp	smalltalk
a ton of languages i use now have repls ruby python scala java beanshell or jruby jython etc. c# csharp php facebook have made a repl for it smalltalk gnu gst and obviously lisp scheme

1938319
post	get
instead you post to a page and you get a http response back instead of rendering that response to the browser you get it as a javascript variable

1938347
inherited	properties
is there a way to inherited the properties of a given displayobject

1938347
width	height
i am looking for a single method that will grab something like the x y width height color etc

1938389
int	chars
i am reading a stream of int chars into a string array from the console with

1938400
int	chars
for more info see partition iia of the cli spec section 7.2 built-in types. can t find a link to the particular section sorry. the built-in types are bool chars object string float32 float64 int 8|16|32|64 unsigned int 8|1632|64 native int intptr native unsigned int and typedref

1938411
inherited	properties
my question is straight why there is inherited value for almost all the properties in html-css

1938411
inherited	properties
even-though all browsers support inherited for all as per my observation yes all the properties

1938411
inherited	properties
inherited properties

1938411
inherited	properties
of inherited for any css properties that√¢ s

1938411
inherited	properties
that a properties should inherited its

1938411
inherited	properties
inherited for any properties other than

1938431
inherited	properties
to me this is a better phrasing rather than increase the weight of the inherited properties

1938467
firefox	safari
internet explorer does not display different fonts while firefox and safari does

1938498
firefox	safari
however when i search the page using firefox and safari on mac the other elements are found but they are not showing anywhere

1938509
keydown	keyup
i am trying to generate keyboard keydown and keyup events programmatically

1938513
getter	setter
i ve looked at other code examples and often they re exposing the variable with a getter and setter and they are also using property

1938530
free	malloc
since you re using malloc and free you should do before calling any of those functions

1938530
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
once you free a pointer allocated by malloc or realloc using the pointer value in any way is bad in particular you cannot call free on it again

1938532
versioning	upgrade
from trac versioning 0.11 an onwards the export ... index.html as answered by gregory pakosz seems to be exactly what i need however we currently work with 10.3 with no intention to upgrade due to some broken functionality with templates

1938536
width	height
in css when you set something s width or height to 100 it really only sets it to 100 of the browser window

1938539
ftp	telnet
stateful http would probably look a lot like ftp telnet or im

1938554
width	height
when you set the width or height to 100 it s 100 of the size of it s parent element

1938557
width	height
so if you want something to cover a certain amount of space create an element a that has width and height set in pixels or ems then the elements inside of it set to 100 will fill to that

1938558
nunit	mstest
not sure about mstest but i believe you could do this in nunit using parameterised tests parameterising with the implementation class and using activator.createinstance to instantiate it

1938630
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
you can do this in nginx with x-accel-redirect and in lighttpd and apache with x-sendfile

1938710
google-chrome	safari
if this is a generic debugging problem you can use the web inspector in safari google-chrome

1938741
authorize.net	ccavenue
there are many providers like paypal authorize.net ccavenue 2co etc

1938844
verilog	vhdl
the syntax has been inspired by c yes but designing electronics be it using vhdl or verilog is very different from writing software

1938859
hide	show
you can check it on launch to see if ads should display have the app hide or show ads accordingly and set it to the appropriate value when the user pays to disable it

1938866
implements	sealed
i suppose you have to implements that with a custom sealed class

1938890
submit	submission
as you don t have a submit button inside your form the user will have difficulties submission it

1938923
put	get
im assuming i need to put single quotes around where the data to the query from the php variables but when i try to put them in even escaping the quotes i get parse errors from the script

1938944
post	get
as to whether you should use get or post as a form method stick to the w3cs recommendation

1938944
post	get
1.3 quick checklist for choosing http get or post

1938944
post	get
use http get or post please also

1939087
bmp	png	bmp	pcx	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
i think input file can be any valid format and output need to be jpg pcx png tiff wmf for dpi parameter i think may be i am wrong but when i looked at pil source files i don t see one for bmp files

1939107
paramiko	pexpect
i m going to write first code for handling ssh commands on python and i did search over the stackoverflow and can see that there are several python libraries that can be used for handling commands passed through ssh like paramiko pexpect and perhaps some others

1939134
accessor	properties	getter	setter
you can create accessor getter setter for a variable by hand no need to use properties

1939134
getter	setter
you can just have and implement your getter setter by hand

1939134
accessor	properties
you can have accessor declared by compiler by defining variable as a properties and then either use synthesize to create accessor in .m file or again you declare the accessor yourself you can override default accessor that would be generated

1939134
getter	setter
you can have readwrite or readonly property - meaning either both setter and getter gets generated or only getter

1939134
getter	setter
definition of variable defining it as iboutlet for interface builder declare variables as properties so that compiler generates getter setter for you defining type of getter setter such as access method memory management and locking

1939190
librsvg	cairo
the cairo library website has examples on drawing svg using librsvg

1939190
librsvg	cairo
both the cairo and librsvg libraries should be sufficiently cross-platform to do what you need and with wxcairo it should be possible to dock them onto wxwidgets

1939239
profiling	instrumentation
secend difference is that vtune is sample profiling and aqtime is instrumentation profiling

1939239
profiling	instrumentation
with instrumentation profiling you get exactly information how many times your function was called all caller of this procedure etc with cost of inaccurate time results - instrumentation profiling change a way processor executing code so branch predictions and cache works different that in real and tested app work slow

1939247
mvp	presenter
by designing i mean the technical design when and how to use data binding when should mvc mvp be used what functionality should go into the model the view the controller presenter how can different parts of the ui best be kept in sync ... not the screen design of which button goes where or how the interaction with the user should take place

1939254
hide	show
is that there is an input field that is show at the client that i cant hide except for the first time with the line i added maybe this is about many values return from the method getelementbyid

1939299
width	height
in this page i want a window with static height and width and inside this window put a gridview

1939344
ienumerable	ilist
i dug through the mvc source code and it looks like dictionaries are supported but not models that are ienumerable or that contain nested ienumerable objects and it s inheritors like ilist

1939346
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

1939422
actionscript	haxe
i m using actionscript 3 code actually haxe no ide and i m struggling to discover the values by experimentation

1939426
cpu	hyperthreading
was very slow on my hyperthreading cpu

1939446
cassini	iis
i m using cassini to run an asp.net app on a machine where i don t have access to iis

1939446
folder	directory
if you clicked properties for the web project folder click the directory security tab

1939476
hex	binary	int	chars
native dlls contain binary instructions mostly unstructured data and there is in general no way to work out what the data means - for example somewhere in the dll may be the two bytes in hex 43 23 and there s no way to tell whether the program will interpret these as the chars c# or as the int 17187 or a memory address or even an instruction to feed to the cpu

1939494
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that though the overlay is opening as expected however the text is appearing under it in ie 7 while that does not happen in firefox or google-chrome obviously not

1939502
ssl	https
first you should navigate the needed https url with your browser and export the cert using ssl properties don t remember how it is done in ie but in firefox something like security view cert details save as -- still not sure because using non-english licalization any x.509 type should work

1939526
stdout	stderr
i d not use capitalized method names those are typically c# not java and use a logger mostly log4j but pick your favorite flavour instead of stdout and stderr

1939541
width	height
#main has a fixed width flexible height and its own background image and colour

1939565
width	height
the width is fixed the height should expand if the content is higher than the div but if the content is shorter it should be placed in the bottom

1939572
hide	show
don t change the src just load the images and hide show move them into the dom

1939578
folder	directory
change directory to bin folder bin debug

1939609
ubuntu	linux
i have a curl command that i can successfully run from a linux ubuntu command line that puts a file to a wiki through an api

1939671
textview	imageview
i have used to position my imageview left and for my textview but the

1939671
textview	imageview
textview comes next to the imageview and doesn t continue underneath the imageview when i have a long text

1939817
ftp	telnet
browsers do not listen on port 80 http servers do although that s just convention you could easily have an ftp or telnet server using port 80

1939825
rss	feed
rss feed and so on not sure where you got the idea to the contrary

1939826
outputstream	inputstream
if your problem is rather that the pdf is not located in the webcontent but rather located somewhere else in disk file system or even in a database then you basically need a servlet which gets an inputstream of it and writes it to the outputstream of the response

1939838
jboss	glassfish
i am not connected in any way with redhat jboss or sun glassfish my company erudis.pl is supporting and developing for both servers

1939867
hudson	phpundercontrol
i have tried cruisecontrol with phpundercontrol and hudson

1939867
ant	cruisecontrol
i went with hudson in the end because it is a lot easier to set up than cruisecontrol and works well with either ant scripts or simple bash scripts

1939898
post	put	post	get	put	get
put the page in web-inf and use requestdispatcher#forward in the servlet and make use of post instead of get

1939903
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
it seems like i ll need to modify foo to inherit from ieditableobject and inotifypropertychanged which is kind of icky from a mvvm perspective in my mind---those seem more like view-type implementation details

1939969
helpers	actioncontroller
you could also configure the rails helpers to use a specific base path by setting actioncontroller base.asset_host in your environment s configuration file

1940026
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the weird thing is that it shows up in firefox google-chrome safari and opera

1940052
getter	setter
bear in mind that this method is a getter and returns you a copy of the list of columns on the datagrid so if you manipulate its contents you have to apply those changes back to the data grid using the equivalent setter

1940093
lvm	umount
is there any way to atomically umount an fs make an lvm snapshot and mount it back

1940101
children	parent
in this case multiple children can point at the same parent relation one-to-many which solves your problem efficiently

1940157
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1940180
switching	screens
how do i switching between multiple uiview s using one uiviewcontroller just like the iphone home screens

1940188
accessor	properties
also note that you need to implement an accessor method properties so that the production class can actually access the powerrating member of the meter class

1940194
int	chars
i m talking about fundamental data types like int chars etc

1940208
serializable	deserialization
this avoids all the necessary serializable and deserialization that would happen if the client and server were on separate machines

1940269
ienumerable	ilist
the assert method works with any ienumerable but when both collections are of type ilist or array of something the error message thrown when the assert fails will contain the index of the first out-of-place element

1940281
put	get
the thing is that the programme requires a csv file to run i have put it in the same directory as the .jar file but when i run from the command line i just get java.lang.arrayindexoutofbounds 0 error

1940293
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1940296
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1940303
put	get
args 0 will not contain anything unless you put it on the command line and you ll get an index out of bounds error

1940306
post	get
if the incoming request were a post will the request dispatcher take my new parameters and include them in the message body or does this forward now become a get

1940323
getter	setter
as a rule of thumb always declare class members private and access them through methods getter setter in the easiest way always

1940337
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
upgrading if all the clients access the same database then the upgrade will be an all or nothing approach - you will not be able to easily migrate some users to a new versioning whilst leaving the others as they were

1940340
redhat	fedora
i know that ext3 and ext4 in redhat enterprise fedora and centos automatically checkpoint when a lvm snapshot is created

1940351
inherited	properties
i would probably do this by having the page inherited from an interface which contains the properties that you want to set

1940386
post	get
if it s okay to have an extra round trip then consider using a post and have an action which takes the post and reconstructs the url and does a redirecttoaction to an action that accepts the values via get

1940391
int	chars
you mentioned int and chars but these are not present in many languages

1940407
cvs	svn
however using a dvcs does require a little more thought and understanding and using a standard version control system like svn or cvs so you will need to consider the training overhead if moving to a dvcs or your central repository will end up full of a lot different branches people didn t realise they were creating

1940413
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
how do i write a bytearrayoutputstream to a dataoutputstream

1940413
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
as far as writing a bytearrayoutputstream to a dataoutputstream it looks like

1940420
width	height
here the plane is put inside the container named pivot and offset by half it s width and height

1940459
inherited	properties
i want to alter properties of a model field inherited from a base class

1940493
ant	emma
it looks like a different ant target is invoking the code coverage tool emma which is then re-running your tests

1940541
width	height
you might try explicitly setting a size height and width or min-height for the content area

1940550
wxpython	pyqt
i would suggest making your life easier and picking some ui toolkit curses wxpython pyqt to handle interaction with the user

1940555
post	get
use jquery to post get ajax and return json

1940572
versioning	upgrade
for older versioning the best thing i ve seen is to either first upgrade to 2008 then port or unfortunately to port the data using scripts as you ve suggested

1940605
bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream
try using an objectinputstream with a bytearrayinputstream

1940620
bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream
if the byte array was serialized normally you can use a bytearrayinputstream pass that into an objectinputstream and cast the resulting object into your message class

1940700
google-chrome	firefox
this is kind of hackish but it appears to work in firefox ie and google-chrome i don t have the other browsers to test it

1940727
post	get
if i use a post i get 405 method not allowed

1940752
post	get
another option might be using solr to retrieve your thread or post with a full-text search and then using an id from there to run a mysql query that will get you everything else you need

1940809
typedef	struct
typedef struct

1940840
post	get
99 of web servers only allow the get and post methods

1940846
ubuntu	linux
i can build a reader and compile for linux ubuntu 9.10 to be precise since i am the library creator

1940846
ubuntu	linux
can i simply copy accross files that were created on the windows xp machine to the linux ubuntu 9.10 machine and use the linux reader to successfully read the copied over file

1940865
int	chars
are negative values contained in chars used only as integral values in a smaller integral data-type than int and short

1940880
ienumerable	ienumerator
remember that under the hood an iterator method causes a seperate class to be created that implements ienumerable and ienumerator

1940903
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
in my application i am executing 10 asynchronous nsurlconnection within an nsoperationqueue as nsinvocationoperations

1940912
portrait	landscape
the uiviewcontroller is set to return yes for portrait and landscape orientations in the -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation method

1940912
portrait	landscape
the problem i m having is that if the device is already in landscape orientation and the view is added to the hierarchy at this point the view is still in portrait orientation and doesn t auto rotate

1940931
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

1940931
debugdiag	debugging
the debugging diagnostic tool debugdiag is designed to assist in troubleshooting issues such as hangs slow performance memory leaks or fragmentation and crashes in any user-mode process

1940932
int	chars
a chars variable can be used to hold a small int value

1940932
int	chars
in c a chars literal is an int constant

1940957
stdout	stderr
the textview gets populated as the subprocess.popen object run and display their stdout and stderr to this textview

1940964
integer	unsigned
however you may notice that adding two 8-bit unsigned integer images as i did above can result in saturation where pixels exceed the value of 255 the maximum value for an 8-bit unsigned integer

1940972
getter	setter
reqdata is a javabean it has a default constructor and it has setter and getter that the marshaller finds

1940973
int	chars
you have to discern between the plain chars type and the types signed chars and unsigned chars as well signed chars and unsigned chars are ordinary int types for which the following holds c99 6.5.2 √¢ 5

1940991
post	get
post this data to the service end point using defaulthttpclient instance and get the response stream

1941018
ssl	https
1 do a try catch where you try to connect via https and fall back on http in the event of an ssl error

1941029
lsp	principles
if names are clashing chances are that you are violating the so-called liskov substitution principles lsp

1941043
verilog	hdl
verilog hdl by samir palnitkar is an easy-to-read introductory book for verilog

1941082
vbscript	jscript
can i use javascript jscript or vbscript in conjunction with the standard windows cscript wscript commands to do this somehow

1941128
int	chars
in c a chars including signed chars and unsigned chars is used to store a byte which the c standard defines as a small int at least 8 bits in size

1941128
unsigned	short
if you re storing a very large number of small numbers 0..255 for unsigned -127..127 for signed 1 in an array you may prefer to use bytes for them rather than say short ints to save space

1941317
mouseover	mouseout
you could just create each div and a add a mouseover and mouseout listener that would change the icon and back for the markers

1941335
vsto	add-in
what are the differences in excel programming between a udf macro add-in automation add-in xll or vsto

1941338
put	get
at the very least i would put an in there so you get a meaningful error

1941340
firefox	safari
i have run the code in safari and firefox both locally and on a remote server

1941351
rss	feed
i am trying to create an xml document rss feed and have worked out all the kinks in it except for one character encoding issue

fadein	fadeout
i am having a problem with gtetting fadein and fadeout effect of jquery to work properly in ie 6+7+8

1941356
firefox	safari	hide	show
the script works fine in firefox and safari fading nicely but in ie it just show hide - no fading effect at all

1941432
fadein	fadeout
the above code will fadeout to 50 the entire span tag then changes background and fadein

1941487
ubuntu	linux
i m testing this on a linux box with gcc gcc version 4.3.3 ubuntu 4.3.3-5ubuntu4

1941567
children	parent
the parent would fade but all the children elements with positive or relative positioning would remain in view

1941568
width	height
after this you can apply a width 100 and a height 100 to every div you like

1941603
concurrenthashmap	blockingqueue

google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox i get a warning in ie and it doesn t work in google-chrome document.hasfocus is alway true

1941686
getter	setter
i ve looked at other code examples and often they re exposing the variable with a getter and setter and they are also using property

1941755
stdout	stderr
collecting the command s stdout stderr in is there a way to find the command s exit status

1941767
firefox	safari
i am biased towards selenium but it does a good job and allows you to test your applications in several browsers firefox safari ie

1941826
for-loop	arrays
the other thing i read from this is that iterating over an arrays is as efficient as a for-loop and the code is much cleaner and easier to read

1941844
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the generated code is identical to using a for-loop and it s in recommended that you use foreach if you don t need to change the arrays element in loops

1941868
httpcontext	httpmodule
update seem to have found a solution if i create a variable for the httpapplication on init of the httpmodule this all occurs in the httpcontext can be accessed from that variable

1941871
vsto	add-in
note that add-in can be written in either vba or using vsto you can also write udfs in .net but it s atypical

1941871
vsto	add-in
personally i typically use vsto for add-in and i use it as soon as i see that lots of logic procedural code is going into macros in vba

1941876
width	height
first at all a textfield is a displayobject so it have the x y width and height

1941876
inherited	properties
you can t inherited the value of a properties at runtime you inherited the properties itself but not his value if the properties is an instance properties like x

1941876
width	height
y width and height

1941938
versioning	upgrade
while versioning 1.0 of an extension may be innocuous a users browser may suggest an upgrade to versioning 1.1 which could contain malicious code which could be used to scrape information from the screen of the compromised browser

1941951
put	get
is there anyway to disable this so that absolutely no xml attribute nodes get put out in the resulting xml

1941971
inherited	properties
all my controllers inherited from a custom controller class that i wrote it just adds some common properties to the original controller class

1942004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for what it may help the following works in ie7+ safari firefox and google-chrome

1942078
rss	feed
i was trying to get a custom rss feed to use with the mirotv app - an application that gets video from an rss feed and download it so you can watch it in your pc

1942078
rss	feed
i mostly use mirotv to watch video lectures from sites that already a nice rss feed for their lectures like yale open courses

1942078
rss	feed
pipes recently and i wanted to try to do a pipe that parses a page with a list of links to lecture videos into a rss feed

1942078
rss	feed
and cach all the links to flv files and create a rss feed with those links

1942087
post	get
here s one post that might help you get started

1942188
width	font-size
if you wrap each tag in a frex you can measure the width of the in javascript figure out the ratio of font-size to width and then adjust the font-size so that the width is where you want

1942200
width	height
you have to give the corner div s an explicit height and width based on the image you re using for the corner so that they re large enough to show their background

1942201
uitextfield	accessoryview
then you assign each uitextfield to the appropriate cell s accessoryview property

1942215
int	double
this is considered safe if you re starting with a type having a more restricted range than the one you re ending up with short to int is ok as is float to double

1942285
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the text is red in recent firefox google-chrome ie and opera browsers

1942294
int	chars
for example isalpha has a prototype with an int argument but really expects an unsigned chars

1942326
hash	md5
we then created a new table containing md5 hash of the combos plus the id of the master record they applied to

1942349
post	get
mvc applications should be built using prg post - redirect - get which means you will have 2 actions for each form one that will display the form and the second with the same name but decorated with acceptpost that will process the form and redirect the user to the appropriate location based on the result

1942356
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
to do so set an alarm with an intent that your appwidgetprovider receives using the alarmmanager

1942371
udp	tcp
tcp or udp or another layer - the way that information is sent at the binary level and split up into usable chunks then reassembled at the destination

1942371

width	height
it works fine in firefox although i had to bump the width height values to make it readable

1942505
width	margin
the default width of the body element is auto which is whatever space is left once margin padding and borders have been taken into account

1942554

1942586
postgresql	mysql
i am trying to find some way to relate column types across the the most used databases mysql postgresql and sqlite

1942596
mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mousedown	keydown	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keyup	mousedown
firstly are there any full implementations out there that raise all the usual events like keypress keydown keyup mousemove mousedown vscroll hscroll vresize hresize of the window

1942613
content-disposition	content-type
and you re exactly right - you just want to set the content-type and content-disposition just setting content-disposition will work in some browsers but setting both should work in all browsers

1942613
content-disposition	content-type
the nice part with this solution is that applications that load media files directly like let s say an mp3 player in flash don t care about the content-type or content-disposition so you can still play your files in the browser and then link to download that same file

1942631
content-disposition	content-type
you just want to set the content-type and content-disposition just setting content-disposition will work in some browsers but setting both should work in all browsers

1942635
onfocus	onblur
i have a couple different things going on in there to try to get it all selected like the onfocus and the onblur which don t work

1942638
caliburn	prism
as an added bonus your application will be more suited to evolve to a more architecturally-sound composition model as that provided by prism or caliburn frameworks if the application requirements arise

1942647
onclick	onfocus
onfocus should work for tabbing into the field but you would also need to capture onclick since the click moves the cursor thus de-selecting as well as selecting the field

1942658
width	height
it appears that i get complete width and height info

1942666
gallery	shadowbox
if it s not possible with javascript any other suggestions to use shadowbox to automatically show a gallery of images stored on dropbox

1942667

1942759
content-length	content-type
from the w3c spec and wikipedia the http headers are actually content-type and content-length note the uppercase second word

1942761
children	parent
if i update the parent by registering it to an event in the child it will update once for every child when it should only update once all children have updated

1942779
postgresql	mysql	tinyint	boolean
the mysql boolean alias bool alias tinyint 1 is not compatible with the postgresql boolean type

1942779
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql the serial datatype results in an integer column and this will about the same as mysql s

1942779
postgresql	mysql
semantically varchar in mysql and postgresql and char in mysql and postgresql are the same but in mysql these types have a much shorter maximum length

1942779
postgresql	mysql
in mysql these types can have a maximum of a little less than 64kb in postgresql 1gb bytes

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the bit datatypes in mysql and postgresql have roughly the same semantics but in mysql the maximum length of the bit data type is 64 bits

1942779
postgresql	mysql
i think the mysql varbinary data type is best comparable to postgresql s bytea datatype

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the float type in mysql should be equivalent to real in postgresql and real in sqlite too

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the decimal type in mysql is equivalent to decimal in postgresql except that in postgresql the type does not impose an arbtrary limit on the precision whereas in mysql the maximum precision is i believe 70

1942779
postgresql	mysql
for both mysql and postgresql numeric is an alias for the decimal type

aspose.words	aspose.pdf
also you only need aspose.words to produce pdf a year ago you needed both aspose.words and aspose.pdf

1942818
int	chars
as a last resort you can dump your chars s as hex system.out.format 04x int c

1942865

however when i am taking ownership of the adapter s output with idxgioutput takeownership before calling to getdisplaysurfacedata the whole screens blacks out for a moment and then restores back just as during display mode switching

1943091
post	get
it would still be interesting to see how you can query the endpoint directly through a php class - not through a get or post request - and specify what format the results should be in

1943132
put	get
i am needing to get the key from the first each and put it into the 2nd item without having to loop a second time

1943137
division	multiplication
as others said doing 64-bit arithmetic on a 32-bit machine is going to take some extra manipulation more-so if doing multiplication or division

1943140
post	get
if you used post it might not matter that much but if get was used for the update then you definitely want to get rid of any dangling params

1943175
width	height
create a new clean bitmap that has the same width height as your original bitmap

1943176
awt	swing
i had to do this once for the mac os x specific extensions for awt swing found in com.apple.eawt

1943242
accessor	properties
i don t believe you can initialize properties that are set as private using asymmetric accessor accessibility

1943248
post	put	post	get	put	get
you redirect to a get request which is correct when it comes to rest only do updates with post put only get data with get

1943248
post	get
the entry should have some text or some other input from the user so i think from a rest and rails perspective you should actually redirect it to the new method with a get request where the user can input the additional information that one will then post the input and create the entry and after redirect to the newly created entry

1943251
coalesce	isnull
i d prefer the ansi standard coalesce function but isnull is fine

1943309
put	get
i d be tempted to do one .dll or more specifically one class and maybe put all the classes in the same .dll for each of the n sets of convertible units and within each .dll convert everything via one standard unit so that you get away with running one or two of 2 x - 1 conversion calcs per conversion say converting all input in to square metres and then out again rather than coding up every possible combination

1943327
accessor	properties
oh yeah is this like the thing where properties create a setsomething mutator and something accessor

1943346
getter	setter
properties by default will create a getter with the same name as the ivar and a setter with set prepended

1943346
getter	setter
changing the getter name or its setter with the syntax is all this property directive does

1943393

implement you own and then try mouseenter and mouseleave events

1943818
getter	setter
i split imyintf into a getter and a setter interfaces

1943820
width	height
this video class will probably be the fluid element in your website such that by itself it has no direct height constraints but when you resize the browser it will change in width according to the flow of the web site

1943820
width	height
make sure you also remove any explicit height or width declaration within the object and embed tags that usually come with copy pasted embed code

1943820
width	height
it tells whatever else is in video class element to take full-advantage of the real estate provided by the dynamic image by forcing its width height to 100 of the video class element being adjusted by the image

1943833
post	get
i was able to get this working - i changed the return value in my post method to return

1943844
getter	setter
that s true but in java you have to add your sysbiz member variable your getter and setter and all the other logic around sysbiz anyway so an extra line in your constructor or deserialization section isn t all that much of a nuisance

1943862
temp	tmp
probably the partition that has your tmp and temp directories is nearly full and in the middle of compiling the partition gets completely full

1943862
temp	tmp
try creating a directory for yourself on some other partition that has lots of free space set your environment variables tmp and temp to point to that directory log out and log in again so your session uses those new settings and try visual studio again

1943894
temp	tmp
most likely you are running out of space quota on the drive that your temp or tmp environment variable points to

1943918
libpcap	wireshark
use wireshark which includes the libpcap packet capture library

1943929
getter	setter
if they are not then the same can be can done with methods module mapping setter names to getter names

1943933
hash	md5
if you want a hash function to serialize something to disk you might consider the kepler project s implementation of md5 hashing for lua

1943990
onclick	onmousedown
use onmousedown instead of onclick

1943990
onclick	onmousedown
the button at the top uses onclick and normal execution the one below uses onmousedown and settimeout func 0

1943998
gif	png
the following code will force users to save pdf rather than viewing it with browser i would love to achieve the same effect for the images jpg gif png by binding the click action with jquery how will i be able to do that

1944029
put	get
does get at a particular uri need to match what was put to that uri

1944029
post	put
the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is reflected in the different meaning of the request-uri

1944029
put	get
so to me the representation returned by get at a given uri does not necessarily have to be the same representation that was put to the given uri it just has to be consistent

1944048
put	get
if you are transforming then it would make sense that what you put is not what you get so i don t see why it is a problem

1944048
put	get
but if you put a user with certain information then when you use get then it should retrieve that person just as when i put my 4th vacation photo when i call get i expect that photo but it may be transformed by converting to a different format or have some other transforms but if i get the 5th photo instead then that is a problem

1944049
width	height
you can retrieve the movie s nominal width and height through the loader s contentloaderinfo object

1944049
width	height
the nominal width and height of your movie is 640x480

i need to resize and crop an image to a specific width and height

1944146
createfile	deviceiocontrol
the driver needs to be loaded when the o s boots opened and closed via setupdixxx and createfile needs to respond to deviceiocontrol etc

1944147
width	height
you can specify both height and width parameters to resize -- it will not change the aspect ratio you cannot do that with gae s images module but it will ensure that each of the two dimensions is the corresponding value you specify in fact one will be exactly equal to the value you specify the other one will be

1944147
width	height
so you wouldn t use the original provided values of height and width for the resize -- you d scale them up so that none of the resulting image is wasted aka blank if i understand your requirements correctly

1944168
hide	show
i have an upper bound on the number of years which can be returned so i intend to create that many radio buttons and do a show hide based on the number of years returned

1944211
gridview	rowdatabound
i use the rowdatabound event instead of the update event of the gridview

1944212
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout is used to make your set of code to execute after a specified time period so for your requirements its better to use setinterval because that will call your function every time at a specified time interval

1944214
int	double
this will tell you if the double represents an int

1944214
int	double
disclaimer 1 i m saying int and not int as a double can represent numbers that are int but whose magnitudes are too great to store in an int

1944214
int	double
extremely large double for example are always int because they don t have enough significant digits to represent any fractional value

1944215
altera	xilinx
if yes xilinx and altera have lots of good verilog examples and other learning resources

1944254
altera	xilinx
if you have tools from xilinx or altera installed consider looking through the source code for their ip cores some cores will be obfuscated but many are not

1944255
filtering	grouping
there calling count on the filtering object is an alias for the sql grouping function count which sums up the number of matching rows

1944279
postgresql	mysql
actually the problem arises since we have named a column authorization which is ok on mysql but fails miserably on postgresql authorization is a reserved keyword there

1944288
textview	imageview
section 1 is a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview

1944291
width	height
you can preload the image into a javascript image object then check the width and height properties on that object

1944298
width	height
remove the width and height attributes and read offsetwidth and offsetheight

1944298
width	height
create a javascript image object set the src and read the width and height you don t even have to add it to the page to do this

1944298
width	height
otherwise with big images height and width would not return anything because the image was not loaded yet

1944309
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work on firefox but not on google-chrome or safari webkit

1944336
int	chars
as for the userid that s embedded in the l.name column if the digits are the leading chars in the column value mysql allows you to convert to an int value much more easily

1944351
int	double
fpus are fast enough these days that doing a double -to- int conversion or a floor really isn t that slow

1944395
client-side	server-side
there s no automatic way unless someone built one that can replicate the client-side validation to server-side

1944435

width	height
see width and height

1944475
getter	setter
i just can across some code where they ve got an implicit setter but no getter eg

1944485
width	height
like a div that can be styled but has no intrinsic display of its own though it will be the width and height specified by its width and height attributes

1944514
width	height
if you need to maintain the state of the application you can for example put it in the middle of a 3x3 table with 100 width and height and then manipulate styles of all other cells

1944598
width	height
we basically filled divs by correlating it s height width pixel count with the 0 to 100 range

1944600
textarea	textbox
if you assign the retrieve value into a textarea or multiline textbox you will have the linebreaks displayed without manipulating the string

1944633
post	get
unfortunately i can t post a picture until i get more points

1944681
ant	pom.xml
after updating the project tree from version control you need to run a little ant script that generates the actual pom.xml in every directory

1944683
google-chrome	firefox
but in my page it will not support session scope between browsers that is at first i signin with firefox while i login with google-chrome browser it comes to login page

1944688
pop-up	dialog
i tried to implement validation on that button using javascript and a confirmation dialog box will pop-up when it is clicked

1944693
children	parent
should i define them in the parent the daemon and assume that they will be inherited in the children

1944716
folder	directory
however i think that you should be able to use linked folder so that you have a eclipse project directory which is basically empty but for a .project file and a linked folder which points to your source tree

1944791
debian	linux
here we use arm board for embedded system from their linux is very light and based on debian and linux from scratch

content-length	content-type
i d also change content-length content-type and host to content-length contnet-type and host just in case

1944943
getter	setter
bellow is the code to generate an array of delegates for getter and setter for a certain type

1944943
getter	setter
obs the code above does not deal with properties that have no getter or no setter or are marked as private

1944945
children	parent
however there s a down side - if you need for some reason to delete insert a parent you may need to delete insert all of its children in order as well

1944950
put	get
australia s code is +61 however when i put this in the form at and i continually get an error message

1945385
vxworks	rtos	vxworks	qnx	rtos	qnx
one of the reasons i suggested that it may depend on the microcontroller is that if for example it is an arm9 with a few mb of external sdram and at least say 4mb flash also usually external - memory takes up a lot of die space then you could run a heavyweight os on it such as linux wince or symbian or even a large rtos such as qnx or vxworks

1946244
post	get
not sure i know what you mean but you could try using a post action rather than get

1946244
submit	submission
another thought if you are submission the form via jquery and using the click handler of an anchor tag try making sure you return false or try using a submit button and catching instead

1946263
strdup	malloc
note that the use of strdup suggested by greg performs this call to malloc under the covers

1946288
fiddler	charles
and obviously the smaller the request response size you can use tools like fiddler charles to find the size the faster the response

1946326
put	get
i√¢ ve used two different approaches in the past one was using adomd to pull results and put these into a dataset the other was using sql openquery to a linked ssas server to get results out as a sql stored procedure result set

1946330
altivec	x87
in my experience i typically see about a 3x improvement in taking an algorithm from x87 to sse and a better than 5x improvement in going to vmx altivec because of complicated issues having to do with pipeline depth scheduling etc

1946348
width	height
the question s about the text width but you can get the text height as well

zlib	libpng
since libpng uses zlib

1946399
zlib	libpng
the my_jpeg_read_func my_png_read_func grabcolorvalue create_colored_tile_by_color_space_warping draw_tile my_jpeg_wrapper_write and report_error_to_user and maybe some others have to be written yourself and you may need to include libjpg zlib and libpng in your project and add headers and or #includes

1946681
width	height
i want to calculate that how width and how height of some text used in my control and do some layout stuff.after some searching i find that the only way to draw text in flex is to use something like textfield

1946681
width	height
so i use textfield to display text and try to get the width and height of the text through

1946681
width	height
why nearly 20 part of the text height width are not displayed

hello i want to use some string like 0xff123456 as a 32-bit unsigned integer

1946821
udp	tcp
you can ask your boss for a specific reason to use tcp and then implement that particular service for example basic reliability or an error correction service over udp

1946862
ubuntu	linux
i use dogtail to do such things using this i have created a automated testing fromework for my linux ubuntu app

1946932
udp	tcp
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

int	chars
converts the specified 64 bit unsigned int into a chars representation based on the specified number system and copies the conversion into this descriptor replacing any existing data

1946968
for-loop	loops
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate

1946971
for-loop	loops
you should be right to be annoyed at not being able to use a for-loop and have to build a collection or use a lambda to build a subcollection instead just because for loops have been banned

1946974
inherited	properties
i then added the type to the inherited attribute on the register page and in the controller added a new instance of the model to the viewdata.model properties

the key thing here is setting the width and height of map_canvas in pixels so they exceed the size of your browser window

1947243
getter	setter
if you d like to do something similar in php you d have to declare a private field and write public getter and setter methods and do some sort of null checking within the setter method

1947244
put	get
i couldn t get hooked into this without digging into the source for dnn which of course is another option but the bottom line was that all i wanted to do was put another textbox right after it and make sure that the email addresses matched

1947258
udp	rtp	rtp	rtcp
rtp rtcp over udp is normally used for delivery of the media stream

1947258
rtp	rtcp
rtp rtcp therefore provides some but not all tcp functionality

1947258
udp	tcp
one main advantage to tcp though is that it traverses firewalls more easily than udp

1947282

1948131
haskell	ocaml
it s my understanding that structural typing is used by type inferencers and the like to determine type information think haskell or ocaml while duck typing doesn t care about types per se just that the thing can handle a specific method invocation property access etc

1948139
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop or a foreach loops that iterates over the arrays index...same difference

all of this is for solaris though i have no idea if it s applicable to sunos

1948426
ienumerable	iqueryable
it s important that query be ienumerable instead of var or iqueryable it s important that you call asenumerable so that you get back an as we want to force the second query to use linq to objects on the results of the first linq to sql query

1948434
children	parent
con this method requires the tables to all have the same structure or at the very least the parent must have only the common elements between all the children

1948454
onkeyup	onblur
a simple onblur onkeyup etc won t work for what you want so just combine them

1948499

i also noticed when looking at this forum and other blogs and such that most people are using nunit xunit or mbunit

1948596
nunit	mstest	nunit	typemock	mstest	typemock
to this end i ve been looking online to come up with the right infrastructure for both a build server and dev machines...i was looking at the typemock website as i ve heard great things about their mocking framework and noticed that it seems like they promote mstest and even have some links of people moving to mstest from nunit

1948638
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what i have found over my 12 years of developing front-end interfaces is you d be better off to start development on ie and test for bugs on firefox opera safari and google-chrome opposed to going about it the other way around

1948649
maven	pom.xml
it was quite easy to download and launch the selenium-server.jar add the selenium-java-client-driver to my existing eclipse maven pom.xml driver project

some of the decision is just down to whether you want a push pull system though

1948762
onresume	onpause
you should try cleaning up on onpause and then onresume re-instate the stuff you need

1948763
versioning	upgrade
however some changes were made to the data access application block in versioning 3.1 may 2007 which may affect applications written for earlier versioning if you upgrade to the current versioning of enterprise library

1948765
mouse	keyboard
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster

1948782
put	get
an alternative way to solve the problem is to use an extra argument in put and get which changes the delimeter

1948827
int	boolean
also i d prefer to leave the columns as boolean bit types and not change them to int types

1948881
trie	tree	integer	radix
a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to integer

1948889
accessor	properties
since you are simply trying to edit a particular row why not use those properties accessor that you already have set up in item

1948893
yacc	bison
the simplest parser generator is yacc or bison

1948893
yacc	bison
bison is just a harry yacc ie it has more options

1948927
getter	setter
i agree that getter setter are verbose

1948957
yacc	bison
keep in mind that with yacc or bison you will have to write a grammar in their language

1949010
bash	subshell
sometimes that is appropriate - but most often it is stuff that a c shell programmer wrote not realizing that the notation means run a subshell in bourne shell and derivatives - such as korn shell the posix-compliant shells and bash

1949054
button	checkbox
i also have a update button and when the user clicks it i want to insert rows into my table with the same value for the dropdown and checkbox fields in all the rows but i want different values for each row depending on the list items that were selected

1949066
textview	imageview
the app runs once fills the information on the screen layouts listviews textview imageview etc and user reads the information

1949068
try-catch	exception-handling
wrap the call that is throwing argumentexception with a try-catch exception-handling ex and step into the exception-handling block to see the raw exception-handling

1949221
bazaar	git
i generally use git but some people find mercurial a bit simpler to use there are lots of others like subversion bazaar and so on but git and mercurial are the most popular distributed revision control systems which make it easier to just version control a directory on your disk without setting up a server

1949228
rss	feed
i m planning a web application using django and it s based on a big pile of data from rss feed

1949251
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
with that approach you can do things like cache the objects using a sqldependency or sqlcachedependency to avoid round-trips

1949267
serializable	deserialization
you could use serializable into a memory stream and deserialization back to an instance

1949286
openssl	gnutls
gnutls and openssl being two of them

1949305
sorting	filtering
i would use the built-in capabilities of linq to xml to handle filtering sorting

1949324
integer	unsigned
of course if num is of an unsigned type or one of the c99 fixed-width integer types int8_t and so on which are required to be 2 s complement then this isn t an issue

1949351
getter	setter
i realise using getter setter can be useful when you need to further processing or need to be notified of when the property is changed like so

1949351
getter	setter
but if you don t need this then is there any reason to use getter setter over just using a public var

1949361
getter	setter
depending on your language you should prefer getter setter up front because you can t introduce them later i m looking at you java if it turns out you do need them

1949363
getter	setter
however there are often benefits when using getter and setter related to versioning and api compatibility

1949368
strcpy	strncpy
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy

1949371
getter	setter
as a side note you can start with a public var and if necessary convert it to a getter setter later in code

1949377
firefox	safari
it works both in ie and firefox and the last time i checked safari too

1949390
hide	show
this would only stop average users who run windows with the defaults hide system files and don t have show hidden files checked from copying the file and including the volume id disk size and volume name also in your check would insist that it is only allowed to a mirrored device

1949432
getter	setter
getter and setter also give you more control over what values the variable can be set to

1949434
post	get
it s quite simple to do a get or post for the template and then do another get post for your data

1949448
getter	setter
getter and setter cost more in most languages but they buy you flexibility down the road

1949448
getter	setter
in some languages you can t change a public to a getter setter without changing the code in the callers because the use syntax changes

1949448
getter	setter
getter and setter let you do parameter validation

1949448
getter	setter
but i use getter and setter only when i need them right away or when i m pretty sure i m going to need the flexibility

1949457
children	parent
the children of that parent

1949471
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have an uitableview and i did put an uisearchbar on it

1949471
uitableview	uisearchbar
what i want to achieve is that if a user is going to scroll i want the uisearchbar element to be fixed on the top plus i want the first row of the uitableview fixed as well

1949471
uitableview	uisearchbar	put	get
one way to get the uisearchbar element fixed could be if i put an uiview under both elements uitableview and uisearchbar and put those two consecutively among themselves just a thought of me don t know if this actually is working

1949493
jar	war
something like a jar hidden inside a war or something which could have been build with an earlier version of the class

1949511
division	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

1949597
move	drag
so for example if the scene is one large square and the mouse is located in the center of the square the square should move in the direction of the mouse drag while the center of the square remains under the mouse

1949626
portrait	landscape
whether the iphone is in portrait or landscape the screen coordinates don t change so you ll need to adjust for that in your app

1949663
versioning	upgrade
if you port your app to another brand of rdbms or even if you upgrade to a newer versioning of mysql that may implement storage differently the rows could come back in some other order

1949666
innodb	myisam
per this thread default sort is insert order for myisam and primary key ascending for innodb

1949678
outputstream	inputstream
you ll need to create a servlet which listens on this url and get the image as an inputstream from the local disk file system by fileinputstream or from the database by resultset#getbinarystream and writes it to the outputstream of the response along with a correct set of response headers with at least content-type

1949678
outputstream	inputstream
just get it as an inputstream and write it the usual java io way to the outputstream of the response

1949680
xfce	gnome
exo-open in xfce see the comments in the gnome link

1949680
kde	gnome
xdg-open may work in many environments reputedly works in kde see the comments in the gnome link

width	height
additionally don t forget to change width height values above to whatever the new values should be

1949741
apache	lighttpd
i don t really have an answer for you but after some very basic inspection i can tell you that staging apache is returning a 200 with the entire file and stream29l lighttpd is returning a 206 with a partial file

1949749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox 3.0 and all version of ie possibly other browsers though it does not happen in some browsers i ve tested firefox 3.5 safari google-chrome

1949755
jboss	glassfish
if you want to run in container tests then you could indeed use an embedded container and my current preference goes to glassfish v3 even for java ee 5 i may be wrong but i m pretty disappointed by the starting time of the latest jboss releases so it isn t getting much of my attention

1949809
jmonkeyengine	ardor3d
ardor3d or jmonkeyengine for a higher level 3d library

1953836
width	height
lastly i set the imageview height to fitcontent and the width to fillparent and that gave me a horizontal line

but how would i return more than just a single string int boolean from my webservice to my application

1954469
width	height
a select s height and width need to be adjusted for the size of the border and the padding of it

1954469
width	height
so if you want a 100x20 select with a 1px border you will need to set height width to 100x20 as opposed to most everything else where you would set height width to 98x18

1954482
children	parent
now anytime you want to have children deal with updating themselves just dispatch the event.change from the parent

1954888
awt	swing
offhand i can t recall if any of this code relies on swing i imported javax.swing and the servlet is about 300 lines long so i may have thought i needed it for something else a quick check on google looks like this is squarely in the awt space

1954922
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
also if you call sql server from c# i d strongly recommend you use the native .net sql provider sqlconnection sqlcommand etc. - not oledbcommand

1954971

1955240
sorting	filtering
when this does so the table is run through multiple features such as filtering sorting etc etc .

1955249
width	height
also some screens have different ratio of height width so using only dip will not be enough

1955249
width	height
but sometimes you set a fixed height on something and if you deploy it on the droid for example it will look short because the droid has more height width ratio than the g1 g2 etc

1955262
post	get
what you need to do is get the page that the screenshot post back to something like login.php etc and then construct a webrequest to that page with the login data you have

1955317
coldfusion	railo
i am trying to setup the coldfusion server railo on tomcat6 and using apache2 to connect to tomcat via mod_jk

1955317
coldfusion	railo
im planning on having multiple virtual hosts in apache that would all ideally have all of their coldfusion pages served by railo since several of the subdomains would be rarely used admin etc so it seems a waste to have a separate railo app for them

when you databind something you are telling the thing you type into where to put what gets typed into it and where to get what it shows

1955527
google-chrome	safari
i noticed when in app-capable mode any http link will take you out of the app and launch a separate mobile safari window take you to the page and show the safari google-chrome

1955593
nsis	uninstaller
also to check for your file specifically see if there s a plugin for nsis that can calculate checksums and compare that on uninstaller

1955620
class-method	delegation
i then began using class-method which i believe ruled out the possibility of using the delegation methods

1955623
inherited	properties
i am not currently planning on using inherited for conveying semantics to the said messages but rather simple properties

1955628
width	height
the playarea div in this case will not automatically expand in width height to fit the elements within and since it has no height defined it is treated as not taking up any room which means that the tag will appear at the same location as the div

1955642
hide	show
do you want to render different templates for the different users or just have conditionals in the template to hide show parts of it depending on the user s access levels

1955655

1955716
uiview	subviews
a. is it appropriate to add buttons or any subviews for that matter to the uiview initwithframe method or should i be adding these subviews as a subviews to my buttonpad in the view controller file

1955738
put	get
this allows you to put them somewhere different from the pages that get directly accessed

1955763
for-loop	loops
this means that that loops is very likely to change the value of i in a completely different for-loop in another function and you ll have absoutely no idea what s going on

1955768
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller inside

1955811
put	get
however when i try to put it into an automator workflow mac os x i get this error

1955852
keystore	jks
sun s default jks keystore uses a proprietary algorithm primarily to get around exporting restrictions on standard algorithms

1955852
hash	salt
this is how the algorithm works for key protection p - user password s - random salt x - xor key p - to-be-protected key y - protected key r - what gets stored in the keystore step 1 take the user s password append a random salt of fixed size to it and hash it d1 digest p s store d1 in x

1955854
ubuntu	linux
the best 2 ways to go are os x and linux i use ubuntu just because it s the nicest package that i ve found there will no doubt be a variety of opinons on this.

1955854
textmate	gedit
i like textmate like everyone else for osx and gedit with gedit-mate

1955855
post	get
is there a way to get an image from a usb scanner on windows primarily cross-platform solution would be best and post the image together to a form in browser with flex or java applet

1955886
width	height
if width of shape is smaller than 5 and height of shape is smaller than 5 delete the shape

1955898
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you re doing min max avg queries do you prefer to use aggregation tables or simply query across a range of rows in the raw table

1955923
getter	setter
the dependencyproperty system operates independently of the c# property getter and setter which are provided as a convienience to the programmer

1955931
pentaho	olap
since you re using mysql you could take a look at pentaho mondrian which is an open source olap solution that supports mysql

1955940
expander	itemscontrol
use an itemscontrol and have your itemtemplate include an expander

1955940
expander	itemscontrol
the content of the expander would be another itemscontrol bound to the child items and with its itemtemplate set to the appropriate detail view

1955958
lisp	smalltalk
io is a prototype-based programming language inspired by smalltalk all values are objects all messages are dynamic self prototype-based newtonscript differential inheritance act1 actors and futures for concurrency lisp code is a runtime inspectable modifiable tree and lua small embeddable

lisp	smalltalk
ioke is a prototype-based programming language that is inspired by io smalltalk lisp and ruby

1956007
vb.net	vb6
i have to upgrade a legacy vb6 app to vb.net

1956011
public	protected
however if i change the access modifier on that property from protected internal to public it gets populated fine which tells me that it s not any obvious problem with the mapping itself

1956037
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net don t have a lot in common beyond similar syntax and a similar sounding name

1956082
centos	linux
note if you have no idea what that means then the answer is probably yes since utf-8 has been the default for most linux distributions for several years now and indeed redhat and thus centos were the very first to make the switch

1956082
ubuntu	debian
since this patch is already from 2005 i assume that it is also used in centos. this patch is also used in mac osx debian ubuntu ... pretty much nobody uses gnu grep as distributed by gnu

1956088
ready	each
since git push does not merge you could have each developer push to a branch on the central repository and then when you re ready log on to the machine that hosts the central repo and merge them with

1956096
uploadify	swfupload
if you really need to customize the look and feel of your fields try a flash based uploader like swfupload or uploadify

1956117
hide	show
this way you can pass arguments to your program or batch and decide to show or hide the executing console

1956127
client-side	server-side
do you mean a server-side or client-side script

1956134
post	get
you can get fancy by using a standard format like json yaml or xml within each post file and even fancier by requesting these with ajax calls in mostly client side code

1956134
rss	feed
it also builds an rss feed

1956142
stdout	stderr
also preferably i don t want to create a subprocess and read its stdout and stderr in separate thread

1956147
nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
synchronous nsurlconnection work great inside of an nsoperation - and because you are using them synchronously an nsoperationqueue handed the nsoperation will automatically use a background thread to run them you have to do extra work otherwise

1956150
hash	md5
obviously this may cause collisions but the small number of machines 100 means this is unlikely and using the truncated output of a cryptographic hash say md5 makes this even less so

1956156
switching	screens
i m trying to play two videos using the mpmovieplayercontroller class and allow the user to switching between the two videos by swiping their finger across the screens

1956188
sorting	grouping
i d like to do all joins grouping sorting and advanced data manipulation using linq

1956342
queue	fifo
given only fifo support for a given single queue you will of course have to introduce either multiple queue an intermediary or have a more complex consumer

1956349
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox looks fine but in internet explorer 6 and 7 looks too tall

1956363
user-controls	tabcontrol
in this case if you only want access to a specific control on the user-controls s parent form like a tabcontrol you might consider that you want to make the property you set of type tabcontrol rather than form the same coding technique shown above can be used in the user-controls

1956376
int	chars
but int and chars variables can

1956377
for-loop	loops
unless you need to access its value after the for-loop ends leave the variable inside loops it will be closer to the code that uses it your code will be more readable and its scope will be bounded by loops itself your code will be more elegant and less bug-prone

1956387
int	chars
so for example if sp represents the memory address of the top of the stack declaring chars x results in and int x results in on a 32 bit machine

1956392
int	chars
int and chars can t change either

1956407
stdout	stderr
i would like to log the output of both stdout and stderr from a python script

1956407
stdout	stderr
also it is possible to get stdout and stderr like this

1956434
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
primitive values such as int boolean chars floats and double allow the actual value in memory to be changed

1956447
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
the same is true for all primitive types boolean byte chars short int long float and double

1956518
put	get
2 - i couldn t grasp what exactly the put and get functions do

1956525
post	get
i have a jquery ajax request in my website page and every page i need to post this request to server to get the status

1956631
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has explain analyze dunno about mysql you ll probably find you need to index columns that participate in where and join not the ones that form the result set

1956741
nsurl	nsdata
nsdata imgdata nsdata datawithcontentsofurl nsurl urlwithstring

1956749
width	height
you can t use fadeout because it sets the div style to display none and thus the div has a zero height and width making the scrollto plugin mess up pretty bad

1956784
mouse	keyboard
you can do application wide keyboard and mouse handling but you have very few options if your application is not the foreground application

1956838
width	height
i am facing a problem when gets height width of textview

1956845
terminate	timeout
for using subprocess please check this post python popen and select - waiting for a process to terminate or a timeout

1956899
superclass	subclassing
i m not going to get into detail about superclass and subclassing because other people have explained it already

1956914
dictionary	map
if you only need a dictionary like functionality go with a map for something more complex consider a database

1956968
vb.net	vb6
write code in vb6 to do what you need call it from c# vb.net

1957030
firefox	safari
i have tried using javascript to save the hash values in cookies but that isnt working with firefox and its too slow in safari the html will show first so one has to refresh the page a second time for the correct content to be shown

1957059
submit	submission
when you submit the form form method state method post so by submission to itself request_method will be post

1957091
post	get
it will equal post if they get to the page after submitting a form

1957095
post	get
get and post are the http verb s used to access the page

1957095
post	get
usually we use post to send user data back to the server and use get to well get data from the server

1957095
post	get
so asking for an index.html is a get request but posting data to something like a comment form sending data back to the server uses post

1957095
post	get
try this link to learn more about get and post

1957114
free	malloc
only free pointers obtained from malloc never adjust them prior to that

1957116
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc realloc or valloc function or if the space is deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behaviour is undefined

1957118
versioning	upgrade
3- then i build a new versioning of this program and upgrade it

1957119
free	malloc
of course other implementation of malloc free can choose other way to achieve this

1957119
free	malloc
but they generally don t support to free on a different pointer than what was returned by malloc or equivalent function

1957173
post	get
there are a bunch such as head get post delete and i believe a few more

1957185
range	max	range	min	min	max
it is doing a range select on city_id it will scan every row with a city_id value between the min and max values in your in clause

1957192
subtraction	add
if x2 is negative due to the above subtraction add n to it

1957193
put	get
how do i put a download button on a site to get a csv of a table query

1957245
mouseover	mouseleave
like when you want to hide a mouseover menu not exactly at the time when a mouseleave it but a few milliseconds later

1957245
hide	show
for example you have a function that show and hide a menu

1957251
super	self
why there is also no super instance with typical usage super self .__init__

1957251
super	self
technically you can obtain the type of an object from the object itself so the current strategy super classtype self .__init__ is kind of redundant

1957267
super	implements
i think super was implements to be explicit redundant just to be on the safe side and keep the logic involved as simple as possible no sugar or deep logic to find the parent

1957271
mouseover	mouseout
using console.log or some other logging method you should be able to determine if the mouseout is firing before the mouseover is finished adding content or if there is another problem

1957286
subtract	add
by changing the texture combiner state you can add subtract interpolate or take dot products of your texture samples instead

1957310
django-filter	django-haystack
another option separate from django-haystack and searching is django-filter by alex gaynor it allows you to filter fields based on the contents of the model and not on an index

1957314
getter	setter
getter and setter are created manually

1957314
getter	setter
the getter setter then just access that array with the appropriate key

1957437
hide	show
for example i have some general information about contacts and i want to show each row has extra information like activity for that contact and ability to hide or show extra information

1957498
hide	show
now i want to hide or show with my condition a divider when my app run

1957543
google-chrome	safari
works in ie8 ff3 but not ie7 or google-chrome webkit so probably safari too

1957571
google-chrome	firefox
personally i don t like web applications that requires a lot of user interaction there are some of them that is a pleasure to use but i think it is very easy to do it the wrong way and end up having a buggy or not so responsive application probably because of the incompatibilities in browsers i have ie firefox and google-chrome installed on my computer and i use one for some websites because they run faster on it and others for other sites because web pages show up correctly only on them

1957603
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring and nsmutablestring are part of what s called a class cluster - when you create or modify a string it may or may not be an instance of the class you re expecting

1957642
nunit	mstest
as much as the console runner is nice i enjoy the instant red green view of a graphical runner such as nunit or mstest for quickly glancing at broken tests

1957647
printf	getchar
i can only use if-else while simple math operators and printf getchar scanf - no functions arrays or pointers

1957656
public	protected
use exceptions when checking parameters passed to public or protected methods and constructors

1957717
getter	setter
this is an over-simplified example as the property simply wraps the private field by returning it in the getter and setting it in the setter

1957720
getter	setter
a property can have a setter or a getter or both and you can also specify different accessibility level for each

1957721
getter	setter
also if you use a reflection you would have to lookup for property setter and getter for the first example line and for the second you would need to directly retrieve a member variable

1957724
getter	setter
the main difference is that if you later need to add logic into your getter or setter and other dlls have already been compiled against yours you can easily change

1957741
hide	show
you can hide some portions using css if you don t want and show the others

1957786
mathml	tex
if you want typesetting then use either tex or presentational mathml as they have well-developed toolkits

1957796
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram shoud be in uml notation see this the last is uml notation

1957820
super	self
super classtype self .__init__ is not redundant in a cooperative multiple inheritance scheme -- classtype is not necessarily the type of self but the class from which you want to do the cooperative call to __init__

1957820
super	self
if you now instantiate you see that the class type is not redundant -- super self .__init__ inside b.__init__ would not really work

1957828
entity-relationship	diagram
when all you want is an entity-relationship diagram

1957833
entity-relationship	diagram
power designer - my preferred tool for working with entity-relationship diagram

1957847
width	height
i am trying to fix the height and width of image in pdf generated using fop 0.95

1957862

you should add an fflush stdout after this to make sure the output appears before scanf is called

1957876
erd	diagram
personally i prefer erd diagram for databaser data models

1957888
ubuntu	linux
i am ofcourse using linux ubuntu and i managed to get the source code for blender

1957893
jstl	taglib
you can use taglib such as jstl to control the flow in the jsp page and you can use el to access the back-end data

1957942
width	height
just width and height are enough

1957952
width	height
by default fop keeps the aspect ratio regardless of the image height and width specified

1957952
width	height
this will display your image.png image with height 2.00in and width 2.00in

1957987
serializable	deserialization
i m using serializable and deserialization in c# for my project which is a class

is there a way to return one row per parent with it s children as columns

1958066
user-controls	elementhost
and the user-controls is hosted on winform using elementhost

1958109
post	get
alternatively if you post the problem you√¢ re trying to solve rather than discussing issues with a solution you√¢ ve decided upon you might get more traction

1958132
superclass	subclassing
before_filter in your subclassing doesn t override the same call in the superclass but they stack after each other instead

1958133
children	parent
i have a data such that there are many parent each with 0-n children where each child can have 0-n nodes

1958133
children	parent
from any given node down children then up to the root up to the specific parent

1958138
postgresql	mysql
there is one dbd for mysql another one for postgresql etc

1958147
subtraction	addition
all these come with the cost of a simple subtraction addition which is really irrelevant

1958208
post	get
sounds like you are looking to do a post redirect get

1958208
post	get
advantages of redirecting a post to a get request are

1958216
public	protected
i ve been working with the prototype library for some time now and occasionally find myself wishing i had multiple access levels public private and protected

1958216

1958328
btrieve	pervasive
it s a free download from pervasive the makers of btrieve which is what i m assuming your .btr files are

1958362
queue	fifo
waiting threads are put in a nominally fifo queue and while they re triggered with pulse they aren t fully runnable until the lock is relinquished again in part due to memory barriers

1958366
google-chrome	safari
for some reason when you apply a background image to a tr in safari google-chrome it renders it as if the rule applies to every td

1958378
gif	png
one common cause of oom while using image resources is when one is decompressing jpg png gif images with really high resolutions

1958434
post	put	post	get	put	get
these names correspond to the http method names delete get post and put

1958480
uitableview	uisearchbar
as for now i have implemented this search elimination using uisearchbar and results appears at a uitableview

1958563
int	boolean
if you put the argument of the while loop in a separate variable boolean bool true the compiler will tell you to return an int in this method

1958684
set	bag
i believe that i need to use a set as opposed to a bag because my collections contain unique items

1958690
apache	lighttpd
if you don t have access to your apache lighttpd configuration file a little hack that may work is putting the script in

1958723
int	double
change your data type to float or double and write all of your numbers as 100.0 for example - otherwise it will be treated as an int

1958807
onmousemove	onmouseover
replaced onmouseout and onmouseover with the more widely supported onmousemove event

1958854
wildfly	weblogic
if you ever want to go ejb or jpa then you d like to pick another wildfly tomee payara liberty weblogic etc

1958854
wildfly	weblogic
wildfly tomee payara liberty weblogic etc as being a complete java ee implementation already ships with jsf and ejb and jpa etc out the box

1958874
freemarker	velocity
some will let you use something else too velocity freemarker etc.

1958874
getter	setter
basically it means that you are using getter and setter or some alternatives and you are following some rules

1958881
x86	64bit
the problem is that createenvironmentblock using the token of the user-session application creates a block with programw6432 c program files x86 which is a problem for 64bit applications

1958901
redmine	trac
grab redmine or trac and take on the challenge of getting everyone to standardize

1958951
width	margin
it looks like i can t set left margin to be less then 42pt width

1958951
width	height
page width and height are 6x9 in

1958997
public	protected
this way only the integrity of the public key needs to be protected

1959001

there are few alternatives you may try like freemarker and velocity

1959011
typedef	typename
the key is the typename part of the typedef

1959031
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also this currently works best in ie google-chrome and safari - there is an issue with firefox that i am working out separately

1959068
ogre	irrlicht
see some examples using ogre and irrlicht here

1959078
onclick	onchange	onclick	onfocus	onchange	onfocus
don t use js to change the content onload rather do it only during user-controlled events onclick onchange onfocus etc

1959089
put	get
you can get round this by either using badd and then bufdo as above or by doing something like this put it in your vimrc

1959095
persistent	transient
if that is the case would the domain object for the metadata contain a reference to the raw byte object that is marked as transient so jpa won t attempt to persistent it

1959144
scrollable	panels
the panels has a few text fields and a scrollable panels below in a verticalpanel

1959144
scrollable	panels
what i d like to do is to make the scrollable panels with uibinder and then add that to a verticalpanel below is an example i created to illustrate this

1959148
google-chrome	firefox
this is an html5 api and it ll work on webkit-derivatives google-chrome and firefox 3.5 for now

1959209
min	max
this is achieved with an aggregate function like min max or group_concat

1959241
int	double
when you use f make sure that the argument is a float or double not an int

1959310
mapquest	directions
as accuracy goes i ve noticed that for directions here in north carolina mapquest is slightly more accurate

1959319
inherited	subclassing
2 does a subclassing of class a which implements interface i inherited the conformance to that interface or should it also declare itself as implementing i

1959333
pop-up	dialog
i pop-up other dialog boxes but i also want to be able to get back to the parent app dialog

1959336
opera	firefox
i don t need markup for ie firefox opera etc

1959348
put	get
this is a c# example. in this property get all that customer s orders put them in list object maintain it in a private variable in case the property is called again and return that list object

1959348
inherited	properties
then create an orders class that inherited from to replace your basic and add the properties firstorder

1959353
implements	extends
one could extends button and implements this interface to get a simple button renderer

1959388
inherited	subclassing
your subclassing of str does not override format so when you call format on one of its instances it just uses the one inherited from str which uses self s intrinsic value as str the string form of whatever you passed to offset

1959437
keydown	keyup
the ev_key key_menu 1 is keydown event and the ev_key key_menu 0 is the corresponding keyup event

1959495
getter	setter
this object may be composed of getter and setter but it is a model of a student and would thus be extremely useful in a database system

1959495
entity-relationship	diagram
to further understand this i recommend reading on entity-relationship diagram

1959517
stateless	stateful
web-servers are stateless web-application are stateful -- this leads to dependance on a data-layer to persist state

1959558
pop-up	dialog
so when you click on it pop-up a dialog box and you can fill out information

1959568
jobs	cron
it is likely that your system is using it to run hourly daily etc. cron jobs just by dropping scripts into directories such as etc cron.hourly

1959715
hex	binary
how to print integer literals in binary or hex in haskell

1959750
airplane	roaming
your best option in this case is probably to present an alert suggesting that the user enable airplane mode or turn off data roaming

1959795
innodb	myisam
your server tuning will now necessarily be a compromise - you cannot use all the memory for either myisam or innodb nb this does not apply if they are on different servers

1959795
innodb	myisam
then you can pretty much forget about myisam and not devote resources to it and get the full benefits of using innodb

1959795
innodb	myisam
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

1959816
joystick	keyboard	hid	joystick	hid	keyboard
also there s a usb hid pos point of sale mode that some higher-end usb scanners support that gives you an even greater degree of flexibility with the added bonus of driver free installation it looks like a generic hid device to the system like a joystick or keyboard but with 2-way comm ability

1959828
nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
an approach i like to use is synchronous nsurlconnection calls inside of an nsoperation which in turn is managed by an nsoperationqueue

1959841
memset	calloc
i realize that the gdb output makes no sense because you do verify it s a null terminated strings but i ve had a lot of string.h bizarre problems go away with a memset bzero calloc or whatever you want to use

1959842
switching	screens
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

1959842
switching	screens
when each state handler becomes longer than a couple of screens split each event out in a separate function similar to the way that the state switching was split

1959842
switching	screens
i have used state event tables in the past but i have to say that for the simplest cases i do not find them necessary and i prefer the clarity and readability of the switching statement even if it does extend past one screens full

1959853
trie	dawg
if you need alphabetical order use a trie or a dawg like i recommended in your last question

1959866
gentoo	linux
an example of a stable and successful linux distribution would be gentoo where all binaries are compiled on the server before install no binaries exist in the distribution

1959901
button	checkbox
when building medium to large scale javascript applications i find it convenient to move all control creation instantiation into a single class were each method is a factory for that control combo box text area button tool tips checkbox etc

1959911
verilog	vhdl	rtl	verilog	rtl	vhdl
the high-level model can then be used as a golden reference to verifiy the register transfer level rtl description which is typically coded in vhdl or verilog

if you get frustrated because something works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie this will happen a lot don t give up

1959968
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for me i develop in firefox then make sure that things are solid on google-chrome safari

1959983
ienumerable	ilist
you can also make children ienumerable and using a backing field that is ilist but then you need to tell nhibernate how to access the backing field

1959985
opera	firefox
various versions of firefox opera and

1960000
min	max
so its advantage for x true wrt the expression form is 4.8 to 8.1 nanoseconds it s quite fair to restrict this latter interval estimation to 6.3 to 6.8 nanoseconds comparing min min and max max instead of min max and max min as the wider more prudential estimate does

1960075
ubuntu	linux
i am currently testing on linux using ubuntu 9.10

1960101
put	get
the main thing i think is to get the normal product s application code out of the test and put in some test code instead

1960165
put	get
first block elements had to be put inside td elements in order to get z-index working in several browsers

1960182

1960249
pop-up	dialog
when finishing system booting it always pop-up a dialog resolveactiivty for choose preferred activity for this intent.

1960258
jobs	cron
ruby does however have a gem named whenever to make easier the declaration and deployment of new cron jobs

1960285
min	max
a way to determine typical size is to run some tests using various data sets and collect stats for starting size number of reallocations and min max memory usage for your data

1960300
uilabel	uitextview
using a uilabel and a uitextview w number keyboard i want to achieve an atm like behavior of letting the users just type the numbers and it is formatted as currency in the label

1960329
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
i m not that an md5 is the best way to store passwords i think the general accepted practice is to use a hash and a salt check out the way restful_authentication or authlogic does it for best practices

1960335
spaces	delimiter
so to do this in java read the file in one line at a time with a filereader or something and split on spaces or whatever other delimiter you want to use - each word is a term

1960372
innodb	myisam
make sure your tables are myisam not innodb

1960445
client-side	server-side
the client-side application is a flex application and communicate with server-side java application using blazeds

1960447
struts	wicket	struts	stripes	wicket	stripes
now as i said i can already hear voices saying things like java ee is heavy use spring instead learn struts or wicket or stripes for the presentation layer learn hibernate for persistence or not because i don t like orm use ibatis or straight jdbc instead you ll see it s cool with spring spring is so cooool and use tomcat and why not jetty or jboss or just forget all this and go for grails and bla bla bla...

1960453
post	put
put or post request and the representation is in the right format but it doesn√¢ t make

1960518
rss	feed
i am making a dynamic image that parses off of an rss feed

1960574
rss	feed
you may even need to provide additional characters to trim second argument in order to cover extended characters embedded in the rss feed

1960610
jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	jboss	resin	glassfish	geronimo	glassfish	resin	geronimo	resin
tomcat jboss openejb glassfish jetty resin geronimo etc

ntlm should work fine kerberos is the latest technology n it is recommended to use kerberos

1960747
turbogears	repoze.who
i m using turbogears 2.1 and repoze.who what and am having trouble figuring out how to extend the basic authentication functionality

1960761
memcpy	memset
during feedback directed optimizations the expected block size the memcpy memset and bzero functions operate on is discovered and for cases of commonly used small sizes specialized inline code is generated.

1960779
next	except
tr n next fastest except for long average line lengths

1960784
jcl	rexx
can we pass arguments to a rexx program from jcl

1960787
int	chars
i thought about printing on screen the chars read in the variable c before i get the error so i can understand in which part of the read file is the error located but this is an int

1960794
feof	fgetc
you should call feof or ferror to determine why fgetc is returning no more data

1960796
int	chars
to get a chars from an int use chars some_int and to output a chars use f putc or printf c some_int

1960825
put	get
...you ll get an error if you put the bracket around the and part of a between statement

1960829
webkit	gecko
describe how to set opacity and how will it appear in gecko webkit and ie

1960932
post	get
the slashes are automatically added when data comes from post or get

1960938
pop-up	dialog
while download will pop-up a dialog to save that file on your disk

1960991
memcpy	memmove
using memcpy when source and destination overlap can lead to undefined behaviour - in those cases only memmove can be used

1960991
memcpy	memmove
but what if i know for sure buffers don t overlap - is there a reason to use specifically memcpy or specifically memmove

1960996
memcpy	memmove
memcpy doesn t have any special handling for overlapping buffers so it lacks some checks therefore it is faster than memmove

1960996
memcpy	memmove
also on some architectures memcpy can benefit from using cpu instructions for moving blocks of memory - something that memmove cannot use

1961005
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
you might want to look into the domnodeinserted event for firefox opera safari and the onpropertychange event for ie

1961069
post	get
how to get value of the get or post variable on page load using javascript

1961075
post	get
you can t get the value of post variables using javascript although you can insert it in the document when you process the request on the server

1961121
memcpy	memmove
it s quite possible though unlikely that the person who wrote memmove for your particular compiler was a certified genius while the poor soul who got the job of writing memcpy was the village idiot -

1961121
memcpy	memmove
although in reality i find it hard to imagine the memmove could be faster than memcpy i don t discount the possibility

1961136
daemons	launchd
if you re looking to build such a thing on os x look up daemons and launchd .

1961168
disk	ram
the length of offline time more specifically if there s a reboot of the app determined whether your cache will be saved on disk or can be trusted to ram

1961185
post	get
i believe one of the best ways of coping with this problem is by accessing values of get and post cookie session etc arrays through a class

1961192
put	get
i want to put 1000 entities into my app engine server production server but i get timeout errors and also 500 server errors

1961200
width	height
is there a way to set the height width css properties to something like that 100 - 50px

1961231
width	height
i know the exact width height and location of each control

1961231
width	height
the width and height property of the window is including the borders

1961231
width	height
how can i set the inner width and height of the window

1961231
width	height
the client width and height

1961231
width	height
if i set the width and height of the window to 300 then the borders take up anywhere from 5 - 15px and only 285 or so pixels are available for the client area where you can add controls

1961237
memcpy	memmove
assuming a sane library implementor memcpy will always be at least as fast as memmove

1961237
memcpy	memmove
however on most platforms the difference will be minimal and on many platforms memcpy is just an alias for memmove to support legacy code that incorrectly calls memcpy on overlapping buffers

1961237
memcpy	memmove
both memcpy and memmove should be written to take advantage of the fastest loads and stores available on the platform

1961275
hide	show
for show and hide tabs i used this jquery code

1961286
put	get
i agree with the other answers that resource that you put is not required to be the same as the one that you later get

1961342
width	height
the issue is how to calculate the correct width height

1961342
min	max
i want to resize #frame so that it were like min size of #container max size of #frame size of #content

1961425
post	put
your most obvious choices would be to put the coordinates in the query string or in a post request

1961485
havok	physx
havok definitely uses this i think it s an option in bullet but i m not sure about physx

1961522
hash	salt
that is i take a hash of a unique code attached to each image plus some salt and pass the first few characters of that hash to the user for confirmation during retrieval

1961534
width	margin
then your third div will not float but you ll set its left margin to the width of the left column its right margin to the width of the right column

1961543
folder	directory
i have a folder in my home directory which is used as the eclipse workspace for the project

1961551
getter	setter
the compiler actually creates a private backing variable and a simple getter and setter as in your first example

1961551
getter	setter
if all you re doing is creating a getter and setter and nothing actually happens when either occurs then the concise syntax is a good option

1961621
groupbox	panel
replace the container by the name of yours it may be a form a panel a groupbox

1961633
getter	setter
getter setter wraps up an underlying data store

1961641
yacc	bison
there are many parsing rules that cannot be parsed by a bison yacc parser for example distinguishing between a declaration and a function call in some circumstances

1961641
yacc	bison
yacc and bison are lalr 1 parser generators which are not sophisticated enough to handle c++ effectively

1961646
sequence	permutation
permutation of a long sequence can

1961646
sequence	permutation
nevertheless factorials which count the permutation of a sequence of length n also grow pretty fast

1961646
sequence	permutation
the mersenne twister for example might be able to produce all permutation of a sequence of length 2080 but definitely not of one of length 2081 or higher

1961646
sequence	permutation
were it not for the lifetime of the universe issue the docs worry about even rather small len x would be justified -- we know that many possible permutation can never be reached by shuffling with such a pseudo-rng as soon as we have a reasonably long sequence so one might worry about what kind of bias we re actually introducing with even a few shuffles

1961714
vsts	tfs
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions

1961729
getter	setter
after a while you can start using hide method on the getter and setter

1961749
qgraphicsitem	qobject
qgraphicsitem is not a qobject and cannot send signals nor receive slots

1961752
hash	md5
3 million strings - 3 million md5 hash

1961752
hash	md5
a good solution will include a bash perl script that takes a list of strings from stdin and outputs a list of their md5 hash

1961774
hash	md5
it s not hard to do in c or perl or python using any of the many md5 implementations -- at its heart md5 is a hash function that goes from a character vector to a character vector

1961775
fadein	hide
i tried several variations of this including hide .show and .fadeout fadein and just setting the opacity seems to have the fewest ill effects flicker changing page height etc.

1961776
hash	md5
to get better performance you would probably need to use a different program or create a c program that calls one of the publicly available md5 hash apis

1961794
post	get
when you post a form the only thing that will get passed to your post action are controls

1961805
hide	show
i am trying to create a way to show and hide a number of different elements on my page depending if the user is logged in or not

1961824
debian	centos
b debian to centos should work just fine

1961864
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
you will need something which can periodically run jobs for you like a cron daemon or windows task scheduler

1961894
cvs	svn
most commonly small companies currently use cvs or svn and there s nothing bad in that in fact i d be really worried if no version control was really used at all

1961894
cvs	svn
we currently use cvs and are looking into mercurial but we ve found that the following works as a good set of conventions when working with cvs and i d suspect svn too

1961894
cvs	svn
this is mainly because in cvs and svn branching just doesn t work as expected and it becomes an exercise in futility to maintain any more than two living branches head and any secondary branch over time

1961894
jar	war
we soon came to realize that these extra steps are completely useless since by using ant - by the way you can invoke ant tasks directly in hudson - we could tell the jar war building step to ignore everything by either file name say everything that ends with test or testcase or by source folder

1961894
maven	m2e
this has worked tremendously well and doesn t require any additional support or plugins from any of ides out there which is a great plus - number two reason we didn t choose maven was seeing how m2e basically took over eclipse

1961898
post	get
never pass them in hidden form fields via post or get

1961918
inherited	subclassing
create a subclassing that inherited from the library s class and implement reference-counting in the subclassing

1961922
hide	show
if you are using the standard cflogin built into coldfusion you can show hide elements by checking for a logged in user

1961948
int	chars
is there a faster way in r to turn a list of chars like c 12313 21323 into an int list like c 12313 21323 other than writing a for-loop myself

1961966
directx	gdi
after that you may have to look at using gdi or directx to get closer to the hardware

1962006
postgresql	mysql
support differs between oracle 10g+ sql server 2000+ postgresql mysql 5.1+ so we d need more information before recommending a specific one

1962032
put	get	integer	unsigned
if you put u or d in it would still work and you would get out the number represented as an unsigned integer in based 10 or a signed integer in base 10

1962074
getter	setter
doing this seems to reduce everything a player does to itself as a series of getter and setter or am i just wrong here

1962074
getter	setter
i ve read countless times that a class that exposes everything as a series of getter setter indicates a pretty poor abstraction being used as a data structure instead of a class

1962084
inherited	properties
well if you want to add another properties to the datetimepicker you will have to create your own control implementation that inherited datetimepicker

1962092
folder	directory
ok so i have a directory in my root folder called pages in which i keep all my pages that i include thru index.php

1962142
directx	gdi
directx bypasses everything and talks directly to the device driver thus gdi and other usual methods won t work - unless aero is disabled or unavailable all that appears is a black rectangle at the top left of the screen

1962205
getter	setter
i advise you not to fear the fact that player will be a class of getter and setter

1962228
srp	principles
in fact i d argue that s the whole point of principles like the srp - not to make it easy to design everything beforehand but to make it easy to change things as your requirements grow and change shape because you can t predict everything beforehand

1962249
getter	setter
ide netbeans for php php html css - auto-completion insert getter setter u dont have that in eclipse

1962251
put	get
now it takes some time before i get the result not instantly so i put in the return false at the bottom preventing the form to submit before i get the .post results back and do something with it

1962299
pop-up	dialog
i have a jquery dialog modal box pop-up for logging into my website

1962324
pull	push
then you can pull from them and push to your own repository

1962336
base	fractions
you want the standard posixt type from base r that can be had in compact form as a posixct which is essentially a double representing fractions seconds since the epoch or as long form in posixlt which contains sub-elements

1962346
maya	blender
i have designed several bits of these 3d objects in blender and also am aware of other programs with which to do this maya etc. however i am unsure how to use c++ to display these objects much less manipulate them in response to changing variables

1962359
post	get
there was also an option to have this automatically added to all local links as get and form targets as post

1962390
children	parent
windows only get the parent flag when they have children not because you tell them to

1962425
mouse	keyboard

note- this is for firefox opera google-chrome safari

1962584
jndi	jta
this will require some knowledge of your application server as the jndi location of the jta transactionmanager is specific to each j2ee server

1962584
jboss	glassfish
you should maybe consider moving to a j2ee app server like jboss or glassfish

1962628
filesystems	ntfs
this may be a starting point to extending ntfs in the way that the gmail filesystems used to do windows nt reparse points

1962683
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to latest versioning of rails and installs active support from gems and i still get the same error

1962727
firefox	safari
using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs

1962851
httphandler	httpmodule	isapi	httpmodule
in iis6 isapi filters extensions were analogous to httpmodule httphandler

1962851
isapi	httpmodule
in terms of httpmodule they cannot deliver the exact same functionality as isapi filters

1962878
hide	show
to do what you want you will want to use dom elements like a div and show then hide it after a specified time

1962928

1962963
getattr	setattr
setattr getattr is for attribute access mc.aa

1963012
jms	jta
jta is also used for managing transactions across systems like jms and jca but that s fairly exotic usage for most of us

1963046
rtp	sip
by the way i ve even used conferencexp video rtp part with rtc 1.3 voice sip features together to improve video quality so you have wide choice of managed technologies here

1963079
width	height
just make sure that you don t have any width or height attributes in the image

1963149
vim	gedit
i tried many editors ides mainly gedit vim radrails with a couple of plugins

1963149
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
all i have found for gedit vim never tried emacs actually i cannot remember anyone using emacs for ruby development are plugins doing completion based on phrases in the same file

1963193
apache	nginx
it is deployed on nginx proxied with apache which handles the django app via wsgi

1963193
chunked	transfer-encoding
the j2me transfers the file with transfer-encoding set as chunked and content length set to zero

1963193
apache	nginx
the problem is that neither nginx nor apache allow zero content length chunked data and give back http 411 error response

1963193
apache	nginx
few solutions on net suggest recompiling nginx and apache but i don t want to go into that

1963222
client-side	server-side
client-side and server-side validation simply serve a different purpose respectively enhancing usability for the user and guarding logic and security of your service

1963241

for example the code linked to by zoran will accidentally submit the form on enter press in a which wouldn t normally happen and won t catch ie s behaviour of submission the form for enter press on other non-field content in the form

1963312
ubuntu	debian
this would also need to be deployed to multiple machines running ubuntu 9.x and debian lenny so it should be simple to install

1963327
post	get
this way you could see how the received data looks like and you d know if it s passed in post or in get

1963406
hide	fadeout
for example the function below will hide the element with the class hideme then once the fadeout effect is complete the callback function removes the element from the page and dom

1963407
serializable	deserialization
i think the serializable deserialization is the easiest way to do this

1963411
google-chrome	firefox
i need a browser-independent way that works in google-chrome firefox

1963493
for-loop	loops
on isolating the error i found that if the second for-loop is not run for the last iteration i mean like in the sample test case n 5 so i run loops only till i 3 instead of i 4 then it doesn t crash and produces the expected output

1963535
post	get
i presume that you re relying on this being populated from the incoming get post data most likely via the depreciated register_globals which is bad practice

1963538
paperclip	minimagick
i ve come across rmagick minimagick paperclip attachment_fu attribute_fu imagescience

1963550
width	height
width and height are the size of the screen in windowed mode not the windows

1963582
put	get
when i put into my app i get this

1963587
opera	firefox
if then to come to look through ie opera firefox that has varied of nothing.

1963630
client-side	server-side
if you still want to serve the xml to normal users and have them perform the xslt transform client-side then you would need some server-side logic to identify the google bots and only performs the transform to return html for google requests

1963655
min	max
select rowmin min rowid rowmax max rowid from tblt

1963672
appfuse	spring
i am looking for feedback from experienced users on spring roo and appfuse

1963677
int	chars
astnode reserves nodetype which specifies given node s type i.e int op or chars and type we don t need to concern other types the other members are left and right pointers and finally we store

1963679
hide	show
i have a loadingstatus function that has two options show or hide

1963679
hide	show
the show triggers to display when the jquery post is made the hide happens after the response comes back

1963679
hide	show
how can i have my show hide function work together to make sure at minimum the show was displayed to the user for at least 1 2 second

1963683
hide	show
you can perform this math either inside your callback or within the savebanner function itself within the show portion you would set the starting time within the hide portion you would check the difference and set the settimeout

1963690
rss	feed
well i would think you would need to do that to get the partial image url and then append the baes url from the original server unless the url in the rss feed is the full url to the image

1963696
int	chars
null checks when printing the int and chars nodes

1963709
wufoo	jotform
pragmatic approach would be using google spreadsheet s feature called forms paid services from wufoo or jotform

1963745
free	malloc
when programming in c i often use malloc to allocate memory and free to release it

1963766
free	malloc
the only thing that matters to free is getting the exact same address as what malloc returned

1963794
free	malloc
for the case of malloc the heap allocator stores a mapping of the original returned pointer to relevant details needed for free ing the memory later

1963794
free	malloc
attempting to free any pointer with a value different to those returned by previous malloc s and as yet unfreed is an error

1963794
free	malloc
it is not possible to partially free memory regions returned from malloc

1963798
free	malloc
your code calls malloc in one routine stores the pointer somewhere and eventually calls free in a different routine

1963875
addition	modulo
in both cases addition is performed modulo the array size and make sure to increment the other index when needed that is when the queue is full or empty

1963877
range	infinity
it s value range lies between 0 and positive infinity in theory

1963902
post	get
you can either submit the values with a classic post or get or via ajax but you have to wire up a server-side action that processes that input

1963938
post	get
requestscope contained the post headers sent from browsers and the get arguments

1963955
base-class	subclassing
when you specify a member function as virtual there is a chance that you may try to use subclassing via a base-class polymorphically at run-time

1963994
postgresql	mysql
you can use my online database code-generator to generate sql server ddl scripts and oracle mysql postgresql ... from uml models

1964055
postgresql	mysql	disk	ram
you don t really have a variety of choices here you can cache them in ram using something like memcached or push them to disk reading and writing them with a databsae rdbms like postgresql mysql or dod like couchdb

1964067
children	parent
all children to the top level menu items collected under their parent objects

1964082
int	chars	int	double
now the pointer ptr may point to an int or an array of int it may point to a single chars or array of chars it may point to a single double number or an array of double etc

1964092
post	get
you can only encode get values in the url and not post parameters

1964123

how can i set width and height of a jface listviewer

1964237
ddms	adb
you can always download the database file using ddms or adb pull and use a desktop sqlite client to examine it

1964246
free	malloc
you either need to malloc free the pixel buffer or better yet use stack

1964246
free	malloc
malloc free

1964250
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it should also demonstrate their ability to write cross-browser compatible code just open their examples in ie firefox opera safari google-chrome

1964281
folder	directory
you can then reference that external directory from within your project with a linked folder

1964282
post	get
but you can get things out of the query string if you post the form via get

1964295
post	get
javascript is running at client side so if your want to get the text area s value before post your page to serve use this

1964310
keydown	keyup
check out the form.keypreview property it will allow you to trap all keydown keyup and keypress events at the form level before allowing them to be processed by individual elements

1964327
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the pages of the web app will have some data grids some with link columns input boxes labels dropdownlistfor checkbox radio button and submit action button

1964344
width	height
the problem is i want background images for header and footer that are not getting displayed until i specify a height and width for them.moreover the height and width specified in the css inside the #header and #footer have to match the exact dimension of the original images which are dimensionally large otherwise the images are not being displayed properly parts of them get cut

1964398
g++	gcc
the default installation prefix is usr local which is why make install put gcc and g++ binaries into usr local bin etc

1964436
serializable	deserialization
performance - dcs was tweaked specifically to be as fast as possible since wcf relies heavily and frequently on object serializable deserialization - that s one of the reasons that the dcs doesn t support attributes on xml nodes either

1964454
formview	detailsview	objectdatasource	detailsview	objectdatasource	formview
i m wondering are detailsview formview and objectdatasource have enough capability for inserting editing your records or not

1964495
width	height
if you want the images to automatically scale you will need to use an img tag for each image and set the width height to 100

1964495
width	height
that means if you want the images to scale according to the size of the browser window you ll need to set the parent container s width height to be a percentage and not a fixed pixel width height

1964502
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have used this successfully in firefox ie opera and safari haven t needed to test in google-chrome

1964511
folder	directory
to be more specific i have one directory the backup folder which i constantly update using findfirstchangenotification

1964514
sorting	grouping
you could create a sorting table the more sanely grouping the characters like

1964520
postgresql	mysql
you might see for mysql postgresql sqlite to use in applications for example to archive my books

1964533
hudson	phpundercontrol
phing or ant can be called from an continous integration system like phpundercontrol or hudson on a regular basis so you get regular automated feedback

1964574
openssl	libcrypto
or use the openssl libcrypto

1964588
free	malloc
afaik free usually doesn t take much time but malloc can take a lot of time if memory is fragmented

1964623
free	malloc
ok well i tried to replace the malloc free with new delete and that had no effect on the speed

1964643
free	malloc
you could turn these into a single malloc free call althought that would make the code less clear and harder to mantain

1964650
opencv	emgucv
i want to make an apps detect an square rectangle in my webcam using emgucv an opencv wrapper

1964650
width	height
if it s posible i would like to obtain the width and height of the square rectangle

1964697
onenote	ms-office
george writing a question uses word excel or onenote to create content and then inserts the content into the question area probably copying it into the clipboard and then using some paste from ms-office widget

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
and jta capable application server means a real j2ee container or a non j2ee container like tomcat with a standalone transaction manager like atomikos jotm bitronix simplejta jbossts or geronimotm jencks

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
fwiw i ve seen lots of complains about jotm i think that geronimotm jencks lacks of documentation i can t really say anything about jbossts arjunats except that it s a rock solid product simplejta and bitronix have both good documentation and atomikos is an impressive product greatly documented too

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
personally i d choose bitronix or atomikos

1964701
jboss	glassfish
or consider using a real j2ee container like jboss or glassfish as i wrote in a previous answer

1964722
boost	allocator
having one big memory pool shared by all factories of one game representation using something like boost pool with some adapter functions that way i ve got all the game objects memory allocated together and can have one bit allocator for a game that i already know the total size it s not always the case

1964731
implements	modifiers
multiple texts say that when implements double-checked locking in .net the field you are locking on should have volatile modifiers applied

1964735
webclient	httpwebrequest
since webclient is implemented on top of httpwebrequest you can do everything with httpwebrequest that you can with webclient albeit with more code

1964772
boost	allocator
when testing performance of boost pool test not only allocator but also deallocation

1964796
strstr	strcmp
even if you wanted to create strstr which is a c function and not a c++ function you really don t need to avoid using strcmp

1964804
put	get
so i could put the selectedindex in a hidden input before submitting the form and then get that selectedindex and set it with a javascript function.

1964833
free	malloc
having had a look at the code one big thing that comes to my mind is this - mixture of malloc ... new ... delete ... free ...

1964833
free	malloc
in short you are mixing the c++ s runtime in calling new ... and delete ... with malloc ... and free ...

1964833
free	malloc
why did you use the malloc ... and free ... which is from c in the middle of this c++ code

1964836
allocator	stl
one problem that you ll run into is that stl implementations are allowed to assume that two allocator of the same type are equivalent

1964870
hide	show
this has a few caveats first of all if you have two or more places the loading image can be show you re going to need to kep track of how many calls are running at once somehow and only hide when they re all done

1964871
hide	show
let s create an element that we can show hide anytime we re making an ajax request

1964896
webclient	httpwebrequest
the answer almost certainly is to replace usage of httpwebrequest with webclient and to use the async methods of webclient

1964896
webclient	httpwebrequest
typically the lower-level classes httpwebrequest will use the iasyncresult pattern while the higher-level classes webclient will use the event-based pattern

1964896
webclient	httpwebrequest
so if it s easy to do i d suggest moving to webclient and event handlers instead of httpwebrequest and callback delegates

1964902
rss	feed
creating rss feed in rails is easy

1964902
rss	feed
i need a simple way to password protect the rss feed

1964946
daemons	systemd
see for a discussion of issues keeping the systemd clock accurate via the ntpd 8 daemons

1964950
free	malloc
+1 to malloc free making my eyes hurt in c++

1964950
free	malloc
roll up your malloc calls to one large malloc and free for the x y left right etc structures instead of 12

1965040
portrait	landscape
what is nice is that an image is not needed for the watermark so i set the font size to 96pts and that seemed to work fine in landscape and portrait mode

1965072
post	get
update the solution is to use the http verb post and not get

1965081
libcurl	libssh
now i m pretty sure that mac os x does not ship with libcurl installed and even if it did it most likely wasn t built with libssh which i would also need

1965139
pull	push

1965139
ethernet	wireless
i was planning to use a wifly or wiznet ethernet board in combination with a wireless access hub

1965242

it works fine in portrait mode but fails miserably in landscape mode

1965253
min	max
i want to specify a base value the center of the distribution a standard deviation and a min and max values

1965253
min	max	minimum	max
obviously one can use a loop and only exit if the generated number was between the minimum and maximum but that could go on for a long time if min max are too close together or too far out along a tail

1965277
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

the past week or two i ve been studying maven and i like it but there are just a few things that i require ant tasks for rather than maven s complicated and scarcely-documented pom.xml file

1965473
width	height
if i understand your preview function right it is actually already doing exactly that it should be enough to just remove the width and height settings

1965476
robocopy	xcopy
another is to try the robocopy utility which is part of the windows server resource kit and which replaces xcopy in versions of windows above server 2008 r2

1965487
g++	gcc
has anyone seen any numbers analysis on whether or not use of the c c++ restrict keyword in gcc g++ actual provides any significant performance boost in reality and not just in theory

1965526
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i was taught that for arrays length is not retrieved through a method due to the following fear programmers would just assign the length to a local variable before entering a loops think a for-loop where the conditional uses the arrays s length. the programmer would supposedly do so to trim down on function calls and thereby improve performance. the problem is that the length might change during loops and the variable wouldn t

1965537
pop-up	dialog
question 4 if someday i manage to make the applet work in a browser will the java security warning dialog pop-up every time the application tries to read text from disk

1965541
int	double
however when i changed those int s to double s which is what python would probably do i got this

1965541
division	multiplication
i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using integers division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2

1965646
versioning	upgrade
.net last i checked has versioning issues that might force the user to have to upgrade but maybe this problem can be avoided by developing against an older versioning

1965655
boost	stl
it s not practical to use stl or boost for any type of video game for starters

1965738
public	protected
the only way i can think to do this is create a public final method in the parent class that the calling code will use and a protected method which will be called by the public final method

1965738
public	protected
the protected method contains the functionality and the public final method validates the return value of the protected method

listview	gridview
i have a simple wpf with a menu a toolbar and a listview in a gridview

1965873
getter	setter
i know that the logic inside the add and remove functions can be inside the setter or getter but the person wanting to add should pass only a single entry object

1965891
swt	nebula
nebula is a place where different eclipse-projects and independent developers collaborate on building custom swt widgets and reuseable ui-components useable in ui-applications built using swt and jface

post	get
if you get user credentials in your iphone app you can then pass them to php using simple post or get request

1966078
fgets	feof
if you are running the above code in a loop when feof returns true no line will be read by fgets and buff will be null but newbuff will be unchanged

1966093

that s very easy for addition multiplication is a bit harder but still possible

1966187
single-quotes	double-quotes
note how i use single-quotes within my double-quotes

1966205
hex	binary
then a gap buffer model is better it is also much better if you don t have lines at all for example when displaying binary files in hex mode

in posix i think you can safely seek past the end of file the idea is that if more data is written later so as to make data go past the position set with lseek you will be able to read more data now

1966285
folder	directory
using executable_path you can use paths relative to your applications executable file and then place the libraries either in your frameworks folder executable_path .. frameworks libcurl.dylib or inside the executable directory executable_path lib libcurl.dylib

ubuntu	linux
i m running a database server in a linux vm ubuntu 9.10 under vmware fusion but coding django on the mac side

1966341
g++	gcc
i couldn t work out how to get the configure script to set g++ as the compiler linker instead of gcc so ended up hacking the makefile with a sed command to do a search replace in my bash build script

1966376
profiling	benchmarking
1 by benchmarking i mean a long-running program that exercises your library outside of a profiling passing it a variety of inputs

1966398
post	get
at this stage i need some advice on how to set up the urls for files that receive both get and post requests

1966413
django	web.py	pylons	cherrypy	web.py	cherrypy	web.py	pylons
my guess is that web service apis with pretty urls aka rest are built via some kind of webframework werkzeug web.py django pylons cherrypy plain wsgi ...

1966420
django	web.py
web.py and django are nice

1966444
jboss	glassfish
jboss richfaces seem pretty good on documentation but i m using glassfish

1966444
richfaces	icefaces
being a jsf web beginner i tried some icefaces mojarra tutorials and had a go at getting richfaces working with nbeans and glassfish but no luck

1966485
richfaces	icefaces
icefaces - also very good an alternative to richfaces

1966485
woodstock	openfaces
rcfaces netadvantage webgalileofaces quipukit blueprints woodstock ilog g4jsf simplica backbase jenia4faces visualwebpack dynafaces ibm impl dinamica openfaces - never heard of those or only saw some of them once or twice probably not that popular and stable after all

1966487
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs
file locking requires a fairly modern filesystems such as ntfs windows ext3 ext4 linux and hfs+ mac

1966491
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried it on 4 computers 2- xp 2- win 7 and i have tried it on google-chrome firefox and several version of ie

1966532
opera	safari
taken from sitepoint.com works in in opera 9.5+ safari 4+ ff3.5+

1966580
strncmp	strcmp
conceptually databases compare character fields just like strcmp strncmp if you prefer from left to right

1966588
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
anything written using firebreath will work on ie firefox google-chrome safari and possibly opera opera doesn t 100 correctly implement npapi

1966607
cvs	svn
i would like to know if there is an option available in vimdiff that automerges the differences in left and right files as long as there is no ambiguity and leaving the conflicted resolutions similar to the tools svn merge and cvs merge tools does

1966618
int	chars
it can still be made more memory efficient by using unsigned chars array rather than using int array to store digits

1966621
post	get
get even if the client does a post

1966621
isapi	httpmodule
rather than creating my own httpmodule i decided instead to use ionics isapi rewrite filter to rewrite my urls

1966681
spaces	delimiter
you should have a common easy to read delimiter if they are all integers then a spaces or comma will work just fine

1966707
invokelater	invokeandwait
it would be great to avoid edt and invokelater or invokeandwait when performing an animation

1966708
restructuredtext	textile
however we want to allow multiple formatting languages markdown textile restructuredtext

1966729
int	chars
the spaces in your example impact that as well - in your example the int with a length of 4 plus the 1 chars for the space means you could have a maximum of 1 600 distinct values

1966729
int	chars
reliable data enforcement - an int column won t allow alphabet chars

1966754
multiplying	add
if step three above said multiplying instead of add then someone would be able to point out the error in the logic without having to debug code

1966878
httpresponse	request
the code would look something like the following but i need a way to pass the object id to the httpresponse request

1966899
margin	height
the margin should have a minimum size of say 10px and should shrink in proportion to the window height

1966899
width	height
i m stuggling with min-height min-width height and width at the moment

1966905
innodb	myisam
i m trying to achieve a cascading update and delete effect in a myisam database similar effect as you can create in innodb tables with foreign keys

1966912
mouseover	mouseout
consider this for a mouseover mouseout situation

1966917
int	chars
chars int long many properties of

1966925
fadein	fadeout
use fadein and fadeout to change the opacity of an element

1966926
integer	unsigned
however assuming that this is 16 bit unsigned data normalised to 1.0 so the values range from 0.0 s 1.0 then all you need to do to expand them to 8bit integer values is to multiply each sample by 255

1966926
range	max
if the range is not 0.0 s 1.0 but 0.0 s max then

1966934
inherited	properties
the page class your page inherited from contains an instance properties request

1966947
getter	setter
i m assuming it would make use of designmode - but i can only find getter and not setter for these properties

1966961
elf	coff
on linux this format is typically elf on windows and older unixes it s coff and on mac os x it s mach-o

1966968
valgrind	callgrind
it depends on callgrind and valgrind as one could have guessed so no special compiler flags required during compile-time

1966981
g++	gcc
you didn t indicate what gcc version you are using but if it is a recent enough one 4.0.0 and above me thinks you should try the --with-sysroot flag to g++ ld

1967038
pull	push
hooks triggers -- doing things on push pull including quality no tabs allowed etc. filters

1967063
google-chrome	firefox
similar functionality exists for both google-chrome and firefox as well

1967077
client-side	server-side
what if you could store these common chunks and combine them either client-side or server-side to dynamically generate content

1967129
ubuntu	linux
right now i m using heyu with a cm11a under linux ubuntu

1967152
config	ini
except its not in ini format because it doesn t contain but just key which chokes config ini

1967189
switching	screens
on small screens i simply like to use ctrl-m to switching the editor to fullscreen mode and back without the need of minimizing single views or move them around

1967210
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i have a qtreeview subclass and qabstractitemmodel subclass which has a nice horizontal header

1967210
qtableview	qtreeview
but unlike qtableview which has separate vertical setverticalheader and horizontal headers sethorizontalheader qtreeview only allows a single header setheader

1967219
min	max
each has a different algorithm for how you get the min and max and the actual code involves some bit twiddling and in the case of floating point you have to loop unless you have a known integer type that is the same size as the float type

1967219
min	max
the min is when all bits are 0 s the max is when all bits are 1 s

1967219
min	max
for signed the min is when the sign bit is set but all of the other bits are zeros the max is when all bits except the sign bit are set

1967226
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you actually go through the entire article not just the top it allows a single font-face statement to cover ie firefox safari opera google-chrome and possibly others

1967226
put	get
working from that base font squirrel put together a variety of useful tools including the font-face generator which allows you to upload a ttf or otf file and get auto-converted font files for the other types along with pre-built css and a demo html page

1967251
public	protected
you don t specify public private or protected

1967257
gtk	cairo
i m writing an open source program key-train in python and gtk with cairo and i would like to use some more attractive fonts

1967296
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
one easy way is to write the string seperately to a dataoutputstream wrapping a bytearrayoutputstream then close he dataoutputstream and get the backing byte array from the baos and see how long it is

1967343
ftp	telnet
ftp like telnet should be avoided

1967361
ubuntu	linux
my files are on a remote ubuntu linux server

1967388
rss	feed
how is http authentication any different on rss feed than other controller actions

1967394
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	tomahawk	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	trinidad	richfaces	tomahawk	richfaces	icefaces	richfaces	trinidad	icefaces	tomahawk	icefaces	trinidad	tomahawk	trinidad
those component libraries adds just that extra on top of the basic implementation often with more skinning capabilities richfaces icefaces and or ajaxical stuff richfaces icefaces trinidad and or more enhanced specialized components tomahawk primefaces

1967394
websphere	ibm
the ibm components are proprietary and ships with ibm websphere only

1967394
richfaces	tomahawk
you don t need them they re not much better than for example tomahawk or richfaces

1967406
firefox	safari
update i tested on an old powerbook after incorporating pixelbreaker s swfmacmousewheel scripts and found that while the os x version of firefox behaves normally safari 3.2.1 is doubling the events too

1967428
put	get
using the apple s pagecontrol sample code i ve managed to put several uiwebviews side-by-side and i m able to swipe left and right in order to get to each web view

1967434
mp3	wav
is there a way to convert wav files to mp3 in asp.net

1967438
socialauth	pyfacebook
notes on pyfacebook are at least a year out of date and people have pointed me to the socialauth app for django which appears to be equally out of date and focused on targeting users as opposed to their pages

1967466
vb.net	vb6
the same way you learned vb6 and vb.net no doubt

1967529
inherited	properties
both of these types have an actiondescriptor properties but they don t inherited it from a common type or interface that i can find

1967549
launch4j	jsmooth
launch4j - no new development in over a year supports 64 bit but you can t sign the exe created by launch4j so i prefer jsmooth but it does not support 64 bit

1967583
exponent	modulo
if your exponent is low and the value of m e modulo you can just take the eth root of the ciphertext to decrypt

1967585
put	get
here is the most reasonable code i have come across to get the job done so far but i don t know how to put it into practice or whether it can accomplish what i need

1967628
hex	binary
hex is a way of displaying binary data

1967640
formview	detailsview
if you have a large form detailsview allows you to specify fields and allows the control to do the work you simply specify the data and detailsview handles the form but of course with a custom ui the formview is the way to go and yes it can be tedious to have to create large forms.

1967695
freetype	cairo
you might want to take a look at this feature request it shows a work-a-round if using cairo and freetype for the backend

1967729
pop-up	dialog
you dont have enough room for the textbox its only about 1 8 of an inch wide i would somehow like the textbox to pop-up above the table maybe in a small dialog or something so i have more width to allow someone to enter longer text

1967735
g++	gcc
if you want a free alternative i have cegcc that is a gcc gnu c compiler and g++ gnu c++ compiler to compile windows mobile programs

1967747
submit	submission
i imagine there are ways you could automate a series of commands like typing in a field hitting tab typing tabbing etc. but to achieve the end result of submission the information to the server it probably would be faster and easier to just submit the http post using a tool like curl

1967749
children	parent
some browsers limit to 4096 and split longer texts into multiple text node children of the parent element

1967794
hide	show
some of the pages contain slidedown sections with trigger text - clicking this text show hide the slidedown section below it

1967835
rss	feed
i ve been looking at some different options for reading rss feed in .net

1967858
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the latest versions of firefox safari google-chrome and opera all support the nth-of-type pseudo-element but ie does not yet it is a css 3 feature which ie does not support much of

1967862
gif	png
is it gif png jpg and under the 800 kilobyte limit set by the api

1967867
rss	feed
given that rss is stateless it doesn t know when you last requested the feed and therefore couldn t provide which items in the current feed are new or not compared to the last time you queried the feed

1967876
udp	tcp
with tcp being so easy you need a compelling reason to bother with udp

1967882
free	malloc
i know that a new should match a delete and a malloc with a free

1967886
popupwindow	pop-up
invoke the popupwindow by inflating the layout xml and assign the appropriate parent view to the pop-up

1967901
textarea	textbox
you would probably want to handle keyup for textbox textarea and select elements change for select elements and probably focus on everything

1967902
free	malloc
new delete call the constructor destructor of the associated object unlike malloc free

1967936
portrait	landscape
my suggestion would be to rotate the video so that if it was being played in landscape and the device was turned to portrait it would be oriented correctly

1967960
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
realloc like free should only be used with memory allocated by malloc

1967960
free	malloc
see what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

1967960
free	malloc
basically new uses the free store while malloc uses the heap

1967978
accelerometer	gyroscope
i m now however in a position where i need to make use of some third-party sensors which i ve purchased from hitechnic such as an accelerometer a gyroscope and a 3d compass - to mention a few

1968002
textarea	textbox
it fires when you select text within a textbox or textarea

1968002
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome you have to hit the enter key to trigger change

1968010
antlr	parser-generator
antlr is a parser-generator but there are grammars for java available

1968063
getter	setter
if you test this function at a higher level then you just need to make certain you are testing all possible situations for this setter but testing the getter part is pointless

1968162
formview	detailsview
still there are some points to remember if you have forms with lots of controls and you need them interact with each other you need to consider playing around the straight ways of formview detailsview

1968175
integer	fractions
you can get the number of seconds as a integer whole number by dividing the milliseconds by 1000 to convert it to seconds then converting the result to an integer this removes the fractions part representing the milliseconds

1968180
post	get
i want to send xml file with userid and password over https and then send all other xml file on http using post method and get the response as a xml file back

1968226
wxpython	pyqt
go pyqt gtk or wxpython if you want the features seen in the screen-shot above

1968235
serializable	deserialization
using a web service a wcf web service you ll get serializable deserialization an infrastructure and an ability for a client to easily consume your service

1968266
mxmlc	compc
i was earlier using mxmlc but on googling i found that for compiling libraries we have to use compc

1968290
button	checkbox
i have a .net 2.0 application with several types of controls checkbox button etc that i need to enable or disable them according the kind of license that the user bought

1968314
post	get
you can use get or post to pass the data from one to another

1968321
rss	feed
if the site provides an rss feed which you ll find in the tag use the fielded information from that instead

1968345
division	multiplication
it s also probably faster than the code posted by kingnestor because it s all multiplication and division no square roots

1968421
alloca	calloc
in this case you could allocate storage with calloc alloca or with a raii approach

1968421
free	alloca	free	calloc	alloca	calloc
using calloc alloca has the big advantage that you don t have to care about calling free because the allocated memory is automatically free when the local scope is left

1968421
alloca	calloc
edited use alloca instead of calloc

1968430
mouse	keyboard
here is a library for simulating keyboard and mouse activities

1968432
wordpress	joomla
not looking for cms s like drupal wordpress joomla etc

1968439
maven	cargo
if you strongly want to automate with maven installation of jogl you can try use maven-antrun-plugin or create own maven plugin that handles installation a good example is cargo that downloads servers and unpack it

1968521
post	get
first php runs at the server prepares the html and js and gives it to the client then at clients computer javascript runs if javascript needs something from server it calls the server again either post get or ajax doesnt matter it is still a http request

1968532
internationalization	translation
the standard way of adding internationalization in webos is to use the l function where i can set a key to the translation string

1968535
mouse	keyboard
this will clear the textarea on focus using mouse click or keyboard

1968580
user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
otherwise you an create a new tabitem manually with your user-controls as its child and add it in tabcontrol instead of adding data items

1968588
kde	gnome
linux imlib gdk-pixbuf gnome gtk qt image kde qt should be able to do what you need

1968592
children	parent
the proper way seems to have a configurationsection as the parent and configurationelement as each children

1968672
yacc	lemon
i would dare to say that if parsing is so prominent in your task you might benefit from using a parser generator lex yacc antlr lemon ...

1968718
apache	nginx
if it s just static html you may want to look into setting up some form of server side includes such as apache ssi or nginx ssi

1968743
client-side	server-side
i recommend you using unified server-side and client-side validation using a framework since it may avoid confronting the user to data valid on client side but rejected by the server or the opposite client side too restrictive

1968746
hash	md5
website authorizes the user and set cookie visible in website domain with user name password md5 hash and sometimes other information

1968766
jobs	cron
quartz.net supports clustering and database persistence out-of-the-box and has powerful means to schedule jobs using cron like expressions interval triggers and exclusion advices

1968769
magento	joomla
it may be interesting for you to check out the following discussion on two existing ecommerce solutions magento eav and joomla regular relational structure

1968805
put	get
later in the .m file when i try to access that variable using the debugger when i put the mouse on that variable i get the message like out of scope and than i continue to debug the program at the end it will crash and give error like exc_bad_access

1968815
union	distinct
first get a distinct list union of the ids so that you include all then left join to add the values together

1968820
for-loop	loops
well you could replace one for-loop with a foreach loops or maybe use the that does the same internally but ultimately linq is a query syntax hence the q not a mutation syntax and it isn t usually very beneficial to try to represent the updates via an anonymous method lambda

1968825
post	get
well post is basically the same as get just some random chunks of info client sended to server

1968825
post	get
mvc is not the model of everything and it doesn t say how to treat post or get requests

1968833
comparator	icomparer
alternatively you can specify an implementation of the icomparer t generic interface by using a constructor that accepts a comparator parameter

1968921
hash	salt
you should even apply a random salt that is stored with the hash password usually as a prefix string so that the same password can t even be identified across sites or accounts

1968923
hash	salt
the default answer is yes hash and salt the passwords in screaming caps

1969032
post	get
for some expert advice on how to deal with indices and how to find out which indices might not get used and when it makes sense to create an index see kimberly tripp s blog post

1969100
public	protected
of course it gets more complex if you need polymorphism and need overrides to still call the method first probably involving a public non-virtual method and a protected virtual method

1969120
addition	multiplication
of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

1969120
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	exponent	addition	multiplication	multiplication	exponent	exponent	addition
parentheses exponent division multiplication addition subtraction

1969127
strcpy	strdup
in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup

1969142
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
that s a rather trivial approach with simply utilizing the system.windows.forms controls openfiledialog and savefiledialog

1969145
opera	firefox
firefox ie opera safri output 54321

1969164
windows	wow64
usually you will be compiling this for a specific environment windows x86 in which case it could not run under linux and would run under the wow64 emulation layer on windows x64

1969171
width	height	children	parent
for a particular node i have properties like height and width like children which is a collection and resides implicitly in the hierarchy of xml and like resources which will also be having some properties and each will be represented by nodes under the parent

1969189
versioning	upgrade
what versioning of .net was your application targeting before the upgrade and now

1969202
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
edit 3 by using the xsd.exe tool instead of the svcutil.exe i created the datacontract class so no handcrafted work here

1969209
hide	show
i agree with tj - z-index is the way to go - using javascript and css html will allow you to hide show this magic floating box above the table

1969260
inherited	properties
but you don t see it by default since textbox doesn t inherited background properties

1969307
opera	firefox
i have a page that s working fine in firefox 3.5.6 but not in ie 7 or opera 10.01

1969339
opera	google-chrome
in opera and google-chrome they are encoded to cookie headers with utf-8

1969347
actionscript	mxml
if not then obviously you ll need an httpservice defined in your mxml and you ll want to have it s result event bound to an actionscript function that changes your dataarr array arraycollection

1969361
ant	maven
how can i use maven features in an ant build

1969361

gwt	icefaces
gwt ext-js the lgpl branch flex or jquery but icefaces still causes nightmares to some of our developers.

1969375
hex	binary
i m just wondering is there a reason why some libraries be it any language use iterative hashing such that the hashed data is encoded in hex and rehashed again instead of rehashing the actual binary output

1969389
post	get
so we know how to do http get and post connections

1969408
facebook	fbconnect
how can i get a limited no of friends from facebook using fbconnect and fql

1969411
int	double
however i am getting an ambiguous match exception presumably because there are a lot of overloaded parse methods each taking a single object string int double etc.

1969420
ready	each
i m too wondering about ide independant projects right now we are all sticked on eclipse - eclipse project files .project .classpath .settings are even commited in the cvs repository in order to have a project fully ready once checked out - but with netbeans supported by sun and running faster and faster with each release and each new jre version the question isn t closed

1969420
ant	maven
my build system is ant launched from eclipse for various small tasks uploading a war on a remote server for example and mainly maven 2 for

1969420
ant	maven
for what i ve seen so far it s seems pretty cool there are various conflict manager for the conflicts dependencies resolutions and you can even write your own conflict manager there is no need to have an additionnal tool installed and configured as ant is running natively under eclipse whereas maven needs a separate plugin - i ve tried the 3 mavens plugins by the way and have found all the three of them buggy

1969451
multibyte	substr
instead of fulltag 0 you may want to use a multibyte substr function

1969463

when i create a category in my cms i want to create its directory folder in an image directory

1969463
folder	directory
can i create a directory or folder with php

naturally you will need to be using innodb not myisam for this to do anything

1969472
ironruby	ironpython
now someone knows about any performance difference between ironruby 1.0 and ironpython 2.6

1969503
put	get
my current solution is really ugly as i need to get the ninject kernel from my mvcapplication and use it to spin up the projectdataprovider class which takes an inoterepository in it s constructor to avoid having to put the inoterepository somewhere in my dto -class

1969522
google-chrome	firefox
tested it in google-chrome and should work in firefox too

1969545

postgresql	mysql
however this scenario is not supported by microsoft linq to sql server only by the devart implementations for oracle mysql postgresql and sqlite

1969641
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1969702
mp3	m3u
the problem is that you are reading not mp3 stream but m3u playlist file

1969707
int	chars
have a look at the memory layout of your structs print out sizeof float sizeof int sizeof chars sizeof md3_frame_header_t etc

1969715
folder	directory
you need to add an image list to your form add a folder icon to it there is one in the borland common files and then associated the image list with the directory treeview and the filetree treeview

1969748
postgresql	mysql
outside of using a transactional engine innodb if you re using mysql or just use postgresql etc. and wrapping the relevant atomic activities there s not a great deal you can do

1969789
explode	substr
for this i ve explode the components of the phrase into individual substr and now i am trying to compare them to the word i am looking for but it doesn t work

1969809
int	double	min	max
are there any asm instructions that can speed up computation of min max of vector of double int on core i7 architecture

1969809
min	max
so i see that max min is possible to do without branching

1969853
set	bag
you have two options you must either add a bag set list to the class owner with cascade-delete

1969860
min	max
where min_max computes min and max of an array of 500 doubles 100 000 times using a naive loop

1969871
min	max
if your are using intel s ipp library you can use the vector statistical functions to calculate vector min max among other things

1969884
maven	pom.xml
i m aware that maven offers a filtering ability which makes it possible to specify the database settings as property inside my pom.xml and reference them inside my hibernate.properties as

1969886
reparsepoint	ntfs
reparsepoint means that there s a reparse point on this directory which causes ntfs to look at some special data that s been stored along with the directory

1969890
innodb	myisam
the difference will be even more apparent if you store the posts in an innodb table instead of a myisam

1969915
getter	setter
synthesize propertyname automates the generation of getter and setter methods

1970037
min	max
since you probably have many of these values there is little value in calculating and recalculating these value spans and factors for every value nor for that matter in passing those min max limits around all the time

1970060
bluetooth	usb
all the libraries i found until now support devices connected via com usb bluetooth infrared but non of them support a direct connection via ip using a com to ip redirector or virtual com port is not an option for us

1970066
joomla	phpbb
if you need user integration for joomla and phpbb you can use jfusion so people logged in joomla will be logged in phpbb

1970066
joomla	phpbb
registered users in joomla will be replicated to phpbb too and vice versa you have to setup jfusion configuration to decide which system is the master

1970068
keydown	keyup
what i usually do is start the timeout on keyup and clear the timeout on keydown or keypress

1970101
mako	genshi
mako jinja genshi all offer a more flexible alternative to django templates

1970113
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery scriptaculous prototype raphaeljs and even css phantasia not in the base distribution combination with an oodb for persistence gemstone provides a lot of why is the current state of the art in php java ruby or c# so much worse

1970114
post	get
does asp.net mvc have any constants for the the strings get and post

1970142
getter	setter
val html methods in jquery act as getter and as setter

1970148
serializable	deserialization
it is just a holder of information using boost variant and some serializable deserialization stuff

1970151
min	max	width	height
maybe you have to manage the scrollpolicy and the max min height width values

1970160
innodb	myisam
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

1970160
innodb	myisam
so when i create a table should i always try to use innodb engine instead of myisam

1970176
innodb	myisam
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational database system

1970200
put	get
and if you want to insist on typing a prefix to get completion put the above in a class

1970203
post	put
you d probably be better off in this case to put a currenttextid on your post table to avoid having to figure out which revision is current an alternative would be a flag on revision but i think a currenttextid on the post will give you easier queries

1970210
innodb	myisam
you could use innodb for your write database transactions but read back from an myisam database which is denormalized

1970210
innodb	myisam
you know you re data is safe with referential integrity from innodb and you can read it as fast as you d like with myisam

1970229
post	get
however when i post the data and use i get the other elements that were there before i dynamically added the jquery code but not the file elements

1970235
freemarker	velocity
pages could be modified using standard jsps or perhaps via apache velocity or freemarker templates

1970238
maven	m2e
i am using eclipse 3.51 maven 2.0.9 java 1.4 with the maven eclipse plugin 2.7 with wtp 2.0 not m2e

1970242
innodb	myisam
myisam is fast but may get currupted easily innodb is slow but is more stable thanks to transactions and foreign keys

1970254
stdout	stderr
this is probably because whiptail uses stdin and stdout to print the input box so you cannot redirect stderr directly to stdout but you need to swap them e.g

1970256
innodb	myisam
taken from mysql - innodb vs myisam

1970258
innodb	myisam
i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search

1970289
width	height
the div needs to be flexible in width and height

1970312
post	put	post	get	put	get
so that means show gets one the record to show index will get all a post will create new put will edit and delete will destroy

1970326
jar	.war
deploy your application as a .zip .war the archive contains your project s jar and all dependent jars

1970331
fiddler	charles
http proxies like fiddler httpwatch or charles are other alternatives

1970337
nonetype	iterable
that s the cause for nonetype object is not iterable because you re trying to iterate over it with for x in all_mods

1970340
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

1970342
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
is it possible in safari google-chrome firefox with firebug or anything else to break at the point any request is made

1970365
put	get
when i put in import statements such as from entries.models import entry i get the models from these apps ignored by syncdb because the imports are circular or when i remove one or both of them i get validation errors

1970377
hash	salt
are the salt and hash values machine specific

1970420
innodb	myisam
people say innodb is not so fast like myisam

1970430
accessor	properties
once you get the hang of it you ll also get a feel for when you need the test and when you don t -- automatic properties accessor for instance don t need to be unit tested imo

1970442
cpython	ironpython
i m using the same test code in cpython and ironpython in cpython it works but i m getting

1970446
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t happen in firefox nor google-chrome

1970470
windows	winpe
by doing this the dialog is not dependent on any other windows files and can be run in winpe 2.0

1970476
youtube	vimeo	vimeo	flickr
the match method looks if there are any sub-string that match the list of providers youtube flickr vimeo etc

1970535
innodb	myisam
for example - select count queries are cheap when run on a myisam table but can be really slow when run on an innodb table

1970535
innodb	myisam
also a lot of people don t configure their installation for innodb performance - especially if they re used to myisam which performs pretty well on a rather default mysql installation

1970535
innodb	myisam
my advice would be to run your own tests by taking a couple of top queries and running them against myisam tables and then innodb versions

1970588
hide	show
after the image is loaded you hide the loading gif and show the image itself

1970598
addition	multiplication
in addition to the other suggestions you might try using integer multiplication as part of the hash function for example

1970610
min	max
better to have a data base table with id min max description fields that you load when your app initializes

1970613
width	height
note height and width should be the size of the loaing image.

1970629
profiling	debugging
the one project that meets all your requirements with the exception of profiling is the excellent django debugging toolbar

1970694
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
consider using a sorteddictionary or a sortedlist instead if you need an ordered map

1970713
put	get
i at first thought it was a package issue so put the three classes in a package but i didn t know enough about packages to get it working

1970741
put	get
if you can t change the json i would put the objects into an associative array using there aid as the key so you can directly get to the objects as needed

1970755
getter	setter
the hydration process is the process of converting a plain boring mysql result set into nice objects having getter and setter

1970764
subtraction	addition
this gets complicated though especially if you want to start overloading operators to support year addition and subtraction

1970801
innodb	myisam
for instance innodb can do row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking

1970805
min	max
after that it was easy enough to join the table to itself using max min and comparisons on the line number to keep the sections together

1970832
debian	linux
i am working with an atmel at91sam9263-ek development board arm926ej-s core armv5 instruction set running debian linux 2.6.28-4

1970832
freebsd	linux
yes i realize that freebsd is not exactly the same as linux but my point is that it doesn t hurt to be carefully sure

1970866
put	get
on the other hand there s a possibility the tcl isn t the problem at all - if you can get at the tcl source put after 1000000 or the like after the tool call

1970868
comparator	comparable
users of the api can then pass in their own classes which implement those interfaces and you code will work on those classes even though they didn t exist yet when it was written such as java.util.arrays.sort being able to sort anything that implements comparable or comes with a suitable comparator

1970903
youtube	vimeo
i was wondering if anyone knew of a way to only allow embed codes like ones from youtube vimeo blip.tv etc

1970904
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

1970931
mouse	keyboard
in this case you need to put the ui thread into a busy wait loop where it calls application.doevents to keep message handling running so the progress bar will work but you need to add a messagefilter that only allows your application to respond to safe events it would allow paint events so your application windows continue to redraw but it would filter out mouse and keyboard messages so that the user can t actually do anything in the proigram while the export is in progress

1970973
jboss	weblogic
as it is written here i presume you needed it in weblogic in order for the oracle driver to participate in xa two-phase commit transactions if that s so i would suggest that you use the native xa datasource that oracle provides oracle.jdbc.xa.client.oraclexadatasource and fetch the datasource from the jndi along with jboss s own transaction manager

1970983
redmine	trac
while requisite pro enforces a standard and that can certainly help you in your task i d certainly second mark on trying to standardize the input by agreement with personnel and using a more flexible tool like trac redmine which both have incredibly fast deploy and setup times especially if you host them from a vm or even a custom one if you can get the management to endorse your project

1971005
hide	show
after viewing the adobe slideshow i think the way i would attempt to get that to work using the android java sdk would be to create a listview object with a transparent background and then dynamically hide show it in that position when the menu button is clicked by setting the view s visibility to visible or gone

1971063
invokelater	invokeandwait
if so i would recommend using invokelater to build the swing components as i have noticed that opera can sporadically crash at start up with invokeandwait

1971084
put	get
if you put in x then you should get y i don t see any issue there

1971133
jstl	taglib
jstl provides pretty everything you need in the core fmt and function taglib

1971257
hide	show
then when you want to hide flowlayoutpanel1 you can just toggle the visible property to hide show it

1971280
awt	swing
awt swing

1971305
post	get
i am trying to get this flash carousel to show up in a wordpress post

1971305
post	put
now here is the code i put in the post i am working on

1971330
for-loop	loops
that means loops control variable is initialized before the for-loop

1971332
for-loop	loops
end of loops iteration so this just means there is no initialisation of anything in this for-loop

1971336
accessor	properties
in each of your data object s properties set accessor test for a change in value and mark the object as dirty

1971339
for-loop	loops
but the value of hole just before the for-loop was already 1 then you can slip this initilization part of loops

1971359
nunit	mstest
i am new to tdd and i know that both have their pro s and con s however i want to know from a simplicity point of view which would be easier mstest or nunit

1971371
mbunit	nunit
i d switch to nunit or personally mbunit later on

1971400
int	double
were num_elements 2 ist an int and kappa is a double but contains only int numbers for example 79

1971405
ubuntu	debian
this complements the answer recommending a virtual to-pdf printer in that it s the more linuxy command line solution all of the tools mentioned are available in debian s and ubuntu s package repository

1971589
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
- has a number of visual clients or rather a number of solutions for integrating svn and git hg bazaar cvs even...

1971601
post	get
i have placed in logic to determine if the requesttype is a post or a get

1971605
superclass	subclassing
if you want a per-subclass counter then declare a map in the superclass with key subclassing s class and value the counter value as suggested by

1971612
bmp	png
one easy way to get a hash sum of just the pixel data would be to convert the jpeg into a 32bit bmp or alternatively into png and to calculate a hashsum from that

1971721
memcached	apc
i know they are several cache systems and php frameworks already out there but my host don t have apc or memcached installed and i m not using any framework for this particular project

1971723
width	height
one way i ve done this is to grab the layer s bounds multiply the bounds width and height by the old and new anchorpoint s normalized values take the difference of the two anchorpoints and apply that difference to the position of the layer

1971795
width	height
it animates the width and or height when a boolean dependencyproperty is toggled

1971814
subtract	add
i don t know how to add subtract 1 hour in oracle dateadd hh... does it in sybase

1971822
multiplying	add
you can iterate over each bucket get it s size bucket_size size_t bucket_num multiplying that by the size of a pair of key and values and add them all up to give you a rough estimate of the memory used

1971834
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox as the main testing platform and google-chrome for mac as the secondary

1971834
google-chrome	firefox
just to be clear google-chrome is showing the textarea 20px down as compared to firefox

1971884
free	malloc
later when the pointer from malloc is passed to free a corresponding diagnostic version of free is called

1971884
free	malloc
diagnostic wrapper functions for malloc can also address other misuses of malloc such as multiple calls to free for same memory block

1971884
realloc	strdup	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc
when wrapping the malloc api one must wrap all of the related functions including calloc realloc and strdup

1971884
free	malloc
if the need arises to code a call to the standard implementation for example the allocated block will be passed to a third-party binary-only library which expects to free the block using the standard free implementation the original function names can be accessed rather than the preprocessor macro by using malloc s -- that is place parentheses around the function name

1971912
ant	maven
i need to execute some ant commands depending on an environment variable passed in as a parameter to the maven build command

1971941
rar	zip
edit i forgot to mention that the files are generally going to be compressed archives zip rar and on occasion jpg images

1971986
postgresql	mysql
im running on postgresql but i suppose the problem is the same on mysql

1972037
getter	setter
workaround rename outlet variable name or rename setter getter methods to be different from kvc notation.

1972039
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing needs to know when particular events occur withing its superclass but there are more than one ways for the superclass to break the news

1972043
for-loop	loops
i would probably give loops index in the second for-loop a more desciptive name like marblesremaining so it s clearer what it is and does not need to be explained by comments

1972048
range	max
it s in that range but it s not evenly distributed unless 90 or nbr divides max rand

1972057
versioning	upgrade
a team responsible for a project that has a reference to the library can decide on both the versioning that they are going to code against and the timing of any upgrade

1972067
nunit	mstest
i ve actually never used mstest myself since i started learning tdd with nunit right away

1972131
jar	war
you are not really providing enough details do you bundle jax-ws or any other jar in the war that could conflict with weblogic s one

1972171
min	max
this is not a trivial project and you may find that a library that already does this would be your best approach but places to start would be mapping attributes to html form components and the min max occues to javascript events

1972173
spaces	delimiter
this last query assumes that you are using a comma as your delimiter and that there is no white spaces in the string

1972203
pull	push
you can then check server side if there are some new notifications and if there are then you ll push it even though it s a pull - to the client and kill the script

1972243
kde	gnome
you need to have they installed but if you re on linux using kde qt is natively installed for default the same for gnome and also the same of cocoa on mac and cocoa-touch on iphone and ipod touch

1972257
jar	manifest.mf
regarding your meta information question sometimes you get some environment information when you unpack the jar and have a look at meta-inf manifest.mf file

1972258
coalesce	isnull
if you want to return non-null data use a null translation function like isnull or coalesce

1972282
post	get
this is common when you have a get and post version of the same action the register and logon actions present in a brand new asp.net mvc project within accountcontroller.cs

1972289
clearance	devise
i suggest clearance or devise if you haven t

1972290
ostream	istream
are istream and ostream instance variables or local variables

1972294
automake	autotools
it s a bit of a steep learning curve but the most common solution for all of these problems is to use the gnu autotools toolchain autoconf and automake specifically

1972294
scons	autotools
there are some alternative build systems that support some similar auto-configuration behavior like cmake and scons that might be worth looking into if autotools feels like too much

1972303
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers google-chrome safari

1972315
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
if anyone can break this down into something i can understand with basic operators + - and functions sin cos sqrt etc. i d really appreciate it

1972317
int	double
the int local is convertible to a double the literal is convertible to a double and obviously they will never be equal

1972318
vb6	vba
vba thus vb6 doesn t have a garbage collector per se but it does use reference counting to automatically clean up after itself

1972334
heapsort	in-place
sort all sets using heapsort for in-place sorting o 1 space

1972336
tabcontrol	tabitem
i need to be able to manipulate different types of configurations in tabs in the same tabcontrol meaning that the content of the tabitem must be dynamically generated

1972336
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a controltemplate called pendantconfigurationtabitemtemplate defined in my window resources and i use the following code to apply the template which contains a named item i need to access to the tabitem and add them to their parent tabcontrol

1972339
pop-up	dialog
i ll assume by dialog you mean a pop-up that is invisible at page load and made visible by say a click on something in the existing html

1972339
hide	show
lastly you can play with the visibility of your popup div with the display none style and the show and hide methods on the widget

1972353
projectile	angle
and the formula on that link will give you the angle you need to launch the projectile in order to hit the target on the coordinate x y

1972371
redmine	bugzilla	redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	trac	bugzilla	trac	mantis	mantis	bugzilla
possible options that i ve heard of so far are bugzilla mantis redmine and trac

1972387
entity-relationship	diagram
in the past i have seen tables related to one piece of functionality represented in one color in the entity-relationship diagram

1972420
next	except
control works fine except that when the user hits tab when inside one of the value text boxes on the right the focus shifts away from my control to the next control in the hiearchy

1972424
post	put
in the future though please put new questions in a new post

1972449
width	height
can you just set your page width to be 3 and your height to 4

1972460
free	malloc
thus a reviewer can glance at the code to make sure that each malloc has a matching free

1972475
integer	fractions
fractions are rounded up to an integer

1972490
std	ostream	ostream	istream
std istream and std ostream respectively

1972501
free	malloc
the simple advantage is this if the programmer un-intentionally introduced a memory leak the warning is there as the adage in c is this for every malloc there should be a corresponding free if you do not have it then you have a leak

1972504
for-loop	arrays
most will prefer the for-loop because that is the familiar way of doing something to every item in arrays in sequence

1972513
cpython	pypy
however the whole point is irrelevant because as mark points out you can always reverse engineer the byte code anyway especially in cases like cpython pypy rubinius yarv tinyrb rubygolightly where the bytecode format was specifically designed to be very close to the source language

1972526
getter	setter
the third option is also considered bad practice since you should not provide getter setter for all of your fields only the ones that need it

1972560
google-chrome	firefox
i have exactly the same problem as you do except i m using ie7 ie takes about 16 seconds to load localhost while firefox and google-chrome loads it in an instant

1972572
versioning	upgrade
all iphones and ipod touches can upgrade the firmware as new versioning become available

1972630
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late

1972630
ironruby	ironpython
however we rarely pin ironruby up against ironpython

1972644
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
the text editors with sharpdevelop and monodevelop may be useful

1972655
inherited	properties
since mouseevent inherited from event you can safely change mouseevent to event in the parameter list of myfunction unless you re using some of the properties of e that belong exclusively to mouseevent your example does not

1972690
daemon	cron
i even restarted the cron daemon

1972695
margin	height
it uses a 100 height and negative bottom margin on the wrapper the negative bottom margin matching the height of the footer

1972703
post	get
where load_f fails to run copy-paste the result of your get post requests from firebug into your text-editor and pour through them with a fine-tooth comb to make sure the json is well-formed

1972727
children	parent
so again i am looking for a way to pass a single instance of pieceloc that lives within the parent class game to two children classes where pieceloc can be directly manipulated without using additional parameters

1972742
lua	scheme
i use scripting languages like lua python or scheme to provide an interface for the user to extend the software

1972748
boost	stl
read sources of boost and stl try to copy and modify some of the code from them that is a good way

1972753
post	get
can someone post an example of how i get an instance variable value that is a double

1972763
jobs	cron
by default cron jobs get a minimal environment which will almost certainly not have the full path and a host of other environment variables that your login sessions have

1972763
jobs	cron
from a login session to get the full environment then make sure that my cron jobs execute that script before attempting to do the real work

1972818
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
so you loop down the digits and every time you multiplying the value so far by 10 subtract 0 from the current character and add it

1972918
concave	convex
i love that there is no real trigonometry required and it works for convex and concave and it performs reasonably well as the number of sides increases

1972971
pop-up	dialog
if you want to act like software usually acts and pop-up a modal dialog that says

1972976
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	pop-up	dialog
in firefox it works fine but in opera and safari browser captures event prior to flex application and find dialog pop-up

1973036
google-chrome	firefox
i have to develop a console application that would monitor and list all the events fired by browsers internet explorer 8 mozilla firefox and google-chrome

1973080
getter	setter
a javabean is a java object that is serializable has a nullary constructor and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods

1973085
getter	setter
a java bean is a class that is serializable has a no-argument constructor and uses getter and setter methods for its member fields

1973088
accessor	properties
any serializable java class implementing java.io.serializable that follows specific conventions a no-argument constructor and properties accessible via get set is accessor

1973104
google-chrome	firefox
if it is google-chrome or mozilla firefox i m pretty much sure you could listen to the events by installing your plug-in extension in the browser

1973106
nsoperation	nsnotification
to my understanding listeners to the nsnotification will not run on the main thread because the nsoperation is not on the main thread

1973124
firefox	safari
my testing browser is safari but i ve also tried firefox

1973193
onclick	onsubmit
change the onclick handler to onsubmit on the form like so

1973225
jquery	simplemodal	simplemodal	blockui
simplemodal blockui and jquery ui dialog do not persist the checkbox changes between modal window calls

1973246
children	parent

1974528
width	height
it will work on all screen resolutions as it takes the total screen width and height then divides it in half thus giving the center of the screen then it subtracts your width and height settings to take them into account but divides them by half as well to offset the window as without the offset it will not be centered

1974563

1974735
equals	gethashcode
object identity doesn t work properly unless you abuse equals gethashcode

1974735
equals	gethashcode
clearly the definition of it as being able to persist ordinary classes is a fallacy because the nhibernate ones are only ordinary insofar as not referencing framework-specific classes whereas they are extraordinary inasmuch as they require unusual design choices such as default constructors and all-virtual members and equals gethashcode implementations on mutable types

when the request arrives at port 80 it is collected by your http server which is probably apache but might be lighttpd or any other http server

1975449
apache	lighttpd
cgi containers do the same job in a slighly different way the reason you might choose one over the other is likely to be related to what http server you are using mod_python is designed for apache for example something like fastcgi is used more with lighttpd and to performance considerations

1975511
stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
i fflush stdout so the web browser gets the whole page

1975527
children	parent
you then use string or xquery functions to find children of a parent etc

1975548
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
each row contains a couple of textboxes a dropdownlistfor and a checkbox which are all .net form controls rather than plain html controls i should point out

1975548

once you progress past hello world you ll find yourself scripting it or using tools like ant and maven that will help you set the classpath for your project

1975716
min	max
x min x max x min-max

1975725
ienumerable	iqueryable
regarding the combinatorial explosion of find methods in .net you can return an iqueryable instead of an ienumerable and allow the calling client to run a linq query on it instead of using a find method

1975748
min	max
1 min-max - same as 1 n with check n min and n max non-nullable

1975752
post	get
if i get round to doing this i ll post it up otherwise maybe somebody else might beat me to it

1975957
width	height
you can however specify height and width for you new window

1975966
datatrigger	eventtrigger
i ve looked at datatrigger but they seem to require an equality condition to hold and eventtrigger seem to not be possible to attached to any events to do with the display of data

1975970
youtube	vimeo
another cool way is to use one of the video apis to upload encode to the cloud youtube data api vimeo api hey

int	double
if it s a value type like int double etc. setting the variable to nothing will set it to the default value

1976137
disk	ram
if you have the disk cpu and ram on your host box i d suggest setting up the db on a separate box

1976140
int	chars
in c language memset is only guaranteed to properly initialize memory for int types and its validity for all int types as opposed to just chars types is a relatively recent guarantee added to c language specification

uiactivityindicatorview	viewdidload
in viewdidload i wrote the code for uiactivityindicatorview but the spinner started after loading of the image and it is not stopping

1976164
mouse	keyboard
you ll have to find out that mouse the computer uses what keyboard key layout hardware buttons etc

1976215
put	get
when i run this from the command line i always get the same values for maxidleness which is to be expected curidle which should change and timeremaining which is always at the maximum value...understandable since i m executing from the command line but i get the same result if i put it in a batch file with sleep.exe in between or in a program that iterates with a sleep between each call to callntpowerinformation

1976218
public	protected
you cannot make a protected property public

1976218
accessor	properties
you can however write an accessor function that will return the protected properties

opera	firefox
it works great for me in opera 10.10 chromium 4.0 firefox 3.6 and ie8

1976481
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream	bufferedoutputstream	inputstream
to improve performance you can wrap the response.getoutputstream in a bufferedoutputstream beforehand and the inputstream in a bufferedinputstream and use a buffer

1976481
outputstream	inputstream
you don t need to get hold of the entire inputstream in a under the hood massive byte buffer and then write it away to the outputstream

1976534
decimal	ieee
an ieee 754 64 bit float double precision is good for 15 decimal significant figures so you should have no problem converting to double

1976592
udp	tcp
everyone mentions tcp but nat works for udp as well the first outgoing udp packet associates that source port with the internal ip address and your nat device will forward incoming traffic to that port to the correct host on the internal network

clang	llvm
the advantage to this is that when compiling without openmp-support pcc or clang llvm as of now the code will still compile

1976838
keystore	jks
this are my keystore file keystore type jks keystore provider sun

1976858

1977136
prepare	execute
the gist of it is that you have a prepare statement you are trying to execute but you are not supplying one of the parameters needed

1977175
versioning	upgrade
easy fix is to upgrade internet explorer to versioning 8

1977185
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
the mint distribution is based on ubuntu debian so i assume that my ubuntu approach also works on mint

1977252
client-side	server-side
whether you are programming for html or asp .net making a stylesheet with css your project being server-side or client-side it is always good practice to use standard markup and make sure all your work is cross-browser compatible with a strong influence on being compatible with ie

1977291
rel	alt
this doesn t work it works for other attributes such as alt rel etc

1977327
xslt	schematron
while you can validate using schema schematron just uses xslt and results in an xml document that has validation messages that you can make user friendly

1977339
boost	stl
is there c++ equivalent for python xrange generator in either stl or boost

1977364
converter	multibinding
since your converter depends on both the text property from the textbox and the visibilityofworkitemcolumntitles property on your mainmediator class you ll probably need to use a multibinding and include both properties back in the xaml

1977367
spaces	delimiter
i would suggest using regular expressions on the original string looking for the pattern any number of spaces followed by one of your delimiter followed by one or more spaces and remove those spaces

1977369
extjs	sproutcore
check out sproutcore and extjs

1977390

1977499
disk	ram
or you can mount a ram disk and mount individual tables or the whole database on it

1977557
fadein	fadeout
as far as i can tell you would use fadeout change the source with attr and then fadein again

1977580
fadein	fadeout
are you sure you re using the callback you pass into fadeout to change the source attr and then calling fadein

1977580
fadein	fadeout
you can t call fadeout attr and fadein sequentially

1977582

1977619
gif	png
does it work for other files like css gif png

1977619
.htaccess	httpd.conf

1977624
anjuta	gnome
i thought that anjuta is the default ide for gnome applications

1977635
config	ini
i would find it doubtful that your automated code scanning solution would read plaintext ini files or xml ini files and some frameworks like zend make it very easy to deal with these types of config files so that your password is not scattered throught your code or web accessible at any point.

1977641
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
passed properties of the command line switches i required and called the ant targets in the build.xml file from the tasks section in the maven pom.xml as follows

1977652
gtkmm	glibmm
there are c++ wrappers like gtkmm and glibmm but i believe that core gnome is written in c

1977655
git-clone	git-init
from the git-init man page also works with git-clone if you are cloning an existing repo instead of creating a new one from scratch

1977727
width	height
the link tags within your li s need to have display block to make use of the width and height rules

1977768
firefox	safari
i believe that below is a correct implementation of it in that there s nothing theoretically wrong with it but it displays in firefox and safari with the table layout screwed up as you can see by the borders

1977790
kde	gnome
on windows you will need some trickery with pywin32 and the windows api on linux the answer will depend on which desktop is running - kde gnome or something more exotic

1977790
kde	gnome
under kde and maybe gnome you can probably send a message using d-bus which you could do without including any new libraries by using the command line tool dbus-send

1977804
actionscript	mxml
an actionscript block in an mxml file

1977845
profiling	debugging
i m pretty new to the sql profiling so maybe there s an event i can enable that will provide me with more info to try and debugging this

1978007
ftp	telnet	paramiko	telnetlib
no paramiko has no support for telnet or ftp -- you re indeed better off using a higher-level abstraction and implementing it twice with paramiko and without it with the ftplib and telnetlib modules of the python standard library

1978019
cruisecontrol	jenkins
svn itself does not do continuous integration ci but there are many ci servers that integrate well with svn cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.net jenkins hudson...

1978050

you need to encode the text but i think is better to use an object rather than a string as the data member jquery will do the job of properly encoding the post get parameters

1978389
pop-up	dialog
some developers also create a mask to hide or inactivate the rest of the page while the pop-up is visible - and to make it act as if it were a modal dialog

1978389
width	height
to do this create another div with a background color usually black or white then set the opacity to something like 50 - 70 - then set its zindex higher than anything else on the page but lower then the popup and set its position to absolute its top and left to 0 and width and height to match the page

1978390
rss	feed
then using the simplexmlelement to traverse the rss feed makes things nice and easy

1978407
disk	ram
but even if your target is network packets sent pages of ram allocated blocks of disk read written or just watts of power consumed the message i am trying to communicate is that you should have a performance target that target should be quantified and the target should be connected to the needs of your users

1978449
explode	implode
if you know that your array will just be a list of numbers for example then you should use implode explode

1978454
portrait	landscape
so when the phone is rotated from landscape to portrait mode i d like rectangleview and all its subviews to keep their original shape and position relative to each other but just get smaller

1978454
portrait	landscape
this is a problem because the content view is now a different shape portrait than it was before landscape and so all the elements on the screen are in the wrong places when they should just be scaled down within rectangleview

1978468
button	checkbox
form styling input button select fieldset radio checkbox etc

1979061
min	max
if not there is are id s per min max value

1979061
min	max
the top solutions won t give you rows where you have tied min max values unless defined with ties

1979065
min	max
it gets all min id value and max id value grouped by indicatorid

1979108
superclass	subclassing
is this happening because the subclassing is inheriting the superclass constructor and therefore creating another window

1979135
superclass	subclassing
ya its happening because the subclassing is inheriting the superclass constructor.in any subclassing always first superclass constructor is called

1979136

1979194
pull	push
can i create branches modifications and use push pull just like i would in regular repos or are there things to be cautious about

1979203
versioning	upgrade
also consider to upgrade to the latest versioning of eclipse

1979233
min	max
i also assume that you only want one row per indicatorid and if there are duplicate rows that have the same max min then it s better to just choose one of them arbitrarily instead of returning both

1979271
folder	directory
i need to copy a folder directory and its contents located in a machine a to machine b successfully

1979271

i am adding folder from other app folder and then put that folder in my app and i import folder files to my app file but i am getting error like no such file or directory while running

1980482
hide	show
you can easily hide style display none the upload forms and show them with a link like upload an image onclick #link_id .show

1980488
getter	setter
my understanding was that adding the retain attribute to the property declaration and using the necessary synthesize delcaration in the implementation file will basically do the following setter and getter for me

1980536
submit	submission
this leads me to believe that either the form itself is randomly not being rendered correctly to the browser the edit call and therefor submission back the incorrect parameters or something is going wrong with the submit call causing the parameters to be messed up

1980572
ironruby	ironpython
rather than write a custom language you could embed any of the dlr languages ironpython ironruby or jscript or you can use compiler services to compile vb.net from your application

1980945
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
i d suggest that instead of using a foreach loop to construct the html output you should use a databound control such as a asp repeater datalist or gridview

1980971
nsurl	nsstring
request seturl nsurl urlwithstring nsstring stringwithformat session.sessionkey

1980972
put	get
to get the desired behavior put this in the page_load event of your login page

1980988
post	get
i think that if you are serving multiple languages via the same url with no get or post values based only upon the accept-language header then you have to use vary

1981004
gentoo	centos	gentoo	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora

1981101
google-chrome	firefox
if i use the tag google-chrome and firefox do not render the page correctly

1981105
jobs	cron
when you don t have access to cron jobs or scheduled tasks on your server you can use online services such as to hit your script at specified intervals

1981137
actualheight	actualwidth
i have tried several ways involving bindings to actualwidth actualheight but can t get it to work

1981144
put	get
this should get called before you re put on screen in both the initial push and the pop case

1981151
maven	pom.xml
in maven multi-module projects where i want each of the modules to always keep the same version as the parent i ve typically done something like the following in the module s pom.xml

1981161
ubuntu	linux
using ubuntu linux with qt 4.6.0

1981175
width	height
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width

1981192
bazaar	svn
if you change your mind later and want it to behave more like svn you can do a bazaar bind and any commits you make will automatically be committed to the parent branch

1981215
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m not having a problem with your code in firefox google-chrome or safari

1981240
profiler	gprof
you can use gprof which is a free profiler

1981324
width	height
i would have to keep making instances of gameobject and giving it a new name and height and width

1981327
width	height
i assumed i can anchor the width but set the height manually anchor the left right and top edges

1981336
subclass	abstract-class
when someone wants to create a form he must subclass formviewcontroller and implement its abstract-class

1981343
width	height
i d create a calayer the width of the line and height of the view set its background color to the line color and attach it to the view at the position desired

1981388
implements	extends
if you implements runnable as well as extends activity then you could handle the code like this.

1981404
put	get
i tried clickhandler and to put the image on a pushbutton and get the element from this pushbutton but all don t work

1981406
int	double
any two subclasses of number such as int and double are expected to add together properly in an oop language

1981415
getter	setter
add getter and setter method to your class

1981427
getter	setter
this is the way but i would suggest to write a getter and setter for that variable

1981434
inherited	properties
rather than having all your gameobjects inherited properties from gameobject

1981446
treemap	treeset
if you need to iterate through the people or require them to have ordering consider treemap or treeset instead of hashing

1981485
haskell	scheme
my advise would be to learn a functional language maybe start with scheme then move to haskell

1981542
keydown	keyup
you would test for them in either the keydown or keyup events

1981543
outputstream	inputstream
note that like balusc and michael borgwardt say readers and writers are for text if you just want to copy the file you should use inputstream and outputstream you are only concerned with bytes

1981550
getter	setter
if you are going to follow the examples given using getter setter or setting it in the constructor change it to private since those are ways to control what is set in the variable

1981567
pecl	pear
it seems like pecl is using pear to perform installations

1981568
memcpy	memset
can i reliably use memset and memcpy operators in c++ with memory been allocated with new

1981587
memcpy	memset
using std vector which has its own copy and assignment facilities seems like a better bet for memcpy and i ve never really believed in the magic of setting everything to zero which seems to be the main use for memset

1981590
post	get
i hesitate to post the solution because it is going to get you into enormous trouble

1981590
pull	push
there is no safe push model only pull

1981592
memcpy	memset
memset and memcpy simply take address parameters for a source and destination and these parameters can technically be to any address in your application s address space

1981593
memset	malloc
it s obvious that the dst pointer could be allocated any valid way new malloc or even statically - memset doesn t care

1981594
outputstream	inputstream
you already have an outputstream at hands so just get an inputstream of the file and pipe the bytes from input to output it the usual java io way

1981594
outputstream	bufferedinputstream	outputstream	inputstream	bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream	bufferedoutputstream	inputstream
to improve performance a bit more you can always wrap the inputstream and outputstream in an bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream respectively

1981596
memcpy	memset
if you have allocated an object s then using memcpy or memset could lead to un-defined behavior

1981604
button	checkbox
how much time can be considered as acceptable time for setting value to text box like 1 sec for 20characters or what range of time will be considered as acceptable for clicking on button selecting value from combobox selecting checkbox available in grid etc

1981611
jobs	cron
the idea of cron and scheudled jobs seems to run counter to what you re actually trying to do

1981620
typemock	moles
if you absolutely need to use test doubles for unit tets involving httpsessionstate this is still possible with certain invasive dynamic mocks such as typemock or moles althought these carry plenty of disadvantages as well see this comparison of dynamic mocks

1981658
sorting	filtering
i can separately do pagination mislav will_paginate sorting and filtering but together i m having some problems combining them

1981674
put	get
so if you put something in the viewdata when a page is requested then expect your controller to be able to get it back when a form on that page is posted it won t be there

1981723
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu 9.04 g++ 4.3.3 and for memory testing mudflap library

1981778
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i make a request with firefox ie google-chrome or safari it takes takes about one second before my server sees that there is a new connection to be accepted

1981778
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using other clients wget own test client that just opens a socket than firefox ie google-chrome safari seeing the new connection is matter of milliseconds

1981785
integer	radix
it takes a string and an optional radix which should always be supplied and parses the number as an integer in that radix or a radix based on the format of the number if none is supplied which is why you should always supply one

1981814
put	get
by using explicit joins you will get a syntax error if you forget to put in a join condition and a cross join must be explicitly specified as such

1981842
implements	extends
the jdk also provides the class xmlfilterimpl which implements all of the interfaces of defaulthandler but does not extends from it .

1981845
textarea	textbox
it is impractical for me to use textarea when only 15 or 20 characters are allowed in the textbox

1981884
required	placeholder
in this case spring internally creates the sql query with the required number of placeholder based on the size of the actual list when replacing named parameters with

1981897
post	get
check out phil haack s blog post on how to get this to work

1981938
post	get
ajax requests via get and post

1981960
cpu	affinity
the thread affinity apis are generally only used when someone gets totally anal about the difference in performance in accessing cpu memory locatations from different cores

1981987
udp	tcp
if you want to fuzz the ip udp or tcp route your packets from your high level services via loopback to a process that reads them fuzzes them and forwards them

1982020
public	protected
you can then add fields and properties and methods public private or protected

1982067
put	get
now if i put immediately after the addtxn then the subsequent code does indeed get the post-addtxn acctbal value

1982137
disk	ram
by splitting it into two passes you may also gain performance even without mutlithreading by doing all the input processing and then all the output processing as separate stages which will probably reduce the disk seeking involved depending on how much ram you have available for disk caches on your pc

1982142
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari everything works perfectly

1982165
for-loop	loops
for complicated processing such as lists inside lists you might want to use a for-loop for the outer layer and a list comprehension for the inner loops

1982215
children	parent
i m unsure how to alter the ui.helper.bind so that it s binding to the clickable children rather than the draggable parent

1982230
imagemagick	im4java
i m using im4java to call imagemagick from a grails app

1982252
ati	nvidia
32 seems to be typical for nvidia chips 64 for ati

1982254
hide	show
i just saw a demo that had this jquery code to show and hide a dive on hover can t this be done with just regualr css though

1982255
udp	tcp
also the tcp udp port numbers of ip

1982255
udp	tcp
checksums both ip and tcp udp must

1982343
hide	show
that would show one set of children the first time they hover then hide and the next time show a different set of children

1982388
system.in	system.out
see the documentation for system in particular system.out system.err system.in

1982389
stdout	stderr
use system.out and system.err to write to stdout and stderr respectively

awt	swing	system.in	system.out
there s not a new console project or similar in eclipse but you d just make a new java project and read write to system.out system.in system.err and not use a gui framweork such as swing awt to be a console application

1982411
put	get
they re not just magic devices where you put in the sql and get out result sets but rather very complicated pieces of software with their own logic and quirks

1982425
webkit	gecko
the only alternatives i can think about is using any web browser engine like webkit gecko etc

1982476
accessor	properties	getter	setter
it creates accessor methods to get and set the properties it would create a getter method to return that nsmutablearray and a setter method to allow you to replace it with another nsmutablearray

1982524
udp	tcp
and then look for the referenced sockets by the inode in proc net tcp or proc net udp

1982549
int	chars
and int foo chars

1982642
width	height
you can set the div s width or height to a percentage as well and with overflow auto the div contents will scroll if the browser is sized to less than the content

1982764
pull	push
you can do a pull or push from the website database wsdb to the enterprise database edb and vice-versa

1982775
qtkit	quicktime
also does anyone know the difference between the quicktime player and the qtkit that is supplied to developers

1982780
viewdidload	viewdidappear
also i d move this code to viewdidappear rather than viewdidload

1982802
getter	setter
when should a class use its own getter setter vs accessing the members directly

1982841
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is likely the most popular os for rails probably because of ubuntu being a very popular linux distro

1982841
heroku	engineyard
i would also second other people s recommendations of heroku and engineyard as well

1982849
implements	extends
if there are common tasks responsibilities in your two timers you could create an abstract timer that implements these common tasks and extends it for more specific behavior method implementation

1982850
mouse	keyboard
then all you have to do is hook up the event handlers to deal with the mouse and keyboard

1982876
children	parent
i actually would like 4 states - checked unchecked indeterminate like a tri-state box - parent is tri-state if not all of the children are checked and notappicable this checkbox would be an x and greyed out

1982878
width	height
it represents a picture with previously known width and height

1982954

1983003
google-chrome	safari
but this solution works like a charm on google-chrome and safari

1983029
floating-point	integer
recent intel compilers achieve significantly better performance on floating-point heavy benchmarks and are similar to visual c++ on integer heavy benchmarks

1983053
profiling	debugging
it does a great job of helping you analyze this information including directly showing you how your code lays out showing you misses blocks and many other useful tools for debugging and profiling concurrent apps

1983120
for-loop	arrays
that tends to be less error prone since you can just use a for-loop across the arrays and not have to keep track of start and end pints which i always get wrong for what it s worth

1983147
accessor	properties
well your synthesize doesn t match properties declaration - you re declaring properties for mobinfo but generating synthesized accessor for mobinfo

1983150
jobs	cron
if the user as whom the webserver runs is allowed to have cron jobs and the system is correcty set up then its simply a matter of executing the cron program popen exec system....etc and feeding it an appropirate input file

1983150
jobs	cron
however on any sensibly configured internet connected webserver the httpd user will not be allowed to run cron jobs

1983183
cpu	processors
support cpu dispatching this is really important since it allows the compiler to target the processors for optimized instructions when the program runs

1983186
getter	setter
now i had this problem in the past and that was caused by me trying to over optimize each entity class by making the setter and getter final

1983186
getter	setter
hibernate needs to setup proxying for the entity classes so it can lazy load stuff so if i make a setter getter final it can t do that

1983239
min	max
if you want a readable format you can use a level meter uiprogressview or your own where the max is 0.0 and the min is -60.0 you can adjust depending on the noise floor

1983249
width	height
displaying a rectangle and binding width height angle to a view model class works as i expect in xaml

1983249
width	height
however when creating a rectangle in the code-behind i can bind to the height and width but not the angle

1983270
subclass	abstract-class
this is an abstract-class which you can subclass and implement the abstract method which maps namespace uris on to prefixes

1983276
explode	implode
if there is 5 items for every link i could have an array of 5 items on the page a list of 5 items seperated by commas or i could use json encode decode what would be best for performance for saving a link to the db and showing it on the page something like implode explode with a list of item json encode decode or serialize un-serialize the array

1983285
qtkit	quicktime
quicktime player should use an almost identical backing as any other app on the system qtkit

1983387

by example if you want to copy a file you need to read from an inputstream and write to an outputstream

1983517
mouse	keyboard
george mamaladze s article processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# which works if the application is in the background on codeproject has been around since 2004 been through multiple revisions and he s still supporting it and updating it as i understand it he started his project because he could not implement global hooks in .net that worked when the app was running in the background but later discovered you could hook certain lower level events formerly q318804 now msdn article revised

1983529
gtk	gdk
such tests are common in gtk gdk internals - things like i m expecting this pointer to be a such-and-such but i better make sure before i treat it that way. each message pair you see indicates a pointer has been passed to such a routine but what it points to is not only not the expected object type it s not even pointing to anything the rtti system recognizes so the rtti system is throwing up its hands

1983541
erlang	lisp	homoiconicity	lfe
if you are not scared of lists you might try using lfe lisp flavoured erlang to generate code as with all lisp there is no special abstract form it s all homoiconicity and much easier to work with

1983563
free	malloc
lastly it seems that any program created with visual c++ 6 using malloc free or new delete seems to be affected on these newer platforms

1983565
post	get
is this all one needs for handling post and get data

1983568
nstextfield	nsimageview
i hand-wrote two iboutlets nstextfield nsimageview made sure to do the property line in the .h and the synthesize in the .m file

1983658

1983680
google-chrome	safari
-webkit-border-radius is for webkit based browsers such as safari google-chrome

1983708
post	get
in your tests you re sending a post request and the new action doesn t accept post requests but only get s

1983724
post	get
i get the values fine but i am having trouble to update the primary entity after post

1983727
width	height
the right second sizer is user sizable but a minimum of 960 pixels via a spacer there then a gridsizer that s determined by the level width and height in code

1983737
n-gram	words
a words based n-gram solution might also be worth investigating

1983773
put	get
all the line of code does is changes a pointer but for some reason every time i put it in i get this error

1983807
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is implemented in firefox 3.5 safari 4 and google-chrome 3 but not ie

1983840
width	height
control dimensions height and width can t be set to negative values so code like the following in your form_resize event can cause this error

1983933
free	malloc
if something malloc d memory before it started and then free d it while it was running you d get a negative count

1983943
client-side	server-side
i m using a python socketserver with a trivial message replication system√¢ √¢ √¢ all the game logic in my case is on the client-side with some complicated javascript maintaining a consistent game world in the face of lag√¢ √¢ √¢ but even for a more complex server-side i think a scripting language will probably be just fine

1983983
google-chrome	firefox
the code is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie6+.

1984066
clang	llvm
and the clang llvm reports the leak

1984079
post	put
i m looking to write some javascript which will make an ajax put or post request to an http server

1984098
post	get
there is no need for the loop really unless you are doing multiple updates with one post - you can get at any specific record via an xpath query

1984183
rdf	owl
what you seem to be talking about is semantics for which rdf s and owl can be a good starting point

1984201
udp	tcp
am doing a dll in vc++ for blocking ports like tcp sniffer .while blocking udp port in local machine its works fine.while am taking remote computer from my my system its raises on exception

i thought i would actually post the details of my progress so that we can get out of the comments which dont format as nice

1984228
put	get
if not - then i need to get that damn patch put in place and push 3.0.4 pronto

1984242
jquery	scriptaculous
how do i get intellisense for prototype scriptaculous like we get for jquery in visual studio

1984273
google-chrome	safari
by the fact that you are asking the question though i would suggest that you use jquery as testing as various browsers and getting your own framework to work across ie6+ google-chrome safari and other browsers is obviously doable but there are some issues to deal with so unless you want to test on many browsers and resolve the issues go with the one that is already tested

1984356
width	margin
sort of hard to tell without your markup but it seems that in some cases your width + margin + padding would exceed 960px horizontally

1984365
aggregate-functions	sum
also pivot requires that you use an aggregate-functions sum avg count

1984366
3des	aes
on windows you want to find a device that has an api that supports mscapi caping or pkcs#11 the first and last are all very common mscapi however does not support hardware aes 3des

1984429
rss	feed
many rss feed use the element which is a child of to indicate when they were last updated

1984449
user-controls	elementhost
i create a simple wpf user-controls any control will do and insert it into a winform using an elementhost

1984454
inherited	properties
instead of switching styles you should use hierarchicaldatatemplate and datatemplate in order to style your treeviewitem they will work similarly unless you want to change certain inherited framework properties

1984470
sprint	branding
leading branding such as sprint verizon clearasil and snickers leverage our paid performance-based distribution solutions to engage their audiences on facebook myspace and myyearbook

1984499
put	get
but the import directives themselves do not get put into the compiled bytecode files the compiler compiles the fully qualified name into the .class file

1984519
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
array allocation should probably a call to calloc or malloc memset

1984536
jobs	cron
my web application requires 6 different cron jobs to run to update timezone sensitive data within tables at 00 01 00 of each timezone

1984544
csla	.net
i just want to add here as this seems to be about .net that you can use csla for the implementation of your model and you get isdirty funcionality and a lot of other things for free

1984636
tiff	png
i need a pcre perl compatible regular expression that will match all non -images jpg png tiff from a list of files

1984712

i ll try and post some code soon but hopefully this ll help you get some sleep

1984769
hash	md5
using some hash function h say md5 take the hash of each image and store the image with a filename equal to the digest

1984796
coalesce	nvl
coalesce is the ansi equivalent more or less of oracle s nvl function

1984866

however when i scroll the table loads the new cell s starts the nsurlconnections but when the image is finished loading in code they do not get put into the view until the table actually stops scrolling

1984870
put	get
a standard fresh ci install works perfectly but when i put my app in the same dir i get errors

1984873
tstringlist	tlist	tstringlist	tobjectlist
i would recommend against using tstringlist tlist tobjectlist because insertion deletion in very large lists millions can be painfull because the deletion insertion is o n and inserting in the middle means shifting half the data

1984917
daemon	cron
a counter-question really but i ve noticed that you ve mentioned cron meaning your app is going to be run periodically as opposed to being run continously in a so-called daemon fashion

1984917
ubuntu	debian
anyway since you ve mentioned ubuntu i must say that the script you ve linked doesn t comply with the current standard for initscripts neither for ubuntu nor for debian lenny

1984936
onmousedown	onmouseup
isn t onmousedown and onmouseup events are helpful

1984936
onmousedown	onmouseup
with onmousedown event you can get the co-ordinates of initial letter and with onmouseup the last letter

1984966
for-loop	arrays
i was once curious about this as well and wrote a simple program in java and then an equivalent in c not much more than doing some operation with a for-loop and a massive arrays

1984986
width	height
try putting a div round the silverlight control name the div and use css to give that div a fixed height height 150px and width width 250px both being the width and height of the silverlight control make it position absolute and add a bottom 0px and right 0px to the div class properties adjust the 0px to the number of pixels you want to let the control stand out

1985030
phpunit	simpletest
update it s much easier to run the unit tests with simpletest than with phpunit

1985056

1985089
jms	jta
strictly speaking from java ee apis i d suggest to start with jsp servlet jpa ejb 3.0 jax-ws and then maybe jms jta and once you ll have reached this point i think that you ll be skilled enough to learn any other api if required

1985126
wicket	seam
i m partial to spring but there s also of the top of my head seam wicket struts2

1985181
wan	lan
when you switch off nat from your wireless router it can operate as a hub switch and not a router anymore so that you could connect it to the modem using one of its lan socket instead of thro its wan socket

1985199
mouse	keyboard
for example if the site uses javascript that requires the use of a mouse and doesn t have keyboard alternatives it will not be 508 compliant

1985225
try-catch	exception-handling
i can put try-catch clauses around all the calls to the service client and reinstantiate the singleton instance on communication exception-handling but that will involve a lot of boilerplate code

1985240
width	height
i have images in the columns but i include height and width tags on the images so the browser should know in advance the sizing

1985240
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in internet explorer 8 firefox and google-chrome

1985247
vim	emacs
fortunately they do this in a way that is compatible with both emacs and vim modelines

1985247
vim	emacs
both vim s and emacs coding satisfy these requirements.

1985247
vim	jedit	vim	emacs	emacs	jedit
here is a simple modeline generator which generates modelines for vim emacs and jedit

1985254

i can see plenty of post about where the field description extended property lives and how i can get it but nothing about adding these at the create table stage

1985317
min	max
what s the quickest and easiest way to get the min or max value between two dates

1985325
firefox	safari
firefox and safari could easily handle the transparent parts but in ie these parts were just black

1985326
min	max
you can write a generic method to calculate min or max for any type provided that is set appropriately

1985332
unixodbc	iodbc
unless you want some specific features offered by this driver api you can use the php odbc module along with unixodbc iodbc driver or freetds odbc or db-lib

1985338
getter	setter
they have no behaviour but merely a bunch of setter and getter

1985359
actionscript	mxml
i am looking for a way to programmatically dissassoicate the click handler function from a button on my mxml component through actionscript code

1985385
google-chrome	firefox
the problematic part for me is the inclusion of javascript file - it works ok in firefox and google-chrome but ie 7 and 8 as i tested behaves strange

1985447
public	protected
don t forget to mark this field as protected to be visible in inheritors or public to be visible both in inheritors and from outside the class

1985448
public	protected
if the access modifier of the name field is public or protected you will be able to access it in your derived classes

1985448
public	protected
the modifier public will make it visible to all other classes while protected will restrict visibility to the derived classes

1985467
width	height
the same goes for the image width height

1985471
opera	firefox
using unshift instead of push is nearly twice as fast in opera 10 whereas the differences in firefox were negligible

1985478
stdout	stderr
as the manpage states the primary use of the freopen function is to change the file associated with a standard text stream stderr stdin or stdout

1985487
dictionary	map
after reading each line from your dictionary file into an entry class object de add it the map

1985574
button	checkbox
im not sure if is the best way to check on radio button but a similar method works with checkbox

1985591
folder	directory
i need to use libcurl for creating a folder in my home directory

1985591
mkdir	pwd
i tried using pwd command instead of mkdir myfolder

1985610
versioning	upgrade
that way when the database gets upgrade the sproc would get upgrade as well to match the new schema and you wouldn t have to worry as much about whether the code versioning matched the database versioning or not

1985616
getter	setter
if you want to explicitly declare getter setter methods it makes sense to make the corresponding properties protected

1985650
public	protected
i would use private or protected or public instead of var

1985686
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1985693
versioning	upgrade
what versioning do i need to upgrade

1985700
post	get
i can t see anything wrong with the post action but you do need a corresponding get action to set up the form for you

1985882
jar	manifest.mf
currently in eclipse when you open a library jar it shows all the packages and classes but if you want to see the meta-inf content manifest.mf you have to open the file externally using winrar

1985919
gridview	rowdatabound
if this isn t feasible in your case you can undo the html encoding for these cells on the gridview s rowdatabound event

1985954
tiff	png
you could use the xps printer driver and then convert the resultant png jpeg to tiff using some other image conversion package

1985955
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
i have an android listactivity that is backed by a database cursor through a simplecursoradapter

1985959

1985994
width	height
there is a player.setsize width number height number method on the player object.have you used that.i am using actionscript though and setsize is working for me

1985994
width	height
you should not have to use this method in javascript as the player will automatically resize when the containing elements in the embed code have their height and width properties modified.

1986002
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
to any other browser firefox google-chrome safari etc. this will just look like a normal html comment and will be ignored however ie will actually evaluate the statement and render what you ask it to

1986020
matplotlib	mplot3d
matplotlib has a mplot3d module that will do exactly what you want

1986090
onenote	ms-office
another similar tool is onenote which is part of ms-office

1986106

1986128
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
practical implementations of it are the manualresetevent and autoresetevent classes

1986152
int	boolean
when you need cmp x y you could just do a sign x-y or even better for non-numerical stuff just a x y - of course this should have required sorted accepting a boolean instead of an int comparator

1986153
implements	extends
public class loginmidlet extends midlet implements commandlistener

1986281
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you should probably recommend something like this site works best using firefox safari opera or google-chrome

1986290
vcard	vcalendar
to read and write ics file in python you can for example use the icalendar package which does precisely that task or vobject which is a much broader package supporting the range of vcard and vcalendar formats including icalendar

1986293
width	margin
changing only width margin padding or border will mean that you have to calculate the div s pixels again

1986293
width	margin
is there a better way of using width padding and margin

1986293
width	margin
it s a good option to have a outer div which as width and an inner div for the padding and margin

1986364
google-chrome	firefox
installing google-chrome and firefox additional to an existing internet explorer is as easy as installing the new version of get-me-porn and i-don t-pay-for-music

you can then copy the contents into an nsimage using nsbitmapimagerep -initwithfocusedviewrect

1986397
nstextview	nsscrollview
mydocument.xib just has an nstextview in an nsscrollview

1986436

webrat	cucumber
i am using cucumber webrat and selenium to test a web application

1986440
webrat	cucumber
environment cucumber 0.3.11 selenium-client 1.2.17 webrat 0.6.0

1986518
post	get
as far as having two actions register and process_register i find it s much cleaner to have one action which responds differently to post and get requests

1986533
implements	extends
you can extends the element class by using implements method

1986564
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
i am trying to use listactivity and a simplecursoradapter to check boxes based on a query from a database

1986633
firefox	safari
in css 3 you can use border-radius which safari and firefox support currently as -webkit-border-radius and -moz-border-radius

1986641
g++	gcc
without any real life experience with gcc g++ it seems to me that it supports every major platform one can imagine so code that compiles on g++ can run on almost any system

1986678
put	get
for instance if your api has a method that will return some information about a user you ll need to build up an http request in your iphone client and send it to the server via the api url specifying whether it is a get or put or other type of http request

1986717
user-controls	tabcontrol
then i have a composite user-controls that adds the individual detailviews 1-3 on a tab on the tabcontrol

several projects use gcc g++ as a day-to-day compiler for normal use but every so often will check to make sure their code follows the standards with the comeau c c++ compiler

1986817
many-to-one	one-to-many
tables should be modeled based on either having one-to-many or many-to-one relationships depending on the context and of those options they can be either optional or required

1986861
onmouseover	onclick
strip embedded event handler attributes like onmouseover out onclick onkeypress etc

1986901
rss	feed
i m currently building an app that renders rss and atom feed on the client side

1986930
free	realloc
if realloc fails you lose the original pointer and realloc does not free the original memory so you will get a memory leak

1986948
int	chars
i ve tried all sorts of other syntax to declare the extern variable such as chars chars int int etc

1986980
put	get
it turns out that i want to also get back some db.assets that do not have relations in db.assetbundles however i am not sure how to do this i want to put empty space blank strings in the place of the bundle fields of the recentlycreatedassetviewmodel when there is no relation

1986981
distutils	buildout
distutils and easyinstall in addition to buildout

1987000
post	put
the object is being correctly created and posted to the server i ve tried using post and put by the way the server appears to be receiving an object instance but the properties are - as usual - all null

1987025
post	get
if you want to add something inside the rotation s code then maybe you should also post the code of the rotation functions in order to get help

1987055
memcpy	strcpy
in other words in some implementations you d probably have to use strcpy not memcpy to force the data into the controlled sequence like that

1987055
memcpy	strcpy
while in some other implementations you d have to use memcpy and not strcpy

1987058
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql it is easy with limit and offset clauses

1987076
jboss	weblogic
as for deploying to weblogic and jboss - as long as your code is not using proprietary stuff from j2ee containers vendors you should be fine with one project

1987087
getter	setter
if however you use a dao you end up not being able to trivially extend the data object one of the strengths of xml and you have to create getter and setter for the object that do

1987106
hex	binary
i can open a file in a hex editor and know that each 2 digits is a byte they are 8 digits in binary correct

1987137
children	parent
write a custom class extending zend_db_table_row and write functions to retrieve the given row s parent and also a rowset of its children

1987137
children	parent
the row class should contain protected data objects to reference the parent and the array of children

1987137
children	parent
write a custom class extending zend_db_table_rowset that has a function to iterate over the rows in the rowset setting parent and children references so that you can subsequently traverse them as a tree

1987153
paradox	dbisam	paradox	dbase
filext has limited information and almost no signatures on the types i need specifically .db for paradox dbase iv sql anywhere novell groupwise progress and oracle and .dat for clarion and dbisam

1987156
hlsl	glsl
look into hlsl glsl cg or you can do the shader in asm

1987188
boost	stl
i would recommend effective c++ effective stl boost beyond the stl the important thing to note is that there are no game specific design patterns

1987239
rss	feed
it downloads an rss feed which is xml parses it then loads the data into a table

1987266
profiling	debugging
as far as you re allowed to install stuff on the server xdebug is the way to go for both debugging and profiling

1987308
min	max
as an aside the reason that standard linq can provide a min max is because of icomparable assisted by

1987357
throttling	throttle
i would suggest throttling the bandwidth on the network http request when connected to cellular and having no throttle on wifi

1987393
goto	break
you must use a goto statement for multi level break

1987443
goto	break
no goto needed and the break statement leaves the loop

1987456
post	get
it might be worth your while to check and monitor the http get post s when using your browser to post sample code text and intercept the data and find out..use wireshark or httpwatch

1987465
decimal	ieee
ieee 754 and related floating point numbers cannot accurately represent many decimal values

1987510
post	get
either that or get the raw post data and parse it yourself

1987519
post	put	post	get	put	get
this gets called by the process method which is in turn called by the get post head or put methods

1987538
mp3	wmv
i ve got some heavily modified code that ultimately came from the windows media sdk that works great for reading tags out of mp3 and wmv files

1987569
post	get
another way to do this by using a plugin would be to get a plugin such as recent post by nick momrick

1987591
filesystems	hfs	filesystems	hfs+
however it only actually works on a few filesystems that specifically support it such as apple s hfs and hfs+ and i haven t seen any similar system call on other systems

1987766
post	get
as jspcal suggested your post response should be a redirect to another page requested by a get

1987767
post	get
this probably happens because the post info comes from the page before and isn t really saved anywhere for longer than the transition of pages whereas get uses the url to send the info so the information is stored somewhere

1987788
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox google-chrome but in ie6 7 8 i m getting a this command is not supported error message

1987803
jms	jta
xml xsl ejb jms jta and junit

1987803
websphere	ibm
and or ibm websphere application

1987805
lisp	scheme
learn a dialect of lisp scheme is currently quite popular

1987806
haskell	scheme
many languages have support for arbitrarily large numbers including in alphabetical order haskell icon python scheme and smalltalk among others

1987812
getter	setter
you can apply scope to property getter setter

1987845
lisp	scheme
lisp ml and scheme all permit body to have side effects

1987845
lisp	scheme
in lisp and scheme the closure stores the locations of the free variables

1987875
vim	emacs
not real ides but still very popular development environments emacs vim

1987877
vim	geany	vim	emacs
on linux ides like emacs vim geany code blocks netbeans use gcc as their compiler

1987887
int	chars
bitfield int chars etc.

1987932
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari the pop up redirects to the canvas url and doesn t close

1987932
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have googled and it seems to be something to do with the xd-receiver.htm file however it seems weird that it is working in ie and firefox but not google-chrome or safari

1987933
subclass	abstract-class
so client can subclass from the abstract-class and just implement the abstract method

1987940
put	get
and then you wrap all your puzzles put them in a map and get them out again hellip

1987961
width	height
in my applcaiton i make grid of size grid width 1300.441 height 80

1988022
cassini	iis
what are the advantages of cassini over iis

1988034
cassini	iis
cassini doesn t claim to be multi threaded or handle any of the advanced e-tags or other header control issues that can be issues with iis but are also usually set at sensible defaults in later versions of iis

1988035
getter	setter
the basic idea is to have a builder class that has setter but usually not getter for the different constructor parameters

1988061
int	chars
that said you ll give up simplicity and consistency these types may be a chars type for example which are int types in c c++ and that might lead to surprising function resolutions instead of just using an int

1988075
cassini	iis
will launch the built-in cassini web server not iis

1988109
width	height
this gives a formatting problem when an image has 100 height and width

1988150
qpainter	qtextdocument
i tried using qtextdocument in html and alternatively qpainter

1988168
multiplying	add
collect the digits into a floating point number by shifting powers of 10 before decimal point multiplying by 10.0 and add new number after decimal point divide by a growing power of 10 and add

1988193
width	height
because the p has no height the image can figure out the width but not the height of the bounding element the p

1988193
width	height
the image therefore becomes as large as the width and scales the image - creating a height of 219px

1988193
width	height
but now the q is - why doesn t it get the height from its ancestor - the same way that it got the width from the ancestor

1988193
width	height
and the answer to that has to do with the way height is mangled by the browser which in turn has to do with the allowances given by the browser for things overflowing to the height before allowing an overflow to the width

1988205
strcpy	strncpy
the solution is to either make msg a pointer if your strings are all known at compile-time or if you don t mind dynamically allocating memory or to use strcpy strncpy i personally don t like strncpy because it might not null-terminate the destination

1988215
boost	allocator
i m not sure but i think most boost classes let you specify an allocator

1988242
pop-up	dialog
for example my service class has a showdialog method that takes a frameworkelement and shows it in dialog style either as a window for windows application or as a pop-up on a page for xbap

1988296
ubuntu	linux
each linux distribution has it s own set of programs and features you can change around to your liking but i doubt you want to edit everything that comes in a standard distribution like ubuntu as recompiling everything each time to see changes will take a while

1988313
width	height
it s width and height properties define it s dimensions

1988346
ord	chr
is it possible without using ascii related functions chr or ord suppose those exist

1988364
gentoo	linux
for the specifics install any linux distribution then install the kernel source package gentoo will probably install this by default

1988396
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
using nsurlconnection the timeout is set in the nsurlrequest and the default in the nsmutableurlrequest request is 60 seconds and can be changed using the settimeoutinterval method

1988516
hex	binary
by using binary integers often expressed in hex or

1988541
rss	feed
i ve been trying to grab the digg rss feed and parse its contents into a table as an intro to working with jquery xml

1988545
division	multiplication
so division is always a bit worse than multiplication

1988552
division	addition
the problem with ascii is that manipulating the numbers is harder addition is fairly simple but imagine what division would look like

1988558
decimal	ieee
supplement your reading with a trip to wikipedia articles on ieee 754 floating-point number representation and on bcd binary-coded decimal -- not the same thing as your ascii but another similar approach

1988593
range	minimum
check the minimum and maximum values in a range example in you can download the same as well from the same section

1988597
width	height
to get the scale you need to compute the end width height and set it but that shouldn t be a problem

1988610
automake	autotools
if you develop for posix linux platforms or you work only with mingw under win32 that i would suggest to learn how to work with autotools -- autoconf automake libtool and friends

1988625
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
as it turned out i could not achieve this behaviour by handling a combination of combobox s events such as selectedindexchanged selectionchangecommitted textchanged etc. because the combobox control would finally synchronize the textbox field with the selected item from the drop-down list without raising any further events afterwards

1988679
integer	unsigned
the length id should be a 32 bit unsigned integer

1988710
int	chars
btw this means that a lot of objects that are considered falsy in some other languages are actually truthy in ruby like the int 0 the real value 0.0 the empty string the empty array the empty hash the chars f

1988851
memcpy	malloc
if you do need to modify your vertices after initialization you ll need to allocate for each ballsprite its own set of vertex data using malloc and copy the vertex data in using memcpy

1988864
octal	binary
binary in the octal system base 2 the alien would write 1011

1988864
octal	binary
octal in the binary system base 8 the computer would use 13

1988900
width	margin
then you just fill the open space at the right of a cell with another uilabel layout it to cover the open space and set it to autoresize it s width and set the right margin to be fixed

1988903
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr to stdout by using and then pipe | to your logger process

1988951
rss	feed
i m trying to load the parsed html data from an rss feed using a

1988958
width	height
when i set scale in in mxml the width and height of the canvas are adjusted accordingly

1988958
width	height
the canvas now appears on screen to have a width and height of 100 and if inside my creationcomplete callback i check the width and height property they are indeed 100

1988958
width	height
but if i do exactly the same thing except i set the scalex y property from actionscript the canvas on screen appears to have a width and height of 100 as expected but when i check the width and height property of the canvas they are still at the previous values of 1000

1988958
width	height
could anyone help me understand what is going on and also tell me if there is any method that will refresh the width and height values so that they are correct

1988988
freebsd	linux
on some platforms that support separate namespaces for linkers like windows os x and some commercial unices but not linux and freebsd you can workaround conflicts by stuffing code in a library and only export the symbols from the library you really need

1989004
pseudo-class	visited
the link pseudo-class applies for links that have not yet been visited

1989024
postgresql	mysql
from what i ve seen at least on the web mysql and postgresql are the most ubiquitous free database systems

1989036
powerpc	i386
if you re using xcode there s a setting in the project inspector where you can set the architectures powerpc i386 x86_64 you want to have in a single universal binary

1989066
pseudo-class	visited
the pseudo-class link and visited are only for links a elements with an href attribute

1989066
pseudo-class	visited
the link pseudo-class applies for links that have not yet been visited

1989066
pseudo-class	visited
the visited pseudo-class applies once the link has been visited by the user

1989080
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql sqlite - pick one

1989172
rss	feed
your web app registers with superfeedr to watch that rss feed and you keep track of this relationship

1989182
inherited	subclassing
you may be able to create a new class that is inherited from groupbox and subclassing it to intercept mouse move event

1989203
datamapper	activerecord
3 -- ok so if you absolutely can t use an orm framework like nhibernate or god forbid entity framework then i would suggest you adhere to one of the standard patterns that the orm frameworks use like activerecord or datamapper

1989203
datamapper	activerecord
martin fowler s activerecord and datamapper patterns both use an insert method to persist new objects to the database

1989216
rss	feed
in cf8 i have a working cftree with an rss feed per node multiple nodes

1989216
children	parent
the page is not throwing an error but none of the children nodes of the feed are showing under the parent

1989263
ant	maven
in your case i would track them through a report by a build-system maven or ant

1989291
merb	ruby-on-rails	datamapper	activerecord
this is one of the reasons that ruby-on-rails upcoming move to merb has been generally seen as a positive move for ruby-on-rails as merb makes use of the datamapper pattern in addition to activerecord

1989315
jvisualvm	jstat
use jvisualvm or jstat to observe if you re doing frequent garbage collections

1989349
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
note ...at design time if you define the event handlers for mouseup mousedown and mousemove while the control is on a form the parent of the control is the form and then cut and paste it into a container like a panel you ll have re-establish the binding linkage between the control and the mousedown mouseup and mousemove events in the ide for it to work

1989373
stdout	stderr
namely the consts stdin stdout stderr and their variable counterparts

1989386
folder	directory
i have a simple .bat move.bat file in the sendto folder which moves files and directory from any location to a specified folder by using the context menu

1989390
public	protected
also is db a protected or public variable

1989408
onmousedown	onkeydown
to keep track of the originator event capture the onmousedown and onkeydown events and set an internal indicator of the type of the latest one received so you may check for the later oncollapsing and onexpanding event process

1989431
ubuntu	linux
i program c++ applications on ubuntu linux and compile them to 2 operating systems natively to linux by using g++ gnu c++ compiler and cross-compile them to windows by using i386-mingw32-g++ mingw c++ cross-compiler

1989431
ubuntu	linux
fortunately ubuntu offers precompiled mesa3d libraries libgl1-mesa-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev for linux but unfortunately there are not any precompiled libraries for using with mingw cross-compiler thus windows versions of them - so i must manually compile them from source which can be downloaded from homepage

1993318
post	get
one of the reasons you want to do a redirect here is so that the user can hit the refresh button in the browser and not get that pesky would you like to post the data again dialog

1993318
post	get
see the wikipedia article for more info on prg post redirect get

1993350
ienumerable	ienumerator
for instance - in the above link ienumerable ienumerator is collaped to a single method interface

1993364
hide	show
one consideration is that combo boxes hide potential data while radio buttons always show all options

1993372
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t even know how to open a window not to mention how to handle mouse or keyboard input

1993396
post	get
and here an example for accessing post variables cookies and get vars are similar

1993401
glut	sdl
if you used sdl or glut add their frameworks as well

1993407
disk	ram
here resources includes disk space ram and cache space

1993434
getter	setter
it s just a list of getter and setter

1993436
freebsd	solaris	unix	solaris
i don t recall what os solaris or freebsd gave me problems with my unix build system because i just wasn t doing this and wondered why it crashed until i applied -fpic to gcc

1993493
folder	directory
i have removed all other projects from the webapps folder i have taken the servlet-api.jar file that was in the tomcat6 lib directory and added that and only that to the project build path so i can t see how there is still a conflict

1993498
post	get	pop-up	dialog
these will happily refresh with get values but will pop-up a warning dialog on a refresh of a post are you sure you want to resubmit

1993498
post	get
it looks like you were trying to combine the two methods get and post

1993515
autocomplete	typeahead
typeahead is the autocomplete effect for a combobox which you can see here in the light column

1993565
post	get
for instance i want to visit or similar with post but i get a 500 server error

1993616
put	get
however note that the first line returns a different value an instance of either get or put and this value is used in the second line

1993616
put	get
perhaps i could have some interface that both get and put implement then require a delegate-like thing that takes an instance of that interface

1993616
put	get
get and put inherit from a common base class request

1993634
nsxmlparser	nsurl
it shows how to use nsurl nsxmlparser and a tableview to do just this type of thing

1993646
hide	show
the same window in c is relatively easier in mfc as show here and it hide some of the boilerplate code

1993647
implements	extends
declaring a final __construct ensures that no one who extends your class can implements a method with the same name

1993684
put	get
you will need to change the builder.getrequest method so that it takes in a parameter that indicates whether a get or a put is what you require unless that can be deduced from either the user or name parameter

1993687
put	get
btw - i didn t read all your code you might get more bettre responses if you put a bit more effort in formatting it so that it easier to read

1993708
hash	md5
md5 is relatively fast but if you can t afford full-text comparisons on hash collisions you should probably use a stronger hash like sha-256

1993717
pop-up	dialog
but in this way we can do it ourself we copy the link of pro version in the appstore then pop-up a dialog guide the user to app store

1993720
serializable	deserialization
i won t mind rewriting 1300 lines of xml from scratch again as long as i learn the proper way to prepare xml data for serializable deserialization

1993726
irrlicht	ogre3d
sourceforge has many including ogre3d irrlicht and crystalspace

1993739
post	get
ps this is also posted in the sun forums so i ll post the answer i get there here or the answer i get here there naturally giving proper credit once i this is solved p

1993776
post	get
this should work with the store using both get and post

1993783
hash	md5
if you care about performances i think it would be better to check for matching file size first then using a fast hash function crc32 or md5 which should be faster than sha1 and for possible duplicated files found this way trying with md5 sha1 or sha256 depending on the criticality of the task

1993809
put	get
i cannot duplicate your error when i put that code into a file and run it with no additional flags i get

1993824
width	height
in the following example i m setting the listbox.background for simplicity but you should be able to adapt it to operate on the layouttransform or rendertransform or width height or whatever you re using to shrink the listbox

1993832
epl	zpl
in zebra printers it s called epl zpl

1993832
width	height
it s possible to set the font width and height to a multiple of the original size

1993840
dictionary	map
is there a way to map a list onto a dictionary

1993853

if i understand your question correctly i believe you can accomplish this with a combination of map zip and the dictionary constructor

1993865
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to call the matlab engine programatically from a c program on linux matlab r2009a ubuntu 9.10

1993892
int	chars
in almost every contemporary application that text is expressed as a sequence of unicode code points which are int mapped to particular abstract chars

1993901
arp	icmp
then you can either user icmp ping standard ping or arp ping to list all the valid ip addresses

1993932
octal	decimal
0103 in octal is equal to 67 in decimal

1993946
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
you can then cache all or part of it in memory with a sqldependency or sqlcachedependency so that the code receives a notification if the db table changes you can do something similar with an xml file if you must

1994034
subset-sum	np-complete
we know that since subset-sum is np-complete deciding in polynomail time probably is impossible

1994036
nhibernate	automapper
i am using s#arp architecture with fluent nhibernate and automapper on a legacy db

1994094
profiling	debugging
compared to an is_dirty flag knowing when a field was updated will help with tasks like debugging production problems knowing when a user profiling was updated and relating that to the time of the user s complaint and the validation of enhancements to your db updates

1994108
put	get
also you need to new your view and scene objects to put them on the heap so they don t get destroyed once drawscene finishes

1994126
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
get an nsbitmapimagerep from your nsimage

1994132
floating-point	integer
the argument is normally used for providing an integer for rounding from a floating-point type but you can really use it for whatever you want

1994151
dbi	dbd-pg
i ve tried installing the gems postgres dbi dbd-pg pg and ruby-pg but with pg ruby-pg and postgres it fails at the require for require postgres or require pg

1994157
stdout	stderr
i used an anonymous pipe to capture all stdout and stderr then print into a richedit it s ok when i use wsprintf but the python using multibyte char that really annoy me

1994203
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie7 the inputs all float left on a new line

1994234
width	margin
note that i hard-coded a left and right margin of 10 units on the rear textbox which assumes a particular width for the quote characters

1994234
richtextbox	textblock
the front text box is replaced with a richtextbox or textblock whose content is computed dynamically to be the text with extra characters but the regular text transparent

1994237
implements	extends
a benefit that this gives you is that you can now pass any object that extends b or implements b if it is an interface to a s constructor and it will work

1994264
folder	directory
right-click the web sites folder an individual web site folder a virtual directory or a file

1994325
g++	gcc
once i downloaded and installed that and changed my path back to the default then g++ and gcc work fine

1994349
post	get
hopefully this gets you going in the right direction if so have a stab at re-writing the first class using objects - if you get stuck post what you tried if you get all the way done post it and i am sure we help you see if you got it right

1994399
accessor	properties
an event isn t an eventhandler in the same way that a properties isn t an int - the event properties defines accessor methods

1994480
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
sqldatasource objectdatasource and

1994487
accessor	properties
the add and remove accessor are equivalent to the get and set accessor of a properties they prevent code from messing with the private _someevent field

1994487
accessor	properties
one final note the symmetry between an event and a properties is a bit lost the c# compiler automatically generates the add remove accessor if you don t write them explicitly

1994523
scatter	graphing
consider a graphing of some attributes of a collection of things where one has two independent variables - to analyse the relationship on these one obviously plots on two dimensions and you might see a scatter of points

1994547
firefox	safari
also it√¢ s slightly faster than using the attribute not equal to selector√¢ in firefox but slightly slower in safari

1994564
accessor	ivar
if you are using automatic kvo notifications you have to use the accessor instead of directly manipulating the ivar to trigger notifications

1994601
qtabwidget	qwidget
qtabwidget inherits qwidget and qwidget implements close

1994675
winpcap	libpcap
for filtering there s libraries like winpcap or libpcap

mouse	keyboard
get stuff done with the keyboard more and depend on the mouse less

1994822
ubuntu	linux
i also occasionally use ubuntu linux

1994862
client-side	server-side
as far as i know there is no way to map client-side classes to server-side fms classes

1994941
serializable	deserialization
use xml serializable and deserialization on client and server side rather than doing it yourself

1994945
opera	firefox
the following code opens the new window without scrollbars in firefox ie and opera

1994948
prefuse	flare
the flare toolkit the predecessor to flare was prefuse

1995014
post	get
and do please ignore the horrible smell coming from the bizarre example i post below of what you can get away with if there were any justice in the world that example should result in a blue screen of death at least

1995014
put	get
a brief demonstration of what a monstrosity you can actually get away with in .net 4.0 this will actually compile and run and put up an instance of form1

1995147
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i m going to diverge from the other answers and say that it is a very bad idea to have a sqlconnection and especially sqldatareader as global state

1995153
children	parent
a category has one parent and can have many children

1995224
min	max
and keep the min max buttons

1995239
min	max
you could roll your own min max buttons on top of the standard toolwindow title bar but i don t recommend it

1995378
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	fat	hfs+	ntfs	fat	hfs+
if you are on fat ntfs in case-insensitive mode essentially any time it s being used under windows or hfs+ in case-insensitive mode and have two files foobar and foobar then git will see two distinct files but the filesystems will only see one which will cause all kinds of problems

1995384
boost	stl
std wstring would be much more portable and benefit from a lot of existing prewritten code in stl and in boost

1995416
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore cappuccino

1995432
profiling	debugging
the eclipse plugin for the google app engine provides a local app engine environment in which you can run your program in debugging or profiling mode

1995446
serializable	deserialization
personally when dealing with network-enabled apps talking to a remote web service i use a singleton data loader class wrapping asihttprequest and handling all the serializable and deserialization which pops notifications when something occurs

1995468
rss	feed
just came across this in my rss feed not sure if this is what you re after or not

1995475
addeventlistener	onload
well first the library iwebkit you are using is doing a bad thing by taking the entire onload event to itself instead of using the proper addeventlistener function to attach itself to the onload function

1995517
debian	linux
linux debian lenny 5.0.3

1995545
entity-relationship	diagram
you sync the entity-relationship diagram with a uml class diagram etc

1995546
int	chars
main.mm 7 undefined reference to nsapplicationmain int chars const

1995549
uialertview	uipickerview
instead of showing a uialertview you might as well show your own uipickerview and do your thing

1995555
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if you created a salt which was an md5 of the password then it would have to stored alongside the hash and salt password value which means you have an unsalted hash which is vulnerable to precomputed lookup tables unless you plan to calculate it every time which is a small performance hit

1995555
hash	md5
by taking a sha hash of an md5 hash you re reducing the possibility of the plain text values as there s a finite number of md5 hash values as they are fixed length

1995556
mouseover	mouseout
it takes two functions as arguments mouseover and mouseout

1995556
mouseover	mouseout
or the plain mouseover mouseout equivalent

1995557
slideup	slidedown
lastly i m not entirely convinced slideup and slidedown will behave as desired with inline elements being that as opposed to block-level elements

1995589
mp3	ogg
i m attempting to embed an html5 audio element pointing to mp3 or ogg data served by a php file

1995646
hide	show
just set up the 3 divs on the page and then use jquery to hide show

1995646
hide	show
if you don t have a ton of divs to show hide ajax is probably overkill

1995658
min	max
you can also set min max dimensions so shrinking stretching to fit becomes a breeze

1995673
hash	salt
you are already salting your hash and ensuring each record has it s own individual salt which is very important

1995678
division	multiplication
same idea but division instead of multiplication

1995717
hash	salt
the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works

1995766
translation	localization
what localization prefix do i use for an arabic translation of the text for an iphone application

1995766
translation	localization
so what localization prefix do i use for an arabic translation

1995790
getter	setter
an ide-independent way is to use lombok an annotation-based library that generates getter setter and even equals and hashcode

1995825
stopwatch	nstimer
the stopwatch uses an nstimer to do the counting and has a table for storing laps but when the lap table is scrolled the watch stops or pauses and does not make up for the lost time

1995828
nscoder	nsuserdefaults
nscoder nsuserdefaults

1995857
width	height
y coordinates are not given because the width is to height

1995876
spaces	delimiter
you can specify whichever symbols you need spaces delimiter but iirc is is quite forgiving

1995941
lwp	libwww-perl
one such module is lwp curl which belongs to the libwww-perl family

1996029
innodb	myisam
note that aggregates like max and count are slower when using transactional tables like innodb and faster when using myisam

1996062
accessor	properties
it s probably not a problem since it is in your dealloc method but if you re going to use a properties accessor you should leave the retain and release to it

1996065
addition	multiplication
the addition and the multiplication have both error approximation

1996088
jvisualvm	jprofiler	jhat	jvisualvm	jhat	jprofiler
i tried jprofiler jvisualvm jhat and a lot of google

1996133
wan	lan
an as has a unique asn autonomous system number within that as one can have networks wan lan

1996172
client-side	server-side
therefore the code is parsed as server-side c# code not client-side javascript

1996208
nofollow	noindex
the html for the history view and several others such as the logs etc. contains a noindex nofollow meta declaration

1996248
sorting	filtering
it provides full support for all app engine data types as well as provides much more pretty viewing sorting and filtering

1996275
sqldatasource	formview
in vs 2005 using vb page has a formview linked to an sqldatasource

1996301
post	get
i m building an xml-based webservice in rails to serve as the backend for an iphone app and i m wondering how i can best achieve an auth scheme that will let me use both get and post requests -- one that doesn t require auth sent in the body of an xml payload

1996316
ssms	sqlcmd
if you can t download ssms express you always do have the sqlcmd utility at your fingertips - it s a command-line driven utility which allows you to send t-sql command to your sql server - check out the msdn docs on how to use it in detail

1996354
daemons	systemd
the only difference is that in a low runlevel lots of other systemd services will not be running so if the program tries to do something that depends on another daemons that may fail

1996374
int	chars
i don t know how to convert an int say 2007 into a chars array

1996390
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
i have yet to test it on ie am on a linux machine but it works correctly in webkit and gecko browsers safari google-chrome and firefox as well as in opera

1996407
uilabel	uitextview
in my app i have a uilabel which is the title and a uitextview which is the description and i want the title uilabel to be the first word typed into the uitextview

1996433
mvp	presenter
if so from my interpretation of mvp the model can raise events which my presenter would subscribe to

1996462
post	get
when you create your form you set it to use post variables instead of get that way they don t go through the url that s codeigniter s default method for forms

1996484
google-chrome	firefox
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

1996486
superclass	subclassing
this way you can call what is a private method outside of the class just by casting the subclassing object pointer to a superclass object pointer

1996492
submit	submission
i m not sure search engines index form submission locations and even if they did they certainly wouldn t index a form that submit to dynamic uris in the way that you want it to

1996500
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
we don t have to worry about snprintf or malloc realloc and free combination either

1996504
hide	show
so far i ve seen and i m using the following scripts to show hide a div or other controls depending on another control in asp.net

1996521
superclass	subclassing
the shorter version of the question is it ok to have a superclass with 2 subclassing one is an entity the other is a value object

1996526
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the latest versioning of the sdk 3.1.2 and it broke my application

1996540
stdout	stderr
then you can pass subprocess.pipe for the stderr stdout and or stdin parameters and read from the pipes by using the communicate method

1996581
sharepoint	spsite
a lot of referencing in sharepoint is done by using a url as a starting point just look at the constructor of spsite

1996592
gif	png
jpeg files don t have bit depth in the same manner as gif or png files

1996652
width	height
error shell widget xemacs has zero width and or height

1996658
multiplying	multiplication
how to multiplying two very large numbers greater than 32 characters for example multiplication of 100

1996675
width	height
you can get width and height using width and height

1996681
width	height
note that these both include the padding and border in their calculations whereas jquery height and width do not

1996714
octal	hex
if you encounter x or 0 you then need to read subsequent hex or octal digits to determine the character to insert

1996772
put	get
now to put anything new in you have to move one pile out of the way then another just to get to the shelf by the wall

1996811
hash	salt
if you make the salt dependent on just the password the same password will always result in the same hash

1996811
hash	salt
so basically the result is the same as if you d use a slightly different hash function without any salt

1996811
hash	salt
with the third method two users with the same password will usually get a different salt and the hash version of the password will look different for both users

1996815
inherited	subclassing
create subclassing that inherited from filepart called myfileheader myfileindex myfilebody etc

1996857
hash	salt
you use a salt function g hash g salt password

1996879
width	height
i am laying the divs out and specifying the height and width of each

1996904
children	parent
yes i agree option #2 is better - index the children when you re at the parent

1996950
strncmp	strncpy
write versions of the library functions strncpy strncat and strncmp which operate on at most the first n characters of their argument strings

1996956
int	double
for example you could see int and short as a restricted versions of double and a long as an extension of a byte

1996982
strncmp	strlen
in strncmp the strlen call on the input is not valid

1996983
post	put
this all worked fine until i put the system.componentmodel.dataannotations.stringlength attribute on the property in my model then when the view does a post from a submit button i got the exception

1996985
post	put
it is hard to implement and too hard to describe in a simple post and too valuable to just give away so sorry i can t provide more but searching on flood fill and dynamic programming will put you on the path if you want to go that route

1997021
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you know the range you want to look over you don t need to use the min max subquery in the cte

1997070
stdout	stderr
or even stdout and stderr

1997074
post	get
it has to be fixed at the input stage by iterating the get post cookies arrays and removing the slashes if you need your app to run on servers using the foul archaic wrongness that is magic_quotes_gpc

1997089
google-chrome	firefox
also i have ie8 firefox and google-chrome installed

1997137
daemons	systemd
in the .net world this would be many separate assemblies which represent the different logical portions of the subsystems not all of which might be needed by every webservice console application forms application web application or service daemons which comprise the systemd

1997141
mp3	wav
given an audio file mp3 or wav is here a way to get the duration size in bytes and other other attributes of the file

1997177
ant	maven
this sort of thing is rife in the java world ant maven etc

1997197
post	get
it looks like it s designed to be called to create an object on which the get post methods are called

1997263
hide	show
then supporting show hide in wpf is extremely easy

1997278
width	height
personally i would just make a table 100 height and width of body 0 0

1997325
firefox	safari
the products on the below page are getting displayed correctly in firefox safari and ie8

1997327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tried on mac osx with safari firefox and google-chrome and on ubuntue with firefox

1997335
post	get
i manage to accept domain.com 222 but if i use url_for post i still get domain.com post 222

1997344
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work ok in firefox and google-chrome

1997349
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen it in the past using firefox and tried your example on google-chrome to the same effect

1997364
vbscript	jscript
why not consider using the windows scripting host vbscript jscript or even powershell

1997375
persistent	transient
to have persistent code within such a wrapper that can service http requests rather than being transient like cgi scripts

1997418
post	get
if not then use your own algorithym to get the top 5 post

1997474
ddms	adb
that wasn t happening and looking at their debugging they suggest the reset adb link in the ddms perspective in the devices panel

1997482
clang	llvm
in this case i m compiling with clang + llvm on snowleopard with xcode 3.2.1 but this also happens with gcc 4.2 on both leopard and snowleopard

1997482
inherited	subclassing
what i don t understand is why it s throwing a warning for my direct nsobject subclassing when nsxmldocument has to inherited from nsxmlnode first

1997484
width	height
with plain css you could set only one dimension of the images either width or height and set the other as auto

1997484
width	height
the images will have a fixed 200px width and the height will depend on the aspect ratio

1997490
hash	salt	case-sensitive	case-insensitive
don t store the password in the db - store a salt hash also note that default case-insensitive collation will mean that neither username nor password are case-sensitively compared - usually passwords are case-sensitive you can use the t-sql hashbytes function with appropriate salt data and appropriate choice of hash function

1997490
hash	salt
here s the code i would recommend i left off the output parameter and assume the password is not stored but the hash is - and that the password is simply salt with the username to create the hash not always the best choice especially if you allow usernames to change and don t re-get the password properly to re-store a new hash plus user names are usually not case-sensitive

1997490
hash	salt
is it okay to store salt with hash

1997490
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

1997491
uilabel	uitextview
i want a counter that shows in a uilabel how many charachters the uitextview has

1997493
put	get
i am trying to get a message sent to a phone i have message coming in from a text area and then i assign it to content then i put content into message and then as you can see in my mail line i want the address to be the variable number vtext.com i have the while loop because there are many people in these files i wish to send a message to..

1997559
postgresql	mysql
unfortunately db2 s case statements need to end with end case when oracle sql server mysql postgresql doesn t

1997586
postgresql	mysql
any rdbms mysql sqlserver postgresql etc. will do

1997612
opera	safari
opera mini iphone safari blackberry browser windows mobile browser whatever

1997649
firefox	safari
are you testing in firefox or safari by chance

1997691
udp	tcp
i am trying to get a handle on what happens when a server publishes over tcp udp etc. faster than a client can consume the data

1997691
udp	tcp
do i just have to read the low level details of tcp udp

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i was wondering if with a uinavigationcontroller can you have a + sign like the contacts app that adds a row to the main root view and has a default name as setup then you can click on that row to go to one level below change a value in a uipickerview in the one level below uiviewcontroller and then press the back button and have that value from the uipickerview be the name of the new row that was created

1998170
nfa	dfa
the way i understand it re.compile or any regex system in any language converts the regex string into a finite automaton dfa or nfa and despite the ominous name compile it has nothing to do with the execution of any code

1998193
hide	show
by the way the initial dot in a file or directory name doesn t really hide the entry it s just that ls and and similar commands don t show them while these do

1998922
implements	extends
the best solution i have found yet is to implements a fixed number of typed properties on rotation and extends the mapping with a element for each

1998930
hide	show
there you create tabs using the resource editor and hide show based on the forms you want to display to the end user

1998965
jstl	taglib
jsp is just a view technology providing a template to write client side markup style scripting languages in such as html css js code alongside with the possibility to control the page flow dynamically with help of taglib such as jstl and access to backend data with help of el

1998965
implements	extends
basically just extends httpservlet and implements the doget to preprocess data or the dopost to postprocess the data

1998982
versioning	upgrade
if a new versioning exists we need to download it and upgrade the software

1998993
dreamweaver	fireworks
whilst i would agree with all of the comments above if you want to do this yourself or don t have the knowledge funds you can do it with the likes of dreamweaver fireworks but as everyone has said you won t get good html and unless you use it properly you ll have problems if you ever make changes to your page as changing sizes will break your layout

1999026
for-loop	loops
i can understand what a for-loop does but can t really understand what a while loops does

1999033
windows	wow64
if you know you are running on 64-bit windows then if it a process is running in wow64 mode then it must be 32-bit that is what wow64 is for - running 32-bit applications on 64-bit windows if not then you can assume 64-bit

1999037
jstl	taglib
anything which isn t possible with el or taglib like jstl would then technically and semantically belong in a real java class

1999071
hide	show
i need to show hide image in html page

1999077
min	max	width	height
by default windows imposes a constraint of caption bar height for height and about 100 pixels for width min max close buttons + a few letters of the name

1999107
apk	dex
how i can create apk application from two different dex file

1999112
memcpy	memset
some c functions are already linked in to do runtime setup so the compiler have these library functions like memset memcpy available to use

1999193
inherited	properties
also how the three important components - models controllers views are inherited from classes which already have methods and properties

1999202
accessor	properties
you need to mark your properties with synthetize in order for the compiler to generate the accessor methods

1999202
accessor	properties
if you don t want to generate the accessor then use the dot notation to access the properties

1999219
width	height
what width and height should i use on css

1999298
implements	extends
even then that s not complete enough as per microsoft rule for extends exceptions there are minimum 4 constructors that you should implements - namely

1999314
inherited	properties
once the project has this properties then every source file should inherited this properties

1999314
inherited	properties
every source file should then inherited this properties and your .obj files should be separated

1999323
button	checkbox
as with acces the gui would mainly comprise of controls such as radio button combo box populated from a table checkbox text boxes text areas and data grids

1999378
hide	show
jquery s domready show the image and hide the div

1999397
concave	convex
the polygon may be convex but bonus points if you come up with an algorithm that works for concave shapes

1999423
vb.net	vb6
in the end i converted the function call to a vb.net lib using the automatic project converter from vb6 to vb.net 2008 and called it using c# reference

1999428
des	aes
des is the predecessor of aes and is considered broken because of its short key length

1999473

what you really want to do is to place the configuration file in the profile directory or in a folder you create inside the profile directory

1999497
uitableview	reloaddata
when processing the notication i will run uitableview reloaddata

1999516
ant	maven
i d really appreciate any suggestions this community has to offer such as it really is better to just stick with ant or maven cause they work already or be sure to avoid make s dependency issue

1999552
translation	localization
you may wish to read wil shipley s post on localization called lost in translation and perhaps this blog post and this screencast tutorial as well

1999556
ant	maven
i would advocate always using continuous integration cruise control for ant or hudson for maven regardless of the build tool you use

1999565
concave	convex
should work for any polygon convex concave with holes in them i think given that what exactly you do for intersecting squares triangles handles such polygons

1999569
ant	maven
cobbling together your own build tool doesn t sound like a great use of your time especially when established tools such as ant and maven exist and have such vast user bases that are finding and fixing bugs with those tools

1999604
listview	gridview
i know it deals with a gridview but i adapted it to a listview as long as the underlying structure is a table and it worked fine for me

1999679
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
in php this would be done by calling htmlspecialchars on the inbox contents when displaying the inbox possibly along with nl2br and maybe turning links to tags

1999688
hide	show
basically when i use ajax.beginform with a onbegin function and this function returns false the loading elementid is still show and it never hide again

1999689
accessor	properties
objective-c allows you to automatically generate accessor by defining them as properties and synthesizing in implementation class

1999717
free	malloc
.c clean malloc mmapped heap and stack memory once allocated written then free but not reclaimed yet

1999767
ubuntu	linux
my estimate if you have powerful hardware and a big screen the combination of atom and iptv sounds like that than using a lfs linux from scratch ubuntu or something similar and create a flashy ui on top of that using qt opengl gtk swing ... is less pain than porting your libs apps to android

1999775
daemon	cron
crontab -l spits out the line above and running ps -a | grep cron shows usr sbin cron running which i assume is the cron daemon under mac os x

1999787
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
in your case you can use java.util.calendar class instead of java.util.date

1999794
many-to-many	one-to-many
suggest you create multiple views in the database filtered on the association_name column and then define many-to-many relationships in your mapping based on these and just enforce the one-to-many semantics in your code

1999824
hash	md5
up to what string length is it possible to use md5 as a hash without having to worry about the possibility of a collision

1999824
hash	md5
this would presumably be calculated by generating an md5 hash for every possible string in a particular character set in increasing length until a hash appears for a second time a collision

1999840
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox 3.5 etc

1999858
spweb	spsite
it s known that objects like spsite and spweb have to be dispose -d after a call otherwise memory leaks occur

1999896
width	height
object width 550 height 400

1999896
width	height
embed src somefilename.swf width 550 height 400

1999901
inherited	subclassing
languages the subclassing inherited all

1999901
width	height
a rectangle can be defined by two measures its width and height

1999901
width	height
it would be counterproductive to inherit the width and height of the rectangle class in the square class which would require extra constraints to ensure that the same value is provided to a setter for the width and a setter for the height

1999903
width	height
every div has a fixed width and height

1999950
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both firefox google-chrome but fails in ie

1999956
entity-relationship	entities
the tables that represent entities from an entity-relationship model should have a smiple pk

1999959
free	malloc
.c clean malloc mmapped heap and stack memory once allocated written then free but not reclaimed yet

1999966
installation	upgrade
we ve been considering trying out the tfs 2010 beta 2 as an upgrade from our existing installation but i cannot find anything in the docs explaining how many users are available

2000014
128bit	64bit
the mathematics of the birthday paradox make the inflection point of probability of collision roughly around sqrt n where n is the number of distinct bins in the hash function so for a 128bit hash as you get around 64bit you are moderately likely to have 1 collision

2000014
hash	md5
edit this assumes that the md5 hash algorithm causes a mapping from input bytestring to output hash that is close to random

2000023
free	malloc
.c clean malloc mmapped heap and stack memory once allocated written then free but not reclaimed yet

2000049
apache	nginx
the example configuration as shown on the github staticgenerator page is using nginx as the front-end http server and apache as the back-end http server

2000050
kde	gnome
if there is a command like the one described it is easy to add a shortcut to it from kde or gnome interface

2000065
freebsd	linux
will run on linux and perhaps rarely in freebsd

2000069
ssl	https
is the download link using https ssl

2000132
children	parent
from a select all children then select all i elements then select the parent or from a select all children then select all ii elements then select the parent

2000147
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	linuxmint
i am using linuxmint ubuntu linux 9.10

2000165
config	ini
i have used xml ini and yaml files for config in the python as well as in .net c# application

2000177
width	height
while building the flowdocument-table by code the height width of the tablerows are 0 of course

2000182
spweb	spsite
the solution i came up with involved parsing the url to figure out the spsite and spweb

2000182
spweb	spsite
since spsite takes a longer url you may also be able to open the right spweb as well using site.openweb

2000203
postgresql	mysql
if you ever port from mysql to say postgresql you will discover a very unpleasant fact that creating databases in postgresql is a comparatively very slow operation

2000205
postgresql	mysql
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

2000249
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you want some control on the order used by iterators use a treemap or a linkedhashmap

2000250
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
read the script with a bufferedreader see some examples appending each line to a stringbuilder

2000286
put	get
hashmap uses hash codes to store things so you have constant time for put and get operations but items are always unordered

2000303
post	get
it appears that you would have to have some type of application to create specific xml from your database that can be set with a post method to google and retrived with a get method for dislaying

2000311
min	max
also in this context constrained means between given min and max values

2000311
int	double
the system.random class provides random generation of int double and byte arrays

2000360
width	height
the adjustment here is to accommodate the thickness of your bold circle by adjusting the width height in the positive direction and adjusting the top and left in the negative direction by half to recenter

2000363
getter	setter
other features can t be supported simply because they would need language features like getter setter that can t be used in the browser yet due to poor support

2000377
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work fine for firefox google-chrome etc but internet explorer appears to work differently

2000379
hide	show
i d like to show hide divs based on which tags have been toggled show hide

2000379
hide	show
the tricky part is to show divs if any of its classes are toggled to show and hide if all of its classes are toggled to hide

2000388
width	height
i think i solved my own problem i can check the width and height of the image and then notify the user if the image is too big but i have another question how do i change the allowed amout of allocated memory

2000431
folder	directory
i ve edit the .htaccess file in that directory to protect this folder from allowing the unwanted visitors to download the contents manually by typing the full url

2000442
hide	show
if you first hide and then show it should do the trick

2000452
int	chars
if you know what the chars are meant to be i suggest you add some logging to indicate the unicode values of those chars as int and compare them with the code charts on unicode.org

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable does not allow indexed access to the collection whereas ilist does

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
if you need to go from ienumerable to ilist you may try a cast first if you get lucky it will work

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
if not you ll have to foreach over the ienumerable collection and build a new ilist

2000458
ienumerable	ilist
ilist implements ienumerable so if you pass your method an ilist you can safely use it as an ienumerable

2000545
getter	setter
you can map the private fields so that you can provide public getter setter that provide the correct view at the logical level

2000587
outputstream	inputstream
basically just create a servlet which gets an inputstream of it with help of fileinputstream and writes it to the outputstream of the httpservletresponse along with a correct set of response headers with at least the content-type

2000595
put	get
however when i go to put it on the sql server i get the error

2000612
stdout	stderr
these allow you to control an external console program from within perl and pass and read stdout stderr stdin information from it

2000630
children	parent
a simpler way to select a parent with specific children in jquery can be written as

2000676
subclass	accessor
coredata accessor are generated at run time for each subclass of nsmanagedobject etc

2000678
installation	upgrade
i try to perform a major upgrade with my msi installer with a quiet installation

2000691
button	checkbox
i am creating a table based on result from servlet which contains a checkbox when the checked property of checkbox is true there will be one button in the bottom of the table which calls for a remove function which removes that particular row from table this function is working when the table is created inside jsp using server tags but when it is created from jquery .getjson method it is not working

2000702
des	aes
hex formating elliptic curve cryptography and any of the algorithms for encryption such as aes rijndael des blowfish etc

2000706
ant	maven
i m using ant with maven to build a multi module project

2000728
width	height
i think i solved my own problem i can check the width and height of the image

2000729
width	height
npc normalized parent coordinates which is the default treats the viewport origin as 0 0 and assigns it a width height of 1 unit each

2000768
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
i ask because if i close a sqlconnection that has a sqltransaction object the transaction is rolled back

2000808
postgresql	mysql
i have seen the mysql_insert_id function for mysql and heard that pg_last_oid is similar for postgresql but the documentation claims that it is deprecated and will be removed soon

2000863
sorting	filtering
i would use the timestamp field for dates since it will make sorting filtering faster than it would be on a text field

2000884
put	get
i want to get a nested div in gwt and be able to put a widget in there

2000884
put	get
i want to be able to get content_left and put a widget in there

2000885
cstring	bstr
while i agree with the spirit of the above posters that a standard solution is better than the alternatives cstring is if your project uses mfc or atl anyway much nicer to work with than std string wstring conversions between ansi unicode through cstringa and cstringw bstr loading from string table cast operators to tchar .c_str

2000896
postgresql	mysql
mysql has the notion of autoincrement fields postgresql has the notion of sequences

2000918
client-side	server-side
i have an asp.net webform which i want to validate client-side and server-side using the same validation controls

2000926
cstring	bstr
i personally would go with cstring s in this case since you state that you re working with bstr s using com and writing this in mfc

2000926
cstring	bstr
as you noted cstring s also have built-in functions to help load strings and convert to bstr s and the like all pre-made and already built to work with windows

2000940
width	height
the bounds and frame would have the same width and height

2000949
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i use russian words in links encoded with urlencode so links are human-readable in most browsers - firefox google-chrome opera except for ie but this is not the real problem with this browser

2000973
int	chars	int	double
hint encoding a billion int into it would take quite a lot of chars billion 12 chars s long scale in binary it fits in a uint32_t now what about trying to encode a double

2000975
serializable	deserialization
there are good benchmarks from the java community on serializable deserialization and wire size of these technologies

2000989
temp	tmp
tmp c users sof appdata local temp

2001010
width	height
i think it might have to do with the fact that you are trying to set the height and width without css

2001010
width	height
i am not sure but if i was going to do it i would use the jquery .css method to set he height and width

2001054
google-chrome	firefox
adblock plus for firefox adthwart for google-chrome

2001108
haskell	ocaml
i have been programming in java for many years and haskell and ocaml for the last two years

2001219
min	max
so i cant define the max and min occurrences for product in a products list

2001251
multiplying	add
in general however the expression should be expected to be the more accurate in cases where they differ because it incurs only two roundings the square root and the add for any binary ieee-754 type whereas incurs three roundings square root add and multiplying

2001275
vb6	vba
a simple c# dll - how do i call it from excel access vba vb6

2001308
post	get
the controller has two login methods one for handling a get one for handling a post

2001308
post	get
by changing the method on the corporate site to do a form get rather than a post the username and password are preserved in the query string after the redirect and i could handle the requests that way but i would rather do a post and not pass that data around in the url

2001310
children	parent
take a binary tree for instance with references both down to left and right children and also up to parent

2001318
free	malloc
that is a potential memory leak anyway for every new there is a delete likewise same for malloc and free

2001320
disk	ram
i would recommend saving them to ram using whatever cache method suits you best and periodically writing the results to disk

2001322
post	get
it may help if you post the interfaces for monitoreddevice devicetypetoextend so we can get a better picture of what you re hoping to achieve

2001323
post	get
if you get the url to the file in the post you can propably use the simplexml_load_file function with the url but if that doesn t work you can use the file_get_contents in combination with the simplexml_load_string

2001401
jobs	cron
although the preferred method on os x for running automated jobs is launchd cron is still supported

2001415
vim	textmate
there are already plugins for all the main editors and ides to support django - from vim to textmate to netbeans - and these provide syntax highlighting indentation shortcuts and snippets for both python source and django templates

2001418

i have a div with a fixed width and height and overflow set to scroll

2001440
google-chrome	firefox
it works find in ie7 8 firefox google-chrome so on

2001483
stdout	fflush
if you re writing out every three seconds and sleep 3 is a good way to do that and it s not showing up every three seconds try putting in fflush stdout

2001525
width	height
did you try to set a width and height to that component

however to answer your original question there is really is no way to compare md5 or any hash against any type of encryption

2003840

mockito	easymock
i m not sure about how to do this with easymock but this behavior is possible with mockito because verification assertions can be specified at the end of the test

2006215
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
if you re trying to do something else can t quite imagine what. you should try qtableview combined with a qabstracttablemodel that you subclass to provide the content

2006227
kerberos	ntlm
a third variation is to try with authentication type set to kerberos instead of ntlm

2006233
abstract-class	superclass
a class can only extend one superclass and thus only one abstract-class

for instance masm can generate omf or coff object formats to be used by different linkers.

2006508
post	get
when using postsharp with a referenced assembly with proper pdb info checked with chkmatch it seems strange that the debug info gets lost by vstudio build and post compile process and i get the following error by using chkmatch to compare the assembly after the vstudio build

2006544
int	chars
in fact there s an implicit conversion from chars to int so you don t have to specify it explicitly as i ve done above but i would do so in this case to make it obvious what you re trying to do

2006580
int	chars
this will handle high surrogate chars that cannot be represented by a single int within the range that a chars can represent

2006612
put	get
to put them on a web server somewhere and make sure that every user get the correct binary when they try to download the app

2006640
put	get
alternatively if you put all your debug statements in an if __debug__ block they will get optimised out when python is run with the -o optimise flag

2006641
sorting	filtering
i m using filtering where clause sorting orderby and paging skip and take all over my app and need to handle this fairly generically

2006657
maven	pom.xml
you typically don t add the complete target folder of a maven project to your repository the rest should definetely go in there including the pom.xml

2006682
spweb	spsite
found a solution myself the trick i did not know is that if you use a long url in the constructor of the spsite it gives you the spweb object with the deepest possible address that matches your url described here

2006696
equinox	knopflerfish
there are 4 very popular open source implementations of osgi available concierge knopflerfish felix and equinox

2006698
swt	swing
if your only goal is to let users choose between swt or swing drawing their ui then swtswing would have been an option

2006698
swt	swing
swtswing is an implementation of the swt api using swing

2006714
chown	chmod
update the chmod and chown functions return true on success and false on failure so it would be a good idea to put them in an if clause

i use the m2e plugin primarily for searching for maven dependencies and adding them to my project

2006772
maven	pom.xml
both these tools are great for situational awareness of the state of your maven pom.xml and or your svn repo

2006809
trac	bugzilla
in my experience this is a much simpler sell than trac bugzilla and all the rest

2006820
inherited	properties
listener doesn t inherited the values it can get a reference to the object that dispatched the event using the event.target properties or a reference to the object with which the event listener was registered using the event.currenttarget properties

2006923
mockito	easymock	mockito	unitils	mockito	jmock	jmock	unitils	easymock	unitils	easymock	jmock
the use of di is important for mocking apis such as unitils mock easymock jmock and mockito because they always require mock instances to be passed to code under test

2006970
coalesce	isnull
you may also have to use isnull total 0 or coalesce total 0 depending on which dbms you are using and your query as stated by womp .

2007035
next	except
fadeinnew handles the new one by one fade in elsewhere but this was what i was looking for more or less with a bit of extra code around it to maybe shed some light on what was happening there s a next arrow with a url in its href if javascript is on i need the url of the next page relative to the current if it s off it follows that url as an href and loads a new page which has the same content on the page except for the new items that would have been .load-ed

2007084
rss	feed
trying to modify the rss feed created by views module in drupal

2007084
rss	feed
since there are no theme_ hooks for the rss feed rightfully as xml is theme-less i need an alternate way to modify the fields that are output into the rss preferably using template.php if possible

2007204
srp	principles
obviously i don t want to use the customer class since that would be against srp single responsibility principles also i don t see it as a good idea to attach the method to the customerfactory class since it s only role is to get customers from the database

put	get
it operates like a regular map with get put and remove methods but has a sort method that can be called to sorts the map

2007212
put	get
i understand that it might not be possible but i m hoping for o 1 get put and remove operations

2007212
dictionary	map
data structure for efficiently returning the top-k entries of a hash table map dictionary

2007214
persistent	transient
rule #2 the object to be persistent must mark all nonserializable fields transient

2007228
getter	setter
the very fact that you are exposing state or derived state as getter and setter breaks encapsulation and implies you are implementing an abstract data type rather than a true object-oriented class

2007276
post	get
someone else posted the .text method but deleted the post which will get you all the text minus the tags which means you ll get text i m interested in other crap i don t care about -- not what you want

2007353
folder	directory
some of the directory i m checking are source-code directory and they have .svn folder

2007373
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a uitableview in an iphone application which i am refreshing by calling in the action method for a uisegmentedcontrol dynamically embedded in one of the uitableview cells

2007373
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
it appears that each time the uitableview refreshes it creates a new instance of the uisegmentedcontrol and possibly the images - i m not sure over the existing one s

2007403
put	get
for o 1 get put and remove operations you essentially need o 1 lookup which implies a hash function as you know but the requirements of a good hash function often break the requirement to be easily sorted

2007416
switching	screens
so the -x switching may be to execute a screens command as opposed to a shell command

2007421
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2007438
hide	show
if you need to generate result2 based on what the user selects in result1 then you need to either create rows for every possible selection then use javascript to show or hide or utilize ajax calls much better

2007460
folder	dir
but the dir folder will not have the whatever.php

2007542
httpcontext	httpmodule
seem to have found a solution if i create a variable for the httpapplication on init of the httpmodule this all occurs in the httpcontext can be accessed from that variable

2007543
folder	directory	folder	dir
lets say you are in a page at and want to access something in the dir folder you could specify .. inthedir.php to move up one directory or .. .. intheroot.php to move up two

2007545
width	height
we can actually just add any kind of control to the dialog set the height and width to 0 css and set the focus on it to get the refresh working

2007563
division	multiplication
arithmetic shifts can be useful as efficient ways of performing multiplication or division of signed integers by powers of two

2007589
allocator	stl
your can then use all stl classes giving them your allocator type as template argument

2007641
dictionary	map
this allows the order of name bindings in the class body to be preserved and used while the normal dictionary loses order which is sometimes nice when the class must have fields in a certain specific order to map 1 1 onto a c struct a row in a csv file or db table and the like -- in python 2

2007661
post	get
yes it s for java not c but the last post on this thread outlines how to get input to work in eclipse console

2007666
children	parent
the obvious answer from that is that parent blocks run before their children s but that could just be a coincidence and doesn t help if two classes aren t in the same hierarchy

2007734
rss	feed
i want to make something which parses some atom or rss feed and displays some content in a gridview

2007734
rss	feed
previously when i ve done this sort of thing in pythion i use a general purpose feed parser which can parse pretty much anything rss atom

2007775
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse that works for you

2007782
subtract	add
to move it somewhere else do a translation transform first or modify the code to subtract add in the desired origin

2007783
hide	show
how can i use javabuilders + miglayout to position two separate buttons go stop in the same location and put the progressbar in a particular location so that i can show hide the gui controls as necessary

2007789
rss	feed
since rss atom feed are essentially xml documents you can use saxparser which is part of the standard java libraries included with android

2007820
hide	show
how can i use javabuilders + miglayout to position two separate buttons go stop in the same location and put the progressbar in a particular location so that i can show hide the gui controls as necessary

2007820
hide	show
add the controls to the panels show hide the panels as required

2007846
width	height
i don t think you can disable the large size but you can set it s width and height to be the same as the medium size

2007895
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a popular gnu linux distro which is fairly easy to install and quite straightforward

2007895
unix	solaris
there are too many books that come to mind but what really moved me from my old dos days to unix solaris first was kernighan and pike s unix programming environment

2007900
jobs	cron
more on cron jobs

2007940
portrait	landscape
also is there any way to restrict the orientation to just up and down portrait and reverse portrait and not have a rotation on landscape

2007955
sorting	filtering
now i want to add filtering and sorting

2007955
sorting	filtering
i assume sorting and filtering are a standard practice within ddd and design patterns thus the question

2007980
int	chars	int	double
because the class contains a double it will be 8 byte aligned meaning the chars will be padded by 7 bytes and the int will be padded by 4 to ensure that in an array of some_object all elements would be 8 byte aligned

2007992
sorting	filtering
ideally you ll probably want to do the sorting and the filtering inside the repository

2007993
virtualbox	parallels
i use virtualbox free but parallels is also good though commercial

2008000
webclient	webrequest
one thing you can do is start by building a manual proxy using webclient or webrequest webresponse

2008010
folder	directory
create a temporary directory install ruby into a sbin subdirectory and chroot into the temp folder

2008048
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux is a pretty easy place to start

2008048
ubuntu	linux
i m in awe of how easy the ubuntu people have made things and having your own linux install to play with really helps

2008054
superclass	subclassing
is there anyway that i can cast from the generic subclassing to the generic superclass or is this covariance and a c# 4.0 thing

2008108
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome this works however in firefox with greasemonkey the last line fails and the protection is not removed

2008126
keydown	keyup
is there something i m missing in how to implement the keydown and keyup for the shift key

2008132
opera	google-chrome
you could use the greasemonkey stuff to import jquery via url at the top but this is greasemonkey specific google-chrome opera etc

2008175
width	height
assume i have a bean dialogbox with properties for height and width

2008204
mouseover	mouseout
on application mouseover call a javascript function to disable the mouse scroll wheel and enable it on application mouseout

2008209
daemons	systemd
if you really do need to do locking because you are writing to some external service like a bit of hardware then you can use a typical unix approach to locking resources and write a single-instanced daemons that runs on a local socket which all your web services can talk to - depending on if it indicates a resources is busy they could either reject requests or queue them in memory in a queueing systemd a table in an sql db etc. with a a daemons which process queued requests which also talks to the locking service

2008288
filesystems	fat
if true this option enables various workarounds to enable git to work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive like fat

2008288
git-clone	git-init
the default is false except git-clone 1 or git-init 1 will probe and set core.ignorecase true if appropriate when the repository is created

2008289
post	get
below is a list of some brief tutorials to get you started although each of these subjects could easily warrant a post as big or bigger than this one

2008315
textview	imageview
i would just show dialog with imageview photo textview information and button to close dialog

2008324
folder	directory
if the file is located in a different directory you could use server.mappath path to the file.txt where corresponds to the root folder of your web application

2008362
strdup	malloc
if i use malloc directly rather than strdup it won t crash

2008362
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
possibly because strdup is using the default malloc while the free call is using dlmalloc s free

2008380
spaces	delimiter
the command should be spaces delimiter with each path wrapped in quotes to properly include their embedded strings

2008386
range	max	range	min	min	max
note that i have reduced the min max by assuming the next array index in the sequence is always greater than the previous range

2008389
post	get
most of the interaction in browser comes down to an http get or an http post

2008409
projectile	angle
which should give me the angle from which i can calculate the horizontal and vertical velocities needed to launch the projectile

2008416
int	chars
there is operator sizeof int sizeof chars so i think that it is possible and call probably look like sizeof myclass

2008459
int	double
but i ve used this in the past for storing int double and serialised java objects via xstream so i can confirm it works well

2008479
allocator	stl
you can define a custom allocator type see this link for a good tutorial on how to do so the interface needed etc and use that exclusively with your stl types it s a template argument

2008537
affinity	processors
yes unless you utilize processors affinity threads one or many will be scheduled on whatever processors the kernel thread management code assigns

2008551
django	web2py	pylons	cherrypy	pylons	web2py	web2py	cherrypy
cherrypy django pylons web2py zope 2 zope 3 etc

2008582
skip-lists	tree
a deterministic skip-lists has a 1-1 mapping to a 2-3 tree so with some more work the procedure described above could work for a 2-3 tree as well

2008588
getter	setter
i find making getter setter on objects is best to pass data from one object to another in cocoa-type apps

2008588
getter	setter
create a setter method on your app delegate that accepts the lat value sets it internally to the app delegate object in a protected property and finally make a separate getter method that simply returns the lat value from the app delegate

2008588
getter	setter
or put the setter getter methods on whatever object makes sense in your app

2008588
getter	setter
the naming convention is usually setnameofvar and getnameofvar for setter and getter respectively

2008599
ubuntu	linux
then i run this program with gdb by the way i m using linux ubuntu 9.04 g++ 4.3.3 gnu gdb 6.8-debian and set a breakpoint at the end of the definition of compute_n_best_parses with some conditions to locate the exact call of this function i wanted i was tracing back from a segmentation fault

2008666
accessor	properties
you can avoid having to fuss with retaining properties by using the self notation to call the accessor and setter methods created by the synthesize directive

2008679
mvp	presenter
the basic idea behind the view presenter portion of a mvp design is that view is lightweight

2008679
mvp	presenter
if you find yourself making radical changes to the presenter to reflect the new ui then likely it not a clean mvp design

2008686
ubuntu	linux
as others have mentioned ubuntu is a great distribution to play with if you ve never used linux before

2008773
postgresql	mysql
i ve noticed that the connection adapters for mysql have options that specify the required info for setting up an ssl connection but there is no equivalent options for the postgresql postgresql adapter

2008845
composite	memento
i use singleton flyweight composite iterator memento observer state strategy as a matter of routine

2008873
integer	unsigned
note that you can not mix inet_ntoa inet_aton in mysql with ip2long long2ip in php since mysql uses an int unsigned datatype while php uses a signed integer

2008931
mousemove	keydown
my question is how do i get the mousemove or keydown event in the parent window that hosts this childwindow

2008944
firefox	safari
i can get the ads to work when i view the site on a mac using firefox or safari

2009007
folder	directory
the embedded fonts folder is in the project directory and was copied along with it and all references to the fonts that i was able to find were relative paths

2009015
ascx	onclientclick
if you want to add your own javascript functions on the code behind you can use btn1.attributes.add onclientclick yourjs or if in aspx ascx side you can use onclientclick

2009059
post	get
the fb client tries to use available data to authenticate - post get cookies - but if it fails it will redirect to an fb login

2009067
versioning	upgrade
the script requires php 5.1.0 which is out since 2005-11-24 - time to upgrade if not yet at this versioning and gd which is rarely missing from good web hosts

2009094
getter	setter
if you want to be careful paranoid i d have an empty class with virtual getter setter methods as the base class rather than as above so compiler keeps the code correct

2009101
maven	m2e
i did that with tons of projects maven and eclipse live side-by-side without m2e

2009101
maven	m2e
a second option is to try to integrate eclipse and maven with m2e plugin as crowne mentioned but i found this unnecessary

2009126
stdout	stderr
glib gtk are quite verbose with errors to stdout stderr is there nothing there

2009133
post	get
and when a collection of workposts are lazy loaded from the owning work post sheet i get the following select statement

2009139
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it only happens on ie7+ works fine on other browsers like firefox safari opera and google-chrome

2009152
udp	tcp
if you transmit data over tcp data that doesn t match up with the crc will be rejected but the same data transmitted over udp with the same corruption might be accepted

2009257
children	parent
i am working on a c# project that has a mdi parent form hosting multiple mdi children form

2009257
children	parent
but when i close the mdi parent without close the mdi children form first the tcplistner did not get stopped

2009273
google-chrome	firefox
if i m using google-chrome or firefox i just need to be patient

2009278
centos	linux
python version 2.6.2 os is linux 2.6.18 centos release 5.4 and it s vps machine

2009320
int	chars
the raw value of a chars has an int equivalent

2009332
int	chars
because in java chars is an integral data type whose values are 16-bit unsigned int representing utf-16 code units

2009332
int	chars
in case you re talking about the fact that int value assignment to chars normally gives you a possible loss of precision compiler error as the following code will demonstrate

2009332
int	chars
in the second 3-line version the assignment isn t allowed because the int variable could take any value from -2147483648 to 2147483647 inclusive most of which are out of range for the chars variable to contain

2009352
html5lib	beautifulsoup
use an html parser instead like beautifulsoup html5lib hpricot or nokogiri

2009405
width	height
take all letters as divs with some background while letter e is where the content is placed and it is dynamic so it can get any height while the width will be 100 for whole window there is another div as the menu floating left of that div but i didn t consider it here

2009411
innodb	myisam
at the end it will have something like engine innodb or engine myisam

2009428
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the rtm versioning here

2009450
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the rtm versioning of powershell 2.0 here

2009513
addclass	removeclass
i don t think addclass and removeclass have duration parameters

2009535
firefox	safari
however even their demo for addclass does not work in safari 4 but worked fine in firefox 3.5

2009568
folder	directory
in the first project i upload some images to a specific folder under the project root and save just the filename in the database now i am trying to display this images at some page of the second project i know the filename from the database and the image folder as absolute pat but i have not been able to display the image even thought when looking in firebug the image src is correct the image does not display probably because it is not pointing in the right directory

2009573
put	get
i am thinking the way to accomplish this in the changeparentfunction is to call a controller action to get a new list then grab the mylistbox object and reassign it but am unsure how to put it all together

2009576
int	chars
returns nil for no match or an int chars position if there

2009584
mouse	keyboard
more specifically i need the application to stop processing all input both mouse and keyboard when the dialog is launched and resume when it s closed

2009584
mouse	keyboard
to summarize how do i disable enable user input in a qt application both mouse and keyboard shortcuts

2009597
for-loop	arrays
could i use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays with all of the values converted to strings at the output

2009643
uilabel	uibutton
some people write functions that add 1000 or some other integer that allows you group types of subviews together √¢ uilabel instances get 1000 1001 and so on and uibutton instances would get 2000 2001 etc

2009676
hide	show
i am using this code to hide and show a div based on which thumbnail you rollover

2009684
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog box that pop-up you should be able to choose the php editor

2009778
stdout	stderr
you should also scan p.geterrorstream - some programs write to stderr which is indistinguishable from stdout when run from the command line

2009864
firefox	safari
when developing simple code against ie6 and safari i found that going back to firefox and ie8 is incredibly easier

2009873
put	get
2 if the .pyc files are actually bundled inside the python exe by py2exe or put in the same directory as the .exe or put into a named subdirectory which is then set as part of the pythonpath variable e.g w pylib i get importerror no module named os os is the first module imported before sys and anything else

2009917
maven	pom.xml
to do so you need to add the jboss maven repository to the pom.xml of your project

2009953
prepare	execute
prepare statements explicitly tells mysql what is sql and what is data so mysql won√¢ t execute any sql in the data

2010043
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	submit	submission
once setting the action for the form in firefox safari google-chrome the submit method works fine while in ie 8 nothing happens when submit is called i am submission a form to paypal not that it matters

2010139
hide	show
the alternative is that all three steps be on the base page to begin with and you can show hide tham as required

2010140
redhat	fedora
i m trying to install ffmpeg on a virtual dedicated server with redhat fedora core 7 but get the following error

2010181
bitset	bitvector
it s often called a bitset or bitvector

2010210
sml	scheme
i mean types very broadly speaking to include such things as caml module types sml signatures and plt scheme units . to communicate how a large application works i suggest three things

2010215
put	get
if i just add an int to the structure then if i put too many objects let s say 70 so much less than the limit of the block i get a segmentation fault when writing

2010243
switching	accessory	switching	screens

apache	lighttpd
apache supported configurations lighttpd cgi this is mostly a dying-off method of hosting

2014241
fastcgi	scgi

for lighttpd nginx they can handle a large number of connections thousands in a tiny memory footprint often just a few megs per thousand connections depends on factors like buffers and how async io apis are set up

2014241
nginx	lighttpd
if you truly need to scale to 1000 connections or more and want keep-alive you will want to look at nginx lighttpd and other lightweight event-based servers

2014241
apache	nginx
it might be noted that if you do want apache for configuration ease of use or need to host certain setups you can put nginx in front of apache using http proxying

2014241
apache	nginx
this will allow nginx to handle keep-alive connections and preferably static files and apache to handle only the grunt work

2014241
apache	nginx
nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

the reason it doesn t exist is because there is a symbolic link so if b is usr name folder file then b really is mnt mounttest because the symlink is to that directory

2014610
gif	png
but you ll have to find out what the image type is - trial and error will do i guess it s gotta be one of image jpeg image png or image gif surely

2014616
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction on pointers is based on the type so for example array+1 and will yield different results

2014870
config	ini
try this module from cpan config ini reader

2014879
distance	polygons
the most intuitive scale factor would be the ratio of distance from current mouse position to the polygons centre to distance from mouse position at start of drag to the polygons centre - so that clicking on a point in the polygons and dragging it twice as far from the centre as it was doubles the size of the polygons

2014899
post	get
i wrote a blog post several years ago on how to determine the number of lines in the textbox as the user sees them and get the index of a given line like to get the line at index perhaps this post will help

2014902
cos	inverse	cos	sin
obviously i m not talking about simple inverse sin cos and tan seeing as those are all provided by the math class

2014928
int	boolean
nsnumber objects are also used to represent and persist boolean as well as int and floats but not currency in core data

2014944
width	height
my first idea was placing a div with the color i intend with the same width and height as the ad div and applying an opacity setting to it so that it blends together

2014955
set	bag
if you don t want sorting semantics you should use a set or a bag depending on whether you allow duplicate elements or not

2014955
ilist	icollection
a bag persists icollection or ilist but provides no guarantees for indexing is an unordered collection that allows duplicates

2014958
udp	tcp
in the firewall control panel i didn t double check that the firewall had opened port 1433 tcp and 1434 udp on the public network which is what win7 treats the loopback adapter network as

2014984
int	double
you can t do anything with a struct that doesn t have a type determined at compile time so you ll probably want a master struct with lots of fields so it can handle all the int s all the bool s all the float s all the double s and so forth any of your structs is going to have

2015002
qsslsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
is there any way to replace qsslsocket used by qnetworkaccessmanager with my own implementation

2015015
rss	feed
how do you do you fetch a single rss feed and show it in an listview

2015047
hash	salt
hash that password with a salt

2015047
hash	md5
if you have to use md5 sha use a technique called stretching and hash it s hash several thousand times

2015052
hash	salt
it s generally good practice to store the password as a salt one-way hash of the actual password rather than storing it as cleartext

2015064
postgresql	mysql
regarding the database - if it were me i d try postgresql rather than mysql

2015090
int	boolean
the values 1 and 0 are of type int and are not implicitly convertible to boolean

then use xmlreader to loop over the xml elements and execute my prepare query plugging in values for the parameters

2015185
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
there s a catch the viewwillappear viewdidappear methods won t be called unless you call them yourself so you ll have to insert those in the right places too

2015236
int	boolean
on a related note the java compiler uses int to represent boolean since jvm has a limited support for the boolean type.see section 3.3.4 the boolean type

2015249
post	get
the problem with your script is that though you re sending a post method you re adding the data in the url as though it were a get

2015263
short	base
but i imagine one way you could implement a short url is by incrementing the value using the characters 0-9a-za-z -- essentially using a base 62 number system

2015321
int	boolean
what i did was create a separate table called location_properties columns were id int location_id foreign key is_hidden boolean

2015321
hide	show
that i should be able to simply check for the existence of the location_id to hide or show it

2015348
onclick	onsubmit
in the onclick of the button or i assume the onsubmit of the form then tinymce ensures the value is saved and the validation occurs properly

if you want to investigate further you could look at spring.net microsoft unity autofac linfu or one of many other frameworks

2015353
uiview	calayer
the documentation says not to use the uiview the layers reside in as this is reserved for the main calayer of the view

2015356
folder	directory
update my application creates a cahce file in this directory when it runs which looks like the reason the folder is not removed during the uninstall

put	get
but put the contents of a word doc in there and can t get it out

2015409
post	get
you should always check sanitize all data you get in your php code because anyone could post data to all of your pages

2015412
fast-forward	merge
the branches which do exist both in origin and upstream need to be synchronized as well rebasing your local branches on top of those from upstream before pushing your work to origin can be a good way to make very easy pull request to upstream bitprophet would only have fast-forward merge to do to include your work

2015444
post	get
so be sure to verify and sanitize all the data you receive no matter if post or get or update or whatever

2015447
ubuntu	linux
some linux distributions like ubuntu split the packages between the library runtime and the dev files so you need to install both packages

2015490
switching	screens
once you make your nice little game engine with menus and screens ready to be reused asobu the timeline seems a bit pointless for switching views

2015501
put	get
you get to put it on your resume

2015555
versioning	upgrade
i also had a really old versioning of livna already installed so i had to upgrade rather than install

put	get
when i try to put more than one of these controls in my main silverlight control i get a xamlparseexception with the message the name already exists in the tree

2015704
hide	show
there are different approaches that can be taken to accomplish this the application might close the window and open a new copy when restoring or it might simply hide the original window and show it upon restoring

2015715
config	ini
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files

2015739
post	get
but i want to use post and not get since get is not suitable for this kind of stuff changing something

2015780
websphere	ibm
as i said above goes well doesn t really makes sense as this depends on the container you are using and containers might have different compatibility requirements for example ibm websphere s j2ee 1.4 server may not work with jdk 5

2015784
jobs	cron
this is a redesign of a legacy system that currently controls everything with a plethora of cron jobs

2015784
jobs	cron
the cron jobs currently have the ability to send sms messages or emails should one of the tasks fail

2015838
glassfish	geronimo	websphere	ibm
note that these download packages actually include sun s version of java ee glassfish these days which is different than apache s version of java ee tomcat geronimo or ibm s version of java ee websphere

2015861
decoder	encoder
apache commons offers a decent encoder decoder

2015911
jobs	cron
if so then your dba s objection is irrelevant you don t want to run the jobs when the database is offline for planned downtime and the dba ought to have something in place to alert them if the database is down for unplanned reasons rather than relying on a signal from a failing cron job

2015931
entities	entitymanager
edit additionally the persistentcontext type is transaction-scoped by default 16.11.1.1 in the spec so all entities managed by entitymanager are detached at the end of each transaction

2015940
put	get
call gettransactionisolation before the query to get the current mode so you can put it back after the stmt if you like

2016015
int	chars
you declare an int to tell the program after how many chars you wish to insert the second string into the first

2016131
post	get
your request get post hits the router then your router says that the post urls belongs to the postscontroller and the action is index

2016131
post	put
then when you edit something and click the submit button it makes a request by default a put to post passing all the values in the form then your controller gets the post values of the requests the ones you see in the server log and makes his work like saving the post s datas

2016186
width	height
say i have an .jpg image on the file server and that i need to get its height and width

2016186
width	height
so how do you get the actual height and width of an image in asp.net

2016242
addclass	removeclass
then use the addclass removeclass to finish it up

2016277
keydown	keyup
this is going to be a shot but you did say you have the keyup keydown and keypress event handlers right

2016277
keydown	keyup
it could be that both keyup and keydown are conflicting.

2016277
keydown	keyup
my suggestion is to change the code completely in this manner as shown take out either keydown or keyup event handler as they simplistically put it are the same ok technically it is designated respectively for when a key is pressed down and likewise when a key is released

2016290
client-side	server-side
without server-side sessions you could try to achieve this with client-side session cookies or inspecting the referrer header but then it s trivial for the clients to fake as these are just strings that they send you and you accept their word for it

2016311
implements	extends
java s java.io.closeable interface implements by streams automagically extends autocloseable so you can already use streams in a try block the same way you would use them in a c# using block

2016329
cvs	svn
a dialog will appear asking weather this is a cvs or svn project

2016352
ocl	uml
it occurs in several books has a relation to ocl which is considered part of uml but the latest ocl specification by omg no longer mentions these terms

2016369
post	put
there would be no need to put the post into the same group as a user and in fact this would be a bad idea since comments posted in any of a users post would all be contending to write the same entity group

2016407
int	double
as i mentioned i assume it has to do with double precision as it also works fine with int eq 8 2 16

2016422
public	protected
the public and protected methods of the base class can still access private variables of the base class and these methods are available in the derived class

2016464
implements	extends
wnere the tank and soldier classes both extends from or implements enemy like this

2016483
int	chars
the static modifier is not necessary and you have to explicitly cast your int to a chars

2016506
getter	setter
using getter and setter is good for the encapsulation of code

2016544
post	get
lastly i switched the the methods from get methods to post methods wrote a bit of code using webrequest webresponse with the same result

2016550
hide	show
enables or disables the show hide grid button which appears on the right side of the caption layer

2016619
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
i d like to have a uiviewcontroller which has an add and a trash button both right to the title either by adding two uibutton to the navigation item bar or by adding them to a uisegmentedcontrol and then adding the segmentedcontrol to the item

2016636

the xibs compiled fine using 3.0 but when i upgrade to 3.1.2 i started getting the error pattern colors are not supported by the iphone sdk for iphone os versioning prior to 3.0.

2016641
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
to write preference files you can use the nsuserdefaults or cfpreferences apis

2016652
tax	shipping
it enables you to specify a url for paypal to call your web service with the buyer√¢ s shipping address so you can provide the buyer with more detailed shipping insurance and tax information

2016652
tax	shipping
2.your callback server responds with the available shipping options for that address along with any insurance options and tax adjustments on the order

2016665
super	extends
extends the defaultsingleselectionmodel and overiding the setselectedindex method seems to do the job fine calling the super method only if the switch is to be permitted

2016704
post	put	post	get	put	get
i wrote a blog post on how to get around this issue and i even put up some code for helper methods you can swipe from my site

this tool allows to generate a unique cross-platform installer provides native integration is highly customizable covers the uninstall part and the generation of the installer can be easily included in an automated build ant or maven based

2016745
dictionary	map
this doesn t make any less meaningful practical necessary to map dictionary to other objects

2016765
implements	extends
basically i want to know why an abstract decorator class must be created which implements or extends some interface or abstract class

2016765
implements	extends
why can t all the new decorated classes simply implements or extends the base abstract object themselves instead of extends the abstract decorator class

2016782
hide	show
then the user can hide and show them via button clicks

2016785
public	protected
those protected or public base class methods can still invoke the private base class methods

2016788
pull	push
however i do not want all of these commits to go on github so a simple clone and then just push pull approach does not suit

2016788
pull	push
so pc1 and pc2 should be able to push pull to the local network share and thus share code between each other and every once in a while i want to push those changes to my github repository

2016788
pull	push
creating the repository on the server without --bare means that it has it s own work dir so when i git push from the pcs the server does not pick that up i m guessing i somehow need git pull from the pcs but i want to avoid that

2016828
hash	md5
i would probably base the md5 hash on a combination of unique identifier and a random number

2016855
put	get
but when i put struts in my web-inf lib directory and try to make a struts app i get the below in the log file

2016860
accessor	properties
indexers resemble properties except that their accessor take parameters.

2016864
accessor	properties
a get accessor of a properties corresponds to a method with no parameters whereas a get accessor of an indexer corresponds to a method with the same formal parameter list as the indexer

2016864
accessor	properties
a set accessor of a properties corresponds to a method with a single parameter named value whereas a set accessor of an indexer corresponds to a method with the same formal parameter list as the indexer plus an additional parameter named value

2016864
inherited	properties
in an overriding properties declaration the inherited properties is accessed using the syntax base.p where p is the properties name

2016872
pull	push
if you make a git clone --bare mygithubrepo.git on your share and then clone that sharedrepo on pc1 and pc2 you have set up for each of those pc repo a natural destination for them to push pull

2016881
pull	push
developers that don t have push access to the main remote can push pull to a separate remote

2016883
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note firefox google-chrome and safari use the same service maybe it s of google too

2016891
for-loop	arrays
but i d recommend the for-loop to avoid clashing with library modifications or when firefox suddenly decide to implement its own each method for arrays some libraries have already been bitten by this

2016895
qtcore	qtgui
i m not sure why it wasn t auto-included but i think it has something to do with qtcore only being used by qtgui which is a c++ lib.

2016930
pop-up	dialog
2- the div becomes visible but no dialog window pop-up

2016947
solaris	bsd
it will only run on x86 systems not sparc etc. with directx compliant hardware rendering units graphics cards and it will not run on a system with strong hardware abstraction like most unices like bsd or linux or solaris

2016960
bash	zsh
you could switch to zsh instead of bash

2016960
bash	zsh
zsh has lots of other features that bash lacks but that one alone is worth making the switch for

2016975
ant	buildr
i have a buildr script that first loads a java properties file then creates an ant task

2016975

alternately if you re using updatepanel use scriptmanager s equivalent register... methods

2017138
ubuntu	debian
in the server debian ubuntu instructions

2017207
client-side	server-side
there s no bit of client-side or server-side for that matter validation that takes longer to run than the second or so that is an acceptable response time

2017218
memset	malloc
i would equate that roughly to someone listing c c++ on their resume and being expected to write a short program that uses basic language features like sizeof memset or malloc

2017293
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
swfobject will be executed as soon as it is read and will perform all dom manipulations as soon as the dom is loaded - for all browsers that support this like ie firefox safari and opera 9+ - or otherwise as soon as the onload event fires

2017315
post	put
edit i put box-shadow in the post earlier but i meant the respective specific directives such as -moz-box-shadow

2017334
width	height
i am not sure if you need to use a particular container but in any event set the width and height to 100 and use grid gridrow and griditem to size and resize text control you can specify the width of the table or just use it just like an html table in flex to manipulate the size of controls and containers..

2017362
stdout	stderr
so you need to call createpipe twice to create two pipes one for stdin one for stdout and stderr

2017398
hash	md5
at a minimum the password should be stored as a sha1 md5 hash

2017416
width	height
i have a simple dimensions class containing a width height property and a constructor to set them

free	malloc
our malloc sticks magic cookies before and after a malloc block of memory and checks these on free

2017502
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
then use gobjdump you might have to install that yourself from macports fink homebrew to see what s inside the files and compare the two versions

2017523
cout	cin
my students who learn cin and cout first then learn printf later overwhelmingly prefer printf or more usually fprintf

2017553
for-loop	arrays
the information received in an arrays so i use for-loop to append them to my html page in this way

2017623
getter	setter
unless i am thoroughly mistaken the getter setter pattern is a common pattern used for two things

2017623
getter	setter
to make sure that in the future if you happen to have a problem to which a good solution would be simply to treat the variable before it goes in and or out of the class you can treat the variable by using an actual implementation on the getter and setter methods instead of simply returning or setting the values

2017679
getter	setter
you can also use a getter or setter type method to get or set computable values much the way properties are used in other languages like c#

2017711
int	double
yet in the getcursorqd you are using a double address of int

2017736
maya	blender
i am taking an opengl course and we have the option to create models to use in our assignments with a 3d modeling application like maya or blender

2017763
maya	blender
there are many options when exporting from a 3d program like maya or blender

2017783
getter	setter
the point of the getter setter pattern is to give the clas control over it s data and to decrease coupling other class knowing how data is stored

2017806
yacc	bison
is there any alternative to flex and bison lex yacc combo

2017821
swt	swing
qt jambi is much simple and easier to use than swing and swt

2017898
post	put
so i ll put up a link to that post as well

2017983
inherited	subclassing
the code in __new__ might also be used to allow sorteddict to be subclassing in a diamond inherited structure where it is possible sorteddict.__init__ is not called before the first __setitem__ and the like are called

2017997
interpreted-language	compiled-language
java is a statically typed compiled-language while ruby is a dynamically typed interpreted-language

2018009
inherited	subclassing
but the parent class inherited it and the subclassing inherited the parent class

2018036
testdriven.net	xunit.net
xunit.net also provides support for this and works well with testdriven.net

2018044
getter	setter
as i understand it you should and can avoid custom getter and setter and then you can leave core data to do it s thing and not worry about retain release

2018051
put	get
i would just put this in the of your document and apply the class to the html element instead of body so you don t get a fous or flash of unstyled content

2018059
for-loop	loops
i am trying to see if i can convert a for-loop to a foreach loops

2018074
urllib	httplib
with google app engine you can use any of httplib urllib or urllib2 but all of them are just wrappers for google s url fetch api

2018088
accessor	properties
the reason of that relies on the properties accessor the dot notation

2018092
post	get
use post for large data instead of get

scrollable	panels
it worked when in design mode resizing the picture box and web browser would cause the panels to enable its scrollbars but didn t work during runtime i added code to have the picture box change to the size of the web browser control - which itself is always resized to fit the size of the scrollable contents

2018135
public	protected
there are public private and protected methods

2018243
swt	swing
different toolkits i.e swing swt have their own way of doing things

2018279
identifier	ambiguous
backticks are used to qualify identifier that could otherwise be ambiguous ie

2018286
keydown	keyup
the browser will should fire a separate keydown keyup event for each key even if they are simultaneously pressed

2018288
keydown	keyup
maybe you can do it by keeping track of keydown and keyup event for each key and you ll know if two keys are being held at the same time

2018301
onkeyup	onkeydown
javascript has onkeydown and onkeyup events

2018322
cpu	processors
when tracking cpu statistics be aware that multiple processors and multiple cores will complicate any accurate statistics in some cases

2018370
button	checkbox
updated this answer works for checkbox radio button input and textareas

2018379
int	boolean
this code fails because int newid is boolean

2018384
getter	setter
false will make hibernate start faster since it does not try to build cglib-enhanced objects to access getter setter and use standard jdk reflection for access

2018385
jar	manifest.mf
put your code in a jar i ll call it app.jar along with a meta-inf manifest.mf file with entries like this

2018390
profiling	instrumentation
maybe some kind of instrumentation that can give me per-function time profiling

mouse	keyboard
you can easily capture dynamic ranges where you use the mouse keyboard to mark top-left and bottom-right corners as well as pre-specified ranges like same range as last time or the current window with simple key combinations this last one is ideal for our demo and documentation purposes

in fact the documentation warns about the automatic width for the columns feature and my attempts to use dynamic width and height for the table itself failed

2018662
bids	ssis
my thought after breifly looking at and playing with bids and ssis is that building a package with the gui would seem to provide a substantial productivity boost over them having to write custom reformatting logic

2018943
jar	manifest.mf
an executable jar has a main class defined in the jar s manifest.mf file and the manifest also allows the definition of a class path to include libraries that the code in the executable jar will need

google-chrome	safari
google-chrome achieves this using the open source webkit rendering engine which is also used by apple s safari web browser

2019572
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
if i m correct than you need to have an extra column like ismultipleanswers bit in the table in db or whatever the source is you need to have a flag for each question and handle a event for the detailview like databinding check the value for this field based on that either add radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist

2019621

2020344
codeigniter	kohana
why do popular frameworks like codeigniter and kohana i m not aware of zend framework have such rudimentary db cache systems

2020355
children	parent
a parent can have unlimited numbers of children scary thought - 2 is enough for me

2020392
children	parent
usually in a one-to-many relationship it s the one record that is the parent and the many records that are the children

2020449
post	get

2020789
onclick	onsubmit
just make sure that onclick or onsubmit functions always return false if you don t want the default action to occur

2020791
post	get
i remember reading somewhere it s a good practice to redirect pages using get to show the next page after a post request

2020809
post	get
if you redirect to the thankyou page with get the post vars are empty so the form won t be resubmitted

2020813
post	get
get is idempotent while post isn t

2020820
folder	directory
if you are in linux find -name .git otherwise there is no way they are standard directory just use your os file folder find program to find .git named folder

2020840

feed burner rss

2020899
submit	submission
its working in normal way if i submit the form but i want add this ability to add a new category without submission the form first

firefox	safari
is the web worker draft implemented in firefox 3.5 and safari 4 so they should wind up in iphone s version of safari eventually

2020944
post	get
i m pretty sure things like trim won t modify the actual post data so you can only take advantage of it if you go through the validation framework to get the data

2020963
ssl	https
you can t see the request at a proxy for https traffic - ssl is specifically designed to prevent this

2020997
free	malloc

2021045
post	get
yes the semantics of get and post should be respected

2021045
post	get
given that fact then there is often a very good reason for putting some parameters in the get and some in the post vars - consider the case where you have a web based script which does something like

2021059
children	parent
on parent i want to add code on the before_update callback to set a calculated attribute based on its children

2021071
serializable	deserialization
you can still serializable the xmlnode as a string you just can t implement it directly like i show above then you will have to do some post-processing step after xml deserialization to recreate the xmlnode

2021073
free	malloc
since all calls to malloc will go through your hook you can synchronize on a semaphore wait until it is free lock it juggle the hooks and free the semaphore

2021089
free	malloc
programmers should instead preempt calls to the relevant functions by defining and exporting functions like malloc and free

2021089
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the appropriate way to inject debug malloc realloc free functions is to provide your own library that exports your debug versions of these functions and then defers itself to the real ones

2021094
try-catch	exception-handling
also i think and im no expert that it is generally a good idea to put methods that may throw exception-handling in a try-catch

2021476
rss	feed
is only valid for rss feed not atom feed

2021476

google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome is built on webkit testing in safari will get you close but you really can t escape the need to actually fire it up and test

2021631
uiview	subviews
you could perhaps feed the deque to a uiview that contains the text views as subviews with various offsets set based on how many lines your application is displaying at one time

2021654
put	get
so in case you put a .txt file in your sharepoint store you will not get any spfile.properties back

2021876
ubuntu	linux

2021890
nfa	dfa
first this is not a question asking for the algorithm to convert a nfa to dfa

2021890
nfa	dfa
it s known and proved that the equivalent dfa of a nfa has at most 2 n states even though most of the times it will have more or less the same number of states as the nfa

2021890
nfa	dfa
which particular type of nfa will require an equivalent dfa to have 2 n states

2021954
uicontrol	uibutton
if uibutton doesn t work then perhaps try a custom subclass of uicontrol which tracks the same touch down actions etc.

2021960
nant	cruisecontrol
it s probably not the account that nant is running under but the account that cruisecontrol is running under since it s the one executing that process

2021986
range	max	range	min	min	max
by assuming the range wraps around when going below min or above max

2021986
range	max	range	min	min	max
by assuming the range wraps around when going below min or above max

2022006
nfa	dfa
if you take an nfa where each transition is uniquely determined a deterministic nfa then it is nothing but a normal dfa

2022006
nfa	dfa
as for an nfa with n states for which the equivalent dfa has 2 n states think about exploiting non-determinism

2022006
nfa	dfa
this gives you a nfa with n+1 states 1 being the starting state where the dfa requires 2 n +1 states

2022045
post	get
i ve added the else clause in hopes that i can get it to only post back when the checkbox is checked but it s posting back in either case

2022777
set-cover	np-complete
and the words in a2 do not contain dashes then it s a just set-cover in disguise an np-complete optimization problem

2022793
versioning	upgrade
if we could upgrade our versioning of .net i would just return a but that s not going to be an option for some time yet

2022797
int	double
but usually when it comes from sql server you should not convert it first to a string than to int double but convert it directly from object in row column1 to needed value this will save you troubles handling cultures and improve performance a bit

high-speed execution for this queue is very critical but so is proper operation and i m not sure whether i can get away with implementing a fifo without any explicit synchronization or if not where i have to disable interrupts

2022915
getter	setter
i was having the problem of wanting a property to have an internal getter and a protected setter as described in this question and i thought i solved that by doing the following

2022915
getter	setter	public	protected
i would rather not make connection a public class while accessor needs to be public so how can i get around this error while still maintaining an internal getter and a protected setter

2022926
jobs	cron
if you have overlapping cron jobs you need to have a locking mechanism to control access

2022927
width	height
if you are talking about icons and icon sets used in your application the original low-density format had a size of 10 x 9 width x height

2022942
public	protected
if setconnection is to be protected connection will have to be public

2022976

java byte code does not have a datatype boolean therefore boolean primitives are converted to int 32 bit except boolean arrays where a boolean value is represented by a bit

2023008
hash	salt
use salt hash to store it and if the user forgets it generate a new one for them

2023008

2023094
post	put
does http put have advantages over http post particularly for file uploads

2023109
post	get
since this post seems to get decent amount of attention i d like to let you know that the solution ended up being to provide a proper enctype content type parameter in the declaration

2023144
post	put
put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

2023155
post	put
does http put have advantages over http post particularly for file uploads

2023164
cobertura	maven-antrun-plugin	jar	war
unfortunately while cobertura can instrument an ear sar zip war jar i don t think that the cobertura-maven-plugin supports this out-of-the-box and it may be a better option to use cobertura s ant task with the maven-antrun-plugin

2023286
getter	setter
for the blobs i tend to use the canonical private attribute + getter + setter since it abstracts the actual implementation from the client

2023286
getter	setter
there is more functionality there getter setter duo

2023286
public	protected
it wreaks havoc on the accessors public protected private so it s best not to intersped it throughout the class

2023300
inherited	properties
my models all inherited from a basemodel class which also has a currentuser properties

2023318
getter	setter

2023481
post	get
i ve been through other similar post on stack overflow but would be good to get views specific to this type of common message storing

2023499
int	chars
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags

2023499
tinyint	boolean
if mysql goes so far as to equate tinyint 1 with boolean it seems like the way to go

2023520
int	chars
chars columns have encodings and collations and comparing them could involve unnecessary switches between encodings so my guess is that an int will be faster

2023544
jar	manifest.mf
when you select the main class in eclipse this is what gets set in main-class myprograms.myclass inside of the jar manifest meta-inf manifest.mf in side of the jar file

2023549

pop-up	dialog
after that whenever you use any command a dialog will pop-up first showing you the exact command line parameters tortoiseproc.exe is started with

2023845
datediff	difference
something like this should do the trick using datediff to get the difference between two dates and then dividing the product_stat column by that difference

2023873
hide	show
update i was going to implement show and hide methods although setting display to none would probably work just fine they would prefer an explicit method

2023892
getter	setter
in a well-designed application getter and setter should be rare not automated

2023901
versioning	upgrade
you can code your app to check for new update every few minutes and prompt the user to restart the app if a new versioning is found which will then take them through the upgrade process

2023916
uiview	subviews
what i would do is make another uiview mapview that is the same size as mycontentview to hold the tiledlayer and have both the imageview and new mapview at the same level instead of one being a subviews of the other

2023939
width	height
i created an input field with zero height and zero width and move the focus to this field to blur a ckeditor field instance

i can add children using similar code edit non-collection properties of existing children edit the parent s properties all of that works just not deleting

2024097

edit you may have to play with the size height and width of your input files

2024189
children	parent
you need to reference what that acutal id is that s getting rendered which is availble with the clientid property on the control hfuser.clientid or access your control in a different more roundabout way like find the controls parent then search through its children to find your control

2024240

profiler	aqtime
personally i use a code profiler that supports both managed and unmanaged and mixed mode code aqtime

2024339
getter	setter
you can still use a dp for the implementation by the way the implements directive is on the clr property and does not interfere with the do not touch implementation of the getter and setter

2024339
inherited	properties
if the class you want to implement it on already has inherited command commandparameter and commandtarget properties and you want the interface implementation to reuse those you ll need to create new properties with new names declare them as interface implementations and back them onto the existing properties

i ve also looked at putting this work onto a backgrounding thread and letting the main thread terminate in theory letting us go back to springboard while continuing to run for a few seconds

2024393
mouseleave	mouseenter
in parts of our program we slide it out based on a mouseenter event and slide it back in on a mouseleave event however we are currently using a 3rd party library s treeview for this which i have been tasked with replacing

2024393
mouseleave	mouseenter
the scrollbar does not fire mouseenter or mouseleave for the control and that makes using mouseenter mouseleave for sliding out the control unusable since the user can not use the scrollbar

2024421
uiview	calayer
then put each tile in a calayer and attach all the calayers to the uiview and move them around and rotate them

2024421
uiview	calayer
calayer is similar to uiview in principle but much lighter weight faster and simpler

2024427
mouse	keyboard
many of these methods involve simulating the keyboard so by far the most important thing is to consider the accessibility of your site without using a mouse

2024462
awt	swing
learning java se is not only learning to develop desktop applications or applets which are basically just swing awt

2024462
awt	swing

pull	push
you can t do this with sql alone you d need to pull the data from the database manipulate it and then push it back

2024627
children	parent
it has nothing to do with how many elements are matched or what the order of that set is though if all the tables had the same parent and that parent had no other children then your method would work

i thought i had verified this but because i was instantiating the client from inside a jar via webstart that was in itself packed in a war i messed up the placement of the cxf runtime in my build process

2024701
superclass	subclassing
you re adding a new method in a subclassing which does not exist in the superclass

2024701
superclass	subclassing
there is no way to call the new method in the subclassing using a reference to the superclass

2024724
rss	feed
presumably you don t want stories users have voted on to disappear when they fall out of the rss feed so you re going to have to store a copy of said story in your database

put	get
to put it simply none of the extensibility method definitions get generated for any part of this one class

2024823

i think that struts 2 spring mvc stripes this one is my preferred one wicket this one is getting more and more attention are all decent choices they ll all get the job done the 2 first one being i believe more asked on the job market but not the smartest

2025182
wicket	stripes
if the popularity on the jobs market is an important criteria then i guess stripes and wicket will get eliminated

2025207
superclass	subclassing
i thought about adding a type t to the superclass that the subclassing can specify itself but that didn t seem very promising

2025216
put	get
it all depends on how much work you are willing to put into it in order to get pure mvc

2025242

2025440
hide	show
what i want to do is show show hide other elements on the page based on if certain options are selected from the drop down

g++	gcc
i had to compile it with gcc instead of g++ to see it fail to compile with the invalid lvalue in assignment error.

2025481
min	max
if you don t want to use the built in functions and you should because they will be optimized for whatever hardware you port to then it should be an inline template if using c++ for the same reasons mentioned when meyers sutter et al discuss re-implementing the min and max functions

2025522
freebsd	linux
if you re using a posix-based system linux freebsd mac os x etc. you ll want to check out pthreads link to tutorial

2025539
post	put
can someone tell me why this is executing the post method instead of my put method that i specify on the ajax request

2025575
getter	setter
your getter and setter use different variables - is that intentional

2025575
getter	setter
if the getter setter myvector is in a different class you need an instance of that class in your main class before you can access it from there

2025611
hide	show
i used jquery hosted from google apis to modify the dom taking advantage of django s own show hide script

2025849
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
it would help if you provided loops code as well as the code that is executed in loops but assuming you have a standard for-loop iterating through an arrays the following code should work

2025879
aptana	rubymine
thirdly most popular rails ides rubymine aptana etc have built-in controls for both or one of the mongrel and webrick servers

2025883
ubuntu	linux
hard to beat ubuntu though i personally use mostly macs that s because mac os x still offers a superior laptop experience and my personal machines are mostly laptops by now -- my workstation at work does run ubuntu -- though i m pretty sure other modern linux distros would be shoulder and shoulder with it

2025883
gentoo	ubuntu
the key is picking something you really personally care about -- whether you then work on it with ubuntu or gentoo or with gvim or emacs or eric etc etc it s really a very minor consideration imnsho

2025919
return-value-optimization	nrvo
you seem to misunderstand return-value-optimization try this example actually nrvo

2025976

serializable	deserialization
another method i thought of is to serializable lower down in my object hierarchy doing each of my lists separately and controlling the order of deserialization - i rather not do this

2026238
serializable	deserialization
another method would be to xmlignore and create an enrolment serializable helper class that initializes after the deserialization of itself is complete

2026249
put	get
within almost every area there are going to be superstars who earn shedloads of money this i suspect is the mythical better but most of us have to put our heads down and get on with it regardless of what area we work in

that said though it s better to show hide them via display none for example than to manipulate the dom as it s very expensive

2026444
config	ini
the register_globals ini setting can t be set at runtime by ini_set so if you can t do it with an .htaccess or web server config file the method provided there would be the official workaround

this draft describes keep-alive techniques in section 3.5 you can use crlf pairs for connection-oriented transports like tcp or stun for connectionless transports like udp

2026546
put	get	subclass	abstract-class
edit the only approach i can think of is to put both get and set as in the abstract-class and let the subclass throws a notimplementedexception if set is called and it s not necessary

2026557
portrait	landscape
but this problem only occurs when the user take s video in portrait mode in landscape mode everything is simply fine

2026592
gridview	objectdatasource
bind the gridview to an objectdatasource and enable paging on both

2026595
getter	setter
one possible answer would be to override the getter and then to implement a separate setter method

2026610
portrait	landscape
well you can query the uidevice for property uideviceorientation orientation and let the server know if the video was captured in landscape or portrait

2026623
getter	setter
the only case i know where a getter is defined and a getter setter are implemented is by using an interface

2026647
getter	setter
the getter setter pattern likely influenced by c# s properties

2026647
getter	setter
as an aside the new ecmascript 5 spec introduced getter and setter methods for properties to the language and some browsers have implemented them but they re not yet widespread enough to use on the web

2026651
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
innerhtml outerhtml getelementbyid getelementsbytagname and many others exist along with javascript libraries that simplify document object model selection modification and insertion

2026688
put	get
you will avoid the display problem and get a much better looking result if you simply put the uidatepicker in a new view and implement the slide-up-from-the-bottom behavior yourself

2026720
int	boolean
i use encodeobject on all objects except for the boolean and int where i use the correct corresponding method encodebool forkey and encodeint forkey

2026756
subtract	add
client 1 intends to a subtract 10 from integer column_x 10 and then b add this 10 to integer column_y

2026764
put	get
when you get the innerhtml value of the body add a string to it and put it back in the body all elements in the body is recreated from the html string

2026847
pop-up	dialog
i want the function to pop-up an iframe dialog box and wait for user interaction and then submit the form via an ajax post

2026854
emacs	aquamacs
if you decide to dive into that maybe aquamacs is something you d like its a mac-flavored emacs

2026867
pop-up	dialog
my guess is that whatever library you re using to pop-up your dialog box will have some sort of callback function that it will execute based on the user action instead

2026889
pull	push
git pull and or push will help you move changes from open source repo to proprietary repo

2026928
children	parent
matches all elements that are the nth-child of their parent or that are the parent s even or odd children

2026928
children	parent
you re currently selecting the parent while you should be selecting children

2026957
macvim	textmate
xcode eclipse macvim aquaemacs and textmate not free but worth the price if you like it are pretty standard

2027107
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview with an objectdatasource

2027145
width	height
using the debugger i checked what getclientrect returned and sure enough it returns a rectange with location 0 and width height of the combined two monitors so it s right

2027166
implements	extends
so how could i go about implements something as basic as the above example in javascript where there is a base class or an interface and two classes extends from that base class each with their own specific behavior

2027173
sorting	filtering
lots of neat sorting filtering and list manipulation functions

2027294
put	get
also note that urls are of limited length so you cannot put an arbitrary amount of text into a get parameter

2027294
post	get
but as you only send it via get to your proxy and then via post to the other app as long as it works it is fine

2027308
for-loop	loops
do you really mean to use i++ in loops body as well as the increment part of the for-loop

2027314
client-side	server-side
ok if you need to get data from another server it looks like you need to create your own server-side class as an objectdatasource on the server to be the client for your wcf service because the browser s cross-domain restrictions will prevent the radgrid from making client-side requests to both servers

2027356
put	get
if i manually put in the url i get the following error

2027410
post	get
http authorization does not differ between get and post requests so i would first assume that something else is wrong

2027417
ready	each
i m working with java.nio.channels.selector and i d like to create a separate thread for each selectedkey that is ready for read write accept but i want to make sure that the same socket is never handled by two different threads simultaneously

2027438
width	height
it s nothing to dedicate a few more bytes to keep track of the width and height and it will save you from having to hit the driver or gpu to get the information

2027461
int	boolean
you were right in one of your comments that the boolean expression gets added as to the int as 1 or 0

2027461
int	boolean
if you cast a boolean value to an int then false gets 0 and true gets 1

2027535
return-value-optimization	nrvo
a more general version is nrvo named return-value-optimization which also works on named variables

2027544
junit	testng
so it seems that the problem was coming from testng jar requiring junit v3.8.1

2027573
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
i m wondering if i can change the background color of just the prompt of the uinavigationbar to red while the rest of the navigation bar stays black so i can use the prompt property of the uinavigationitem to display status error messages as a one-liner

2027633
versioning	upgrade
start with some free express edition of visual studio upgrade to a commercial versioning if we need the additional features

2027643
submit	submission
i ve done this before in a very similiar way but this time the submit button is submission the new form to the ajax loaded page not the aspnetform parent page

2027681
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven pom.xml file with a plugin that runs on the test phase

2027817
versioning	upgrade
if the only thing we know about our customers is that our current module works fine which versioning of c# may we upgrade to which will still work with the customers current runtime

2027842
division	subtraction
gcd can of course be done much faster if you use division rather than subtraction o n 2

2027842
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
2 in practice integer inputs are often fixed-size 32 bit or whatever and operations on them such as addition multiplication and division are o 1 time

2027842
range	infinity
it s usually more convenient to accept that addition is o 1 because the numbers are fixed-size but ignore that gcd is also o 1 pretend that its behaviour in the range 1 2 32 extends to infinity and analyse it on that basis

2027842
division	subtraction
again this is not ambiguous once you know what the terms of reference are but beware of incorrectly comparing the first analysis i gave of euclid s algorithm with division o n 2 against this analysis of the algorithm with subtraction o n

2027872
google-chrome	safari
safari nor google-chrome doesn t respect some attributes

2027892
firefox	safari
update didn t do anything in safari 4 apart from logging an error in firebug as per usual but shows the alert in firefox 3.6 beta 5

2027899
pow	math.h
for the power operator you want to use the function pow declared in math.h

2027991
unix	solaris
i am working on solaris unix

2028087
accessor	properties
it seems like sometimes this is done automatically on properties accessor and sometimes you must do it explicitly

2028106
hide	show
i was thinking of rendering for each field both a static and an editable version and using javascript to hide and show them as needed

2028143
implements	extends
how do i extends zend_db so i can implements and use the function above as instead of

2028243
nsis	uninstaller
i have written an installer and uninstaller in nsis which creates and drops an sql database which is working fine

2028270
lxml	beautifulsoup
is there an equivalent of beautifulsoup s tag.rendercontents method in lxml

2028336
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work in ie but not firefox or google-chrome

2028368
inherited	subclassing
and the generic classes do not follow the inherited of their template type is not a subclassing of - they are completely different classes in c#

2028374
int	chars
this could hold any kind of data needed at that time ten years ago int floats chars etc

2028388
tapestry	wicket
it s borrows more from tapestry but should have similarities to wicket

2028408
profiling	benchmarking
in terms of standard definitions of efficiency one would often utilize big-0 notation however in the real world outside academia normally one would profiling benchmarking both equations and then compare the results

2028443
google-chrome	safari
in fact the google-chrome team has mostly aimed for compatibility with safari most prominent webkit user at the time and refused features on those grounds

2028457
hex	binary
i wish to open a binary file to read the first byte of the file and finally to print the hex value in string format to stdout ie if the first byte is 03 hex i wish to print out 0x03 for example

2028465
innodb	myisam
i just read a lot of stuff about myisam and innodb as i have to decide which type to use

2028474
getter	setter
in production use nothing will invoke the property setter so the first time the getter is called the controller will call out to your ioc framework get an instance and store it

2028528
public	protected
don t think of the private protected public thing as if a programmer would ever need a method

2028530
rss	feed
the web interface gives a little rss feed but it wasn t enough of a history for me

2028566
getter	setter
for example let s say you have a field called _name and a getter setter named getname setname name

2028571
public	protected
then as needed you can make things protected or public

2028629
public	protected
public and protected methods form the interface to your object public for developers using delegating to your class and protected for developers wishing to extend the functionality of your object by subclassing it

2028629
public	protected
both public and protected interfaces need careful thought especially if this is an api to be used by developers outside your control since changes to the interface can break programs that make assumptions about how the existing interface works

2028642
put	get
when i navigate to the url and put in a non existent page i get the following error message

2028694
uninstall	upgrade
note that this is more of an uninstall then reinstall than an upgrade per se

2028697
pop-up	dialog
in .net when calling messagebox.show ... that creates and shows a pop-up dialog

2028705
cos	sin
if you want the points to spiral out instead of making a circle choose a number of points per circle revolution and replace num with that number in the sin cos functions

2028715
mouse	keyboard
what i see in your problem is you are dealing more with functional things like does this follow this mouse does this respond to keyboard commands etc.

2028739
gif	png
if matlab saves the plot as an image file say gif or png or something then you can use toolkit.getimage or createimage to read it in and then

2028762
listview	gridview
i ve tried to build something with listview and or gridview and i just can t seem to get the behavior i want

2028844
agile	sprint
i thought within agile especially the scrum method that the content an iteration or sprint was decided upon at the start and then the team would deliver that content in the allowed time your example of 3 weeks is a good one then you review and adjust for changes in the next sprint

2028894
distance	polygons
the animation of the polygons consists in calculating the distance between each vertex and moving then to a position according to elapsedtime

2028918
pop-up	dialog
if it s a binary file you want to offer for download you probably also want to send the right headers so the save as.. dialog pop-up

2029022
tcplistener	tcpclient
it seems the most obvious thing but i just can t work out how to get the length of bytes sent over a network using a tcpclient and tcplistener

2029047
width	height
the grid is set to 100 for width and height and it automatically adjusts to the height width of the contentpane it s placed in

2029106
g++	gcc
including that header with gcc g++ 7.2.0 generates a warning

2029153
int	boolean
to make it close to perfect it involves a couple of functions as it also should support int boolean and null values but you can take a look at the source code on the database and database_mysql classes on naturephp

2029195
uiview	calayer
the most powerful of these are imho uiview s transform property which takes cgaffinetransform structs as inputs or calayer s transform property which takes catransform3d structs

2029197
union	distinct
by using a union and not a union all you will get the distinct time stamps

2029236
implements	extends
1 if i have implements an interface with a method in a superclass where im declaring that method and then i extends that superclass in another class

2029249
versioning	upgrade
in the last week some of our clients have upgrade their system to windows 7 x64 bits versioning and start to fail when they print text via com to the printer

2029263
public	protected
it the ivars are marked as public or protected yes they will be exactly the same

2029292
post	get
don t do a google search and post crap that i already know and utilized to get the code to work

2029363
put	get
if you want to get rid of it you could just remove the reference in rails init.rb of the plugin or put an if around to check if the constant already exists

2029368
abstract-class	superclass
as mentioned in other answer by balusc if your superclass tells that it implements an interface and doesn t provide implementation of method s in the interface then you have to mark the superclass as an abstract-class

2029368
abstract-class	superclass
but you cannot instantiate the superclass since it is an abstract-class

2029424
public	protected
this is why i find it much better practise to default all methods and properties to protected visibility and only mark those methods not properties though supposed to allow interaction with my class from another class or script as public but only a few things private

2029427
post	get
can you also post the exact output you get from the following method when field is abcd

2029428
punctuation	words
the article includes punctuation upper and lower case words numbers and abbreviations

2029466
nsstring	nserror
id stringwithcontentsoffile nsstring path encoding nsstringencoding enc error nserror error

2029496
nhibernate	automapper
it s not a restriction imposed by fluent or its automapper but by nhibernate itself

2029506
hide	show
i want to dynamically hide show controls in an activity based on a button touch event when the user presses the details button i want to show more controls in the same activity

2029520
tortoisegit	svn
i m on windows and use tortoisegit which has quite nice support for git-svn but since tortoisegit only runs git svn fetch i m kind of stuck

2029596
postgresql	mysql
with a bit of luck you ll have mysql mysqli pdo_mysql and postgresql pdo_pgsql already installed -- which means it ll be ok from the php side you ll just have to use the right functions classes to connect to your postgresql and or mysql servers

2029642
folder	directory
i like winmerge because you can feed it 2 folder of files and it will traverse sub directory and tell me all the differences in all the files

2029665
delphi	oxygene
prism is a replacement for delphi .net - it has been developed by remobjects and its original names were oxygene and chrome

2029686
free	malloc
so you have to overload delete to use free and the normal new to use malloc

2029686
free	malloc
in practice though all implementations use malloc free themselves internally so even if you don t do it most likely you won t run into any problems except language lawyers yelling at you

2029694
post	get
instead of sending it as a post request send as a get request and try request.params 0 and request.params 1

2029694
post	get
now i am able to access both jhon and 8pm in the beginprocess event as context.request.params 0 and context.request.params 1 but as soon i change the type get to post both the parameters are not there

2029701
pop-up	dialog
i am assuming you re not on windows and you mean the version information that can be stored in windows executables and pop-up in the properties dialog for such a file in windows explorer

2029735
children	parent
make sure that the parent has the child in its children collection and the the child has the parent in its parent reference and that the child is removed from its old parent if it had one

2029762
implements	modifiers
the __interface modifiers is a visual c++ extension to help implements com interfaces

2029781
google-chrome	firefox
ie doesn t offer a feature to do what you re asking and i m not convinced that the firefox and google-chrome features work the way that you expect that they do

2029826
plone	buildout
however it is a production site and so i can t easily take it down to upgrade plone to 3.2+ in order to use buildout

2029826
folder	directory
what i thought i could do is add this collective folder to plone directory zope lib python as a python module

2029869
hash	salt
i was wondering - is there any disadvantages in using the hash of something as a salt of itself

2029878
folder	directory
update for what it s worth i found the actual class files in the configuration component source folder on my hard drive but adding that to the class path as well as the components directory did no good

2029948
getter	setter
see the little manual of api design which describes the benefits of classes having minimal constructors and lots of getter setter over the alternative of using constructor methods having many parameters

2029965
for-loop	arrays
at that point you could run a for-loop on the arrays and get your properties in order

2029970
button	checkbox
accessible custom designed checkbox and radio button inputs styled with css and a dash of jquery

2029992
hash	salt
i you don t want to create and manage a salt value for each hash you could use a strong application wide salt

2030005
post	get
i had the major break through after reading post similar to this one they did not get it completely right either

2030005
post	put
to restore the tableview back you need to add observer on uikeyboarddidhidenotification not uikeyboardwillhidenotification as suggested by other post to avoid flickering where you tableviewcell appears every time and put back the tableview to where it was

2030036
jstl	taglib
badly designed .net user controls and jstl taglib

2030039
x86	64bit
check for the existence of c program files x86 - if it exists then it is a 64bit os

2030045
width	height
for gifs the height and width are 4-byte integers found in the header of the file

2030045
width	height
address 0x12 for width 0x16 for height

2030045
width	height
it passes in the jpg as an array of data and it gets the height and width

2030056
mouse	keyboard
i m fine using the managedwinapi wrappers around p invoke working in c# to record mouse and keyboard activity which works but i think that in order to make the recording more useful i need to know more about what happens when the user starts an application

2030129
getter	setter
if i had a similar problem my first instinct would be to wrap them up in some sort of collection ivar ns mutable array dictionary set and then you can have a normal getter setter on it and just do

2030176
put	get
dynamic linking means some of the required code does not get put into the executable and will be found at runtime

2030200
hash	salt
using a hash of the data as salt for the data is not secure

2030216
vbscript	jscript
windows has built in windows script host engine with two interpreters for vbscript and jscript

2030226
min	max
i can accomplish the same thing as an incrementing record version with just the recordcreated date i suppose but that removes the convenience of knowing that recordorder 1 is the current record and i m back to doing a sub-query with max or min on the datetime to determine the most recent record

2030260
hide	show
on post back you could hide the fileupload control and show a literal that displays the value of the file

2030267
hash	salt
this is not salt - you have just modified the hash function

2030280
cpu	processors
note that it incorrectly identifies my laptop s cpu as being 64 bit see intel√¢ core√¢ duo processors t2300 mdash

2030282
put	get
if you make the combination of those two a unique constraint and put retry logic in your client code on the rare chance you get a race condition you should have no problems

2030326
pascal	delphi
delphi prism is also an adaptation of object pascal to the .net world but with more emphasis on being a fully fledged .net language even more so than c# and much less worries on being compatible with delphi

2030354
firefox	safari
firefox seamonkey and safari - see this table

2030357

opensuse	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse
we make sure that the plug-in available from this site works on the following platforms suse linux enterprise desktop 11 opensuse 11.x ubuntu 9.10 and fedora 12

2030370
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this means that though it s officially supported on ie and firefox with google-chrome in experimental to be supported in v4 on windows and safari on mac it technically works on other browsers that support the netscape plugin model like opera

2030381
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to make sure that upgrade from previous versioning versioning 1 and 2 are the same in the new product versioning 4 as the old versioning 3

2030419
superclass	subclassing
imagine that a superclass a has two subclassing b and c

2030419
inherited	subclassing
we say that the inherited relationship between a b and c is disjoint when a instances cannot be at the same time b instances and c instances instances of a supertype only appear at most in a subclassing

2030420
rss	feed
i have an addon that every 5 minuets or so checks an rss feed for a new post and if there is one it displays an alert

2030428
ironruby	ironpython
if we are to make a new version of our scripting engine we would now be looking forward to using the new dlr-enabled language ironpython and ironruby

2030492
vb.net	vb6
one point of info i left out of the original question was that the vb.net projects are upgrades from vb6 projects

2030492
vb.net	vb6
so i ran reg32 u on the vb6 dlls and that seemed to fix the vb.net issue

2030492
vb.net	vb6
not exactly sure why this fixed it since i was not referencing the vb6 dlls i m guessing something to do with ambiguous entries in the registry confusing the vb.net project

2030500
delphi	oxygene
oxygene fka delphi prism replaces delphi for .net but it is not a new version of it

2030513
coalesce	isnull
isnull can easily give different results as coalesce on sql server because of data type precedence as per my answer comments here

2030609
getter	setter
you could also make getter and setter implicitly inline

2030620
post	put	post	get	put	get
as implied this particular project requires me to use get put and post requests

2030684
int	double
i assume i should not use quotes around any of the int float double and real

2030685
tostring	getter	getter	setter
to take a simple example when you add or remove a field roo will update the tostring getter setter jsp pages etc for you automatically

2030694
post	get
in the design process of my framework i come to a point where i think about merging post and get parameters into one single parameters variable

2030694
post	get
but as usual is there any real advantage to separating post and get without respect to that they are just different because they come from different sources

2030694
post	get
would it be good design at any point when a post parameter has the same name as an get parameter and both are really used

2030694
post	get
in my eyes that s ugly but maybe someone has a good explanation why i should not even attempt to merge post and get

2030694
post	get
i would consider post to be overriding get in any case

2030736
post	get
post and get request have a different semantic

2030737
post	get
i believe the popular ruby on rails framework combines them into a params variable technically a method... but also allows you to access the original get or post parameters through other means

2030743
post	get
ideally post has or can have to be pedantic side-effects and get doesn t

2030743
post	get
responses to get can also be safely cached under certain circumstances while post should never be cached

2030744
quicksort	heapsort
you might have an application where the sorting algorithm itself quicksort heapsort etc. may be chosen at runtime

2030746
free	malloc
first to answer the title no dynamically allocated memory with new malloc etc is not free when function exits

2030754
valgrind	memcheck
i d suggest having a test run using valgrind memcheck and helgrind tools in that order

2030758
public	protected
oncreate is public not protected

2030761
post	get
in some instances accepting a get rather than a post could make you more subject to a csrf attack

2030773
opera	firefox
ideally i would also want to keep and share settings and files for other applications firefox addons opera keyboard shortcuts mail and chat accounts eclipse settings etc but that s probably another issue

2030773
vmware	virtualbox
is virtualbox or vmware a solution

2030774
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome on mac firefox 3.5.x and safari 4 mac

2030775
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

2030775
put	get
the methods get head put

2030775
post	get
so basically get is intended to be idempotent if you resubmit the form you end up with the same result as once - you don t get your orders from amazon delivered twice as a consequence for instance. post is intended to be more liberal in how it behaves

2030788
post	get
maybe stick to literal english use get to get data use post to modify data

2030829
put	get
to do this i m running through the table looking for the event divs which sit inside td and then get the start and duration and put that into a seperate div adding them up as i go so i ll end up with 9 00 5 events 10 00 3 events.

2030838
ssl	https
i would like to use it but with https ssl for distribution

2030857
width	height
width height

2030873
ilist	icollection
i know from experience that fnh will automap ilist but don t think it can deal with icollection

2030893
textwatcher	charsequence
found a better and working way to implement this use edittext.addtextchangedlistener with a textwatcher class and implement textwatcher.ontextchanged charsequence s int start int before int count works perfectly also on the milestone droid

2030915
mouse	keyboard
it uses global system hooks to detect all mouse and keyboard events even outside your application

2030987
jar	war
say a war or a jar with winrar

2031020
ubuntu	linux
it runs on an ubuntu 8.04 server and all employees have a linux user account on that machine

hash	md5
i m storing only their user name and a md5 hash of their password

2031021
arraylist	treeset	treemap	treeset
instead of arraylist string use hashset string not sorted or treeset string sorted if you don t need a count of how often each word occurs hashtable string integer not sorted or treemap string integer sorted if you do

2031023
post	get
it actually took me quite sometime to get the post vs get question straight in my own projects - but for quite some time i do things like this i usually use post whenever forms are involved and get whenever i want to trigger something through a regular link

2031023
post	put	post	get	put	get
or to put it this way i use post for administration and get for navigation

2031023
post	get
thinking of security i suppose it actually doesn t really make much difference - attacks can come through either post or get - so be sure to always check your users input - no matter what method you use

2031038
post	get
but instead of that i want to use post instead of get

2031069
folder	directory
the templates are located in the visual studio install directory common7 ide itemtemplates csharp|visualbasic web mvc codetemplates folder

uiview	uiwindow
you may however be able to rotate the window s coordinate system around manually using uiwindow and uiview beginanimations ... in order to recreate the whole effect

2031139
post	get
please post sample code somewhere if you get it working

2031196
post	get
not quote sure the post data is how you want it formatted but i hope you get the idea

2031196
post	get
if a get works for you use that don t just switch to post it isn t buying you anything unless of course you re using ssl for the post then it d be more secure

2031235
post	get
you may have better luck with restful wcf mode since you can leverage proper http caching throughout see this blog post rest in wcf √¢ part x √¢ supporting caching and conditional get for a start

2031245
pull	push
if you really want to be developing on the master and a feature branch at the same time i suggest cloning your repository working in the clone and the master and then using push and pull to move changes between them

2031255
cpython	ironpython
you ll also need to copy gzip.py from the cpython standard library to the ironpython lib folder

2031259
google-chrome	firefox
it s slow both in firefox and google-chrome so it does not seem to be a browser issue

2031296
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
i would suggest merge-sort on the list as it is o n log n while bubble-sort or insertion-sort are both o n 2

2031321
for-loop	loops
is it possible to loops through a ilist with a simple for-loop

2031360
realloc	malloc
a more common way is to wrap malloc and realloc and keep a list of sizes and pointers

2031378
hash	salt
roll your own database tables salt hash passwords stored in a user profile table

2031379
post	get
i think everyone s missing the point of your question or maybe i m just misunderstanding it. you re not asking the difference between get post you re wondering if its a good or bad idea for the framework that you re building to automatically merge the results of these two together into one safe variable

2031379
post	get
if someone has a reason to only get the post get the variables are still there

2031387
typedef	struct

2031421
int	boolean
convert a list of int to a list of boolean

2031421
int	boolean
convert a tree of int to a tree of boolean

2031444
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are types derived from throwable including throwable which don t derive from exception apart from runtimeexception and its subclasses

2031451
jobs	cron
i don t have access to cron jobs since this is on a localhost apache installation on windows vista home edition

2031451

versioning	upgrade
however in the last few days my server host upgrade to a new versioning of centos but says they did not change the versioning of php

2031553
rss	feed
rss feed if possible

2031555
allocator	stl
with stl containers you can provide your own allocator via an optional template parameter

2031587
rss	feed
rss feed if possible √¢≈ì

2031601
dictionary	map
the text will also have another dictionary inserted to it that will map each button to its bound control a dictionary for each function this will be used when a function gets called to distinguish between buttons different bound controls

2031601
subtract	add
for now it will do simple calculator jobs 1 textbox a couple of buttons and functions like add subtract and such

2031653
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in the end i tried the jquery cooke plugin in ie 6 7 and 8 safari 4 google-chrome 4 firefox 3.5 opera 10.2 and on a few different configurations and it worked in all of them

2031658
hide	show
depending on the value chosen in the drop list i use javascript to show hide divs on the page which all contain different form inputs for the user to fill in

2031663
keydown	keyup
you ll have to use keydown in conjuction with keyup to tell if the user pressed shift to produce the letter

2031675
accessor	properties
the other model is to create an accessor properties that is virtual

2031686
width	height
i am try to increase the width size and height of checkbox but it doesnt happen yet

2031740
hide	show
currently i am using jquery to hide show select options using following code

2031740
opera	google-chrome
how to i hide options from select in google-chrome opera and ie

2031748
opera	google-chrome
you don t it s not supported in ie and assumably not in google-chrome or opera either

2031765
super	implements
slightly longer answer if you make sure the methods you care about are in interfaces then you can have a class that implements the interfaces and then delegates to instances of the super classes

2031792
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
in addition to objects java also includes primitive datatypes such as boolean byte int long chars float double

2031792
int	boolean
there are also matching number objects boolean byte int long etc that can be used which like all objects are passed by reference instead

2031794
urllib	httplib
you could also use httplib which basically is the backend for urllib

2031803
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have font-face working well in webkit safari and google-chrome and opera but not in firefox 3.5 or ie 8

2031819
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as it turns out ie and firefox do not honor font-face declarations wrapped inside media safari google-chrome and opera do

2031820
vb.net	vb6
the vb6 functions work just fine in vb.net

2031828
vb.net	vb6
if you haven t yet converted the code you could choose to buy artinsoft s vb upgrade companion which can do some of the conversions you ask for as part of the vb6 to vb.net conversion

2031853
rss	feed
everything is almost like writing yet another rss feed reader

2031893
webclient	webrequest
you can of course write a .net client for this - but you ll find it a lot easier to write it using webclient webrequest manually formatting reading the xml json requests responses or use datacontractserializer and datacontractjsonserializer to help out with that

2031913
nexus	artifactory
your best bet in this case is to use a managed proxy such as artifactory or nexus

2031917
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
you had primitives int chars byte boolean float double long and the rest in the java world were classes including the corresponging wrappers int chars byte booelan float double long

2031958
put	get
assuming that op can precalculate this array he can put any reasonable number of cars into the array and get sensible results

2031962
boost	allocator
the point of the class is to avoid a dynamic memory allocator - you can put a boost array entirely on the stack

2031964
oncreate	setcontentview
luckily all i wanted to do was to set the title text differently and i soon realized that just calling settitle inside of oncreate worked for me i called it after i called setcontentview

2031978
g++	gcc
you can also suppress using this by using the option -mno-cygwin as compiler option for gcc g++

2031984
post	get	pop-up	dialog
now i have a jquery post that goes to this method and now i am not sure how to take the outputstream result that the jquery post will get and make it pop-up with a save dialog box

2032046
opera	firefox
this works in firefox 3.5 and opera 10 however not in ie8

2032119
pop-up	dialog
you can t make a file dialog pop-up via ajax

2032209
implements	extends
solution is be a component class a class extends fl.core.uicomponent implements the icellrender interface so it can be set as a renderer and containing the label and textinput components

2032245
width	height
this sets the picture as an object and then uses the scaling methods scaleheight and scalewidth to make it 50 smaller in both height and width

2032335
switching	screens
this means that i can only keep the state for one activity when switching back and forth navigating between my screens

2032343
folder	directory
in ii6 i need to set a redirect on a parent folder using the redirect to an url option but have sub folder or sub aspx pages still point to the page in that site the designated directory

2032343
folder	directory
ii6 seems to have no problem with setting a different redirect on the child folder page but if it s set to the designated directory it doesn t take leaving and coming back to that node in iis shows no change

2032350
profiler	callgrind
if you run linux callgrind profiler and kcachegrind visualize the results will give you excellent insight into this even down to the assembler code level

2032361
int	double
i understand that int and double are not polymorphic types

2032369
int	double
please note that other varinat types int double can be successfully convert back and this error ocus only with bstr

2032377
int	double
you are right that static_cast works on types that are not related by inheritance double - int etc and the others answers point out how the casts work

2032389
many-to-many	one-to-many	children	parent
to the database there is only one-to-many or many-to-many relationships or in other words a parent with a collection of children

2032389
children	parent
the database considers the address the parent and the person as a collection of children

2032405
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my array wasn t reloaded in the viewwillappear so i copied the setup codes in viewdidload to viewwillappear and that solved it

2032444
postgresql	mysql
otherwise something like mysql postgresql or any other multi-user db

2032461
hide	show
i believe there is no .net method to do this and also i have come across a lot of how to hide and show the taskbar samples but i haven t seen anything based on what i am looking for

2032490
children	parent
if you re looking for specific elements that are children of one particular element put an id on that parent

2032500
uiview	subviews
now my confusion is that is not documented as some people may say but alertview is a subclass of uiview which has a property called subviews

2032507
freebsd	linux
for instance freebsd allows using the linux syscall abi only through an emulation module

2032557
width	height
where tb.size.width and tb.size.height returns the width and height of the taskbar and tb.autohide returns true if the taskbar is hidden and false if it is not

2032567
ivar	subclassing
as a global variable or an ivar of the subclassing whatever

2032576
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
modify for whether you want preorder inorder or postorder

2032582
nsstring	nsdata
if the data retrieve is textual and you re using the debugger you can use nslog to dump the raw data retrieved to the console after converting from nsdata to nsstring which is easy

2032584
solaris	bsd
incompatible abi is why even though osx linux solaris windows and bsd all run on intel x86 cpus a simple posix-only hello world program compiled on one os that does not use any vendor specific or proprietary system calls and or libraries generally cannot run on one os when compiled for another os

2032586
width	height
wrap the image in a div set the div s height and width to what you want

2032599
int	double
what can i do if i want to make such conversions like bignum to int and bignum to double

2032603
firefox	safari
i have following code which work fine in firefox safari

2032610
hide	show
most probably to be able to show the user something or hide something from the user

2032612
boost	stl
stl tr1 boost provides wrappers for both types of arrays

2032621
getter	setter
an actionscript class can include fields vars properties getter setter and methods

2032621
getter	setter
these classes act as templates to hold data and generally won t contain functions other than getter setter

2032632
serializable	deserialization
perhaps you need to call close on the textwriter objects in your serializable and deserialization methods

2032640
google-chrome	firefox
im trying to close a child window with javascript and in firefox everything works fine but in google-chrome the window doesnt close

2032670
google-chrome	safari
you can also use the standard generic font-family monospace but be careful -- there are some severe side effects sadly in google-chrome safari and anything webkit based

2032678
button	checkbox
always use labels for each checkbox and radio button

2032707
fontfamily	font-size
changing body font-size based on fontfamily with jquery

2032707
fontfamily	font-size
css font-size changes when fontfamily falls back

2032729
groovy	gsp
i have a great one for groovy but nothing yet for gsp

2032794
int	double
it turns out that int float and double are instances of the typeclass real and any real may be converted to rational

2032837
accessor	properties
getter for your properties accessor

2032837
getter	setter
your own setter and getter

2032847
accessor	properties
properties and synthesized accessor are new features in objective-c 2.0

2032847
accessor	properties	getter	setter
then you synthesize accessor methods getter and setter for that properties

2032852
google-chrome	firefox
it works by sitting in google-chrome part of firefox which has special privileges

2032889
pull	push
but if you need git hooks on the git side i would recommend setting up an intermediate bare git repository bare for easy push pull

2032906
jobs	cron
i m running .net executables on the amazon cloud on ubuntu on cron jobs

2032989
width	column-count
use column-count and column-width to control the number of columns and width of each column

2033006
rdf	owl
i need to translate from xmi to owl xml rdf serialized in java so essentially this is xml to xml translation and most probably i could just play with regex and use replaceall to what i need but that seems very messy way to do it

2033031
stdout	stderr
originally i attempted to use system to call the lc3 assembler and redirect the stdout and stderr to a file like so

2033032
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t open on mouse over you need to use context menu or keyboard shortcut in source code

2033040
vbscript	vba
if you want to save word documents programmatically you can for example use vba macros or vbscript for it

2033053
multiplying	division
you re performing an int int division and then multiplying by 100

2033089
octree	quadtree
use proper acceleration trees such as kd-tree cover tree octree quadtree etc

2033091
stdout	stderr
your stderr output is now going be completely out of sync with the stdout output

2033098
equals	gethashcode
if you don t specify a comparer in the union extension method like in my example it will use the default equals and gethashcode methods in your person class

2033110
int	chars	int	double
the first can be either an int double or float so and the second is always a string literal my string so i guess const chars const

2033125
int	double
the first can be either an int double or float so and the second is always a string literal my string

2033147
int	chars	int	double
the first can be either an int double or float so and the second is always a string literal my string so i guess const chars const.

2033147
int	double
this would work for any type for the first parameter int float double whatever

2033147
int	double
now if you really want to restrict the type of the first parameter to be only int float or double

2033156
int	double
a better version of numtoint would be to convert to a double first and then convert to int

2033168
versioning	upgrade
most wiki based approaches just track the head and quickly become useless to anyone stuck working with an old versioning of your api ok maybe this is less of a problem if you re a webservice and just going to force all users to upgrade

2033195
pylons	cherrypy
which python framework do you think is more appropriate or you would suggest over the other cherrypy or pylons

2033206
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
thus it provides getelementbyid getelementbyname and getelementsbytagname

2033256
inherited	properties
however looking at the class names i strongly suspect that you might be misusing inherited and that a composition approach may be more appropriate with details exposing properties of types flightdetails and passengerdetails

2033280
jar	war
as there is no module wide .ser file i manually combine those .ser files from the ejb war jar and ear file using the commandline solution given by cobertura

2033295
udp	tcp
the best strategy to ensure no lost data would be to use tcp over udp

2033296
width	height
recently i tried to create a linearview which content exceeds the screen size so i created the new layout with parent element scrollview and set its width and height to custom values the layout has to appear as dialog - not filling the whole screen

2033299
versioning	upgrade
for now you can try to upgrade locally the pmd versioning used in the plugin with

2033353
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
possible replacements for udp include tcp and sctp

2033396
int	boolean
and the type bool is an alias for boolean in the same way that int is an alias for int32

2033417
disk	ram
you can create and mount a ram based disk as follows

2033438
apache	lighttpd
i ll lay my head on the chopping block and suggest that probably apache with mod_wsgi for django and some other web server lighttpd

2033448
hash	salt
this salt should then be stored in the database along with the username and password hash with the salt

2033448
hash	salt
what i would do when sending the password reset link is to create another salt don t give the user access to anything hash with your salt

2033448
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the other salt which essentially is only a hash of a random string you might wanna go for md5 here as you mentioned that the length is an issue should you then save into your database

2033448
hash	salt
hash your users passwords using a unique-for-the-user salt and perhaps a global secret salt

2033474
rss	feed
i m a complete noob in all of this but sometime ago i wrote a little script in perl to parse an rss feed

2033474
rss	feed
the rss feed is alive and passes through feedvalidator.org

2033492
put	get
it seems that if you have a function and put the op s code which is a php.net example inside that function you will get answer 2

2033511
postgresql	mysql	nginx	lighttpd
this issue differs from a debian vs some other distro postgresql vs mysql or lighttpd vs nginx type choice since choosing app engine most probably will require you to write code specific to it or make modifications in your existing code base

2033515
cashapelayer	calayer
i am trying to move some custom drawing code from a view into a cashapelayer which then get added as a sublayer to the original view s calayer

2033520
awt	swing
a gui would be used to give the user something other than the command line to look at but swing or awt don t provide the functionality you seem to associate them with - namely connecting the server and client allowing the user to log into the running instance of the server

2033531
superclass	subclassing
the way ms vc++ c++ compiler used in visual studio implements none-virtual multi-inheritance you can cast back from the first base type in the list of superclass back to subclassing

2033538
post	get
i created a small php script that returns a mysql result depending on given post get parameters

2033545
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
it s impossible to tell which is the best system to run django on but imo if you anticipate lot s of pageviews go with nginx lighttpd for webserver instead of apache if you don t need those fancy apache modules

2033545
apache	nginx
however since i m used to apache it was faster for me to configure the site to run on apache and switch to nginx when performance problems occured

2033566
apache	nginx
nginx to serve static content and proxy requests to apache

2033566
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu they have great python packages

2033569
rss	feed
perhaps the rss feed had bad corrupt xml in it for a while

2033577
post	get
i need help with figuring out how to get hold of the redirect after i make a post to the server

2033590
rss	feed
i m getting the same error same message and line number with a fresh install of xml rss parser and the modules it uses it s just a wrapper for feed structure over xml elemental which uses xml sax to parse etc

2033598
g++	gcc
for dev-c++ see faq entry dev-c++ uses gcc instead of g++ for linking

2033599
folder	directory
anyway every user seems to be looking in the same folder c userfolder did you intend to have a separate directory for each user

2033615
innodb	myisam
it could be innodb or myisam

2033723
translation	localization
for mere translation localization it suggests either resource files which is very common for .net applications or a database

2033746
submit	submission
if you re not worried about what will happen when javascript isn t available then you can write some script to change the action attribute when one of the submit buttons is clicked prior to actually submission the form

2033749
boost	stl
you could also consider looking at the open-source project thrust which is a stl boost style template library built on top of cuda c++

2033827
memcached	apc
you could implement a caching layer memcached or apc which would allow you to store database results by key which would allow you to skip database access on subsequent calls

2033845
atof	strtod	strlen	strtod	strlen	atof
i tried to use atof strtod but they are real time consuming when the array is too huge because they will call the strlen

2033845
atof	strtod	strlen	strtod	strlen	atof
i debug into the code and find that both atof and strtod call the strlen in the visual studio we can check the crt code

2033881
atof	strtod	strlen	strtod	strlen	atof
why do you think atof strtod use strlen

2033950
implements	extends
i want users to extends the application by implements new port types and rules how to connect them through the eclipse extension point infrastructure

2033951
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently even browsers that do support svg firefox safari google-chrome opera don t support it directly inline in html they only support it directly inline in xhtml because the svg elements are in a different namespace

2033955
children	parent
if your parent delete rule is set to cascade all of those 1k children will be removed as well

2034007
debian	linux
edit debian linux for example has mingw in its repositories

2034023
versioning	upgrade
application expects grails versioning 1.1.1 but grails_home is versioning 1.2.0 - use the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your application expects

2034023
folder	directory
after reading around a bit i cleared out the 1.2.0 folder under .grails in my home directory from previous attempts while exploring the issue ran grails clean and grails upgrade answering y where prompted

2034043
int	chars
i am sure if you changed chars or short to int in your code would not equal when printed

2034076
versioning	upgrade
many of the applications that started crashing when people upgrade to iphone os 3.0 did so because those applications did something funky with subviews of ui elements and those elements changed in the new os versioning

2034079
public	protected
if you want a fast class then data should be protected and use protected and public methods

2034079
accessor	properties
of course if you want a constraint on some of your fields then use accessor functions or properties or something you want and make that field private because there is no other solution.

2034127
vim	emacs
i was learning vim and now i m experimenting with emacs

2034129
inherited	subclassing	getter	setter
that way subclassing have full access to their inherited variables and don t have the artificially created overhead of going through getter setter to access them

2034129
getter	setter	public	protected
in this case it can be made private and public protected getter setter can be provided instead

2034129
getter	setter
i ve seen classes whose own private methods accessed its member variables using only getter setter methods

2034130
getter	setter
there s nothing preventing you from marking a field as public although generally it is considered bad form use getter and setter instead

2034136
hide	show
edit if you want to hide the toolbar try the menu via options - show hide - toolbar

2034144
width	height
the question how best can i create a single box with a specified height and width and with the text in it aligned vertically

2034161
vim	emacs
this file gets loaded up when emacs starts similar to the .vimrc file for vim

2034198
int	chars
when using getchar i was told that it is better to use type int than type chars due to the fact that int can hold more values while chars can hold only 256 values

2034198
int	chars
also what is the actual important difference between chars and int

2034198
int	chars
if we can use int type instead of chars type why do we decide to use one over the other at certain times

2034228
int	chars
at the machine level the difference between int and chars is only the size or number of bytes of the memory allocated for it by the programming language

2034228
int	chars
in c iirc a chars is one byte while an int is 4 bytes

2034228
int	chars
being able to treat them as int or chars depends on how the language decides to interpret them this is also why its possible to convert back and forth between the two types

2034228
int	chars
type chars due to the fact that int

int	chars
this is why you need to store it into an int and check before casting to a chars

2034228
int	chars
difference between chars and int

2034228
int	chars
most importantly you would pick int or chars at the language level depending on whether you wanted to treat the variable as a number or a letter to switch you would need to cast to the other type

2034228
int	chars
if you wanted an int value that took up less space you could use a short int which i believe is 2 bytes or if you were really concerned with memory usage you could use a chars though mostly this is not necessary

2034246
int	chars
depending on the actual encoding all values between 0..255 can occur there for unsigned chars is not enough to represent the -1 and int is used

2034247
int	chars
note that in c a is of type int not chars but it s okay to do because a is able to fit in a chars type

2034253
int	chars	int	double
anyway typical sizes in memory on 32bit intel platforms would be 32 bits 4 bytes for unsigned signed int and float 64 bits 8 bytes for double 8 bits for chars signed unsigned

2034294
yacc	bison
tools such as lex yacc flex bison

2034300
public	protected
unit tests are for testing the visible so public and protected interface of a class

apache	lighttpd
the docs seem to steer you towards running either apache or lighttpd

2034307
ant	maven	ant	maven-assembly-plugin	maven-assembly-plugin	maven-shade-plugin
this can be achieved by hand or with a build tool like ant and the optional support of a project like one-jar or maven which has built-in support for this through the maven-assembly-plugin or the maven-shade-plugin

2034342
post	get
in order to give you the correct solution it s necessary to know what software stack s you re using and how the form is being submitted get post ajax+json

2034351
public	protected
what s indeed a little bit irritating or even a design flaw in c# or the whole .net cli possibly is that you can define a public constructor in an abstract class as it is always effectively protected then in that case

2034355
internationalization	localization
are you talking about internationalization and localization

2034363
cos	sin
w out using a specialized lib you could approximate the distance a few ways calculate it just as if it were planar rectangular then use the haversine formula to sort the subset later use a lookup table that approximates cos sin etc group locations into 5 sq

2034403
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be a hidden margin-top in my css which shows up in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2034487
hide	show
you can have the link in a div and hide it initially and start a javascript timer to show it

2034495
django	turbogears	django	web.py	web.py	turbogears
but anybody who s able to ace a more open-ended discursive interview such as this one is overwhelmingly likely to have really mastered and understood many of the layers of the relevant stack of technologies and abstractions -- i d much rather hire somebody with such a thorough deep-rooted understanding even if they ve never used turbogears but rather say django wekrzeug and web.py they ll be able to cram and get the turbogears-specific details down pat in a week tops than somebody who s committed to memory a stack of turbogears reference manuals but doesn t really understand http cookies tcp ip.

2034533
keyup	mouseup
keyup and mouseup events are enough i think

2034551
width	height

for readonly access you can just copy places.sqlite into a temporary file then open and explore that one

2034581
pascal	delphi
i highly recommend the delphi inspiration pascal preprocessor dipp

2034598
cas	shibboleth
cas is the most common but there are others such as openid and shibboleth

2034657
int	boolean
any fields in json can be mapped as string int boolean etc javabean properties

2034664
keyup	mouseup
there s no onpaste event at least not cross browser and the middle right click paste actually happens after the mouseup event so if you just did .bind change keyup mouseup func.

2034789
hash	md5
first compute the md5 hash of each image and place it in a list of pairs md5hash imageid

2034883
pop-up	dialog
i also made a dialog pop-up where i can change true a form the title and in the future some more content within the dialog for each portlet

2034888
int	double
not now and not for value-types such as int double in 4.0

2034888
int	double
which has an implicit conversion from int to double in the returned value

2034897
ant	maven
the second build can run a shell script or ant instead of maven allowing you easier control of your remote server

2034913
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
quick intro i was using a nib file for storing initial uitabbarcontroller state and to differ my tabs one from another i simply defined tag variables for uitabbaritem objects assigned to each uiviewcontroller stuffed in my uitabbarcontroller

2034914
int	double
delgates aren t convertable like this since double doesn t inherit from int or visa versa

2034962
firefox	safari
the html5 definition of appears to be implemented in firefox 3.5 and safari 4

2035021
springsource	grails
furthermore groovy and grails is now maintained by springsource so its popularity is only going to increase

2035032
ant	maven
another niggle for maven is lack of flexibility like in ant

2035069
nsdateformatter	nsnumberformatter
built in formatters are nsdateformatter and nsnumberformatter

2035076
post	get
if you have needs in that direction post a comment and i ll elaborate but i don t want to get accused of unjustified advertising so i ll leave it there for now

2035095
width	height
suppose you want to create the box of 40pt height and 3cm width

2035097
int	chars
note i have tried deleting and recreating the column using #value #default_value and it is still submitting only the first chars of the int

2035106
post	get
usually each controller is a servlet that handles get post requests for a single page responding to them by presenting a correct view or transferring jurisdiction to another controller

2035117
getattr	setattr
for example using the getattr and setattr methods on objects you could write a class that provides a fluent way of accessing elements from an xml document

2035172
firefox	safari
it s aligning right in ie but not firefox or safari

2035198
gridview	detailsview
i have tried using gridview detailsview etc and none of them seem to enable editing

2035250
children	parent
the way i see it a group is a parent which has topics and users as children

2035250
children	parent
therefore i was thinking of a separate parent entity which stores the user contact and login info and that user would have children containing the group id which each user belongs to so that i know what groups to fetch

2035257
firefox	safari
the code sample that you posted seems to be aligning correctly to the center in both firefox and safari on a mac

2035290
firefox	safari
...haha the box above the copyright area was not centering right in firefox and safari but was right in ie

2035341
getter	setter
example only the getter and setter could be more defensive

2035542
udp	tcp
there is a way to do emulate the same behavior as threaded tcp socket create a new client handler thread on accept but with udp

2035657
kde	gnome
i like the result to be gnome or kde or else

2035665

2035678
vim	emacs
how to open files in browsers e.g firefox within editors like vim or emacs

2035679
google-chrome	firefox
what happens is that the script will be executed in firefox while ie and google-chrome will for some reason avoid running it

2035697
vim	notepad++
edit you could in fact use to cause vim to act very much like notepad++ though this mapping won t care whether you press shift or not

2035698
portrait	landscape
i could listen for a configuration_change broadcast but that will run everytime the phone switches to landscape or portrait and i only want it to happen when the homescreen is shown

2035778
put	get
ie it does not matter what order they put the date in it would always get 9 as the day

2035786
int	double
now we could do the conversion by allocating a new method that fixes it up -- that takes the 4 byte int and turns it into an 8 byte double

2035815
width	height
the mostly accurate way for small angles and the camera centered on the middle is to measure the ratio of the width height between normal image and angle image on the middle lines because they are not warped

2035899
stdout	fflush
the program outputs many lines of data and fflush stdout after each line

2035902
msg	eml
use microsoft exchange server mapi editor mfcmapi which is a great tool to retrieve msg or eml files

2035908
put	get
only when a new object is created and the pointer to it implicitly put in the array does storage for the object get allocated

2035912
wordpress	expressionengine
expressionengine cms and wordpress blog lite-cms are often used both php based but there are tons out there

2035914
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
this should ensure that your site is standards compliant which will mean it will play well with firefox safari opera and even later versions of ie to an extent

2035917
ssl	https
serving static content on a cloud like amazon is an option and some of the cloud providers let you use https as well as long as you are fine with using a subdomain of their domain name due to technical limitations in ssl

2035963
min	max
group-by in sql is usually used for things like sum avg max min count etc

2035977
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in your first line you re attempting to assign an nsstring i hate... to an nsmutablestring teststring

2035978
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you need to handle the mousemove event and if the mouse button was pressed track this in mousedown and mouseup set a variable that gets read in your paint event to draw the tile

2035979
vbscript	jscript
natively you can also learn how to use vbscript jscript

2035984
disk	ram
set the limit of ram for each virtual machine say 2gb each with virtual hard disk of 10gb..now boot all vm s together at the same time that would really put a strain on the machine and it would also put a load on the network stack as well

2035996
pow	math.h
i am using the exp and pow functions in a program for iphone which would use the math.h library if i was programming in c

2036025
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
the app can run on any one of the major commercial websphere weblogic oracle or free glassfish jboss servers

i know the width and height of the logo but the images vary

2036077
postgresql	mysql
other than learning java spring hibernate servlets jsp s how to use eclipse netbeans databases like mysql oracle postgresql jms junit etc

2036101
ant	maven
so get used to new tools java has different tool-set and ides as ms-tools this also includes build-envs like maven or ant

2036152
vim	emacs
i reckon the same thing would work with vim but i ve only used it in emacs

2036160
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade h2 it may not any longer be able to read the files it created in a previous versioning

2036205
cpu	processors
truth is a lot of processors such as recent x86s have hardware in the cpu that optimizes these access pretty well at least the padding and read-modify-write parts since they re so common and usually only involve transfers between the processors and cache

2036250
min	max
each variable is analysed in terms of some simple statistics min max mean stddev

2036282
hide	show
i have a list of items with some details that i would like to reveal upon clicking a show hide details link

2036282
hide	show
i m having trouble making it so that the show hide link only reveals the div of a specific item

2036282
hide	show
right now it is revealing all of the divs when clicking any of the show hide links

2036308
mouse	keyboard
the machine where the gui is displayed and which handles in the keyboard and mouse is the server

2036308
mouse	keyboard
because the server is making the monitor keyboard and mouse available to the client

2036311
stdout	fflush
you re not seeing the first printf because the program crashes before stdout is fflush

2036314
hide	show
it looks to me like all your show hide links are calling the same function show_details etc which show hide all posts because of the loop not specific ones

2036315
client-side	server-side
with connection pooling in place the one-connection-per-request model will work too with rather small client-side overhead and no server-side overhead

2036334
vb6	vba
vb6 and vba is also com based and that is a problem if you want to run as a standard user and not have write access to the registry

2036358
128bit	64bit
i am not aware of any 128bit value on 64bit systems could be wrong here but haven t come across that type in the kernel or regular user apps

2036368
rss	feed
is there some sort of rss feed from apple that i don t know about

2036423
post	get
as you reach certain milestones of functionality post some fliers advertising your super-cool site to get some traffic and momentum before your deadline

2036430
scrollable	panels
i m trying to tackle a problem that seemingly many android developers have which is how to intersperse lists with non-list data in one big scrollable panels

2036430
post	put
i ve read enough so answers and mailing list post to know not to put a listview inside of a scrollview but i want the same effect without using addheader and addfooter with very complex header and footer views

2036442
post	get
some effect with get post

2036442
post	get
a form that display the get data in your page and maybe something to write to a txt file on post

2036451
fseek	fgetc
for example calling fseek infile 0 seek_set would reset it to the beginning of the file causing the next fgetc call to start over from the first character of the file

2036452
invokerequired	begininvoke
in the clipboard operation i just used invokerequired and begininvoke when needed to make sure those ui changes happen on the main thread

2036506
interlocked	lockless
also if you can get away with an interlocked exchange that is best as it is lockless though still stalls the cpu and raises lock# for multi core memory but most locks use this anyway but need to do more

2036526
for-loop	loops
for example the if statement maps directly to a goto while the standard for-loop actually maps to a while loops which maps to a goto

2036614
caliburn	prism
regarding wpf silverlight applications i would strongly recommend to start building applications right on top of prism composite wpf and or caliburn - although it might be confusing from the beginning still it is a much better choice than with vanilla wpf speaking about practices they force you to use

2036638
submit	submission
on click of submit i call a function to validate the form and incase of error i will be setting the errormessage thru innerhtml and need to scroll to top of the page without submission

2036647
hide	show
kind of like toggle but then with some more then just show hide functionality

2036676
notepad++	textpad
i don t know if you can replace special characters in word but in most text editors textpad notepad++ you can replace via a regex so you can write r n to replace all instances of newlines with whatever you wish

2036679
post	get
i finally want to get my notifications and messages an i want to post something

2036711
mouse	keyboard
so what i do at start is clamp everything together - mouse handling keyboard handling drawing layouting - all in one function until i start feeling confident that code does what it suppose to do

2036718
unsigned	short
these functions are needed for signed and unsigned short int and long in big and little endian order

2036734
ant	maven
you haven t specified what ci system you use but regardless of this have you considered using maven instead of ant as your build tool

2036739
unix	solaris
i prefer a solaris unix server running the jvm but for 200 threads a modern windows machine will do just fine

2036816
stdout	stderr
fclose stdin stdout and stderr and don t write to them

2036816
daemons	launchd
it is possible when you launchd the daemons to redirect them using the shell you ll have to find out yourself how to do that i don t know

2036822
put	get
another way to get around this problem is to put a statement between the case label and the first declaration as you ve done in your working example above

2036823
aggregate-functions	sum
furthermore you can use aggregate-functions to calculate the sum for each group

2036858
post	get
i know result page that uses get method can be bookmarked while the one using post cannot be

2036858
post	get
now suppose i want to build a search engine which by default uses get allowing users to bookmark but when the length of the search phrase exceeds the limit switch to post

2036866
post	get
there is the array that merges get post and cookie values but the better way would be to handle get and post manually in your script

2036866
post	get
the only notable difference between the two methods is that a get parameter has size limitations depending on browser and receiving web server post has limitations too but they are usually in the range of several megabytes

2036875
children	parent
option s are nothing but ordinary children of a parent element and all of jquery s filtering possibilities should apply without restriction

2036890
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
for example how much does pre-sorting save on either sortedlist or sorteddictionary

2036901
put	get
the first is to get the values in the controller and put them into the viewdata dictionary like so

2036904
post	get
here s how you could use get and post in one

2036910
getter	setter
it hardcodes a lot of assumptions about what your application requires into the class and it also makes it the responsibility of the class to know and provide this data through getter and setter

2036910
config	ini
also have a look at zend_config as it meets all your requirements already and let s you init the config object from xml ini and plain arrays

2036921
fileinputstream	filechannel
my question is how to get a filechannel or other nio class for reading a file without using java.io fileinputstream

2036937
int	double
it does not use standard function prototype syntax t foo because 2 functions with the same name differing only by the return type cannot coexist int foo conflicts with double foo

2036966
int	double
if this were not the case you could define an int conversion operator for example that actually returned a double

2036970
getter	setter
could you explain what getter and setter are and could give you some examples

2036988
getter	setter
in java getter and setter are completely ordinary functions

2036988
getter	setter
the only thing that makes them getter or setter is convention

2036988
getter	setter
a getter for foo is called getfoo and the setter is called setfoo

2036988
getter	setter
they also must have a specific declaration as shown in this example of a getter and setter for name

2036988
getter	setter
the reason for using getter and setter instead of making your members public is that it makes it possible to change the implementation without changing the interface

2036988
getter	setter
also many tools and toolkits that use reflection to examine objects only accept objects that have getter and setter

2036988
getter	setter
javabeans for example must have getter and setter as well as some other requirements

2037032
background-color	transparency
can you try giving the link a background-color transparency or a transparency background image

2037048
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
in this release a file channel can be obtained from an existing fileinputstream fileoutputstream or randomaccessfile object by invoking that object s getchannel method which returns a file channel that is connected to the same underlying file

2037058
width	height
remove the height and width from you img tags css can take care of that

2037156
junit	testng	junit	unitils	testng	unitils
i couldn t figure out how exactly you could get the junit 4 running with all of your dependencies but i did notice that you re dependency on the testng unitils artifact was what was causing the problem

2037164
nsstring	nsdata
if you want a nsstring from nsdata use

2037197
firefox	safari
in my test html file i tried both calling .hide and .css display none but none of them seemed to work in safari mac but worked as expected in firefox mac

2037205
imagick	gmagick
i m open to other image libraries such as imagick gmagick or cairo for php but i d prefer to avoid using other languages than php

2037245
int	chars
2 a sequence of chars plus a separate field either an int length or a pointer to the end of the string to tell you how long it is

2037271
hide	show
then you can hide show the whole group instead

2037298
mouseleave	mouseenter
then i have the mouseenter and mouseleave which are needed to yield the proper glow i want for the tiles

2037298
mousedown	mouseenter
what should i do to get the same results as in the original minesweeper with the mousedown and mouseenter into other tiles

2037298
mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mousehover	mousehover	mouseenter
i tried many other things such as mouseenter mousemove and mousehover but all seem to yield the same crummy result as what i already have

2037324
firefox	safari
you need to check what your browser supports but this works in firefox 3.5 and safari on the iphone

2037331
explode	implode
but you can also use a combination of explode array_reverse and implode

2037351
rss	feed
are there any free php javascript libraries out there which would help in displaying an rss feed as html

2037362
rss	feed
it can parse rss feed to arrays which you can easily iterate through and build your html

2037401
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
so populating sortedlist with sorted input and populating sorteddictionary with unsorted input is both o nlog n

2037401
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary

2037407
flac	speex
this doesn t seem to get me all the way there loads of formats are wrapper formats that hide the exact codec used within -- for example .ogg files can internally use the vorbis speex or flac codecs

2037416
ffmpeg	libavformat
ffmpeg includes a library called libavformat that can open and demux pretty much any media format

2037487
jar	war
where can i find short practical tutorials that actually teach me where to code what and then compile and where to put all the files war jar ear.. in glassfish to be able to see the output from a web browser

2037487
put	get
feels like i never get to know how i can put up a web server with java cause i can√¢ t find this kind of tutorials

2037507
ubuntu	freebsd
the code above works just fine on ubuntu 9.04 os x 10.6 and freebsd 7

2037544
rss	feed
stackoverflow.com provides rss feed

2037544
rss	feed
the simplest solution is download argotic an rss framework for .net c# and use this with your application to get the latest feed

2037546
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails merb etc

2037630
cos	sin
cos and sin in most programming languages are in radians

2037706
maven	pom.xml
now to add a dependency either right-click the project and select maven add dependency or edit the pom.xml manually

2037707
pull	push
for the push pull etc meta data i would use keywords or stereotypes to convey this

2037712
mvp	presenter
in mvp the view needs to pass itself into the presenter and i can t work out how to do this with spring

2037716
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the root of one of my uinavigationcontroller is a uiviewcontroller

2037717
packets	multicast
in particular if i could set up multicast routes that would effectively combine the two interfaces i could then look at each packets to determine which network that would be fine

2037735
factors	matrix
is there an optimisation that lowers the constant factors of the runtime of floyd-warshall if you are guaranteed to have a symmetric adjacency matrix

2037750
children	parent
in the case of human parent each should refer to the same offspring a list of human children object

2037762
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
is there some easy and elegant way to get the desired result in all common browsers ie6-8 firefox opera safari

2037790
sorting	filtering
msdn has more information on filtering and sorting datasets

2037792
children	parent
parent do not contain children they are related to their children and when somebody marries into family they have new relationships associations created with the existing family

2037801
telerik	radwindow
i have a parent page that launches a telerik radwindow and passes it an argument

2037830
try-catch	exception-handling
this method contains a try-catch block to catch exception-handling of the type system.net.webexception and rethrow it so that the main method can catch it and act appropriately

2037830
try-catch	exception-handling
the one that was invoked didn t have a try-catch block so that the exception-handling thrown inside my class method made the app do what it was supposed to crash

2037929
disk	ram
since you cannot do much in 512 bytes of code although in fact a bootloader is not strictly limited to 512 bytes a bootloader would usually do not much more than load a larger block of code from a disk into ram and then execute it

2037956
put	get
i verified the order that the event handlers were being called by adding in alert statements actually no matter what order i put these lines of code my handler always responded first which is a bit fishy to me but no matter how hard i try i can t get the first handler to quit

2037988
for-loop	arrays
when foreach is used with arrays type compiler translates it into normal for-loop

2037989
vim	emacs
there are the two holy choices vim and emacs

2037989
vim	emacs
if so then definitely give the vim emacs approach a try

2037998
for-loop	arrays
when foreach is used with arrays type compiler translates it into normal for-loop

2038006
ord	chr
in php the strings letters cannot be used like in c you need to use ord and chr in order to convert from number to char and vica versa but

2038009
put	get
these objects get put through a √¢ ≈ìphase√¢ where all attributes must be filled out by users

2038038
getter	setter
you may also want to read why getter and setter methods are evil

2038038

i believe you should be good if you call setmaximumsize on the jscrollpane with the width height of the bufferedimage but haven t tried it

2042588
bmp	png
png bmp jpg

2042622
width	height
is there a way using xaml and possibly template bindings to keep a control s width in a certain proportion to its height

2042645
inherited	properties
none of the elements have their width set to 100 so i doubt it s inherited properties

2042649
public	protected
as far as i know in inheritance all attributes and methods private public and protected in super class are passed child class

2042675
getdate	datepart
i am not sure how to compare for the weekend in the where clause - i know i should be using datepart dw getdate but i cant seem to see the entire picture to solve it

2042685
public	protected
protected and public members are passed on

2042692
hide	show
i am working with a pretty complicated .aspx page that is full of controls telerik ajax etc. that all expand collapse show hide etc

2042693
opera	safari
this page gives a cross-browser implementation targeting ie6+ ff2+ safari 3+ and opera

2042700
pop-up	dialog
if your dialog is a regular pop-up window it is not possible to prevent the user from closing the window

2042700
jquery	jqmodal
you could use a jquery modal dialog plugin such as jqmodal

2042704
hash	md5
i have implemented a key value file cache where i md5 hash the key to determine the file name for the hash file

2042765
mockito	easymock	mockito	jmockit	easymock	powermockito	easymock	jmockit	powermockito	jmockit
i m thinking to jmockit or powermockito the later extends easymock and mockito and provides the ability to mock static methods

2042766
gridview	objectdatasource
i am using a repository class with linq-to-sql as the objectdatasource for a web gridview

2042777
prepare	execute
you prepare stmt_name but execute stmt - is this just a typo

2042833
google-chrome	firefox
i have a simple ajax script that works perfectly fine in google-chrome internet explorer 8 firefox 3.5.5 but fails in firefox 3.5.7

2042843
post	get
i ve already seen lots of post on the site for rtf to html and some other post talking about some html to rtf converters but i m really trying to get a full breakdown of what is considered the most widely used commercial product open source product or if people recommend going home grown

2042845
post	get
but you might get even better suggestions if you post your class es -- or a slimmed-down version of them

2042853
disk	ram
otherwise you can create a ram disk and save your cached files to that disk instead

2042909
getter	setter
in ecmascript 5 there is support for getter setter and you can spoof the document reference if accessed from within a scope which redefines it

2042935
width	height
if you want the first type of resizing stretch the content then place the canvas into a container div and set the width and height of the canvas to 100 using css

2042935
width	height
first you must adjust the width and height attributes of the canvas element

2042980
client-side	server-side	prepare	execute
generally the prepare and execute statements are client-side operations that the server-side of the dbms does not normally see

2042980
prepare	execute
however given that you have problems i recommend splitting up the second chunk of sql into two separate operations - and omit the prepare blurb and the execute blurb

2043013
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has been this way for awhile and google-chrome i believe has always been this way

2043049
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
to read a text file use bufferedreader - in this case wrapped round an inputstreamreader wrapped round a fileinputstream

2043061
onmouseover	onclick
type - can be onmouseover onmouseout onclick or onplotreset

2043075
client-side	server-side
the asp.net mvc 2 rc vs.net project template does show how to implement that on the server-side using the propertiesmustmatchattribute but not on the client-side

2043090
ssl	https
and these are all through https ssl

2043101
hash	salt
since it is common practice to prepend the salt to the password hash the salt is generally known to an attacker

2043108
post	get
if i get this to work i will have a blog post upcoming

2043120
post	get
get post and cookie data

2043147
width	height
for example you should specify swp_nosize otherwise passing 0 for cx and cy will cause the window to shrink to zero width and height at the same time

2043160
children	parent
the easiest way i can think of would be to construct a dictionary that contains all possible children for a given parent like so

2043200
post	get
you just pass an variable to the handler via get or post that tells the handler which content to show

2043207
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and so on just refresh the page like a charm but ie dont

2043248
bionic	glibc
this already runs with glibc rather than bionic

2043309
short	base
in short in catch ex as system.servicemodel.faultexception i want to examine ex and get the base real type of the exception either as a type mostly for debugging so i can add another catch block or as a string for logging

2043321
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and ie8 but not in opera or google-chrome

2043399
folder	directory
for example in a project where foldercustomnamespaceres.resx is placed inside a directory named folder

2043467
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
wouldn t the simplest solution be to tie a textchanged or selectedindexchanged event to any all fields in the datagrid that need to trigger a refresh of the combobox

2043481
getter	setter
you should create public getter and setter

2043511
jlist	jlabel
i created a jframe object and added a jlabel and a jlist to the frame but both objects are being placed on top of each other

2043558
int	boolean
aindex int boolean

2043574
hide	show
this should work to hide all on click then show the specific player directly following the button in the dom

2043580
outputstream	inputstream
after connecting the result i get is an httpentity which has a method getcontent which returns an inputstream and also has a method writeto which writes to an outputstream

2043609
3des	aes
i d use 3des or aes for any encryption

2043635
pop-up	dialog
if you need a more specific answer to your question you ll need to do a better job of describing what you mean by return -- do you want to see the text in a label appear in a pop-up dialog etc

2043667
public	protected
access specifiers public protected private don t control visibility of the name

2043705
children	parent
i have tried eq next parent children in several different ways to succeed but it have only given me even more headache

2043833
put	get
a component i have created works fine if i put it in the main project and reference it from any res layout xml but when i put it in a project on which the main project depends i get a classnotfoundexception in the xml

2043840
subtract	add
this way we always know the date time in the database is correct to utc and if we need to adjust for client display or reporting we can add subtract the offset for all date time values regardless of which server s the data came from

2043841
youtube	vimeo
personally i prefer to see videos on something like vimeo rather than youtube or a similar site

2043865
xpages	lotus
instead it was a lotus notes xpages question

2043878
hide	show
by using show 0 media controller will be show until hide is called by an interaction with the player

2043922
width	height
in css you have width 100 and height 100

2043961
hash	salt
if the salt in this case would be for example otazmzyzodqzmjk5ntm1ndc1n the string to be hash is otazmzyzodqzmjk5ntm1ndc1npassword which is a lot more unlikely to appear in rainbow tables

2043978
int	chars
to that address add sizeof int chars -chunks - you will get a new address

2043986
decoder	encoder
to convert an mp3 file to a file of lower bitrate you must decoder and re-encode the file so you need an mp3 decoder and an mp3 encoder

2043991
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
why does an onclicklistener for a view inside a listview not respond to a trackball click on the view while an onitemclicklistener for the listview does respond to a trackball click on one of the listview s views

2043995
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
this would work but the purpose of using salt is to differentiate the hash key to strengthen the crypt algorithm

2043995
hash	salt
also it would be better not to include the salt and hash key in the same table

2043996
youtube	vimeo
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so they ll play on iphone

2044021
int	double
here s why many common architectures including x86 have a hardware instruction to convert signed int to double but do not have a hardware conversion from unsigned to double so the compiler needs to synthesize the conversion in software

2044021
int	double
gcc s software conversion from unsigned int to double may very well be suboptimal it almost certainly is given the magnitude of the slowdown that you observed but it is expected behavior for the code to be faster when using signed int

2044021
int	double
assuming a smart compiler the difference should be much smaller on a 64-bit system because a 64-bit signed int - double conversion can be used to efficiently do a 32-bit unsigned conversion

2044021
integer	unsigned
on the other hand if the integer variables are unsigned cvtsi2sd can t be used to do the conversion so a software workaround is required

2044056
rss	feed
i do that and a few more things in the 200-line script driving the cranberries rss feed html summary of package updates at cran which stores stateful info in sqlite

2044061
phpunit	simpletest
it can be used with any unit test framework like phpunit or simpletest

2044065
post	get
you probably want to make it just a plain function not a static member function as in your post to get a simple c interface to it.

2044124
int	double
int to double

2044124
int	double
what about the inverse float to int conversion or double to int

2044147
ienumerable	iqueryable
i was also thinking that iqueryable inherits from ienumerable and perhaps that was the way to go but i have failed to find any information that made sense to me on how to actually accomplish this

2044157
awt	swing
if i want to code an desktop application in windows with java should i buy a book about swing and just skip reading books tutorials about awt

2044157
awt	swing
or do i have to learn awt before using swing

2044162
width	height
lets say i have an image that has a dpi of 72 and a width height of 100px 100px

2044164
hide	show
what to show in the beginning what to hide

2044164
draggable	droppable
maybe some draggable droppable pattern can be applied for instance after you have entered user s name you drop it on an appropriate task

2044166
awt	swing
there is no benefit getting your head around awt as swing is essentially a replacement for it

2044178
uploadify	swfupload
i am having exactly the same problem with yui uploader swfupload 2.2 and 2.5a and uploadify

2044205
awt	swing
as for the swing vs awt - swing straight away i would say

2044267
rss	feed
you do have xmldocument or can xml serialize a class to create that rss feed

2044274
floating-point	integer
it is of course impossible to meaningfully reinterpret an integer value as a floating-point value and vice versa since their physical representations are generally completely different

2044274
floating-point	integer
when you convert an integer value to a floating-point type the original value is converted exactly if it can be represented exactly by the target type

2044274
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
when you convert a floating-point value to integer type the fractions part is simply discarded not the nearest value is taken but the number is rounded towards zero

2044274
floating-point	integer
note also that floating-point to integer conversions and the reverse are standard conversions and formally require no explicit cast whatsoever

2044311
awt	swing
well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt

2044311
awt	swing
i have used both and i prefer swing over awt

2044311
awt	swing
also you do not need to learn awt to learn swing basics

2044347
awt	swing
swing replaces a lot of awt s concepts and components but integrates many others unchanged such as layout managers

2044347
awt	swing
if you learn swing you ll learn those parts of awt that still matter and how they are used in swing pretty much automatically

2044370
width	height
it sounds like you ll want to check out the scaleabsolute method of the itextsharp.text.image which will explicitly set the height width of an image

2044401
postgresql	mysql
this is the postgresql but under mysql it is mostly identical except for the extract dow and some group by additions but that isn t the problem the problem is it used to

2044468
rss	feed
system.servicemodel.syndication contains a bunch of classes for creating and consuming rss and atom feed

2044482
udp	tcp
alternatively you could base a tcpappender class on udpappender which uses tcp rather than udp - providing a reliable delivery service

2044510
hide	show
can you put the townships inside of a div and then simply show hide that div

2044534
int	chars
however you may be interested in isxdigit int chars which returns 0 if the chars passed isn t a valid hexadecimal chars note that x is not included as a valid chars

2044538
x86	64bit
if you want to ensure your code works on virtually all x86 processors out there stick to the 386 instruction set if your code is 32-bit or early x86-64 instruction set if it s 64bit

2044573
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
all of the grid features supported by smartclient - inline editing grouping filtering dynamic frozen columns sorting reordering fields drag and drop

google-chrome	firefox
i am building a site right now using the new sifr3 it works perfectly on firefox google-chrome but not on ie7 to view click here

2044594
width	height
calculate the width and height will be occupied by the image after rotation

2044629
google-chrome	firefox
so when i test the webform i see it doesnt even pop up in firefox the client s browser too nor google-chrome only in ie8

2044655
rss	feed
rss is just an xml file with one item for each feed post

2044683
subtract	add
to remember whether to add or subtract just remember that its always earlier east

2044684
google-chrome	firefox
enabling cross domain in firefox and google-chrome was easy by setting the header on the handling server

2044694
sorting	filtering
querydsl is type-safe and supports filtering sorting and projecting collections

2044699
google-chrome	firefox
in ie you ll only see the elements and comments not text nodes so it ll be best to use firefox or google-chrome or something you said it wouldn t have to be cross browser

2044706
int	boolean
only a few data types can be natively accessed eg int boolean without locking assuming you re not using interlocked

2044714
stdout	stderr
both true and false are printed on stdout with an exit status of 0 the fatal error is printed on stderr with an exit status of 128

2044834
for-loop	arrays
the enhanced for-loop works over arrays and iterables separately

2044843
for-loop	arrays
java arrays are not iterable even though the enhanced for-loop can iterate over them

2044852
bazaar	git
i understand git and darcs but have no knowledge about bazaar

2044853
xstream	jibx
i ve looked at jibx and xstream but neither of them seem to be designed to do what i m talking about

2044856
jstl	taglib
with servlets you can control preprocess and or postprocess requests and forward the request to the jsp file which in turn displays the data using el and controls the page flow dynamically using taglib like and jstl

2044867
put	get
i tried to put this into a view but i get slapped with errors

2044894
stdout	stderr
you could write the few things that need showing to stderr instead of stdout

2044955
stdout	stderr
windows actually does have the notion of stdout and stderr

2044991
jmock	guice
i have started using guice to do some dependency injection on a project primarily because i need to inject mocks using jmock currently a layer away from the unit test which makes manual injection very awkward

2045010
for-loop	arrays
you could also use an arrays of objects and a for-loop if you need to do this many times

2045043
fink	macports
you can have even more if you decide to install python via fink or macports

2045043
fink	macports
running these instructions with python2.5 and python you will be able to correctly install pycairo for both versions or for any version installed via macports fink

2045057
ant	maven
when you use netbeans or eclipse do you have to use the maven ant build script

2045057
ant	maven
if you don t use maven ant how does netbeans eclipse perform the build then

2045071
addition	multiplication
i was working predominantly in assembler many years ago and deciding that i needed to learn my basic facts in hex multiplication and addition tables

2045083
ant	maven
if you want to build that automatically you ll need ant or maven

2045083
ant	maven
which is not to say you can t use ant or maven within eclipse both are fully supported by plugins

2045106
int	chars
ie how much memory will be consumed by a simple pojo with an int member and a string member say that holds a 10 chars string

2045118
min	max
as for #2 if you just want the results then remove the min and max aggregate functions from your query

2045128
ndepend	fxcop
overall other tools fxcop and resharper can help with this too but this sort of dependency analysis is ndepend s raison d etre

2045147
int	chars
i would say 144 bits for the string 32 for the pointer 80 for the 10 chars 32 for the length int 32 bits for the int and 32 for the pointer to the object making 208 bits

2045165
matlab	simulink
it was faster than matlab simulink themselves

2045181
typedef	struct
i was assuming the use of the typedef construct as follows for the board struct

2045181
typedef	struct
since i ve never seen anyone using struct in c without a typedef i made this assumption.

2045215
folder	directory
i m laying out a download management that will segregate each users downloads separate watched directory each download to their own folder can t see each others queues etc

2045217
vpn	lan
i noticed that fiddler would stop using the lan settings configuration once i connected to my vpn

2045254
client-side	server-side
if you need all the values added client-side you have to send those up using some other method anyway because they will not be present in the server-side control

2045329
pull	push
developers should be able to pull from any branch and push back to any branch except for master which we want to see as read-only

2045339
post	put
answer was to pass the application model into the edit post - had to put a hidden field on form for the object to be filled correctly and ensure i was getting the application objetc not a var

2045350
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
perhaps it s a custom uibutton designed to look like uisegmentedcontrol

2045359
post	get
when there is a get or post variable xdebug_session_start or the

2045378
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
a salt md5 hash usually works fine or even an aes implementation if md5 is viewed as too weak

2045426
put	get
i can put data in and get it out of the datastore and i am trying to make it so that a user cannot be entered twice

2045433
width	height
you can use though to help sifr sort out the height of the flash movie and of course tweak the letter-spacing to sort out the width of the text

2045442
width	height
but i ve found that if i don t explicitly state the width and height of an image they trace as 0

2045442
width	height
so that i can scale down an image to fit within a given space how do i get the width and height of a source image

2045459
jobs	cron
the developers seem to only be awarding badges with cron jobs

2045459
jobs	cron
these would be used with some per user action and cron jobs to give badges

2045501
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
only in firefox not in ie safari or google-chrome

2045511
linefeed	delimiter
the ragged right option doesn t appear to work for me as the columns themselves don t have delimiter in them no cr linefeed for instance

2045525
width	height
a flash.display.loader has width and height attributes

2045568
int	chars
i have found some symbols using conversion from int to chars

2045602
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
for some reason though everytime i plug in a device whether it be a mouse or a keyboard or the device i am developing which are all hid s the value of wparam is always 0x7

2045607
converter	multibinding
you can use a multibinding and a converter to bind to the item in the row and the parent datagrid

2045608
comparator	comparable
the mydate class will need to implement the interface comparable which will require the method int comparator object o to be implemented

2045608
equals	compareto
in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method

2045624
linefeed	delimiter
linefeed as the record delimiter

2045626
int	chars
in order to save int safely and portably you have to format them byte at a time into a chars buffer that will then be written out to a file

2045626
int	chars
because no pointer casting of int types to chars or vice-versa are done the code is fully portable

2045626
floating-point	integer
doing the same for floating-point types requires extra caution and a pointer cast so that the value can be handled as an integer so that bit shifting works

2045650
inherited	properties
if you want to filter out the inherited properties

2045692
wmv	asf	wmv	ogg
try the free fstream iphone app that can handle mms asf wmv asx and ogg

2045699
implements	extends
extends or implements a membership provider is quite straightforward actually and sounds like a good approach for your problem

2045728
int	chars
handling wide chars strings utf-16 or utf-32 is like handling int - and you can use code similar to the code above for uint2 and uint8 if you wish i have such functions pre-packaged for example - i just copied the uint4 versions

2045742
firefox	safari
it s been working fine in safari although every so often there s a glitch where the height of the top image changes but it s y position doesn t but it hasn t been working in firefox at all

2045770
rss	feed
back in about 2006 i wrote a nice xslt that transformed my rss feed into custom html

now days most browsers ie firefox safari opera seem to grab hold of the styles and won t let go

2045797
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

2045858
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are much better

2045860
g++	gcc
for gcc or clang that means just doing the final link stage using g++

2045869
apache	nginx
so i m moving my site away from apache and onto nginx and i m having trouble with this scenario

2045870
int	double
int to double

2045870
int	double
assuming also 64 bit ieee double it is not possible for an int- double conversion to be imprecise because all int values can be exactly represented as a double

2046040
ssl	https
https is just normal http traffic that is encrypted using ssl tls

2046068
pop-up	dialog
rather that the line you posted as it should pop-up a dialog and is clearly given as a working example

2046078
firefox	safari
i tested in safari and firefox on the mac but it should work correctly in ie7+

2046095
google-chrome	firefox
the best solution would be to develop a plug-in for the browser used by your user whether it be for internet explorer firefox or google-chrome etc

2046134
ubuntu	centos
centos is designed for remote server installations and has lots of nice management features ubuntu is probably the eaiest to maintain -- it just sort of happens

2046147
google-chrome	firefox
since you have not specified the rest of your css i could only test it with default settings in google-chrome internet explorer 8 and mozilla firefox but this should look exactly the same across browsers making use of position absolute

2046154
put	get
just put a couple of things then do a build see if you get the release directory created which should be at the same level as dojo dijit etc. and it will have the entire dojo system in it all minified as well as your built layered stuff

2046179
magento	oscommerce
as to the other poster s comment about oscommerce and magento

2046179
magento	oscommerce
unlike magento oscommerce has and always will be intended as a core ecommerce solution on which you build you own unique ecommerce solution

2046184
post	put
i should have been using put instead of post and the call should have looked like this

2046202
folder	directory
i have added the json-framework stig b - google code to my classes folder just the json directory as per option 1 instructions

2046218
actionscript	haxe
i have recently started using haxe which converts to llvm and then to abc code actionscript byte code

2046236
folder	directory
do you have a .svnignore file in your project directory that may be excluding the json folder

2046239
webrat	cucumber
i m writing cucumber tests with webrat and test unit

2046267
folder	directory
this gets the physical path on disk to the application s directory in the case of a wcf service hosted from iis the virtual folder s absolute file path

2046398
hide	show
this way you only load the pages once and just hide show divs as needed to rotate through them

2046416
gif	png
since cannot be jpg gif and png at the same time at least two of the sub-conditions are true

2046436
jobs	cron
these shared tables are also maintained by a series of cron jobs

2046436
jobs	cron
i would love to avoid duplicating these tables and thus the cron jobs if at all possible

2046438
webkit	gecko
i m trying to get the real end of scrolltop but due to different rendering engines gecko webkit blah blah

2046447
rss	feed
i want to know and understand the structure of youtube s rss feed max-results 50

2046453
spaces	delimiter
split isn t your best bet here and since the delimiter can be both a matched and non matched character it will be clearest to invert the problem and describe what you do what to match which in this case is either a string of non spaces characters or the contents of a c style comment

2046495
queue	fifo
the trace itself may be modeled with a fifo queue of co-ordinates that is shifted with each frame

google-chrome	firefox
it should be also a web project and extensions for browsers like google-chrome firefox ie

2050446
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome or firefox as my browsers of choice but i d even consider using ie again if someone found a plugin that did this

2050481
inherited	properties
when you use this in a class that inherited from object your class does via movieclip- displayobject- eventdispatcher- object the compiler won t throw an error if the properties does not exist because it attempts to create that properties as a member of this

2050488
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
if you want to inherited a class the superclass s interface hence the whole superclass hierarchy must be known so that the ivar offsets of the subclassing can be calculated

2050507
width	height
i need to create a class that can be accessible through the asp classic s server.createobject method and that exposes three properties int width int height bool loaded and three methods void load string locatoin void resize int width int height and void save string location

versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to versioning 3 of nhibernate and the new linq provider seems to be working perfectly well for the same query

2050664
jar	manifest.mf
i suggest that you check the manifest.mf file of your jar

2050674
post	get
where the second argument to the post dict s get method is the value to return if the key var in this case doesn t exist

2050686
vb.net	vb6
the code was converted from vb6 to vb.net and i have figured out most of things that i need to do

2050691
mouse	keyboard
it is also more consistent applies both to mouse and keyboard navigation

2050693
width	height
for instance if i have a linearlayout with the layout width and height set to fill_parent and i have a button with those values set to wrap_content it uses the value from the button like the button values overide the linearlayout

2050718
postgresql	mysql
i have experience with programming objctive-c php web development java c c++ jsp j2me and sql databases like mysql postgresql apache derby

the interactive window station assigned to the logon session of the interactive user also contains the keyboard mouse and display device

2050727
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code below doesn t work in ie6 7 8 but it does work in firefox safari google-chrome

2050736
versioning	upgrade
problem is when i m doing upgrade the users still use the old versioning from their cache which often breaks the application and requires clearing the cache every time to solve the problem

2050740
atomic	interlocked
this approach may be used to build a lock-free queue using two atomic single-linked list based stacks such as provided by win32 interlocked singly linked lists

2050744
vbscript	vba
i ve written vbscript but the similarities to vba cause me more angst than ease

2050790
dictionary	map
for one thing it seemed to me that r s list data type was a straightforward implementation of the map adt dictionary in python nsmutabledictionary in objective c hash in perl and ruby object literal in javascript and so forth

2050860
ienumerable	ienumerator
this is what ienumerable ienumerator does

2050881
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but without three20 you can t do this with a stock uinavigationcontroller because the uiviewcontroller that you re using is a subview of the uinavigationcontroller

2050908
maven	pom.xml
the maven-eclipse-plugin is a maven plugin run from the cmd line to generate eclipse project files based on your pom.xml

2050944
getter	setter
finally i did consider embedding code inside mapping file but overriding things like getter and setter looked pretty tedious

2050947
webclient	webrequest
i have also notice speed disparities between browsers and webclient or webrequest

2050947
webclient	webrequest
our code that uses .net webclient webrequest is totally inefficient in comparison as everything is initialised anew each time

2050950
google-chrome	firefox
the control works fine in firefox google-chrome etc

2051008
hide	show
mark s code should work but i often prefer to create the item manually then show hide it based on the need

2051032
post	get
if you add an id to a div that surrounds each blog post you can move from .parent to an id lookup which is always faster then you can get rid of the .finds which slow things down

2051084
inherited	properties
as long as the properties defined in the mapping exist in the class be it because of inherited it should work

2051198
inherited	properties
what i did was just inherited from a custom controller where i added the orderservice as a properties

2051265
postgresql	mysql
i could handle this with a habtm table but it seems inefficient to have a long table joining offers with countries when i could simply use the set column type in mysql postgresql see mysql documentation on set type here

2051384
rss	feed
today it fails to connect to the internet can t download rss feed or connect to my tfs server

2051495
gradle	ivy
we use gradle for building java projects and at the moment we have ivy repositories to store third-party artifacts and also to publish our own artifacts into repo is build using gant scripts and the ivy ant tasks

2051502
superclass	subclassing
as with any class cluster if you create a subclassing of nsnumber you have to override the primitive methods of its superclass nsvalue

2051523
min	max
this heuristic alone had a tendency to collapse after the bottom right corner became part of the flooded area however so the final result was max bottom right corner min steps number of colors remaining not part of main flood

2051538
post	get
somehow you need to get a pointer back to your tableview and exposing that as a accessor from you viewcontroler could break encapsulation so it would be better to just have a delegate that you set so you could post to the delegate

2051550
packets	multicast
there is an issue that your network equipment specifically any routers possibly other equipment as well may need to be explicitly set up to allow forwarding of broadcast and or multicast packets

2051550
packets	multicast
here s another long shot - if you run both the sender and receiver on the same machine and turn off ip_multicast_loop then you won t get any packets as it disables the multicast loopback interface

2051579
vim	emacs
since emacs and vim are just text editors does that mean i have to copy paste the code into an ide so it can be compiled

2051596
vim	emacs
well you edit your files in emacs or vim

2051596
ant	maven
for java people often use ant or maven to build their software

2051616
vim	emacs
emacs vim are text editors that allow you to write your program

2051616
vim	emacs
also emacs and vim are scriptable and have routines that allow you to call a compiler directly on the file you re editing

2051622
vim	emacs
apart from what already has been said take a few tutorials to learn how to code compile with vim and emacs

2051661
nyromodal	blockui
after some research and lot of quick prototyping i feel like my old companion nyromodal is the only option left for me which gives me flexibility of controlling it using its extensive api i went through other options given by the users and topup and blockui came closer rest of them are also good but doesn t meet my needs

2051683
post	put	post	get	put	get
and then post put get that back to the server

2051693
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
instead of that though i d probably use a debugger like google-chrome s dev tools even if you don t normally use google-chrome for development or firebug even if you don t normally use firefox for development or dragonfly on opera or f12 developer tools on ie

2051712
postgresql	mysql
there are still many ways how to solve or workaround this issue either by plain ado.net mysql postgresql and sql server works perfect or nhibernate didn t test it but i saw somewhere that it works

2051712
ubuntu	linux
i m using visual studio for development and then i deploy apps to linux machine os - ubuntu web server - nginx

2051713
post	get
also obviously i understand that car.speed and car.speed 55 are the same function which makes this wrong but then in php and also in zend framework the same action is used for get post postbacks

2051739
integer	unsigned
i have a table with an unsigned integer as the primary key with values ranging from 0 to 31543

2051739
integer	unsigned
i had to modify the column to auto_increment modify column id integer unsigned not null auto_increment and set the seed in the same statement

2051744
scatter	graphing
i have a scatter plot graphing with a bunch of random x y coordinates

2051750

you should probably not use as that is meant to be used as a way to make ajax calls library scriptaculous dojo yahoo jquery indifferent

2051763
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently not supported blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit

2051797
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
at first i thought i d define exceptions specific to each class however it turns out most of those exceptions are simply extensions of existing runtimeexception foonegativeintargumentexception extends illegalargumentexception foonullbarexception extends nullpointerexception with specific messages

2051823
getter	setter
it seems you have basically cited other features of the language as being confusing and then used that as a defense for making getter setter more confusing

2051823
getter	setter
on the other hand c# does have something like what you describe since properties behave differently as a getter or setter depending on the context in what they are used

2051823
getter	setter
but while it is a single property there are two seperate sections of code for implementing the getting and setting and it is clear that this is a getter setter and not a function speed because they omit the for properties

2051851
struts	stripes
stripes the actionbean approach doesn t look much better than struts

2051851
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket
i m not looking for frameworks with ui state on the server like wicket tapestry or jsf

2051898
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested with the following markup in ie8 and firefox doesn t work in google-chrome safari

2051906
getter	setter
i prefer active objects which encapsulate operations rather than getter and setter so you get a semantically richer objects

2051906
getter	setter
it s relatively rare to want both a setter and a getter on an object with behaviour

2051924
getter	setter
it s convention java has a convention of getter and setter c# has properties python has public fields and javascript frameworks tend to use field to get and field value to set

2051929
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using this css will get it looking like you want it to in ie safari firefox google-chrome

2051933
filtering	grouping
not entirely sure i understand your question but you can try enabling audience targeting list settings - audience targeting settings and then create a sales view with a filtering setting the target audience sales assuming you have a sales grouping

2051941
width	height
i know that i can set the width and height of each canvas panel manually in the xaml but i want them to be the same size

2051941
width	height
so that each panel is the same width and height and i only have to set it once

2051963
onclick	onsubmit
you are assigning submitsearch to the onclick event for the submit button and the onsubmit event for the form

2051963
onclick	onsubmit
since the onclick event is fired before the onsubmit event the onsubmit event will not even fire if the onclick event didn t return true

2051971
width	height
propertytype table contains various property types like name height width color maxspeed volume etc

2051992
margin	height
an alternative if both the parent and child have known height is to set a top margin on the child

2051994
free	malloc
is there a function equivalent to free for malloc

2052041
keydown	keyup
if i replace keypress with keyup or keydown it works fine

2052041
firefox	safari
keypress event does work in firefox and in safari

2052046
draggable	droppable
note that i haven t used the sortable ui helper before but it should be a similar principle to draggable and droppable and i ve based my example on what i know from these other two helpers - if it s not entirely correct it should be close

2052059
goto	break
i think there are some compiler optimizations that are not available if you use early returns break statements goto statements and the like

2052076
width	height
both the canvas s will have the height of 300 and width of 300

2052081
interpolation	splines
update tom smith advises that splines interpolation is to be preferred to polynomial interpolation for this kind of thing and wikipedia bears him out

2052095
range	infinity	interpolation	splines
splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range

2052133
getter	setter
fwiw i prefer the class.noun for the getter and class.verb for the setter

2052140
charindex	substr
if the field always has the number at the end with possibly one word before it and a space before it you could use charindex substr to solve this

2052157
put	get
how many genuine qualified responses do they think they ll get if they put a want-ad out for a foxpro developer

2052166
vim	emacs
an investment in learning vim my preference or emacs will pay off

2052168
google-chrome	firefox
and i ve tried in firefox and google-chrome and i m not getting the textarea s background-color

2052188
inherited	properties
set up the post build steps in it and have all your project inherited settings from that properties sheet

2052286
children	parent
return just the parent and children that were affected

2052321
scatter	graphing
inspecting the scatter graphing visually it s fairly obvious the data points form two groups with some random points that do not obviously belong to either

2052340
post	get
if you get an empty answer back from a synchronous http post it implies success - otherwise you will get a soap fault or other error result

2052357
versioning	upgrade
if you are using another versioning of python and installed pyobjc yourself you still may be able to use easy_install to revert to it since normally easy_install does not remove previous versioning when you upgrade

2052366
mouse	keyboard
i m building a mega menu where i want to be able to trigger the menu via both a hover using the mouse and focus such as tabbing to it via the keyboard

2052449
hide	show
i m having a problem with the jquery hide and show methods

2052449
hide	show
this code comes from a multi-page form which is loaded in it s entirety then jquery is used to show and hide the various pages

2052449
hide	show
the issue is not that the hide fails but that the subsequent show doesn t bring the desired page back

2052449
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i ve tried using different methods like slideup and slidedown i ve tried doing css display none various other ways to perform the hide show

2052449
hide	show
i ve also tried chaining methods doing callbacks from hide to then show

2052453
mxmlc	compc
the purpose of this task is to set a property that determines the name of the patternset to be used when declaring the implicit fileset on a mxmlc or compc task

2052453
mxmlc	compc
the named patternset is then referenced by the mxmlc or compc task like this

2052468
for-loop	arrays
i just wrapped your iterator generation in a for-loop and built up an arrays of iterator functions

2052475
min	max
keep track of the min and max projection on each axis

2052475
min	max
the area of the obb is max1-min1 max2-min2 and you can easily compute the points of the obb from the angle and the min and max projections

2052502
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop instead of a while loops

2052503
try-catch	exception-handling
now you just use the class and wrap the call that might throw the exception-handling in a try-catch block

2052513
client-side	server-side
my idea is to serialize the file into json client-side and call a web service to reconstitute the file server-side

2052533
junit	jmock
there are two obvious answers such as using jmock or remove the final modifier on the classes we want to test but we want to stick with one external testing framework besides junit and it may be hard to convince other developers to remove the final modifier

2052550
versioning	upgrade
use a consistent versioning on all files important for later upgrade

2052613
tcpdf	fpdf
tcpdf and fpdf can both render pdf output

2052641
post	get
you can also get the latest post from the above feed this time i ll use simplexml instead

2052648
hide	show
basically i hide all of the answer divs on the page but i want to show a div if the a user has clicked a bookmarked link to it

2052676
hide	show
i would assume you would need to add a class to the div that hide it and show it based on the click function

2052716
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	jboss	resin	glassfish	weblogic	glassfish	resin	weblogic	resin
finally a framework which can run on any java based web server including google app engine tomcat jetty glassfish weblogic grizzly jbossweb and jboss resin etc

2052769
folder	directory
virtual directory apply to mapping physical folder to specific virtual url folder

this is probably a really dumb noob like question but what is the best method to have an .apk file that when installed drops a zip file onto the sd card in a specific directory from the assets or raw folder

2052856
dictionary	map
if you have many types you could use a dictionary to map from each type to the cached information for that type

2052857
dirichlet	mixture
the dominant probabilistic approach is to place a dirichlet process prior on the mixture distribution and estimate by some bayesian method

2052875
put	get
put the item qty pairs of sheet 1 into the dictionary then run through the items of sheet 2 update the dictionary accordingly to get the differences in there

2052907
put	get
from what i read qt is event driven meaning that i m basically creating a bunch of events that get put in a que and executed when the onclick signal event returns to the main loop event handler

2052911
division	modulo
i built an alternate c solution that doesn t require any modulo or division operations

2052915
mouse	keyboard
chris dunaway suggested global mouse keyboard lib

2052915
mouse	keyboard
it just helps setting up keyboard and mouse hooks

2052923
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is already way faster than good ol cpython

2052925
cjk	thai
for other scripts eg greek cyrillic thai letters cjk characters etc. things get much more complicated and it becomes safer to just forbid things like control characters rather than trying to keep track of which characters are letters

2052971
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2053026

2053046
hide	show
the hint was flashing show hide show hide show hide show hide

2053064

2053231
maple	sage
the best i ve seen is a sage wrapper around the maple commands but i d like to not install and use the overhead of sage for my purposes

2053251
realloc	malloc
oh and add error-checking on the calls to malloc and realloc which was omitted in that answer because it was omitted in the questioner s code

2053257
pull	push
i realize there is a webservice for querying list data using splistitem but that is a pull model not a push model

2053267
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
it seems to me like this is best handled on the java side with an objectinputstream objectoutputstream pair and classes that implement java.io.serializable and have their own writeobject and readobject methods

2053311

2053520
for-loop	arrays
i often use a for-loop with an arrays slice such as

tesseract	tessnet2
i m using the tessnet2 wrapper to the tesseract 2.04 source on windows xp

2053581
awt	swing
the downside if you want to call it that is that your application won t be able reuse any existing awt swing based libraries

2053594
try-catch	exception-handling
edit the rethrowing of this exception-handling is so that the original try-catch block can stay in place

i equally need help on limiting file type permitted for upload gif jpeg png only as well as the file size not more than 100kb

2053681
width	height
you just set the width and height attributes

2053708

consider how many getter and setter you can get rid of

2053948
getter	setter

2053948
getter	setter
here s how you can have a person with no getter or setter involved in ordering a drink

2053948

that means it is either public or protected or if both classes are in the same package package access

2054040
superclass	subclassing
subclassing constructors may specify as the first thing they do which constructor in the superclass to invoke before executing the code in the subclassing s constructor

2054040
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing constructor does not specify which superclass constructor to invoke then the compiler will automatically call the accessible no-args constructor in the superclass

2054040
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass has no no-arg constructor or it isn t accessible then not specifying the superclass constructor to be called in the subclassing constructor is a compiler error so it must be specified

2055461
equals	gethashcode
thesis there is no implementation of equals and gethashcode that meets your requirements

2055461
equals	gethashcode
since equals and gethashcode cannot return different values for the same arguments there is no implementation that meets your requirements

2055470
equals	gethashcode
i don t think it s possible because you could have an infinite sequence of values that are equals within tolerance to the previous and next value in the sequence but not any other value and gethashcode would need to return an identical value for all of them

2055472

2055664
set	bag
the asset is a way to explicitly change your hasmany to a set in situations where fnh might not be able to determine it by type for example if you re exposing your collection as an ienumerable it would default to a bag and calling asset would override that

children	parent
problem getting an attribute from a parent node without getting attributes from all children xml attribute produces a concat of all attributes.

2055729

viewed the source in firefox 3.5.6 and google-chrome and i saw that jquery.js is referenced properly but colorize.js reference is not at all included in html

2055753
findwindow	postmessage
another way would be to use sendmessage postmessage to send a wm_close to the main window unfortunately i don t know anything about the windows of the processes i only have the process id so findwindow doesn t help either

2055804
springsource	grails
there was a great talk regarding the groovy grails integration in eclipse springsource sts that has been recorded see the video

the problem goes away if i replace showdialog with show but - interestingly - it gets better happens less often but doesn t completely go away if i comment out the code that does the hide on pushed

2056006
hash	md5
for the purpose to identify among some known passwords list do log cryptographically strong hash of password using md5 sha1

2056081
post	get
i want to perform the search and get a list of matching post and pages back

2056089

another possible refactoring would be to extract properties belonging together into classes of their own such as the max min structure into an allowedrange object or something

2056100
rss	feed
check out some feed you know to see the simple xml markup and then see the rss specification

2056111
listview	gridview
roll your own grid with listview gridview

shadowing	named
first of all be careful because you are shadowing the built in named list

2056415
tcpdf	fpdi
the same documents could i successfully merge with fpdi + tcpdf however bookmarks wasn t preserved

2056425
g++	gcc
try g++ instead of gcc or throw out the c++ code libraries

2056435
filtering	grouping
in short my question is how do you prefer to expose filtering sorted grouping observablecollections to views in waf

2056435
sorting	filtering
i think the following prinicple applies if the filtering sorting functionality is a property of the view only an alternate view might legitimately not provide such functionality then collectionviews should be used in the view with code-behind as necessary

2056435
sorting	filtering
if the filtering sorting functionality is a dimension of the model then this can be dealt with in the viewmodel or model by other means

2056454
post	get
i would however consider using post instead of get if possible to prettify the url but that s of course depends on your implementation environment

2056477
width	height
i suspect get_size delegates the width and height to object properties and the parent widget uses the properties directly instead of hitting your get_size method

2056497
width	height
dimensions width or height of hidden

2056559
post	get
it is recommended a few times here to use post instead of get

2056583
sorting	filtering
but for most things searching filtering sorting paging etc you can just fetch the data page s you actively need from the database which often isn t nearly as many

2056590
textmate	notepad++
i believe that notepad++ is a similar tool for windows but i am unsure if it is as customizable as textmate

2056600
int	chars
most c and c++ compilers support itoa function which converts an int to a chars or you can use sprintf to do this

2056649
ubuntu	linux
test platform but the production home will be a linux machine ubuntu 9.1 perl 5.10 64 bit activestate perl 64 bit

2056697
width	height
following javascript code may help you to get the screen s width height

2056729
ant	maven
so we would like to keep working with maven and automatically generate the ant scripts when we need to deliver the code to the client

2056745
stdout	stderr
the popen object is effectively just a wrapper for the child processes pid stdin stdout and stderr plus some convenience functions for using those

2056745
daemons	launchd
the proper way to approach this is to launchd the child as a daemons like tobu suggested

2056760
if-statement	while-loop
if it s null the program will not get into the while-loop and will go directly to the first if-statement after the while-loop

2056762
getter	setter
do you want to create new fields getter setter in the class

2056781
getter	setter
you have to write all the getter and setter explicitly by yourself

2056781
getter	setter
you might want to have a look at project lombok which provides the annotations getter and setter that are somewhat similar to python s property

2056787
ant	maven
you can use the maven ant plugin

2056842
terminate	timeout
they will be terminate after a timeout

2056853
uilabel	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a uisegmentedcontrol that has six segments i want them to call a method when the value changes but also when each segment gets a uicontroleventtouchdragin because i want a uilabel to show up with it s name when the person is trying to select something on it and drags their finger across the control but the segmented control does not sen this call even when i drag into the thing

2056875
width	height
add a rectanglegeometry to your outer stackpanel that starts at 0 0 and has the width and height of your stackpanel

2056889
groovy	gpath
for reading property files in groovy you can use the utility class configslurper and access the contained properties using gpath expressions

2056928
getter	setter
as others have noted java has getter and setter but there is no strict analogon

2056928
getter	setter
there is a third party library called project lombok tha uses annotation to generate the getter and setter in the .class files at comile time

2056990
public	protected
if you are storing the data as a public private static protected variable in one of your classes it would be best to store it as a stdclass

2057006
boost	stl
you can either use those from boost or ones supplied with your stl if modern enough

2057024
apache	nginx
use apache o nginx virtual host to diverge public images and others as yiou should do to serve the directly without rails and choose there where you pick them from

2057073
boost	stl
if you have some unexplained phobia against stl or boost you can always pull your own smart pointer class with relative ease if you don t require super exception safety

2057093
put	get
if i put the type definition above the function i get an error

2057093
put	get
before i get to this solution i want to put another guard in the list of guards

2057125
getter	setter
it s not about generating getter and setter for member variables

2057137
hide	show
show hide nested ul on hover

2057169
expression-blend	silverlight
i am developing a sketchflow silverlight project in expression-blend 3

2057283
folder	directory
if you need want to organise your plugin folder - use the zend underscore directory naming convention - so this

2057304
disk	ram
that s one of the main reasons why you should try and keep the clustering key small and static - small because otherwise you ll waste a lot of space on disk and in your server s ram and static because otherwise you ll have to update not just your clustering index but also all your non-clustered indices as well if your value changes

2057319
google-chrome	firefox
webgl is included in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox

2057421

2057438
put	get
if i put some more other panelgroups after one i get as result 1 span class which includes all other inputs and labels

2057459
textview	imageview
each view row in this listview is a linearlayout which contains 3 views - checkbox imageview and a textview horizontal

2057494
submit	submission
using a script-assisted link to submit a form instead of just having a submit button unnecessarily makes your form require javascript so it won t work where js is unavailable or broken due to other errors and makes the link give affordances like √¢ ≈ìopen in new window√¢ and √¢ ≈ìbookmark link√¢ that aren t appropriate and won t work for a form submission

2057556
tortoisegit	svn
if i do a git svn rebase on windows with msysgit and also tortoisegit i have the following error fatal write error invalid argument

2057558
ienumerable	icollection
even if you returned your list as a read-only interface say ienumerable or icollection nothing prevents a caller from performing a run-time cast and getting at the list

2057565
versioning	upgrade
to fix this problem either install wasce in a path without spaces or upgrade to the latest versioning available

2057576
hide	show
another idea i have is to use cookie s to check if a user has chosen to hide a message i think this would be faster but maybe not as good since user can log in with differnt computers and if a new message is show they may not see it right away

2057576
hide	show
however if i decide i need to post a new admin message for all users to see then even a user who chose to hide and not show the admin message will still see it again until they choose to never see it again

2057604
twitter	bit.ly
all the twitter status updates on the wordpress sidebar have bit.ly links

2057605
ubuntu	linux
i m using netbeans on linux ubuntu 9.04 to build a c project

2057673
folder	directory
however if you use compression then the current working directory will be some sub-folder in your temp folder rather than the directory where your setup.exe is

2057691
submit	submission
unless your submit function is doing something funky it shouldn t block the user from submission by pressing enter inside a field

2057765
altera	xilinx
however both altera and xilinx have had their free limited version for long enought you would be safe using them

2057765
verilog	vhdl
since you would be just writing standard verilog or vhdl you could take your source to another vendor just like c

2057767
awt	swing
automatically added to all components in the whole tree of awt swing components

2057778
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
hittest is used by the framework to determine which view is being hit and thus which view to send the touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended touchescancelled messages to

post	get
here is a good msdn blog post to get you started

2057934
opera	firefox
this limit is increased to 50 by firefox and to 30 by opera but ie6 and ie7 enforce the limit of 20 cookie per domain

2057936
installation	upgrade
the only other alternative i can think of is to have the new installation stop the service of the old installation but this is undesirable because it requires the installation to have information about all old installation that it can upgrade stopping this particular service may involve more than just a simple call to the service manager to stop it

2057992
int	chars
the rules are a bit complex but basically the smaller type gets temporarily converted to the larger type so if you compare an int with a chars the chars will be converted to an int for the purposes of the comparison only

2058052
children	parent
if the updatepanel is set with some form of trigger to force it to update be it all children or just specified ones in your parent function you can force a postback on one of those controls

2058058
stdout	stderr
if you re looking at this as a diagnostic tool i recommend redirecting your application log to stdout and then redirecting both stdout and stderr into a file

2058062
objectdatasource	formview
each form is defined within an asp formview with the datasource set to an objectdatasource

2058074
profiling	debugging
also have a look at creating a debugging and profiling agent with jvmti

2058082
subtraction	addition
is it better to define the types say addition subtraction conditionals control flow elsewhere and just bring them together as predefined types in the union

2058096
int	chars
is the type of a function that takes a pointer to a bd_t an int and a pointer to a chars array and returns a ulong

2058101
int	chars
you re typecasting addr to a pointer to a function returning a ulong that takes a bd_t an int and a chars as parameters and then calling the function with the parameters bd --argc argv 1

2058133
getter	setter
which is closer to the c++ calls i guess assuming these are declared as property or have getter and setter

2058158
getattr	setattr
attribute-handling builtins and special methods getattr setattr __getattr__ __setattr__ ... work just the same way across the single namespace of the object whether referring to plain attributes or not

2058176
public	protected
why is readonlyobservablecollection.collectionchanged protected and not public as the corresponding observablecollection.collectionchanged is

2058189

however when i create a new profiling of type instrumentation in vs 2008 and run the profiling the report shows my main function calling run but in turn when viewing the caller callee report for my run method the report shows that the run method is the bottom of the stack

2058424
return-value-optimization	nrvo
it s also unnecessary if your compiler supports the nrvo named return-value-optimization and your function uses and returns the local variable you would have liked to return by ref in a fairly simple way

2058484
post	get
this is failing because it s calling the post method where covered can t be empty instead of the get

2058484
post	get
why is this triggering the post and how do i get it to use the get

2058518
firefox	safari
it s works in firefox and safari but not ie 7 or 8

2058521
put	get
when i put the url in firefox i get back the .wsdl xml and it looks fine and there is no trace of an error message

2058543
pull	push
i m not sure if there is a way to just pull over the whole file read the rows from that file on the local copy and then push back the changes or not

2058547
keystore	jks
the problem is apparently - i can not really confirm this that it s impossible to properly import a previously generated certificate and matching key into a jks keystore and have it presented properly by tomcat

2058547
keystore	jks
import both der files into a keystore jks file using a custom java class

2058547
keystore	jks
the end result is a jks keystore which can then be used in the tomcat connector configuration as the keystore

2058585
maven	pom.xml
the only cause of this is two maven profiles are defined without a profile id element in the same pom.xml thus the ids are treated null

2058585
maven	pom.xml
error profiles.profile.id must be unique but found duplicate profile with id default org.apache.maven.its.mngxxxx parent 1.0-snapshot users plynch dev maven core-integration-testing mytests mng-xxxx-it src test resources mng-xxxx pom.xml

2058585
maven	pom.xml
error the project org.apache.maven.its.mngxxxx parent 1.0-snapshot users plynch dev maven core-integration-testing mytests mng-xxxx-it src test resources mng-xxxx pom.xml has 1 error

2058585
maven	pom.xml
lastly in a multi-module build should a parent pom.xml define a profile with the same id as one in the child there is no warning or other indication emitted from maven

2058587
ostream	istream
also only istream support is in a separate function would be done for ostream -- i know i could pass iostream but that would not allow passing an istream to the conversion function

2058617
post	get
i ve read a couple forum post elsewhere that reference using svn ignore to avoid certain environment-specific files and directories but don t know how to get set up on my live site and ensure everything is properly synchronized

2058628
client-side	server-side
i must admit i m more of a server-side coder than client-side and javascript baffles me

2058643
spaces	delimiter
while i used an example of spaces delimiter fields there are other ways to define fields as well

2058649
google-chrome	firefox
i believe this is why it works on google-chrome but not on firefox or ie

2058701
width	height
subsequently assigned values for its attributes such as x y width height and id for temppanel and then added child instances as below

2058712
switching	screens
if the wakelock timer has expired in the background the system takes the release of wakelock as an opportunity to switching off the screens

2058712
onresume	onpause
edit i should mention that i am setting wakelock onresume and releasing onpause - as i understand it it s necessary to release then to prevent the app from leaking the wakelock

2058730
inherited	subclassing
i only use subclassing the template pattern when there s a suitable inherited relationship per the liskov substitution principle the algorithm i m varying needs access to the protected methods of the base class and i want a high degree of cohesion

2058785
post	get
there may be a way to call the method with a get i ve only ever used post

2058820
switching	screens
to switching off the screens

eiffel	ada	eiffel	smalltalk	forth	ada	forth	smalltalk
they will most probably be mainstream such as c++ c# or ada for example depending on the domain but if this is for academic interest some of the more esoteric languages might be of interest eiffel forth smalltalk and all those mentioned by others

2058931
put	get
however if you could put an app into standby whats to stop you detecting it coming out of standby and putting it back in thus making you have to do a reset or something to get out

2058935
nsstring	nsdata
tmparray objectforkey twitter username and tmparray objectforkey twitter password hold my username and password respectively as nsstrings scrapbook.short_description is an nsstring and scrapbook.image is nsdata

only gecko and webkit browsers support it currently though

2058953
integer	radix
o nk greedy solution n input size k radix of your digits based on stefan kendall s answer above but with the insight that you should probably be greedy and use the integer you have the most of first

2058994
777	tmp
the session.path is set to tmp with 777 perms

2059004
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
also if you switch from cpython to jython or pypy or ironpython all bets are off other than the documentation on id

2059033
integer	unsigned
i m trying to find databases with support for ip addresses as a native type as opposed to storing as a string or an unsigned integer which at least one commenter has already pointed out won t work for ipv6

2059059
pthreads	fcntl
fcntl is the one api to choose since it is the least broken and is pthreads

ubuntu is a distribution of linux which contains bash as an available shell

2059283
fadein	fadeout
i just tried this example and both a fadein and fadeout work at the same time in ie6

2059284
bindparam	pdostatement
the bindparam function is a method of a pdostatement object not a pdo object

2059284
prepare	pdostatement
you ll have to use the pdostatement from your prepare call instead

2059285
put	get
i have put debug statements in to make sure the correct proxy server is being passed to that function and it is indeed correct but the registry entries never get changed after the first time

2059293
bindparam	pdostatement
the bindparam method is inside the pdostatement class not the pdo class

2059333
range	max	range	min	min	max
the solution depends on their inter-relatedness but the min max -- range and value range -- boundedvalue examples give you some idea of the kinds of techniques to apply

2059337
ubuntu	linux
all the web projects are hosted on ubuntu linux

2059347
777	tmp
i had the chmod for the components and tmp directory set to 777 but still having the same issue

2059422
superclass	subclassing
it looks like you should be able to subclassing nspredicateeditor and override predicateforrow declared in nspredicateeditor s superclass nsruleeditor and do your substitution there

2059427
put	get
or you could put a comment inside the element and use dom methods to get the comment object and extract its data

2059465
accessor	properties
when i need to implement lsb in 5.2 i generally make a static properties and corresponding static accessor that allow me to change the class instantiated by static calls

2059519
cos	sin
sin angle disty hypotenuse and cos angle distx hypotenuse assuming x and y rise up and to the right

2059532
getter	setter
many js engines support getter and setter on javascript objects

2059539
getter	setter
you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter

2059539
getter	setter
now if we wanted to instead define getter and setter within the context of our object prototype and where having private data is less of a concern we can then use an alternative object syntax for that

2059542
getter	setter
rhino versions 1.6r6 support getter and setter you could write something like this

2059547
profiler	gprof
i m looking for a statistical profiler - not gprof

2059559
inherited	properties
you need to change you properties to imagesource or bitmapsource which createbitmapsourcefromhicon returns and inherited imagesource like this

2059619
ftp	smb
is there an ant task similar to ftp or scp tasks that would allow me to copy a set of files to a windows smb share

2059638
implements	extends
i think i ll have to implements one base class and then extends it using the others

2059690
try-catch	exception-handling
the advantage of this in the .net world at least is an easier-to-use domain surface and more succinct and readable code no huge try-catch blocks or roundabout exception-handling handling mechanisms

2059710
hide	show
you can create custom alerts that hide show what fields are in the alert message

2059818
octal	hex	octal	decimal
according to the documentation valueof only takes strings that can be interpreted as signed decimal values while decode takes decimal hex or octal strings prefixed by 0x # or 0 - though valueof is overloaded to also take the radix explicitly

2059832
octal	hex
the decode method allows you to specify the radix hex octal in the string itself using 0x 0x or # for hex and 0 as a prefix for octal numbers while valueof allows you to pass the radix as a number 8 or 16 as an optional parameter

2059862
post	get
i m building an android app which should perform a get on my site to get two cookies and then perform a post to the same site with these cookies

2059865
unsigned	short
at 48 bits per pixel with 16 bit per color you can t return an 8 bit value you must return a 16 bit short or unsigned short otherwise the data gets truncated

2059869
unsigned	short
simply read your data as uint16_t or unsigned short and you get the 16 bit extracted properly

2059879
post	get
first the register_globals that you disable in your php.ini refers to an old php feature where any variable sent via a query string get or form get post would be converted into a global php variable

2059882
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i can see no rendering difference with the default stylesheets in ie firefox opera or google-chrome

2059895
googletest	cppunit
are there any frameworks out there like googletest or cppunit that solely focus on unit testing threads thread pools thread queues and such

2059909
width	height
as far as i know you will have to compare the width clientwidth and height clientheight in your addchar function

2059924
typedef	struct
alternatively you can typedef it as datastruct if don t want to use the struct everywhere

2059938
gif	png
example or png or gif will return true

2059946
typedef	struct
c requires you to refer to it using the struct keyword or typedef it

2059948
getter	setter
note that you can distinguish between a getter call and a setter call just by checking if the value argument is undefined or not

2059997
firefox	safari
for some reason ie is adding a vertical scrollbar to the edge of the page but there is no scroller and nothing to scroll firefox and safari look fine

2060004
gridview	linqdatasource
i m trying to set the where clause on a linqdatasource object bound to a gridview programmatically on a button click but when the gridview rebinds data for instance when the user sorts the where clause resets back to the empty string

2060005
post	get
once you get the form you can add the necessary input values to the given hidden values and post the response back again

2060005
post	get
you sometimes have to do a get before a post to get values and cookies set up properly

2060009
gif	png
i suggest making a http head request so you won t need to download the entire image and then based on the string returned parse and make sure the content-type is an image jpeg image pjpeg image gif image png or similar image content-types

2060016
firefox	safari
if you need to get the exact same behaviour in all browsers and want to add the deactivated scrollbar to firefox and safari check my recent question

2060020
vim	emacs
vim emacs

2060049
hex	binary
understanding base 2 binary base 16 hex number systems is helpful a must

2060069
post	get
i m a php man so i can t help you write something off the top of my head but if you need a sample code post a comment and i or someone will get one out to you

2060071
lisp	scheme
scheme is a dialect of lisp but you probably knew that already. on this subject pull down a copy of course 6.001 from open courseware at mit.

2060095
post	get
you could try changing the domain of the cookies in the cookie store or using the same host for get and post

2060100
draggable	droppable
i m trying to use jquery ui to make a block of text draggable and later droppable and resizable

2060100
width	height
the problem is that all of the jquery ui documentation examples act on objects that have an explicitly specified css width and height

2060100
width	height
without having a css width and height specified the horizontal scroll bar in the browser shows up and starts going crazy as soon as you touch the text object

2060100
width	height
the problem goes away if you specify css width and height properties but the text i m working with is dynamic.

2060100
width	height
i can t specify width and height ahead of time

2060117
jnetpcap	libpcap
the underlying libpcap c library that they both wrap has continued to evolve so i would go with jnetpcap for that reason

2060129
width	height
you could dynamically add a width and or height once you start dragging the object and then return those styles to auto once you drop it

2060145
int	boolean
it uses the macro null which is equivalent to the int constant zero and zero in a boolean context is treated as false

2060152
actionscript	mxml
since repeater component won t generate radiobuttongroup in mxml and since i can t do the same through actionscript because radiobuttongroup doesn t have an id property when i try to create it that way is there a way to disable radiobuttons at all

2060152
actionscript	mxml
i also tried actionscript approach but with httpservice mxml component to fetch xml file

2060160
button	checkbox
there is a checkbox in column 1 of both listviews and a button on the page

2060168
sudo	passwd
i ve tried but cannot enter the sudo passwd and then execute another command on the same exec call

2060169
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote this code and it is working nicely in google-chrome but when it comes to firefox and other major browsers it is not even changing a little bit thing

2060176
hide	show
it makes sense to have the controller tell other tabs to hide and tell the new tab to show

2060176
hide	show
but it also makes sense to have the tab tell all the other tabs to hide and then show itself

2060188
sudoers	passwd
you should set up your sudoers not to require a passwd nopasswd for the user that your php is running as

2060204
post	get
a get request will be performed by default - but if you pass in any extra parameters in the form of an object map key value pairs then a post will occur

2060236
getter	setter
at first i figured that is making two calls instead a block first the setter and then the getter to gather the return value

2060236
getter	setter
however instrumenting the setter and getter methods with nslog calls proves this isn t the case

2060262
rss	feed
does any one know the rss feed for 3.0 iphone sdk doc set

2060267
hide	show
internally it would ask the tabset to hide all other tabs and show itself

2060267
hide	show
i m assuming exactly one tab must be show at all times so there s no point in having a public method to hide an individual tab

2060282
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera have build-in debugger

2060287
rss	feed
i don t quite understand rdf but i am looking to convert rss feed from places like yahoo and google into rdf format to display on a website

2060321
bash	subshell
according to the bash man page each command in a pipeline is executed in a subshell

2060328
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
just amounts to capturing mousedown mousemove and mouseup events

2060368
websphere	ibm
supposing that i have a standard ear file and the source files that were used to generated it what additional processing needs to be done to convert it to an ibm websphere enhanced ear

2060369
awt	swing
unfortunately awt components don t have the setopaque property like swing components do so they are rectangular

2060400
fflush	gets
except in your case where you exit the program right after writing and have the unfortunate luck to run out of disk space at the exact moment the buffer gets fflush

2060421
filesystems	ntfs
local or remote files or directories on an ntfs filesystems

2060444
implements	extends
if you want to check if an object implements a particular interface or extends a particular class date use

2060490
width	height
i guess you want to change the width and or the height

2060491
rss	feed
there are a variety facebook applications however that will add posts from a rss feed however there would be a small delay since it would be polling

2060509
datamapper	activerecord
poeaa patterns that i use regularly usually unconsciously or incidentally as a part of the data access strategy or web framework i m using are activerecord application controller datamapper domain model gateway lazy load layer supertype page controller template view and value object

2060534

put post require all of the external state

2060534
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can model the basic functionality with post put and get

put	get
when a widget needs review get it and put it back with the needs-review updated

2060551
google-chrome	firefox
tried with firefox 3.5.7 google-chrome

2060565
versioning	upgrade
many vendor plugins may not work have no 2.x compatible versioning or need to be upgrade

2060569
post	get
then i loop through and run the following query to get all id s and titles of that year months blog post

2060638
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest is easier to call http - get post put delete

2060672
folder	directory
- as far as i m aware if a program tries to save a game to the c program files directory it catches the call redirects the file to another folder meant for such changes...the c users directory as i recall

2060705
int	double
double precision can exactly represent all int up to 2 53

2060705
int	double
because conversions from int to double or multiplication in double are also correctly rounded operations will be the representable value closest to the exact square of i

2060721
stdout	stderr
i m saving the output of a command after redirecting its stdout stderr and passing it through a pipe

2060727
udp	tcp
i had pretty good luck using tcp ip and udp with android and windows java c# respectively

2060743
websphere	ibm
an enhanced ear is an ear with some xml files added to the meta-inf directory to configure specific resources at the application server or cell level see the ibm redbook websphere application server v7 packaging applications for deployment for more details on this

2060743
ant	maven
the files being located under the meta-inf directory embedding them in a standard ear from ant or maven should be pretty straight forward just put them in the meta-inf before packaging

2060743
ant	maven	websphere	ibm
update ibm provides ant tasks for websphere that you could also use from maven using the antrun plugin this seems to be the preferred way but i don t think that wsdefaultbindings is exactly what you re looking for default ibm websphere bindings don t offer the same features than enhanced ear - but they might be useful and enough though

2060814
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
they show up correctly in ie 8 firefox google-chrome opera etc

2060823
postgresql	mysql
i believe sqlyog did this for mysql in win32 but i am now on osx and using postgresql

2060842
post	get
implement the service method to lookup the action associated with the request method get post etc and pathinfo the url part after the servlet s url-pattern

2060842
jsf	stripes	struts	stripes
the more decent mvc frameworks takes most of this all into account such as sun jsf apache struts spring mvc stripes etcetera

2060885
bazaar	svn
that makes bazaar behave more like svn in that every commit automatically goes to the server and you can t forget to push

2061002
cvs	svn
the other really nice thing about git is you don t have to set up a damned server like you have to do with svn or cvs

2061007
width	height
and i ve specified the width and height of the boardview in the application s main.xml file

2061007
width	height
i m trying to get the width and height from a function that is called from the boardview s constructor

2061049
put	get
to load this code from a file you may have to file_get_bytes into a string eval that then put in in a variable but you get the point i hope

2061050
hide	show
you may also want to edit your preferences in xcode to always show the build results while the build is going on and only hide the window if there are no errors or warnings

2061087
maven	m2e	ant	maven
ant shouldn t require any seperate download installation but if you are interested in using maven then i d suggest installing the m2e plugin

2061094
maven	pom.xml
if i install maven eclipse plugin through the eclipse menu do i still need to modify my pom.xml to include the maven eclipse plugin in the plugins section

2061109
maven	pom.xml
this provides nice tools like the pom.xml editor and creating a maven project from within eclipse

2061111
post	put
it is too tough to fully describe batching in this post but i ve put together some really great resources available online at

2061113
put	get
the output csv i get does not put quotes around the field names instead it puts it around the commas

2061113
put	get
how can i get the t to put quotes around all fields

2061119
getter	setter
it is a fair question to ask why would the compiler call the setter on the property when assigning the value to it and not call the getter when using the value of mcinst.foobar afterwards

2061123
cassini	iis
i had visions of complex mail server detection methods but it turns out that i just have an smtp service running that is tied in to iis on my local machine which is why localhost works as the mail server in cassini

2061133
inherited	subclassing
implementing a subclassing interface that by design does not implement one or more methods of the inherited base class or interface

2061141
bluetooth	usb
cultured code does syncing over wifi and on their wiki they ve found that you can do the same thing over usb and bluetooth provided the carrier supports tethering cough cough at t cough cough

2061141
bluetooth	usb
so basically as far as i know if you do standard bonjour syncing over a computer-to-computer network it ll work over usb and even bluetooth if the iphone has tethering capabilities

2061145
folder	directory
you can use it by just putting the folder on your path somewhere like where you project s directory is

2061169
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have an app with a uitabbarcontroller that manages some uinavigationcontroller which in turn manage various uiviewcontroller

2061265
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
for example a basic rule is to perform multiplication before addition this is because multiplication and division using floating point numbers does not introduce inaccuracies as great as that of addition and subtraction but can increase the magnitude of inaccuracies introduced by addition and subtraction so it should be done first in many cases

2061270
client-side	server-side
but in this case i d say just use server-side validation as what you have as client-side validation is hitting the server anyway

2061308
cvs	svn
also i d go with a distributed solution so you re not tied down to a server like you would be with cvs or svn

2061319
subtraction	modulo
if x 0x02 and y 0xfe the calculation x-y as an 8-bit result will give the correct answer of 4 assuming that subtraction of two n -bit values wraps modulo 2 n - which c99 guarantees for subtraction of unsigned values

2061393
post	get
i need to control a website that is loaded into a uiwebview like sending post data and using get requests

2061473
inherited	properties
however properties inherited from the

2061475
inherited	properties
however properties inherited from the object s prototype will be copied over

2061484
width	height
meaning i give it a set width height and the image is scaled to fit at it s same proportions within that box even if there is whitespace around it

2061526
nsnull	nsstring
when a number in coredata is not set coredata will give you back nsnull - possibly the same goes for nsstring values in coredata too

2061526
nsnull	nsstring
so in both cases you have to be careful when you are using values since the thing you thought was an nsstring or nsnumber object is really nsnull

2061545
width	height
i am currently passing in static values for the popup s height and width corresponding to the height and width of the embedded swf like so

2061545
width	height
window.open popup width 400 height 300 resizable 1

2061546
opera	safari
so if you have safari or opera installed you can test with those

2061637
prepare	execute
you can do this in a stored procedure with prepare and execute or you can do it in application code

2061645
maven	m2e
i ve used this plugin during years and was very happy with it and very unsatisfied at this time by eclipse plugins for maven like m2e

2061645
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is one of the eclipse plugins for maven

2061645
maven	pom.xml
but even if i do not use things like creating a maven project from eclipse or the pom.xml editor or other fancy wizards i have to say that this plugin is now totally usable provides very smooth integration has nice features.

2061645
maven	pom.xml
if i install maven eclipse plugin through the eclipse menu help - install new software do i still need to modify my pom.xml to include the maven eclipse plugin in the plugins section

2061707

i got the twitter widget to work over https ssl by doing the following

but i d simply go for glassfish v3 or jboss 5.2+ which also supports jsf 2.0 + cdi

2061848
for-loop	loops
better is to place it outside of the for-loop but in your case put it in loops

2061857
post	get
if you make your pages such that they will work with or without javascript fall back to using frames or standard get post requests to the server if javascript fails either automatically or via a display as plain html link it will be much easier for search engines to crawl the page

2061858
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
including ie firefox google-chrome opera

2061993
put	get
you can also pass arguments into anonymous functions which is something that jquery does quite a bit except it uses call but we won t go there. this is where you get the special things like where you put in a code

2061997
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
from my research support for the selectors api was introduced with jquery 1.2.7 firefox 3.1 ie 8 opera 10 safari 3.1

2062008
int	chars
for example the int 305 419 896 0x12345678 requires 4 bytes to represent or a utf-16 chars usually requires 2 bytes to represent

2062021
multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtraction	subtraction	addition
but in many languages there s an optimization possible when doing integer math - addition subtraction multiplying and dividing are possible with cpu instructions

2062039
quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place
perform an in-place mergesort or quicksort using tape for storage

2062043
lisp	scheme
hyphens in identifier names are pretty common in lisp and scheme and thus i suspect it is natively supported in ironscheme at least

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this site uses js xml xslt and it works with no errors in google-chrome safari firefox ie8 ie7 when accessed remotely but if i access the site through a vpn i get an error that either a document element is lacking or the xml is not well-formed which it is

2062125
firefox	safari
i am not sure what exactly you need to do but selenium remote control works with firefox ie and safari

2062143
post	get
see denny s post for a start although i don t agree with his use of get and passing json in the querystring for complex params

2062143
post	put
for passing complex objects in json use put or post as the type http method of the request

2062164
children	parent
jonathan and chetan have already given a very good explanation of why this works but to reiterate parent of floated elements are not affected by the height of their floated children

2062172
floating-point	integer
sure the range of most fp number implementations is larger than the range of most integer implementations but i could invent a language tomorrow in which i allow 512-bit integers but only 16-bit floating-point numbers 1 sign bit 3 exponent bits 12 significand bits

2062172
int	boolean
no int are not easier on the processor the processor does fundamental boolean logic operations on bits

2062207
updatepanel	ascx
if you use the asp.net ajax control toolkit you can wrap each ascx in an updatepanel so only that package is saved

2062266
width	height
you need to explicitly set the width and height for the area

2062329
realloc	malloc
you might need a function that reads full lines from a file using malloc and realloc to dynamically allocate the buffer see this for more

2062341
postgresql	mysql
dbs like mysql or postgresql have gis modules that use an r-tree under the hood to quickly retrieve locations within a certain proximity to a point on a map

2062345
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
how about what s already built into cocoa in the forms of nsurlrequest and it s subclass nsmutableurlrequest

2062374
bluetooth	usb
the connection between the desktop and the mobile device can be activesync over usb or bluetooth

2062409

2062454
memcached	apc
ability to store data in some caching mecanism apc memcached files ... in which you can only store strings

2062464
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
edit overall the main different the iphone has more pre-built ui classes uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc. you can use in your app to make it look nice and pretty and most importantly consistent with apple apps

2062466
children	parent
the way it works is that you click a parent node and it uses the jquery .load api to make an ajax call back to the server to see if this node has children

2062466
children	parent
when you click the parent link again it does a .remove to remove the children

2062466
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in safari google-chrome and firefox

2062466
children	parent
in the ie s the code works when expanding parent to show children

2062466
children	parent
but when i click the parent to hide the children again with the .remove it s going into the children and doing a remove of their children rather than itself

2062470
powerpc	i386
the preferred way is to use -arch arch where arch is one of powerpc ppc64 i386 or x86_64

2062470
g++	gcc
the reason for this is gcc essentially says use c rules when driving the tool chain and g++ says use c++ rules when driving the tool chain

2062470
g++	gcc
g++ knows that to create a working executable it needs to pass -lstdc++ to the linker stage whereas gcc obviously doesn t think this is necessary even though it knew to use the c++ compiler at the compile the source code stage because of the .cc file ending

2062470
clang	llvm
clang is a completely new c compiler that also targets the llvm tools as its output allowing for the same kinds of optimizations

2062470
g++	gcc
it s a common compiler driver technique to have commands like gcc and g++ sym-link to the same all-in-one compiler driver executable

2062470
g++	gcc
then at run time the compiler driver checks the path and file name that was used to create the process and dynamically switch rules based on whether that file name ends with gcc or g++ or equivalent

2062500
gif	png
the difference between gif and png actually comes from traditional conventions -- gif was traditionally saved as 8-bit whereas png which came later was often saved as 32-bit true color + alpha transparency

2062500
gif	png
hence if you were to compare a 8-bit png to a 8-bit gif the file sizes should be very similar

2062500
gif	png
the same applies with true color png vs true color gif

2062504
folder	directory
literally all i did was move the directory into my folder structure and try an import

2062517
hide	show
put some manager field as a placeholder at button position then add a focuschangelistener to label and use add delete field on focuschanged to show hide button

2062570
yourkit	jprofiler
you may use jprofiler or yourkit profilers for this

2062583
folder	directory
and put the dll under bin folder of the root of sharepoint virtual directory

2062617
src	attr
jquery argues that the src value is not equal to foo.jpg when you pass it in as part of the selector but it is equal to the string literal when you compare from a call to attr

2062623
for-loop	loops
audit login sql batchstarting rpc starting and audit logout for each loops in for-loop below

2062641
gdi	direct2d
the other way to go is to use direct2d which can be faster yet than gdi if you have the right hardware

2062725
equals	gethashcode
you should use gethashcode to rule out equality and then use equals to check the actual equality of any potentially equals values

2062725
profiling	benchmarking
now your question mentions speed - this sounds like the perfect place to use a profiling and some benchmarking tests

2062741
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the nice thing about all this is that uiview and uiviewcontroller and their subclasses all implement these as well so for instance if you encode a uinavigationcontroller you will automatically have all of the view controllers that exist on the navigation stack encoded for free as well which should get you what you need if you implement the nscoding methods in your own classes as well

2062756
directx	gdi
you won t be able to squeeze much more speed out of that code without losing quality or changing to a faster renderer gdi opengl directx

2062756
directx	gdi
but gdi will often be quite a bit faster maybe 2x and directx opengl can be much faster maybe 10x depending on what you re drawing

2062763
portrait	landscape
does anyone know if landscape mode is just terribly handicapped compared to portrait and or if so if there are better ways to create a landscape app

2062781
put	get
now what happen is if user a send request to download asset to approver and approver approves it this will update respective item in asset list and put a download url in download link column but if user b get look for the same record in asset list the download link will be visible to this user too which is wrong

2062813
wordpress	joomla
drupal and joomla and wordpress are all content management php based

x86	64bit
if you re using a 64bit version of windows 7 make sure to compile your application for x86

2062820
stdout	stderr
try open4 which allows you to open stdin stdout stderr to an arbitrary command

2062874
min	max
instead of defining a bounding box with 4 coordinates min and max latitude min and max longitude you can define it with the coordinates of the north-west corner of the box and two parameters resolution and slice

2062874
width	height
the slice is the width and height of the box using the least significant figure as its unit

2062876

i know that you can t use inherited with enums so in my base class i want to define that the classes that implement it must return an enum of some type for a properties

2063057
post	put
in cases where you want to pass a more complex set of data a json-encoded object use webinvoke with put or post a non-parameterized uritemplate and pass form data

2063058
feedback	review
having peers if possible experts review your code and give you feedback is a great tool

2063116
public	protected
it will return false if the derivation is not a public derivation i.e is private or protected

2063117

what you should do is try and get zipinputstream to work and if you can t post the code and we ll help you with whatever problems you re having

2063118
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
repeater listview datalist datagrid gridview .

2063255
factors	mean
so there are many factors that will skew the src code cc to the byte code cc but this doesn t mean that improving the cc is not a valuable job cc evaluation of src code is vital to maintainable clean code

2063257
gentoo	linux
i tested the cable and the pump under linux a gentoo derivative where it worked perfectly albeit as root

2063278

running this as a pre post build event in your project will get you the information you need and some additional information

2063281
gif	png
the icon file itself would preferably be 16x16 pixels and in gif format ie6 wont use transparent png and under 500 bytes

2063281
put	get
most browsers check that path by default but if you like me put your favicon in a directory like images favicon.ico you would need to tell the browser to get it from there or your server will build up alot of 404-not found errors in its log

2063322
jobs	cron
however all my other cron jobs have been and are running with -q and have been sending me output emails.

2063354

i know how to get stores based on a criteria on products and i also know how to get the count of products which price is greater than 2 but i can t find a way to put a criteria on the count

2063449
min	max
for example i need only 15 digits in all queries that return decimals and don t want to manually cast every sum min max operator to decimal 10 5 .

2063463
inherited	properties
if the opacity of all other elements in the page are changed and if the #basket div is inside any other element then this div will also get the opacity properties inherited from the parent

2063463
width	height
it would be better to place another div with page height and width and then put the stacking index of the #basket div to a higher value

2063534
nltk	lingpipe
the ususal nlp libraries like open nlp lingpipe nltk gate uima

2063535

anyone know how to on load hide the 3 inputs and then show the relivant input once it is selected from the combo box

2063816
folder	directory
the t4 templates in that directory need to read from any centeral file in the website project root folder

2063846
folder	directory
i recently noticed that if your app has no files which would be copied into the resources folder the current working directory is set to be that of the actual .app - eg at the level of myapp.app

2063860
hide	show
you might want to try using a tool like firefox s web developer plugin which would let you show hide various parts of the page

2063878
xslt	schematron
is it possible to implement schematron the way we implement xsd and xslt docs

2063897
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the limit is in msie and safari about 2kb in opera about 4kb and in firefox about 8kb

2063913
getter	setter
1 3 in general it is practice that a setter and a getter use the same data structure

2063913
getter	setter
thus the setter and the getter seem to be incompatible

2063923
put	get
where am i supposed to put these files so that they ll automatically get served once i include the application

2064008
union	distinct
use the union and distinct operators

2064018
folder	directory
for example create a folder called media within your app and then require users installing your app to either add a symbolic link from their media directory or copy the whole thing

2064055
cassini	iis
there is a good comparison of cassini and iis here at stackoverflow

2064271
children	parent
but i would like to have the children comment inside the same dom element of the parent comment

2064281
post	get
using curl for example i can post data in a get request

2064298
height	border-box
i am seeing similar issues when defining the height of a cell and it certainly appears that table s use the border-box model rather than content-box

2064298
width	margin
for example if you were to set width 100 and a border or margin then you are going to have scrolling issues assuming your table takes up the whole window

2064321
ant	maven
my boss asked me to fix this project so that it could be built with maven instead of ant

you ll have to set 3 diff cron jobs

2064500
portrait	landscape
there should be no real difference between landscape and portrait orientations when it comes to rendering performance

2064505
put	get
or to put it another way if you change something or more importantly accidentally delete something or do something really stupid and you get the ball clenching feeling that you ve just lost hours of relatively unrelated work that could have been committed and saved then you re not committing often enough

2064510
folder	directory
assuming #1 is doable is there a way to have there not be any trunk directory and just have the files reside in a folder with the name of the repository

2064517
folder	directory
apparently there are hidden folder called .svn spread around in the working directory which i kind of knew about which contains among other things very crucial empty directory which i didn t know about

2064683
phpmyadmin	heidisql
i m using heidisql to manage my databases at work i prefer this over phpmyadmin

2064685
jsf	seam
if you are that interested in jsf i recommend looking into the seam framework which utilizes jsf but also somewhat simplifies its use

2064712
for-loop	loops
the main subtlety which catches people is that in non-pure languages closures close over variable bindings rather than values which means that things like variable scoping are very important and this is where unexpected difficulties arise in the for-loop examples since the scope of loops variable is not always what people expect

2064718
x86	64bit
if the build configuration is x86 we want to copy the 32bit version and with x64 the 64bit

2064728

it is a md5 hash just not properly formatted as a string

2064945
redmine	trac
even if we could run a trac or redmine server here thanks turnkey i m not sure it would be much quicker as our internet connection is over-stretched as it is

2064945

the d conversion specifier expects the corresponding argument to be a pointer to int the u conversion specifier expects a pointer to unsigned int s expects a pointer to chars f expects a pointer to float etc

2065184
client-side	server-side
i know that i can use the getparameter to pass client-side objects but i am wondering what to use to pass server-side objects like i do with the getparameter

2065198
hash	md5
those that are of the same file-size could potentially be the same so i would then generate a hash of the files contents either md5 sha1 etc.

2065218
udp	tcp
this appears to be reasonably trivial if using the ssl module for tcp communication but how would encrypted communication be done via udp

2065248
rss	feed
so if you have the rss feed for apple you have the xml file

2065306
int	boolean
so compare a int with 1 will do a and operation over the two values and then will take the result and evaluate it as a boolean

2065307
int	double
is there a downfall other than maybe needed to allocate more space to giving the columns a class of double even if some of the columns may have all int or longs

2065358
folder	directory
i have my doxygen xml in the folder xml in the same directory as doxyclean.py

2065482
put	get
capistrano is basically a series of scripts that you run from your local machine that get your code and put it on your web server s

2065483
melt	reshape
i agree with juba s suggestion -- learn to use the reshape function or better yet the reshape package with melt cast functions

2065502
folder	directory
if i go to the work directory i find all the jsp compiled the folder of the packadges i have but no classes compiled inside of them

2065522

what i d rather do is have the open with dialog pop-up in that situation is there a method call i m missing

2065616
ssl	https
i have a vendor telling me that the soap header should not have https in it but that we can still communicate via ssl

2065665
int	boolean	int	double
i have other extension methods for the other data type like bool int and double and some custom ones for parsing custom strings into enums or boolean

google-chrome	firefox
regular desktop browsers work with all of the above including firefox ie google-chrome

2065917
post	put
if even the session id itself is very precious you could even put it in a post parameter thereby preventing that it occurs in the url itself

2065919
width	height
now refresh your web page and you should see width + height 60 in your output

getter	setter
tehmick s solution gives you public static with some convenience setter getter but it s really no different than if you replaced y.setb 2 with

2066159
post	get
with regards to security jsessionid is just as vunerable with http get as http post

width	height
which panel do i use to make the menu always stay at the very top take up only as much height as it needs to fit the menu items and fill the entire width of the window in such a way that i can just fill in other panels and what-not in the rest of the window

2066219
accessor	properties
dynamic properties marker indicates to the compiler that you will provide the accessor and setters somehow

2066226

2066262
uiview	subviews
to draw a trail i set a uiview trailview as mkmapview subviews with background color clear

2066276
stdout	stderr
this means you don t need to start two threads one to read stdout one to read stderr just to keep the process from blocking.

2066294
debian	linux
irb history works in debian linux out of the box

2066330
stdout	fflush
2 the i o to an output stream is probably buffered which means that if the subprocess writes some information to stdout without explicitly calling fflush which is almost always the case you might not see the output

2066423
rss	feed
i m using pyrss2gen to generate an rss feed

2066423
rss	feed
i ve succeeded in extending it to add an extra element to each item in the rss feed

2066434
width	height
when adding percentage values for height and width make sure you know the answer to x of what..

2066436
width	margin	width	text-align	margin	text-align
for centering horizontally you can use text-align center on inline elements or margin 0 auto with a set width on containers and block level elements

2066438
inherited	properties
use hasownproperty to differentiate between your own properties and those you inherited from the object constructor which may have been extended

2066440
chunked	transfer-encoding
i suspect that this has something to do with the several requests recorded by firefox and the transfer-encoding chunked header i am seeing in live http headers

2066497
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead of an foreach loops

2066533
google-chrome	firefox
this actually does work in firefox and google-chrome and ie8 so long as your script block is not inside the broken element

2066588
vim	emacs
i m a long time vim user though so emacs is not an issue to me

2066613
rss	feed
i m currently working on an asp.net website where i want to retrieve data from an rss feed

2066613
rss	feed
however i m not sure if this is a good pretty approach to get data from an rss feed

2066622
hide	show
a thin resize bar with the small middle arrow icon which is clicked to hide show a docked panel on the side of the page

2066646
fflush	gets
but you ll have to come up with a way to fflush it when you change data or have it have a timeout so that it gets get d occasionally

2066721
post	get
the progress docs spill plenty of ink on soap but i m having trouble finding the example for a simple http get post with progress abl

2066721
post	get
how do i get and post strings to from a url

2066786
put	get
i m wondering why when you put a system.diagnostics.conditional debug attribute on the a virtual method in a base class that you don t get compiler errors on derived classes that override that same virtual method but don t have the conditional attribute when the condition isn t met

2066803
implements	extends
extends basicfoo to specialbasicfoo and have it implements iqualifyforspecialtreatment

2066809
google-chrome	firefox
now this works as expected in firefox and google-chrome but ie has the icon showing in the top left hand corner

2066812
rss	feed
does it have anything to do with the type of rss feed you re consuming

2066819
udp	tcp
what i ended up using was a tool called socketsniffer that peeks at winsock s calls and monitor tcp udp socket connections

2066831
rss	feed
if it s not returning from the rss feed formatted as you wish you have little other choice

2066952
disk	ram
by caching this in ram instead of writing it immediately back to disk you can limit your io to purely reading the input file and help things go much faster

2066957
inherited	properties
for example the below class inherited from a list and adds a new properties which will not be serialized by the xmlserializer since arrays consist only of elements and not additional properties

2066983
getter	setter
one huge advantage of getter setter is that you can put debug code in the functions to keep track of when values are changed and accessed when testing

2067008
super	extends
the word super implies that the class being inherited from is larger but it is the other way around the inheriting class extends the class it inherits from

2067068
getter	setter
also when you use getter and setter you have control on the data if you need to you can format both input and ouput

2067087
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
because inherited breaks encapsulation subclassing that implement equals and hashcode must necessarily account for the peculiarities of their superclass

2067096
int	chars	int	double
do different data types in c such as chars short int long float double have different memory alignment boundaries

2067096
int	chars
in a 32 bit word aligned byte addressable operating system how is accessing a chars or short different from accessing an int or float

2067125
int	boolean
relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here

2067150
hide	show
why dont you just put the content in their own divs and just hide show the divs

2067183
getter	setter
i use propel because among other things i like the fact that everything has its own concrete getter setter method

2067183
getter	setter
the reason i like having getter setter is that i can put all kinds of logic in them if i need to

2067190
int	chars	int	double
do different data types in c such as chars short int long float double have different memory alignment boundaries

2067190
int	chars
in a 32 bit word aligned byte addressable operating system how is accessing a chars or short different from accessing an int or float

2067197
superclass	subclassing
consider a superclass that checks for field x and y and subclassing checks for x y and z

2067197
superclass	subclassing
so a subclassing superclass subclassing where z is different between the first instance of subclassing and the second violating the transitive part of the contract

2067197
superclass	subclassing
in the above example if subclassing or superclass does an instanceof check it would break symmetry

2067224
do.call	lapply
once you have decided what to do with the multiple authors issue then it s fairly straight forward to turn your book list into a data frame with the ldply function in plyr or just use lapply and convert the return value into a data.frame by using do.call rbind ...

2067260
cpu	processors
it is managed by the processors and provides a way to ensure that data needed by the cpu is close at hand so that it does not have to wait for the bus to fetch it

i am using eclipse s built-in externalize strings wizard to extract string constants in my classes to a properties file and replace those strings with calls to a static accessor

2067340
ssd	sata
use fast disks performance wise ssd fc sata

2067362
width	height
this happens because you calculate the width and height from the first .zitem you find

2067362
width	height
when the first item is hidden due to the filtering its display is set to none so its width and height become 0

2067362
width	height
you will need to read the first visible .zitem when reading the height width like this

2067371
awt	swing
i recommend reading painting in awt and swing if you haven t

2067401
children	parent
children should not examine the private members of their parent

2067409
portrait	landscape
under my res folder i have drawable-land and drawable-port to hold landscape portrait variations then i use r.drawable.myimagename for the imageview s source and android does the right thing - yay

2067430
children	parent
if there s a following sibling that s not a bullettext element we want our list to be all of the children of the current element s parent starting at the current element and ending before the stop element

2067444
google-chrome	safari
however in safari and google-chrome 3 the handlers are never called when i press the middle mouse button

2067444
google-chrome	firefox
the middle mouse down event comes through on ie firefox and google-chrome 4 just fine

2067444
google-chrome	safari
or perhaps i need to wait until safari fixes the issue like google did with google-chrome

2067474
int	chars
convert those int to actual chars only when needed after the increment

2067504
integer	unsigned
what you want to do is view your key as an unsigned integer and view the string that you re handing out as a base 36 a-z + 0-9 representation of that key

2067545
width	height
when i set a column s width or a row s height to star and i fill in content that is bigger than the available rectangle the row keeps on growing underground

2067599
submit	submission
currently i have a custom user control and within it is a little form and a modal popup extender the idea is for the user control to be loaded dynamically in the parent page and displayed so the user can fill out the form and submit it and all the submission code be handled on the user control

2067625
post	get
i would like to intercept all the incoming requests - get or post and perform some task

2067626
post	get
this would be a topic for a long blog post but here is a brief example that you can use to experiment with this using tuple from .net 4.0 if you re using vs 2008 you can get c# implementation here in chapter03 functionalcsharp

2067672
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo just like xhtml xslt svg and other public standards may not be perfect and may not have all the traditional technologies and file formats have

2067693
hide	show
or are the possibilities of what control to load so small you could just hide show div s that are already in the page

2067720
versioning	upgrade
i build my own versioning because i don t want to be forced to upgrade all the dependencies of fluent when i just want to upgrade fluentnhibernate

2067721
stdout	stderr
if you choose this route and consume stdout stderr separately note that when you consume the output stdout you need to consume stderr as well and concurrently otherwise buffers will block and your spawned process waiting for your process to consume this

2067756
filesystems	ntfs
this works best on filesystems that behave like unix ones but should work on ntfs

2067784
extjs	smartgwt
except some advanced components like extjs gwt and smartgwt ee

2067803
haskell	ocaml
functional languages like ocaml and haskell actually use closures implicitly all over the place

2067808
int	double
here you can see we match either an int and then lookahead if we find a double period then we know that the int is really an int and not a real

2067852
stdout	stderr
p subprocess.popen cmd stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.stdout stdin subprocess.pipe

2067852

keydown	keyup
i need a way to get keydown and keyup events quickly without a gui

2067920
gif	png
i just wondered if it would be possible to create a small simple jpg png gif with a given text in powershell

2067958
interpreted-language	compiled-language
while you can certainly write scripts in those languages each is a proper programming language referred to as a dynamic or interpreted-language in contrast to compiled-language like c or c++

2067981
installation	upgrade
i have an existing bugzilla installation that i m trying to upgrade via cvs as per the instructions found here

2068023
children	parent
specify in the parent pom the directories of its modules children

2068065
httphandler	httpmodule
it s much better to use an httpmodule so that you can intercept requests for all pages and make sure users are authorized even before the httphandler has a chance to run

2068078
keydown	keyup
you can use getkeystate or getasynckeystate but that won t give you keydown keyup events

2068078
keydown	keyup
so if you really need to get the keydown keyup events you could install a hook

2068106
move	drag
is there some way to specify how far the mouse should move before it s considered a drag drop

2068200
google-chrome	firefox
something along the lines of greasemonkey for ie firefox and google-chrome would be nice

2068212

processing mouse keyboard input on msdn

2068226
equals	gethashcode
i m concerned about the list while trying to implement the equals and gethashcode methods

2068253
equals	gethashcode
nope equals will just do a reference comparison and gethashcode will return the standard code allocated per object

2068255
button	checkbox
however have you thought of this create a large radiogroup or checkboxgroup then make individual radio button checkbox invisible as required to get the pattern you want

2068335
hide	show
it has a lightbox show hide login menu and a slider is easy slider 1.5

2068337
button	checkbox
add a button to the window hook up a click handler to the button and in that click handler toggle flag -- i made those modifications to your original code and removed the sleep loop clicking on the button toggles the checkbox s state in the fashion you seem to desire

2068353
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
on ie6-8 ff1.5-3.5 google-chrome 2-3 safari 4 and opera 9-10 these headers caused the page to be requested from the server when you click on a link to the page or put the url directly in the address bar

2068382
move	drag
so i intend to use the svn move command or right click and drag the folder

2068386

2068503
hide	show
hey everyone i am trying to hide show different html elements div etc... based on whether a checkbox is checked or if a specific value is chosen from a dropdown box

2068504
post	get
307 came about because user agents adopted as a de facto behaviour to take post requests that receive a 302 response and send a get request to the location response header

2068504
post	get
only a 303 should cause a post to turn into a get

2068529
hide	show
assuming you want to show hide a with

2068538
mockups	balsamiq
to mitigate this i ve been playing with balsamiq mockups

2068544
innodb	myisam
if you are indeed just running innodb you can comment out or remove the myisam settings as you try each to save resources

2068554
post	get
there is a similiar post on this site to what you are trying to get at

2068556
children	parent
if you have a bunch of related processes that is a parent and a bunch of children and they should share a queue then you should call msgget with ipc_private which will create a queue with an unused key and return the handle to it

2068563
entities	entitymanager
this approach will improve maintenance of both the existing manager code and the messaging code you intend to write and will pay off hugely if you ever need to write new entitymanager what store your entities in jcr or tranmit them via web services etc

2068579
int	double
if your vector elements are double instead of int you can do something similar as the sign bit is in the same place you just have to convert to int do the mask and convert back

2068599
put	get
how can i put multiple functions in one file and later get access to all of them in the octave interpreter

2068601

setting its height and width manually work fine but i d like it to scale to the remaining width of the statusbar

2068606
google-chrome	firefox
i have .net code that works on ie8 but wont work on google-chrome or firefox

2068620
disk	ram
i ve also experimented with locating the mysql database entirely on a ram disk

2068624
filtering	grouping
where in your code example is trying to be applied to filtering the results from article that will eventually be grouping to build things like tags

2068681
yacc	bison
the way that precedence works to resolve shift reduce conflicts in yacc bison is that it compares the precedence of the rule to be reduced with the precedence of the token to be shifted

2068690
ant	maven
if you are not tied to using ant and are prepared to use maven then it is simply a matter of setting up maven with the eclipse plugin which generates the eclipse projects for you

2068737
post	get
mvc will automatically match by name query parameters for get or form input files for post to the action parameters by name

2068981
int	boolean
this can be done with bitmap.createscaledbitmap bitmap src int dstwidth int dstheight boolean filter

2069008
folder	directory
however assuming you cannot do that place all of the assemblies that you need to reference from the web project into a folder somewhere lib web and add a pre-build event to your web project that copies the content of that folder into the bin folder of the web directory

2069018
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the resulting string contents includes line breaks - that is between one and two there s character code 10

2069038
versioning	upgrade
in addition to the answer by weiji packaging and upgrade to new jvm versioning there are other risks

so how could i write a selector that would give me the src of the first img element on the page with no border and width height between 180 and 400 px

2069081
onkeyup	onblur
i coded that before learning about unobtrusive javascript so it uses onkeyup ... onblur ...

2069083

hide	show
i need to hide show a div based on a dropdown box the dropdown box only has a name no id

2069180
width	height
or are you refering to external css properties when you speak of border width and height

2069213
inherited	properties
if all your entities inherited from referenceentity wouldn t you want to create the unique constraint for the name properties on all the entities that are mapped

2069278
post	put
i ll put some code together and update this post is nobody else responds

2069283
sequence	permutation
and any given permutation can be thought of as a mapping of source indices from the original sequence into a set of destination indices in the new sequence

2069412
bluetooth	usb
wireless usb and bluetooth i rarely see though some have support for zigbee

2069441
serializable	deserialization
you will probably find that easier than using windows messages because it will handle the serializable and deserialization of the data for you -- but i realise this may not be an option for you or that you may have already ruled it out

2069451
int	chars
change chars c to int c

2069461
qlist	qvector
reversing a qlist is going to be o n however you do it since qlist isn t guaranteed to have its data stored contiguously in memory unlike qvector

2069469
post	get
i ll post the code if we get it worked out

2069474
client-side	server-side
then generate the server-side stub code or the client-side proxy code directly from that wsdl via the svcutil.exe tool

2069492
subtract	add
just add or subtract as appropriate once you get close

2069539
multiplying	multiplication
unlike multiplication in decimal where you need to memorize the times table when multiplying in binary you are always multiplying one of the terms by either 0 or 1 before writing it down in the list addends

2069679
postgresql	mysql
we would like to support the following databases to start with h2 mysql postgresql

2069700
width	height
to do that you must set the size of the body in relation to the page like height 100 or width if you want to relate the size to the width

2069733
sdl	bullet
this game library links against several libraries including ogre3d bullet physics and sdl which are in the library files libogremain-1.6.5.so libbulletcollision.a libbulletdynamics.a libbulletsoftbody.a libsdl-1.2.so.0

2069775
for-loop	loops

2069825
width	height
my requirement is to set the width and height of image relative to the page size

2069833
jboss	glassfish
or i could go with the spring dm-server but it seems the complexity of the solution would comparable to that of an application server jboss or glassfish

2069952
addition	multiplication
mathematically speaking multiplication distributes over addition

2069952
subtraction	addition
any real number in your case 7 can be presented as a series of additions such as 8 + -1 since subtraction is really just addition going the wrong way

2070105
int	chars	int	double
if you have a set of int or double that terminate with a known value then you can use a technique to walk through that sequence similar to walking though the chars in a string until you hit 0

2070122
rss	feed
i ve faced the realization that an upgrade to asp.net is the best way to go to implement features that are just too hard in asp for the hobbyist consuming rss feed authentication and user profiles but which i m keen to get stuck into once i get past the redesign upgrade

2070211
appkit	nsimage
nsimage is not available on the iphone since it is part of the appkit framework in cocoa

2070218
hide	show
so that it can be show or hide this way

2070218
hide	show
the problem is how do i know which one to show or hide

2070274
int	chars	int	double
looping through a chars array checking for 0 works because c-style strings have a convention that int double and most other types don t have null-termination

2070274
int	double
since int and double arrays do not have this convention you must use something else

2070274
int	double
replace double with int or almost any other type and everything here works the same

2070290
versioning	upgrade
is there a way to upgrade my octave versioning on ubuntu without downloading the latest versioning and reinstalling from scratch

2070602
int	chars
reading those aligned parts of the string into an int or some larger datatype to read several chars at a time

2070629
hide	show
static forms don t get garbage collected when their disposed you have to implement your own init reset methods when you show hide the form if the static form has references to other objects then your app will slowly leak memory among other things

2070632
actionscript	mxml
you need only exchange a single file rather than the mxml or actionscript files and images and other resource files

2070645
codeigniter	cakephp
i haven t used zend_controller_router but codeigniter and cakephp router explode a url parameter by and map them to different controllers and methods which i think is not difficult to implement one from scratch

2070649
vb.net	vb6
you may want to try passing nothing from vb.net and seeing what happens if the nothing persists to the vb6 dll then you know it is possible to pass it in and will find the answer by looking at the il code

2070673
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups is the best i can find

2070689
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2070735
post	get
if string lenght is the issue then try to use post instead of get

2070786
subobject	instances
you cannot have an instances of a derived class without first constructing base class subobject all bases ctors execute first

2070792
post	get
urlparams add on helps to observe the get and post parameters sent from the page

2070853
min	max
if not there are also other functions like last min max

2070889
opera	firefox
unfortunately firefox as of 3.5 and opera as of 9.something do not maintain the x-requested-with header in the second request after a redirect so isajaxrequest returns false in this situation when these browsers are being used

2070908
vmware	virtualbox
i looked vmware website and virtualbox and they dont have binaries to mac osx

2070915
post	get
2 my workaround is to create a temporary resource via post first and use the uri of this resource as parameter in the actual get request

2070939
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox certainly do have os x binaries

2070939
vmware	virtualbox
it s the second link in the list on the virtualbox downloads page and should come up on the vmware fusion demo download

2071071
integer	fractions
it divides the answer into an integer part and a fractions part

2071088
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception subclasses of runtimeexception or error are usually implicit

2071090
google-chrome	firefox
i know greasemonkey for firefox doesn t use a version value but since google-chrome actually displays a version number i thought it might

2071102
put	get
the outlets maybe actions i still get those confused leave the curly brackets open to put your own code in

2071138
stdout	stderr
a bit ugly but if you just want to get it up and running as fast as possible you could redirect stdout and stderr to dev null which should make it a bit faster as it won t be writing to disk or console

2071143
width	height
you may need to specify a height and width for the td via css to avoid a moving effect

2071150
outputstream	inputstream
that url can in this particular case just point to a servlet which gets an inputstream of the image from some datasource from local disk file system using fileinputstream or from the db using resultset#getbinarystream and writes it to the outputstream of the response the usual java io way

2071155
portrait	landscape
however for input fields it s better to provide a landscape mode because some phones have a hardware keyboard which automatically aligns the phone in landscape and therefor makes it hard to look at the app that is still in portrait mode

2071157
post	get
how do i get a post form field value

2071203

2071372
accessor	properties
although editbuttonitem is an instance method rather than a read-only properties the dot syntax still works since dot syntax is just shorthand for method calls--usually accessor

2071376
public	protected
i believe you should try to structure your code in meaningfull classes and use the standard access modifiers private protected public internal

2071387
cassini	iis
this is easier with a local instance of iis than cassini though because cassini doesn t seem to do quite as good a job at detecting changes and forcing restarts

2071440
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
reading and writing the threads is done in its own thread treating it as a normal file using bufferedreader and bufferedwriter objects

2071456
oci	sqlplus
as simple as it might look when executed directly on the server with sqlplus it returns a result but when executed from the app that uses oci this query returns oci_no_data always

2071471
versioning	upgrade
i never tried from a versioning 1 release but i know that a versioning 2.x release could be upgrade all the way to a versioning 4.0 release there were typically dot-releases every 4 months

2071500
put	get
so when somebody in pageeditor edit mode hovers over the html you put inside the editframe they will get a pop up menu

2071500
pop-up	dialog
in this menu you can display any number of commands the normal one would be an edit option that then pop-up a dialog where you can edit any fields you want from any content item in the tree

2071529
keydown	keyup
3 the code for your keyup keydown will involve looking for what is selected and what is the next previous item

2071579
g++	gcc
how does gcc g++ handles this

2071593
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
what a library needs to provide is support to store these numbers and perform calculations on them addition multiplication integer division with rest

2071598
many-to-many	one-to-many
coz sooner or later you end up having some complex objects with various one-to-many many-to-many relationships that model binding just won t pick up and you have to construct it by yourself

2071629
g++	gcc
how does gcc g++ handles this

2071629
inherited	subclassing
the behaviour would also be different if the dev method were a virtual method and foo were a base class or a subclassing in an inherited hiearchy

2071689
sunos	aix
i m writting a perl script for which i need the uptime in seconds to do some calculation in all the machine in the shop linux sunos and aix

2071758
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
this will let you easily say this is a one-to-one many-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many etc

2071813
inherited	subclassing
this uses a primary key join column and inherited through separate table per subclassing

2071825

python allows you to use a translation dictionary to map characters to a replacement string

2072627
width	height
width 390 height 250

2072633
put	get
generally though you re going to have to put a lot into it as an oss project to get anything out and if you can t or won t make that commitment probably best not to go down that road

2072642
inherited	properties
each logger inherited properties like its logging level from its parent

2072647
implements	extends
batchserver is the rmi-object implements the rmi interface batchservice and not extends nothing in particular

c# supports nine integral types sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong and chars

2072658
post	get
maybe you can get some ideas from my blog post about it

2072681
getter	setter
java beans have getter and setter methods bad oop practice and are serializable

2072705
children	parent
i have a bunch of properties on person which i don t want to persist at this point so i want to avoid saving the whole parent object just because locations children have changed

2072727
mouse	keyboard
edit i m doing a keyboard mouse statistic application that ll store the amount of key press mouse clicks as well as what button was pressed where and when for my computer and i would want to save this data every time a button is pressed

2072746
getter	setter
the easy way of using javabeans was to use naming conventions to define the attributes of a bean--hence getter and setter

2072746
getter	setter
so the getter and setter made it easy for the ui software to discover user-viewable or editable attributes

2072752
tolower	toupper
the work performed is a set of alternating calls to toupper and tolower on a string

2072790

2072853
move	drag
does java come with a toolbox like control that has drag and drop controls that you can move around etc

2072860
ienumerable	ilist
another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality

2072909
put	get
still worth trying as it might make things a bit better -- it s also very easy since queue s are intrinsically thread-safe and besides a queue s put and get all you need is basically an __import__

2072920
temp	tmp
i initially tried to use php memory instead of tmp headers cause using temp files for this sort of thing is sloppy but for some reason i couldn t get that working

2072922
put	get
i managed to put something together to get the html to the correct structure to use jquery ui tabs on - hopefully someone can learn something from this

2072980
put	get
then put and get as necessary

2073006
ienumerable	iqueryable
see what is the difference between iqueryable t and ienumerable t

2073017
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the exact same application works fine on windows internet explorer firefox google-chrome opera and on safari for macs

2073042
post	get
you will namely get this error page whenever you tries to get a non-cached post request from the browser history

2073042
post	get
pressing the back button will not get the post request anymore but the request which was invoked before it the request used to open view the page with the form

2073059
width	height
how can i get the height and width of each image using php or jquery and store it in the script in some way that jquery can get hold of it and randomise it

2073069
minimum	max
at a minimum you need a single pass to just figure out the max and a second fetch hopefully on indexed columns to retrieve the full dataset

2073104
docx	xlsx
these reps are given read-only access to the libraries as to not change the documents posted by management however we find that if management uploads an office 07 document either docx or xlsx to be more specific the reps cannot open the file unless we give them higher either add edit or even delete permissions

2073120
melt	reshape
here s a simple example of using melt and cast from the reshape help

2073180

you want to bind the nsarraycontroller s content set to nstreecontroller it s controller key to selection and then the model key path should be the relationship name which i would hope isn t name

2073188
tostring	getter
but as usual there are excemptions from my advice - what do you expect from the tostring method if you allow overriding of the getter methods do you want it use the classes fields or the result of the - maybe override - getter method

2073190
tostring	getter
using getter in tostring is an overkill

2073248
firefox	safari
i ve tested it in firefox ie and safari

2073291
getter	setter
if your class has getter and setter for fields you should be consistent throughout the implementation of that class in whether you use getter and setter or access the fields directly

2073291
getter	setter
in terms of performance it shouldn t matter - your trivial getter and setter should be final methods anyway so they should be inlined anyway

2073293
width	height
in php the getimagesize filename function will give you the height and width of an image

2073293
width	height
all you have to do is give the function the image s filename and it will return an array with the height width and image type

2073308
width	height
i have an image + text in a column.when i chaange the width of the column the row height of grid panel is changing.i think it is because of the image because when i change the width of the other columns which dont have image in it row height doesnt chage.how can i prevent this from happening.however this issue is not seen in firefox

2073311

note in the info below assume that get also includes post and the other http methods too

2073420
tcplistener	tcpclient
just glancing over your code i noticed that you have both a tcpclient and tcplistener for your client and server

2073420
tcplistener	tcpclient
your server will be the tcplistener and your client will be the tcpclient

2073446
versioning	upgrade
so should anyone stumble across this again - simple answer is to upgrade to the latest versioning

agree with jherico s answer - the maven ant tasks

2073512
ant	maven
refer this why you should use the maven ant tasks instead of maven or ivy

2073517
width	height
but if they have width in px the height will be identical

2073554
post	get
there are various request methods in http but at a minimum you would have to implement get or maybe even post but that aspect you can control since its your web application

2073569
django	turbogears
i ve not used ruby s sequel but i ve used hibernate and python s sqlalchemy for django turbogears and while you can do these sorts of queries i don t believe that is their strength

2073608

ready	each
each gameobject has a property called garbage that is a boolean that is set when ready to be removed

2073853
innodb	myisam
if so i recommend using the myisam table type as it supports full text indexes innodb does not

2073854
fast-forward	merge
another possibility is that their revision is simply a descendent of yours in which case you will by default have a fast-forward merge in which your head is just updated to their commit with no merging happening this can be disabled if you really want to record a merge using --no-ff

2073858
put	get
i personally have nothing against default_scope but it can get messy and in the few times that i have used it i ve always had to either go back and remove it or put in ugly with_exclusive_scope helper methods in my model to explicitly get around it

2073879
onchange	onfocus
you will obviously not want to call logusage on the onchange method in a textbox etc but probably all onfocus clicks or whatever you are really wanting to keep track of

2073906
equals	icomparable
implement icomparable equals method if you need to

2074010
hide	show
i want to switch the show class to a hide class depending on the clicked link

2074016
int	chars
a chars is a form of int in c

2074112
udp	tcp
you could at least avoid one level of protection by using a udp scheme instead of a tcp one

2074121
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
as for the margin yeah that along with setting width and height are standard ways of setting spacing

2074148
boost	stl
this one illustrates the old smart pointers from the stl and the new ones from boost -- in adequate detail

2074200
int	chars
as others already noted in one case you are attempting to return cstring which is a value in this context - a pointer from a function that is declared to return a chars which is an int

2074206
button	checkbox
if view_test button was clicked initializing the dialog before the form post backs the checkbox ch1.checked property in .net is always false

2074232
memcpy	strcpy
obvious choices for your example are strcpy or memcpy

2074251

obviously frame based onion skinning type animation characters cartoons etc. is still best left to flash but nearly any type of animation you d do in flash with tweens position size color opacity width height etc. can easily be accomplished with most of the modern .js libraries including jquery

2074306
google-chrome	firefox
can t comment on google-chrome but mozilla is releasing firefox 3.6 now without web sockets and it s not a feature likely to be included in minor releases 3.6.x so the earliest release it is likely to ship in is the next major release assuming the implementation is finished soon

2074319
post	get
the straightforward option is just a regular form post even if it is to the url voteup id and i m not sure why you can t do that or even the get you mentioned

2074339
accessor	properties
in your overallrating set accessor you re parsing the current value of the underlying integer variable instead of the value being passed to the properties

2074346

2074347
opera	firefox
this works great in firefox ie and opera

2074347
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome safari it gives the input focus but fails to actually put the cursor inside the input i know it gives it focus because the safari google-chrome focus borders appear

post	get
if that improves things at all enable intellisense but doesn t solve it please post any new errors you get

2074389
maven	pom.xml
so i created a pom.xml file and now maven builds the project fine and runs all the tests and everything

2074396
for-loop	loops
to create the for-loop it says create a for-loop that loops through each of the objects in the phrases collection

2074433
pop-up	dialog
there shouldn t be any issues if you are binding elements from your pop-up dialog to corresponding hidden elements in your main view

2074464
jboss	glassfish
i m currently migrating a spring application from the jboss j2ee container to sun s glassfish j2ee container and although it is the same code i am getting a confusing error during a specific point in my application

2074614
ubuntu	linux
the linked article describes how to install those in a ubuntu linux environment

2074614
gif	png
the best-known pdf generation library fpdf can do this but for jpeg png and gif only

2074703
uitableview	reloaddata
i want to do a reloaddata on a uitableview and after the table refresh is done i want a delegate method to be called when i can know that the refresh is done

2074740
post	put
i will put the whole method and accompanying function at the bottom for reference but first i d like to post the portion i think is where i need to focus on

2074793
datamapper	activerecord
it relies on the datamapper pattern instead of activerecord and uses an entity manager to handle persistence logic

2074795
rss	feed
i had this code that i wrote last year and it returns rss feed for some term i enter

2074795
rss	feed
the user enters a term and i want to display the rss feed from yahoo google or nytimes

2074800
regasm	tlbimp
being c# i ran tsuserex through tlbimp and created tsuserexlib.dll then registered it with regasm

2074826
spaces	delimiter
have you tried just saving it as spaces delimiter

2074869
globalization	localization
what is the difference between globalization and localization

2074890
globalization	localization
so you can think of globalization as a strategic venue where as localization is tactical

2074969
ironruby	ironpython
i know ironruby ironpython are supported

2074976
getter	setter
usually it won t make a big difference and i settled on just accessing the variable directly from inside the class with the exception of getter and setter which do something beyond just getting or setting the value

2074983
queue	fifo
queue is fifo fifo

2074987
internationalization	globalization
read up on asp.net internationalization globalization features

2074989
put	get
use a queue when you want to get things out in the order that you put them in

2074989
put	get
use a stack when you want to get things out in the reverse order than you put them in

2074989
put	get
use a list when you want to get anything out regardless of when you put them in and when you don t want them to automatically be removed

2075008
punctuation	words
and my readpunctwords readnumwords and readcapwords are quite the same just checking if the words has digits or capital letters instead of punctuation like in here

2075024
accessor	ivar
in that case i sometimes access some private ivars through objective-c private accessor which usually check if the ivar is nil null and will load the data back in memory in a lazy loading ad-hoc way

2075029
queue	fifo
fifo for queue filo for stacks

2075045
subtract	add
this way is preferred to the multiple join against same table method as you can simply modify the in clause and the count without needing to add or subtract more tables to the query when your list of ids changes

2075051
for-loop	loops
the idiomatic way to write this loops would be as a for-loop

2075060
interpolation	splines
if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scales incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

2075065
jsf	jspx
aside from the fact that you need to set the proper doctype and content type so that the browser knows what to do with the page you also should get rid of the old fashioned jspx format and use xhtml format to get the most benefit of java ee 6-shipped jsf 2.0 and facelets

2075085
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfect in ie but refuses to work in any other browser like firefox or google-chrome

2075114
queue	fifo
the stack lifo - last in first out and a queue fifo - fifo establish and order in which your elements are inserted and removed from a collection

2075129
draggable	droppable
your mileage may vary but what i did was add logic to my drag event handler that would check to see if the grid was being scrolled which is when i needed to force the droppable positions to be refreshed and if so i set refreshpositions to true on the draggable

2075129
move	drag
this doesn t immediately refresh the positions but it will cause them to refresh the next time the drag handle move

2075165
public	protected
while sensitive data is protected via user authentication the unprotected data is hardly public but as far as i can tell is totally open for public consumption

2075189
temp	tmp
the error you are seeing is likely indicating that you ran our of space in the tmp directory which is where mysql puts its temp tables by default which can cause that error

2075196
for-loop	arrays
the arrays are loaded once then accessed as many times as you want in this case i was using the for-loop that steve wortham posted as a test

2075264
inline-functions	inlining
these are good candidates for inlining whether it be as #define macros or inline-functions

2075285
min	max
take the min max of all the x y coordinates and construct a rectangle xmin ymin xmax ymin xmax ymax xmin ymax

2075304
mouse	keyboard
i wanna modify the document selection user currently selected by mouse or keyboard how to do it in a cross browser way

2075376
instances	transient
in order to temporarily fix this to clean up our logs i want to intercept calls to add objects to the http session so that the class of the object being added and any objects in its object graph have their instances variable declarations changed to transient

2075385
put	get
but you don t get to put an exception handler around the wpf binding code

2075431
hide	show
use hide if you want to show the window later on

2075441
cvs	svn
my goal was to have a directory with my svn version controlled project that pointed to someone else s cvs project

2075441
cvs	svn
trouble is this isn t all too sensible and the team api wouldn t recognize that there was a cvs folder within an svn folder

2075441
cvs	svn
so i ve looked at having a project point at both a cvs and an svn repository without success

2075474
gif	png
if by flash images you mean jpg png and gif files then you use any of the standard server side software packages or language specific libraries that utilize these packages

2075526
sorting	grouping
sorting priority type name type grouping unit value

2075628
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
it gives you a chance to clean up whatever you ve been doing in touchesbegan and touchesmoved

2075633
spaces	delimiter
the second way allows you to easily change the delimiter tab spaces newlines whatever to suit your needs easily

2075676
wtl	atl
that said the usefulness of c# has made me a believer in using it for anything that either needs to be done quickly or needs a user interface because fiddling around with mfc wtl atl or com totally sucks

2075735
width	height
using yui 2 on page load i found all elements of that given classname that were either set to display none or whose height and width was 0 that s one way of measuring whether an element exists or a parent is set to display none

2075762
simplecursoradapter	spinner
the spinner is tied to a simplecursoradapter

2075782
memcached	apc
you could use apc or memcached to implement caching or various other ways to improve performance

2075783
solaris	bsd
for what it s worth there are extensions to plain old bsd sockets in some unixy systems too like the stuff in solaris and other systems

2075797
hbase	hypertable
2 is there an hbase or hypertable base solution obviously a naked hbase hypertable can t do this for this

2075797
hbase	hypertable
-- but if there is a project based on hbase hypertable scalability probably won t be an issue imo

2075805
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i m looking for a way to get text-shadow that looks like css3 text-shadow but that works with ie firefox opera safari etc.

2075823
hex	binary
that s binary 00010000 hex 0x10

2075886
stdout	stderr
is there an alternate way to spawn processes that will share the stdout stderr of the launching process

2075906
restrict	shared
you can adapt this code to restrict the lists to be of a specific type and you can adapt it further so you can join lists which shared a common base type

2075976
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems that the sliding effect works when i run it it firefox but not google-chrome or safari

2075998
children	parent
side note the tables for the assets themselves they are hierarchal are normalized with foreign key references pointing from child to parent tier 3 contains info about tier 2 etc so once a single asset is pinned down it is very simple to locate its children and ancestors

2076004
outputstream	inputstream
i d probably just implement one or more subclasses of inputstream and or outputstream and code them up to mutate my data stream in various ways

2076004
udp	tcp
mutating the packets at different tcp udp layers using some sort of fancy tools is probably possible but kind of wanders away from the math you re really supposed to be concentrating on in a math class

2076021
put	get
you should read the core audio programming guide as well to get a sense of how the audio system is put together

2076025
calloc	malloc
you can use calloc instead of malloc to allocate memory that is already initialised

2076025
calloc	malloc
in c there is no need to cast the return value of malloc or calloc

2076025
calloc	malloc
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

2076043
fseek	ftell
in fact the return value of ftell for streams opened in text mode is useful only in calls to fseek and not to determine file size

2076095
webkit	gecko
gecko webkit and mshtml are huge codebases

2076098
onclick	onchange
that won t stop people from pasting things in with their mouse so an onchange and onclick are probably desirable too

2076098
onclick	onchange	onclick	onkeyup	onchange	onkeyup
if you re using straight js i d recommend not using straight js either use element.addeventlistener or onkeyup onchange and onclick

2076173
textmate	gedit
there are gedit plugins that get you very close to textmate - in fact i like gedit better

2076187
dlsym	dlopen
then main creates an instance of plugin_loader which actually does the dlopen dlsym and creates an instance of refptr passing create_instance to it

2076196
post	get
assuming you re sending the content via post rather than as part of the querystring in get there s no universal limit

2076260
post	get
scenario - 1 query to get 10 post and then 10 queries to get each

2076261
free	malloc
don t mix malloc free with new delete

2076281
listview	gridview
gridview listview

2076344
post	get
i would post sample code but i think that would be pointless as all the different samples have given me different errors etc here s the list of errors that we get

2076355
width	height
you need to specify the original width and height

2076355
width	height
you could try this with jquery if you don t have the width and height up front but your mileage may vary

2076392
stdout	fflush
if i understood you correctly you need to add fflush stdout

2076438
mouseup	mousedown
define mouseup and mousedown event handlers for the picturebox

2076438
mouseup	mousedown
define a boolean variable in form scope that is set to true when the mouse goes down in the mousedown event handler on the picturebox and false in the mouseup handler for the picturebox

2076461
int	chars
the c# spec states in section 5.5 that reads and writes on certain types namely bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types are guaranteed to be atomic

2076470
post	get
now lets say i get the first 100 post using and pass this list to the template - what happens

2076470
post	get
use post.author.get_value_for_datastore post to collect the author keys see the link above and then do a batch get to get them all - the trouble here is that we need to re-construct a template data object.

2076487
median	minimum
another approach that might work is splitting the graph up into 200 point bins and discard all but the maximum minimum and median points in each interval

2076488
opml	feed
i have a huge 5 000+ feed opml file which freezes and crashes my browser when i try uploading it to my google reader account using the following instructions

2076503
imagemagick	magick++
check out the magick++ api to imagemagick

2076572
free	malloc
you never want to use sbrk instead of malloc or free

2076572
free	malloc
finally malloc and free are not cumbersome - they are the standard way to allocate and release memory in c

2076572
free	malloc
even if you want to implement your own memory allocator it s best to just use malloc and free as the basis - a common approach is to allocate a large chunk at a time with malloc and provide memory allocation from it this is what suballocators or pools usually implement

2076575
struts	stripes
stripes programming model is more like a tuned struts - somewhat awkward

2076578
addition	multiplication
this however does not mean that operations like addition and multiplication are atomic

2076617
width	height
do you know about how to set coordinates x y position height and width for mapview

2076639
for-loop	loops
if you do a single query before the for-loop and then loops over the resultset and the svn part you will see a dramatic increase in speed

2076655
post	get
load is specifically for fetching via get unless parameters are provided then post is used an html page and directly inserting it into the selected nodes those selected by the portion of

2076655
post	get
is a more general method that allows you to make get and post requests and does nothing specific with the response

2076673
accessor	properties
javabeans style properties accessor or

2076673
getter	setter
there are a couple reasons why property-based access is discouraged but one is that they you re forced to add getter and setter for all of your persistent entity fields but you may not want those same fields susceptible to mutation by external clients

2076679
post	get
for example they said instead of passing json as a parameter to to indicate return data type they provided so we would all know that the return type we expected was json or instead of indicating send method as post or get you could use or respectively

2076680
getter	setter
i think you need to put the annotations on the getter and setter themselves if you want them to be used

2076720
jpcap	jnetpcap
is there any code available in java that uses jpcap or jnetpcap that captures packets and displays all header information

2076747
int	double
to elaborate on this a little more you have to explicitly wrap up non-object number types int unsigned int double float bool etc. into nsnumber when working with anything that expects an object

2076788
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
more generally if you have a potentially lengthy delegate callback either make sure that 1 the delegate is an object that won t be deallocated during the lifecycle of the delegator uinavigationcontroller managing uiviewcontroller s or 2 the delegator s delegate object is set to nil during the delegate s deallocation

2076838
subtract	add
if it has been used add or subtract one from the number and check again keep repeating until i hit an unused number

2076838
subtract	add
if it has been used add or subtract another randomly generated random number and check again problem is we re back to simply generating random numbers and checking as in solution 1

2076838
hash	md5
5 generate much larger random numbers and hash them using md5 to get a smaller numeric value we should rarely get collisions but i end up with larger than needed numbers again

2076846
put	get
if i put the two appends in comment then my linq query does work and i do get the right data

2076865
implements	extends
if for example you are using the newlib c library commonly used on bare-metal embedded systems with the gnu compiler you have to implements sbrk yourself so how it works in those circumstances is up to you so long as it achieves its required behaviour of extends the heap or failing

2076873
integer	fractions
two values are returned the integer part and the fractions part

2076951
postgresql	mysql
so i suggest you might want to take a look on how the database.yml is configured with mysql and also try that out with the postgresql gem

2076969
rar	zip
basically i want to feed the files folders to a shellscript that creates different compressed archives rar zip tbz2 out of them

2076984
mouse	keyboard
when the childwindow is active none of the controls on the underlying ui will receive mouse or keyboard events

2077013
hide	show
the view i m pushing onto this does need to display the navigation bar and i m currently using the above method to show it and then hide it again when the view is popped

2077053
post	get
then when you do something like post_path post you ll get the post baz-quux or any other relevant url that you have configured in config routes.rb file my example applies to resourceful urls

2077148
cldc	midp
i just wanted to know how do i generate random number using j2me cldc 1.0 midp 2.0

2077157
tapestry	wicket
click is tapestry-like but much more easy than tapestry and wicket

2077167
cldc	midp
you can use the random class of midp or the one in cldc 1.1

2077173
post	put
put the following in your post model stick it at the bottom before the closing end tag

2077254
post	get
whenever i visit i get the error message at the top of this post

2077403
client-side	server-side
client server language compatibility jscript s similarity to javascript means that you can use the same include file for server-side validation as you use for client-side

2077407
hide	show
why don t you just use the current visibility to determine whether to hide or show it

2077410
single-quotes	double-quotes
other answers in this thread have minor problems the cgi.escape method for some reason ignores single-quotes and you need to explicitly ask it to do double-quotes

2077411
firefox	safari
it works in safari and firefox but it does not work in ie7

2077416
put	get
in the page with recent visited div fetch the database content that store recent visited page id use it to get the title and image contained in the actual pages then put the result there

2077418
folder	directory
the main need is to iterate through the hidden directory in the source folder sandbox tmp here

2077418
folder	directory
items with the directory attribute folder

2077418
folder	directory
directory folder

2077418
folder	directory
how can i list only the hidden folder not files in a set directory

2077453
post	put
why a post back occurs while i ve put asyncfileupload in updatepanel

2077459
wordpress	joomla
it can have a steeper learning curve than other systems but it is the superset of joomla and wordpress it does all what they do and much much more

2077459
wordpress	joomla
comparison of drupal wordpress and joomla

2077466
post	put
basically should should create a controller which finds all pages eg your post and put in into an xml file

2077480
post	get
the jquery .post function sends a post request to the server which means to access the value of result you need to get it from the _post superglobal

2077533
json.net	jsonfx
as an alternative to system.web or json.net there s also jsonfx and servicestack.text

2077558
implements	extends
the purchasecontroller is actually a simple managed bean not extends anything an implements only serializable annotated with controller

2077583
width	height
per pixel but color format and width height might then be hardcoded or hopefully in the dictionary

2077609
firefox	safari
edit a blogger did some tests and found that its about 30 faster in firefox but slower compared to 1.3 in safari

2077669
min	max	width	height
instead it returns an axis-aligned rectangle based on the bounds of a rectangle whose width height corresponds to the max min diameter of the ellipse and follows its rotation

2077701
folder	directory
when you build the java project in netbeans it creates a jar file on the dist folder in the current project directory

2077702
opera	firefox
in firefox it works well but in ie and opera the browser first navigates to smart url but then it closes connection and sends a postback using an asp.net form action

2077704
width	height
i m not exactly sure what you mean by height and width of the mapview but if you want to change the size of the mapview itself on the screen you can just do it like you would do for any view by setting the layoutheight and layoutwidth either in xml or dynamically in code

2077755
hide	show
1. you could store your data range in one or two variables then hide years you drew with all those date i hope you understand d add one absolute div to show current year which you ll recalculate on each mousemove

2077777
cashapelayer	cagradientlayer
i have a cashapelayer that i add a cagradientlayer to but there is no clipping about the shape of the cashapelayer

2077822
for-loop	arrays
edit you ve asked for a string arrays specifically but in case you re flexible about the requirements i would prefer a to avoid the need to determine the arrays length prior to the for-loop in the first example and simply add items to it

2077879
georss	kml
i will just add a little detail and recommend you to serve the markers in a standard format natively supported by openlayers like kml geojson or georss

2077999
disk	ram
if you understand how disk i o and caching works you can modify file operations to work well with it if you read from one file and write to another working on large batches of data in ram can help reduce i o contention between the reading and writing phases of your code and vastly improve throughput

2078024
cos	sin
center + sin angle v radius1 + cos angle w radius2

2078045
folder	directory
i want to protect the files in a specific directory so that people cannot link to them - but i still need my program to be capable of rendering them so password protecting the actual folder won t work

2078058
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	width	height
now this works fine in internet explorer and firefox but i just tested in safari and google-chrome and the values are zero but in firefox and it has the correct width and height

2078058
google-chrome	safari
now in google-chrome and safari this animation performs beautifully

2078119
inline	inlining
as for a workaround try explicitly adding inline or not inlining wait_what

2078130
disk	ram
the linux kernel uses a kind of ram disk to access modules at an early boot stage

2078137
16-bit	64bit
splice these four 16-bit integers together to get a 64bit integer

2078144
public	protected
put the protected resources in a different context directory from the public using servlet-mapping s in web.xml

2078144
public	protected
if the public resources are in put the protected in admin and define a security-contraint also in web.xml for that context only

2078160
folder	directory
all the directory and content apache folder wsgi-script martfiles have the permission 775 root devusers with the group devusers including my user http and root

2078162
spaces	delimiter
this will encounter problems however if your search term can occur at the beginning of the field no spaces character before it or at the end of the field no delimiter after it

2078177
hide	show
also jquery s show hide functions don t affect the visibility attribute

2078180
strcpy	malloc
then your addentry function doesn t need the malloc calls for firstname lastname and phonenumber but you still need to copy data using strcpy

2078207
istream	getline
between std string std stringstream and getline std istream std string you should be pretty good

2078214
hide	show
you are using visibility hidden to hide the div but the jquery show functions don t adjust visibility

2078225
lisp	scheme
go back to lisp or scheme since they re the source if you want to be old school

2078227
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

2078255
jobs	cron
the really processor intensive stuff is done in the background all run via scheduled cron jobs

2078266
uploadify	swfupload
if you can t alter your server environment use one of the flash based uploading solutions like swfupload or uploadify

2078277
jsf	wicket	struts	wicket
that s why you can t swing a cat without hitting another java web framework struts spring wicket jsf etc. - there s a lot more to it than just servlets

2078293
django	turbogears
django and turbogears are frameworks for using python more easily on the web

2078293
django	turbogears
currently it supports python even with django or turbogears and java

2078368
lisp	scheme
i think lambda is simplest in lisp since it was designed for that kind of thing and of the dialects scheme tends to be the simplest

2078406
width	height
i have image in container and i have set width and height attributes for this image in css

2078406
width	height
but when i set width and height attributes image is shown in size that is set in css

2078445
width	height
the only unit for the width and height attributes is a percentage √¢

2078477
disk	ram
using a ram disk you can force a cache to use ram instead of a slow disk drive

2078481
jruby	mri
try testing your buildfile under mri 1.8.6 rather than jruby

2078502
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so my guess is that what you are dealing with is something like this a uinavigationcontroller with you uiscroll-uiview-uibutton uiviewcontroller as a root view controller

2078502
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
after being tapped the uibutton pushes a new uiviewcontroller to the uinavigationcontroller

2078502
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then you go back to the previous uiviewcontroller in the uinavigationcontroller stack and this is when you lose you scroll position

2078508
vsto	add-in
i often work with clients who have large financial models with heavy vba and when i can i like to extract the vba code to c# and make it a vsto add-in

2078530
hex	binary
if you look into the options for bulk insert and find no way to tell it to interpret hex as binary i recommend using ssis for this

2078549
chown	chmod
check the permissions on the file use chmod or chown and see if that makes a difference

2078596
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
if building something is truly not viable your other option is to either virtualize windows using vmware fusion or parallels desktop or to use bootcamp and create a windows partition

2078645
vb6	vba
the vba library itself actually got an for the first time since vb6

2078654
ppl	tbb
if you arent tied to pure c i would encourage you to look at the c++ tbb library and particularly the ppl subset you will find more generality and composability like for nested parallelism

2078682
ssl	https
hello i m trying to fetch data from a https web i m not behind firewall or proxy however even accepting all certificates it keeps throwing system.net.webexceptionstatus.securechannelfailure with the message shown cancelled the request unable to create a secure ssl tls channel

2078687
hide	show
manipulate the text links via css to hide the text and show a background image instead color transparent

2078709
children	parent
because it seems like this is a full binary tree assuming your triangle is wrong and the third row is actually supposed to be 3 4 5 6 you could maintain a parent queue whose head is the next parent that needs children

pull	push
can anyone tell me is it possible to use the adb to pull and push a database from an app without root privaliges on the phone

2078710
pull	push
but i have been told you can use push and pull if you know the file you want

2078710
pull	push
basically i want to pull a database from my app on a non rooted phone modify it and push it back on

2078741
maven	m2e
to make all this easier i would quickly learn maven and then use the m2e plugin

2078824
hide	show
i ve been trying to make an option show and hide possibly toggle in my browser action popup without success

2078824
hide	show
the body appears in my popup but the show and hide actions do not work

2078826
client-side	server-side
there s essentially two ways to do this completely client-side and server-side with async postback

2078836
salt	md5
it has no salt added but you could easily add one by taking md5 password

2078836
crypt	hash
however the php crypt function can use a variety of different hash to compute the hash

2078836
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
when you prefix your salt with 1 you get a hash with an md5

2078836
hash	salt
so to verify a hash you take the password provided by the user as the password and you take everything up to the third dollarsign as the salt and you see if the results you get match the results that are stored

2078836
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
the next part of your confusion is that the md5 function is giving you a hex hash whereas the crypt function is giving you a hash coded in base64

2078944
uiview	caanimation
caanimation has a delegate method animationdidstop finished and uiview has setanimationdidstopselector

2079034
dpkg	apt
on debian that would include dpkg pre-installed on any debian system or apt-file not pre-installed necessarily or other apt tools

2079048
ilist	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
like the java collections c# has a hierarchy of interfaces that includes collections icollection lists ilist and map idictionary semantics

2079060
post	get
if you do then you need to check your createuser.php file and see why the post request returns no json but the get request does

2079138
outputstream	inputstream
the load inputstream store outputstream string methods work the same way as the load reader store writer string pair except the input output stream is encoded in iso 8859-1 character encoding

2079164
post	get
using the ajax method really shouldn t take much more than using post get

2079168
free	malloc
malloc will then look at this list for a free block that is the right size or larger

2079178
free	malloc
the answer is that it depends most of the potential slowness rather comes from malloc and free in combination and usually #1 and #2 will be of similar speed

2079178
free	malloc
writing my own almost standards compliant malloc replacement tool malloc free times from 35 to 3-4 and it seriously optimised those two factors

2079178
free	malloc
it would likely have been a similar speed to use some other high-performance malloc but having our own was more portable to esoteric devices and of course allows free to be inlined in some places

2079181
free	malloc
malloc has to run through a linked list of free blocks to find one to allocate

2079181
free	malloc
in addition if you malloc many small blocks then as you free those blocks you will fragment the heap much more than if you only allocate and free a few large blocks

2079201
strsplit	substr
i have tried to use strsplit and substr methods but i can t get it to work for me

2079261
free	malloc
of course this completely depends on the malloc implementation but in this case with no calls to free most malloc implementations will probably give you the same algorithmic speed

2079268
hide	show
i have 3 button-images in one page such that when you press 1 it should show the iframe related to it and hide the others

2079268
hide	show
how can i show 1 frame 1st then when the other button-image is clicked that iframe will hide and the iframe corresponding to the button clicked will be the only 1 showing

2079282
sorting	filtering
it expects primarily numbers because you use this stuff for sorting and filtering after sphinx has already done the search

2079309
filesystems	ntfs
the .net version is however going to work without trouble for a while though the current windows filesystems ntfs version 6 limits the file size to 17 592 185 978 880 bytes well south of 2 63 - 1

2079367
opera	google-chrome
opera and webkit should be accessible to anyone as far as ie goes there s a plugin for google-chrome that renders like ie afair and there s a google-chrome plugin for ie too

2079404
uiview	subviews
uiscrollview is just a subclass of uiview so it s possible to add and remove subviews at runtime

2079529
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby will be the only officially supported dynamic languages

2079562

2079590
hide	show
i m doing this to show hide the navigation bar

2079631
webkit	gecko
you might want to consider using a canvas to do this which works cross platform very well with explorercanvas included for msie compatibility and of course is supported natively in webkit gecko

2079648
nsformatter	nsnumberformatter
the proper way to validate user input in cocoa is to use an instance of an appropriate subclass of nsformatter in this case something like nsnumberformatter

2079653
int	double
however i want this to work for double or int or any arithmetic type

2079682
awt	swing
but if need to look for alternatives and evaluate them before you decide how to write a gui check out this list of alternatives to swing and awt

2079733
width	height
os scrollbars are uniform in width whether displayed vertically or horizontally so you can use the width returned as the height of a horizontal scrollbar

2079757
vmware	virtualbox
the easiest way is to simply install virtualbox or something similar vmware install centos 3 or any suitable old distro with a 2.4 kernel and build test your app on that

2079760
rss	feed
for example reading a large rss feed and attempting to parse every item in it

2079765

but i want a vector that is 98 elements long with each element being an int from 0 to 5 telling me how many chars strings there are in each list item

2079799
do.call	lapply
not the last do.call rbind somelist as we got a list back from lapply

2079893
int	chars
that means it is expanded to it s largest generic size bytes chars and shorts are converted to int by sign-extending or zero padding

2079915
folder	directory
as a result in my solution i have the main web site as well as the virtual directory website which is actually a folder inside this main web site

2079919
rss	feed
i m trying to find a way to split a single rss feed into separate feed based on keyword matches

2079958
width	height
did you record and export for width 1024 height 768

2079991
mouseover	mouseout
you just need to add a few more mouseover s and mouseout s

2079996
folder	directory
it is necessary to put all .elc files i a folder or just in the same directory has their original .el

2080033
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the each method for arrays just loops through all the elements using a for-loop i think

2080034
awt	swing
in turn several implementations would be defined to produce swing widgets or awt or whatever

2080090
post	get
but if the user has to click 10 different places to post a comment they re going to get sick of my interface pretty quick too

2080108
firefox	safari
what happens if the computer s default browser is configured to be a different browser such as firefox or safari each of which has a much longer maximum url length

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
i write scientific software in numpy scipy matplotlib

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
example user uploads image or audio file my program processes it using numpy scipy and output is displayed on the browser using matplotlib or perhaps the user can download a processed file

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
for those interested in numpy scipy matplotlib audiolab here is my ubuntu cheat sheet whenever i launch an ec2 instance

2080117
floating-point	integer
have you ever added two integers with + and then later added an integer to a floating-point number with +

2080138
matplotlib	scipy
app engine does not support any of numpy scipy or matplotlib alas

2080149
lambda	first-class-functions
but from the list you give it sounds like what you want is how to program effectively with first-class-functions values which is what lambda evaluates to

2080149
lambda	first-class-functions
most people use first-class-functions heavily find lambda rather annoying and hard to read

2080149
lambda	first-class-functions
schemers like first-class-functions and scheme s notation forces more explicit lambda on the programmer than many other functional languages

2080166
cos	sin
consider a math class that contains some common values like pi or e and some useful functions like sin and cos

2080170
sorting	filtering
i would approach a pipeline design with processors implementing sorting filtering aggregation etc

2080170
pull	push
consequently the ui needs to be implemented in a pull style rather than push you only want to update it every second

2080211
post	get
this means you will get the .net framework 2.0 sp2 3.0 sp2 and 3.5 sp1 plus a few post 3.5 sp1 bug fixes if you have installed windows 7

2080265
prepare	execute
i ve written a sql query based on qt assistant and it says that you can use the prepare method instead of execute then you can pass your parameter by the help of two methods called

2080312
unsigned	short
the nsevent class has a keycode property which is defined as unsigned short

2080358
perl	tcl
perl python c php and tcl are reference counted and have mechanisms to destroy an object once its reference count goes to zero which can happen as soon as a variable goes out of scope

2080360
cpython	ironpython
python the standard cpython not variants like jython unladen swallow and ironpython uses reference counting for its objects

2080373
prepare	execute
if a prepare query with placeholders is execute on a dbms that does not support it the preparation of this query is emulated

2080381
disk	ram
on a single dedicated server like core2duo 8gig ram 750gb disk 100mbps

2080436
equals	gethashcode
unfortunately doesn t override equals or gethashcode

2080441
put	get
highlight a shell command or just put your cursor on it call up the man bundle view man page and you ll get the full text of the man page for that command in an html window separate from your script with proper headers and other formatting so that you can actually read it--no rtf symbols no scrolling etc

2080482
implements	extends
this not meant to write your own host you can to implements ioperationinvoker as in this sample extends wcf with custom behaviors

2080486

2080486
userid	usergroups
the manytomany mapping in usergroups mapped by userid and groupid

2080488
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
for ie there s trixie or ie7pro there s built-in opera support for userscripts and for safari there s greasekit and for google-chrome you can enable user-scripts as well

2080493
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter is whitespace spaces tabs or newlines

2080530
postgresql	mysql
i know this has changed much in recent years as mysql postgresql and other more open less costly products get mentioned in management business news articles and used successfully in critcal systems.

2080574
awt	swing
a lightweight framebuffer-based peer implementation for awt and swing

2080580
textarea	textbox
textbox when multi-line renders a textarea that does not contain a maxlength property

2080581
getattr	setattr
what you want is similar to python s getattr setattr functions

2080581
ironruby	ironpython
the outer layer of the dlr which ships w ironpython and ironruby in microsoft.scripting.dll includes a set of hosting apis which includes an objectoperations api that has getmember setmember methods

2080590
children	parent
if maybe the parent class should manage initializing it s children

2080611
inherited	properties
another option would be to use composition instead of inherited such that a student had a person properties instead of deriving from person

2080632
public	protected
see php visibility for details on the difference between private protected and public

2080644
cifs	smb
is it possible in principle but requiring years of reverse-engineering like smb cifs samba

2080711
versioning	upgrade
in opencv 2.0 the equivalent kmeans function takes a cv_32fc1 matrix but opencv 2.0 is quite a substantial upgrade to the old kmeans2 function so i cannot be sure if the cluster centers datatype would still be the same for the opencv 1.1 versioning

2080718
min	max
it works by using min max ordering alternating between min and max heap comparison between consecutive tree levels

2080746
viewdidappear	performselector
if you want to do something after the table view is loaded use your view controller s viewdidappear and if this is too early enqueue a selector using performselector withobject afterdelay

2080764
treeview	tabcontrol
for the simplicity of this example i have removed the treeview mentioned above from the documentview and replaced it with a tabcontrol containing 3 fixed tabs

2080766
hash	md5
i m aware that the password column is just a md5 hash of the user s password but inserting the user with md5 userpasswordhashere doesnt seem to work the user just gets redirected back to the admin interface

2080776
pop-up	dialog
how to avoid the confirm dialog box √¢ ≈ìthe web page you are viewing is trying to close the window√¢ when trying to close ie pop-up

2080780
client-side	server-side
in most web projects we do both client-side and server-side form validation

2080780
client-side	server-side
the client-side and server-side form validation library probably have implemented this for us

2080830
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but the css is clearly abstracted from the html and with this code i have full page columns #footer at the bottom even when more than a page of content is added to either column above it and it behaves the same in the latest versions of firefox safari opera google-chrome and ie8 at any resolution tested down to 800x600

2080863
http-get	http-post
can anyone explain the difference between a http-get and http-post

2080881
datamapper	activerecord
in terms of storing the data for these objects using an orm such as activerecord or datamapper makes this very easy

2080885
submit	submission
it s hard to really describe one as being more or less secure than the other but http post data is not visible in the url and when submission data to a website an http post can usually only be performed as a result of user interaction for example clicking on a submit button

2080885
post	get
in general post should be used for requests that potentially modify state on the server and get should be used for read-only operations

2080887
google-chrome	safari
i don t know if it s available in any stable builds yet but i d suggest downloading latest safari or google-chrome and if it s not there then get a webkit nightly from

2080891
sorting	filtering
i m using nhibernate s icriteria interface to supply paging sorting and filtering for my listviews

2080891
sorting	filtering
but in order to use the paging filtering sorting code i d like to use the icriteria interface

2080898
subtract	add
what follows is my first cut you may want to add to it or subtract from it

2080899
width	margin
here s the scenario in my footer i have 4 box which will be my joomla modules and each module has a width of 220px with a margin of 10 in each side

2080899
width	margin
for example if i only got 2 boxes module in my footer they would divide the 940px width 960px-10px margin and they would be have 460px of width each

2080901
post	get
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

2080901
post	get
unless you re using https both get and post will transfer data in an easily accessible form

2080911
post	get
chances are that either you have a mistake in your code you must post a sample here to get any help with it

2080940
post	get
get requests can easily be foreged see cross-site request forgery by just placing an image on a page while forging post requests is not that easy this is also a reason why you should only allow authorized post requests

2080951
post	get
the http specification differentiates post and get in terms of their intent

2080989
uilabel	nsstring
we have an nsarray with nsstring instances inside as data model there could be potentially thousands of nsstrings in it and we want to show each one in a uilabel using horizontal scrolling

2081019
folder	directory
then add a folder named deploy into the config directory of your rails app

2081088
post	get
thats because the default url directly points to a file in the webserver whereas the the url you ve mentioned is a http post get operation which the application may not be designed to handle

2081228
titlebar	window
as you may know using formborderstyle fixedtoolwindow with the text property of the form an empty string you ll have a window with no titlebar and caption

2081253
multiplying	subtract
the strangest thing about it is that when multiplying samples by whole numbers like 1.0 2.0 or adding or subtract from them the playback sounds as expected

2081287
aggregate-functions	sum
that condensing effect would have occurred also for other aggregate-functions like min sum group_concat and friends see

2081287
filtering	grouping
you can also apply specific grouping using the grouping by construct but if you don t the occurrence of the aggregate function will just bunch up all rows into one row but this bunching-up occurs after applying the where condition so only the filtering rows are aggregated

2081298
getter	setter	public	protected
since the class itself is only visible in the declaring assembly due to the implicit internal access modifier just make the getter on the property public and the setter protected

2081322
post	get
my multiselect takes a list of favouritegenreviewmodel s to select the options in the genreslist it does this using automapper in get action but obviouslly i can t use automapper on the post because it will forget my posted values

2081331
hide	show
here s a blog article which describes it well then you just use css to show hide submenus

2081353
post	get
how can i get the form values while it s method is post

2081367
postgresql	mysql
i am trying to move from a mysql set to a postgresql one and one of the fields that i m having trouble moving is a mysql lblob

2081374
vb6	vba
however before i do this perhaps someone has an link to a vb6 or vba library code example that will capture save a given named application window to a bmp or some type of image file on the hard disk

2081374
vb6	vba
an link to an vb6 or vba solution is just fine here

2081405
min	max
if min max is your band and min min max max then obviously min max can be solved only if min max can be solved

2081434
post	get
i have created a method accepting post in the renderpartials controller but it doesn t get called

2081446
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
also you should be calling it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

2081465
int	boolean
that int would determine which int uilablels and boolean get worked on

2081466
google-chrome	safari
this problem occurs only with safari and google-chrome webkit browsers the server sends the headers correctly

2081491
pop-up	dialog
if you have the permission the post action is something invisible if you don t have the permission then you have to pop-up the facebook dialog and ask for that permission but you have to use also javascript and not only php

2081501
rss	feed
parsing transforming xml data such as an rss feed

2081538
thin	webrick
i ve tested it with webrick and thin

2081561
profiling	instrumentation
this is actually nicely captured by the wikipedia page on profiling which mentions that instrumentation can causes changes in the performance of a program potentially causing inaccurate inaccurate results and heisenbugs due to the observer effect observers affect what they are observing by the mere act of observing it alone

2081592
getter	setter
the myentityfilter class would be a simple class with getter and setter for each parameter of your possible search filter

2081635
put	get
i have put the table in a transaction so i can roll back then print it if the height will fit on curent page but how do i get the table height

2081639
pascal	delphi	g++	gcc
i have only tested turbo pascal and free pascal with fpc objfpc tp delphi model .also the gcc g++ and msvc produce the same result.that is assigment from int which is size of 4 byte on my computer to short int size of 2 will not triggger any compile errors while you could set proper options to make the compilers generate possible lose of data warnings

2081711
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
doing a little investigation with class-dump and friends it looks like apple has a private class called nsautounbinder that takes care of this dirty work for classes such as nsviewcontroller and nswindowcontroller

2081716
cvs	svn
first of all i suggest you forgo cvs and instead go with svn cvs successor or perhaps git

2081735
ia-32	x86
edit some good information about the x86 architecture can be found in volume 3 of intel s ia-32 architectures software developer s manuals

2081737
hash	salt
i d create a salt hash for each user saved in the db

2081743
trac	bugzilla
you have to define it manually or you can also connect to some servers bugzilla jira trac to get the tasks

2081747
implements	extends
threads are often designed in two ways see java tutorials either by extends the thread class or by implements the runnable class

2081761
folder	directory
note that the css files need to go in a css directory within the feature folder 12 template features so.question

2081780
google-chrome	firefox
note that this behavior is not consistent between browsers and between browser versions ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome they all behave more or less differently see cookies in firefox and internet explorer or browsers processes cookies and session state or session cookies sessionstorage and ie8

2081796
post	get
if you still get a weird result post the code or url here so other so member can help you more accurately

2081823
innodb	myisam
what other tricks can be used in order to speed up conversion of a production database table from myisam to innodb

2081901
children	parent
ok so lets say i have 3 jpanels - 1 parent and 2 children

2081925
post	put
i think you re mixing your verbs - put is for putting a file post is for posting variables although you can post a file

2081967
for-loop	loops
the prohibition on modifying what pascal calls the control variable of a for-loop combined with the lack of a break statement means that it is possible to know how many times loops body is executed without studying its contents

2081967
for-loop	loops
clearly we never need to be able to modify the control variable in a for-loop because we can always rewrite using a while loops

2082023
hex	binary
right now araxis treats the jars like files and i just see a lot of binary hex stuff

2082030
width	height
only resize images with width or height larger than 400 px

2082030
width	height
any other approaches to make the larger ones fit into the screen without affecting the smaller ones would be appreciated cause if i just use width 400px and height 400px all images will be at that size and the proportion will be wrong

2082055
public	protected
like a private or public or protected variable

2082059
disk	ram
django middleware looked promising but on a close inspection it appears that by the time a request hits the middleware it s already too late and the entire upload had been buffered somewhere typically ram or disk

2082075
width	height
anyway in javascript you can implement your logic depending on the width and height properties of the image object

2082120
post	put
typically there are two conventions you can use to mimic put delete via post

2082120
post	put
_method put which overrides post

2082130
for-loop	loops
it s probably safe to conclude that pascal was designed to prevent modification of a for-loop index inside loops

2082140
client-side	server-side
it is an ide that enables you to easily write the markup html xhtml the formatting css the client-side code ie animations etc through javascript and it is really well integrated with common javascript frameworks as well as server-side code in a very professional way php ruby and many others

2082169
getter	setter
if i understand you correctly and you want a way to key dictionaries in a non case-sensitive fashion one way would be to subclass dict and overload the setter getter

2082197
width	height
btw set width and height to 0 to just use the window you are setting the device too s size .

2082198
regasm	tlbexp
to create the com-callable wrapper use the tlbexp and or regasm command-line utilities

2082256
bazaar	git
maybe you need source control system like git or bazaar - they have local branches each dev may have his own and allow sync ing code with centralized repositories

2082262
ssl	https
note that what i want to do is -not- merely to have an encrypted connection using ssl https

2082279
folder	directory
we are following the zend modular directory structure currently and we have our models folder in each module directory with a base directory like this

2082337
freemarker	velocity
with googling i ve found freemarker velocity and tiles which seem to be very famous

2082355
freemarker	velocity
freemarker started where velocity left off

2082405
rss	feed
in addition to all of the other answers it s also used for rss feed

2082431
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and ie but why doesn t the right hand side render in google-chrome

2082527
ethernet	wireless
i was able to easily complete the task but when i tested my application over my wireless connection and tried communication with my desktop computer ethernet on the same network i found some odd behavior

2082541
freemarker	velocity
i have worked with both velocity and freemarker along with spring mvc

2082543
move	drag
1 how do you move items in a listview using drag drop

2082570
inline	inlining
the compiler will make up its own mind whether to inline a function or not - it might take the programmer suggests inlining this into account but on most compilers simply declaring a function as inline doesn t guarantee it will be

2082587
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you have an nsdate you can use the current nscalendar to retrieve that date s nsdatecomponents

2082587
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar	nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter	nsdateformatter	nscalendar
then use the nscalendar to convert both the nsdatecomponents back to their respective nsdate objects after which you can use an nsdateformatter to create your string representation

2082598
submit	submission
you should be actively checking for duplicates at the ui level and warning the user that s he is about to submit a duplicate entry and disabling the submission if duplicate keys are not allowed

google-chrome	safari
it also isn t supported properly in google-chrome and safari

2082900

firefox	safari
so i have a signup form on the top of my website and in safari firefox it looks perfect but on ie7 for some reason it is pushed down so it does not look right

2082994
ubuntu	debian
i know there are ppa-repositories for ubuntu and maybe for debian also

2082994
bazaar	git
neither mercurial nor bazaar or git does encoding conversion like subversion see characterencodingonwindows

2082994
bazaar	git
mercurial is not designed for this purpose and i don t think bazaar or git would be more fun on this

2083000
post	get
once the record has been successfully saved i typically use the post redirect get method to avoid the common multiple submit issue

2083008
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
look up user agent strings for ie firefox opera safari and you ll start to see what s going on

2083290
int	double
with int i would just use modulo but what would be the correct best way to do it with double

2083290

if you want the min max from all the cardeventtime values

2083302

2083471
actionscript	haxe
if you really have your heart set on actionscript javascript-style syntax then you should look into haxe

2083487
codeigniter	kohana
kohana as well as codeigniter and most of other frameworks relies on the front-controller pattern index.php so unless you deeply hacked it i cannot see how you don t need to rely on it

2083517
range	max
for example with cd quality audio your highest possible absolute value for a sample is 32767 fudging this to make the example easier the real range is -32768 to 32767 but treating 32767 as your max makes things much simpler here so if you scanned through and the highest absolute value you found was 18000 than your amplification factor will be 1.8203888.

2083520
post	get
i have an ajax request that creates a post and upon successful post i want to get html to inject back into the dom

2083665
children	parent
pic2 would check its children if any if it finds the target it goes there otherwise it calls its parent gallery s checkchildren passing itself to the parent won t bother checking it and passing itself to the parent in an array so the parent knows what path has been taken

2083665
children	parent
the parent checks its children if any of them is the target if it is it adds itself and the child to the path array and that s the path

2083665
children	parent
if none of the children find the target gallery calls its parent home page s check children passing itself and the adding itself to the array of the path

2083665
children	parent
alternatively you can choose not to pass the path as an array but instead just transition to the parent page if none of the children or the children s children match cause you re sure the target is not under this page

2083832
g++	gcc
compare gcc -v file.cpp gcc can work with c++ files and g++ -v file.cpp to see the difference in linker commands that often causes the first to fail for example

2083832
g++	gcc
you are better off not using the linker directly because it is much simpler to use either gcc or g++ and give them specific linker options if required

2083891
post	put
i m looking for site similar to that allows one to put in c# code snippet and it formats the html to post into your blog with a css file

2084403
put	get
case in point while we re not allowed to code new functionality without funding we can as a lab-type environment put together a poc proof-of-concept on our own dime and then find that it s remarkably easy to get that to a production-quality solution

2084434
post	put	post	get	put	get
this error means you are trying to post put delete to a path that only accepts get requests

2084473

2084512
springsource	grails
about spring roo i ve read previous answers like spring roo vs wicket and spring and other things over the internet but i m still not convinced maybe i don t get it i m not sure of its maturity and more important i m really wondering what springsource is doing with grails and roo no grails vs roo - why springsource is pushing two very similar technologies

there is also a good comparison wicket -- jsf in terms of performance

2084989
google-chrome	firefox
your code works correctly for me in firefox 3.5.5 and google-chrome 4.0.249.64

2084990
public	protected
i would say that most often it s not good to change public members to private or protected members in the derived class because this will violate the substitution principle you know a base class has some functions and if you cast to a derived class then you expect those functions to be callable too because the derived class is-a base

2085023
width	height
my guess is i would need to create a containerview with the total size width height for the top center and bottom imageviews and add the containerview to the cell but this didn t seem to work

2085031
integer	unsigned
according to c language specification the common part of the range of the corresponding signed and unsigned integer type shall have identical representation implying according to the footnote 31 interchangeability as arguments to functions

in my opinion this does not violate the srp principles

2085155
ienumerable	ilist
i would as you mention however change from ilist to ienumerable on my collections and make the setters private for the collections

2085158
ant	maven
why you should use the maven ant tasks instead of maven or ivy

2085174

if you find you have a lot of parameters you may want to create a type representing all the related ones - that type may have a bunch of getter setter

2085200
hide	show
all i m trying to do is add a speed to jquery s hide and show functions

2085200

configure	libtool
note that you can easily configure libtool not to build any static library with in your configure.ac by default

2085319
pop-up	dialog
i have tried window.close method but it doesnt work as the context is not the pop-up window but the open save dialog box

2085403
getter	setter
if you re in the same object you could use a normal member variable if you re calling between objects you could just provide getter and setter for that variable

2085478
ioexception	printwriter
a second note instances of printwriter never throw ioexception you should test for errors calling checkerror which also flushes the stream

2085516
versioning	upgrade
i may not be able to just update upgrade the perl versioning easily due to policies in place in my organisation that s just the way it is i don t want a side discussion on this

2085540
accessor	properties
secondly although you have declared a matching properties nonatomic retain tabbarcontroller and implemented via sysnthesize you are not actually using the properties accessor and its corresponding retain release behaviour during assignment to do this you need to use self.tabbarcontroller rather than just tabbarcontroller which will refer to the class variable not the properties

2085544
jboss	glassfish
if this is indeed the behaviour how do heavyweight enterprise engines like jboss and glassfish maintain a consistantly high tps rate

2085572
getter	setter
in the withevents case will in fact call a property setter and will fetch the value from a property getter while in the second case there will be no property created for the value but the code will access the field directly

2085626
dlsym	dlopen
the closest would be through dynamic loading of library dll such as with dlopen dlsym on linux

2085641
dlsym	dlopen
library binding or dynamic linking as it s called is done via dlopen and dlsym on nix and loadlibrary and getprocaddress on windows

2085646
dlsym	dlopen
many systems will provide deferred binding as a feature of the linker loader and you can also use explicit calls such as dlopen to open a shared library and dlsym to get the address of a symbol within that library so you can access it or call it

2085691
width	height
there are issues with page layout like width height scrollbars etc

2085699
put	get
because it s a uiimageview i have to put layer after blocky otherwise i get the following error

put	get
my problem is when i m sorting it i don t know where to put the .layer so i get the same problem because uiimageviews can t deal with keys on there own

2085782
maven	pom.xml
the idea is that we should keep as much as possible information in ide independent form like maven pom.xml files and so on

2085819
width	height
i keep finding plenty of info on height based expansions but not much on width

2085820

i m not quite sure what getter and setter are in your code sample but i don t think that s relevant.

2086097
width	height
background i need to have an inline element to which i can apply width and height via css

2086132
vbscript	jscript
so if you launch your barcode reader and capture its output from a script vbscript jscript you should be able to use sendkeys to send that output to the active window

height and width are settable

2086143
google-chrome	safari
this should be across the common browsers however i have not been able to test safari or google-chrome using it

get rid of code resetting the filename to the post one the second line in your original function and you should be fine

2086356
sunos	aix
on sunos the latter path is on aix it is and on hp-ux it s

2086361
hash	salt
salt hash are one of the better ways of dealing with storing passwords you re not really storing it as such

2086372
stdout	stderr
there is no way to keep output on both stderr and stdout synchronized after it is buffered and redirected

2086376
getter	setter
give the csv class getter and setter for a cvs file parameter and a dao parameter and instantiate it using spring di

2086376
getter	setter
the factory class should have a getter setter for the dao object and be instantiated using spring di

2086397
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox doesn t currently bounce the downloads box in the dock when a download is finished like safari google-chrome and camino do

2086670
rel	attr
i tried to just add attr rel to the string but that didnt work

2086683
concave	convex
i don t know the tool and data structure you re working on but for example in matlab when you intersect n polygons the result is a new polygon of intersection and if you can easily find the closest point on the surface of a single convex object then if the intersection polygon is concave you can triangulate for getting your convex objects

2086684
twitter	bit.ly
i have twitter status updates showing on the sidebar of the blog which often has the bit.ly or ow.ly links as well

if however you ve installed postgresql some other way -- fink ports homebrew -- then you ll need to be careful and make sure you ve got the development files install

2087050
libjpeg	libpng
at the very least you ll need to install libjpeg and libpng

2087050
libjpeg	libpng
if not the easiest thing is probably to download and install them from source libpng libjpeg

2087074
getter	setter
i have a fully implemented dao with entity beans containing only getter and setter method

2087074
implements	extends
i want to know how will i implements the publish-subscribe pattern also known as observer pattern such that i don t have to extends my current dao architecture

2087138
sequence	permutation
you want to generate a sequence of numbers that together form a permutation of s 1 ... max

2087203
getter	setter
private member variables are to be accessed via public setter and getter

2087207
post	get
it doesn t matter if you received the data through get or post or if it was encrypted

2087261
rss	feed
where titles is an array of titles read in from the rss feed the idea being that if i get the index for the title i can apply that to another array i ve read from said feed

2087322
put	get
if i have a user put that into their browser they get an access denied error when it is not working

2087332
int	boolean
you can use a boolean or an int for each period and store them in an array

2087344
tabcontrol	tabitem
in this case the relative source is the background property of the tabcontrol that hosts the tabitem

2087344
tabcontrol	tabitem
as a result when you set the background property of the tabcontrol the color will flow through to the tab area of all of the tabitem controls hosted in the tabcontrol

2087347
curb	libcurl	hpricot	curb
ruby script using libcurl curb to fetch the request and hpricot to parse the request

2087362
post	get
i know that is is not strictly a programming question but i can t think of a better place to survey what real developers do and possible get folks to post their policies and even sample headers omitting company names etc.

2087366
webrat	cucumber
webrat cucumber already do this for you so you can just put that in a second project and run the tests that way all you ll have to do is override the host so instead of localhost you ll be using your domain

2087401
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you re using ie 8 firefox 3.5 and higher safari 4 google-chrome then you ll be aware that these browsers support html 5

2087427
profiling	instrumentation
a useful technique is to run the code under a good sampling profiling zoom under linux or instrumentation with time profiling instrumentation under mac os x

2087455
min	max
your compiler might add new features like special min and max operators

2087464
octal	decimal
in addition to x you can use d o u and u for decimal octal up to four and up to eight hexadecimal characters

installation	upgrade
i d like to upgrade the hibernate installation that ships as part of jboss 5.1.x to hibernate 3.5.x

2087512
ubuntu	debian
for debian or ubuntu you can use

2087546
uptime	reboot
a 30minute reboot per quarter fits well within 99.9 uptime sla s

2087556
udp	tcp
the dnsserviceregister and udp part make me think the communication is happening over tcp ip

2087577
move	drag
the trouble is getting these boxes to drag again either inside its own container or another one and without cloning itself it needs to move

2087588
portrait	landscape
my application works on both - landscape and portrait mode - but since it s opengl view i handle rotation of the view by myself so to display uiactionsheet i use empty view and add actionsheet to it

2087593
put	get
but i get a error c2108 subscript is not of integral type when i try to put something in it like

2087593
int	double
if i interpreted the error right then i have to replace my double with an int

2087596
free	malloc
returning an array also means the memory clean up has to be done with a function compatible with the function you used to allocate the block your implementation will likely use malloc and not new to allocate this block so that the caller can later use free on the block

2087635
submit	submission
after one submission every form has two functions bound to the submit event after two submission three and so on

2087692
move	drag
what i m trying to say is that if you were to drag the green over the ones after in the left column will move to fill the empty space

2087747
jsf	seam
it can be triggered by jsf page i am not sure whether you must enable seam transaction management in order to get this feature

2087754
put	get
but also put a #define class struct to get implicit private class data public too

2087778
google-chrome	firefox
haven t tested it with firefox but assume google-chrome compatibiity

2087789
post	get
if you get to a query that does not make sense seems to complicated or such you can post it here and get feed back -- having real code always gets better comments

2087826
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
is there any way i can detect which mode is being used from a httpwebrequest servicepoint other in c# code

2087849
hash	salt
use an n-bit serial number r combined with an m-bit hash h of the concatenated pair r s where s is some secret salt s which you do not publish

2087849
hash	md5
if you like algorithms like md5 or sha but the bit count is too high then just take the m least significant bits of a standard hash algorithm

2087849
hash	salt
if you feel paranoid pick two salt values sprefix and ssuffix and calculate the hash of the concatenated triple sprefix r ssuffix

2087870
inline	inlining
what i want to find out is how much time the inline functions are taking preferably without disabling optimization or inlining in my build options

2087898
cpu	affinity
develop a few macros using the high performance timing mechanism of your cpu x86 -- the routines that don t rely on system calls and bind a single thread running your core loop to a specific cpu set the affinity

2087929
udp	tcp
i want to write a library c c++ which would be able to monitor network traffic tcp and udp as well as limit bandwidth to a particular network area apply different traffic shaping rules to different network zones

2087943
inline	inlining
btw inlining is of significant value only if the routines being inline are small and don t call functions themselves and if the lines where they are being called are active enough of the time to be significant

2087951
profiler	vtune
you can use a more powerful profiler such as intel s vtune which can give you assembly line level of performance detail

2087972
int	chars
obviously the console.writeline int must internally convert the int to a string of decimal chars but this is not obvious from the il.

2087972
tostring	string.format
using jon s example with string.format the first case w o the tostring the value is boxed..

2088047
post	get
if i get that working i ll post it

2088066
versioning	upgrade
for anyone who have happened to meet with this similar issue as mine it s either you upgrade the latest jave 2 sdk and tomcat or downgrade your script to the old versioning compatible

2088089
ienumerable	iequalitycomparer
multiple linq queries would be run against the ienumerable to filter out the options we wanted including a .distinct iequalitycomparer and .sort x x rowname

2088089
google-chrome	firefox
now if you ll watch the following video you ll see that the code above works very well in both firefox and google-chrome and yet it blows in ms ie

2088094
put	get
to get specific start with the following visualization imagine the triangle flat in the x-y plane and it s normal along the z-axis and put a sphere here that touches all corners of the triangle with everything centered at the origin

2088152
profiling	debugging
to debugging issues like this you can attach a profiling ie8 has one and see which function is taking a long time to execute

2088172
gif	png
png gif or jpeg graphic as a different file format for example

2088172
gif	png
emf a png a gif or a jpeg graphic is inserted into a word document

2088172
gif	png
graphics are saved in the applicable emf png gif or jpeg

2088187
filtering	grouping
my application collects business data from various sources aggregates it grouping and filtering and needs to display it

2088194
cos	sin
i have the following code doing sin cos function using a pre-calculated memory table

2088194
cos	sin
in the following example the table has 1024 128 items covering all the sin cos values from 0 to 2pi

2088194
cos	sin
i know i can use sin cos symmetry and hold only 1 4 of the values but them i will have more ifs when computing the value

2088206
agile	sprint
option 3 seems to be against the spirit of agile - you are putting the next sprint at risk by not allowing the results of the prior one to guide the next iteration of development

2088213
vbscript	jscript
jscript has a special function in it for converting vbscript arrays to jscript arrays as they are stored differently which is the vbarray function in your code

2088225
cos	sin
when you need both always compute the sin and cos of a value at the same time

2088269
postgresql	mysql
it s completely annotation based and currently supports mysql postgresql derby and h2

2088276
hide	show
you also need to use the right selector in your hide show calls namely it needs to include the # before the div s id in the selector

2088360
put	get
if i put a break point at the showdialog line i get a fatalexecutionengineerror

2088405
int	chars
main difference is instance variables get default values like int value get zero chars gets null but not the local variables

2088438
cos	sin
one thing you could try would be to use the fact that cos x sin x + pi 2

2088439
public	protected
if you have an access specifier public private or protected between members even the guarantee about order is lost

2088458
google-chrome	safari
however on safari and google-chrome the updateprogress control remains visible after the postback completes

2088470
initializer	class-method
static class-method can also be passed without initializer an object of that class by passing the class name instead of an object at index 0

2088476
dlsym	dlopen
have it open the real implementation with dlopen and link with dlsym

2088482
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when you leave the page in firefox or safari but not google-chrome it keeps the old page still loaded just hidden

2088482
firefox	safari
unfortunately it seems safari also doesn t implement the onpagehide function firefox introduced to go with the bfcache so you can t catch that

2088482
firefox	safari
firefox and safari take this as a signal that the page wants to be really unloaded on leaving

2088519
hash	md5
i need to create a hash key on my tables for uniqueness and someone mentioned to me about md5

2088528
public	protected
the generate javadoc command gives me an option to create javadoc for members with visibility private package protected public

2088530
mapquest	directions
mapquest open offers an open directions service and an open guidance service

2088596
mvp	presenter
i just wrote a blog entry on the mvp model view presenter - passive view pattern

2088602
min	max
an example for this are the unfortunate min and max defines somewhere in windows.h

2088602
min	max
okay there are ways to turn off min max macros in windows.h but it s still poor design

2088631
width	height
my first attempt at this was to create a control called a group which had width height 0

2088666
httphandler	httpmodule
after thinking about what was going on and realizing that issue probably had something to do with nhibernate i refined some of my google searches and found a post httpmodule and httphandler sections in iis 7 web.config files

2088764
width	height
you d need to have a container with overflow hidden and a set height and width with position relative set

2088779
width	height
it only has to do with the content of that tag being limited to the width and height which you haven t even specified

2088779
width	height
if the content overflows that width and height scrollbars are inserted on the container

2088834
hide	show
i have an ibaction on this button and i would like to click on it to show hide the uitoolbar in photoviewcontroller

2088837
post	get
so when the user post the form i get a parent instance with the id and field2 filled i think the mvc framework dont matter here all behaves mostly the same when binding

2088849
int	double
if you pass in a nullable int and a non-nullable double expression bad things happen

2088926
put	get
the problem is that the regex is matching as early as possible - one solution is to put a greedy quantifier at the start so that it gobbles up all the possible early matches and you get the last one

2088959
stdout	stderr
note also that you have to consume stdout and stderr concurrently otherwise your spawned process will block waiting for your process to consume the output or errors

2089023
easymock	jmock
such frameworks exist for java - check out jmock or easymock for example

2089037
hide	show
what i ve done in these situations is used the xaml hierarchy to determine which element to show hide

2089041
put	get
or to put it another way what else could i add to my class library project to get this feature working

2089105
int	chars
chars int

2089106
for-loop	arrays
they re collections in natural language terms and you can use the enhanced for-loop over them - but if you want to use an arrays within the collection api you ll need something like arrays.aslist which wraps an arrays with the interface

2089174
awt	swing	swt	swing
so unless you have a specific requirement to do work in awt i would recommend you to check out the modern replacements swing or swt - much more comfortable flexible customizable and predictable in their behaviour than awt

2089176
public	protected
a derived class can explicitly call the base class implementation if access permissions allow it by using a fully-scoped name by calling a f in your example - if a f were public or protected

2089226
int	chars
even though memory on an x86 is byte-addressable so you can have a chars pointer to any address if you have for example an pointer to a 4-byte int that pointer must be aligned

2089242
inherited	properties
if you really want to inherited from member you ll have to copy all the properties off the passed argument to the new instance manually

2089246
maven	pom.xml
though when maven release is performed the pom.xml is allowed to be released with snapshot version in dependencymanagement

2089265
mouseup	mousedown
i m trying to enable a double click event on a flex control without disabling the default mouseup mousedown behaviors

2089272
hide	show
you can use datatriggers in your datatemplate.triggers collection to show and hide elements depending on the content data

2089277
jobs	cron
i have written a set of rake tasks which are kicked off by whenever-generated cron jobs

2089295
put	get
as you already have an ibook g4 you could as well put xcode on it you can get the mac sdks - even for powerpc - for free from apple

2089357
for-loop	loops
the second for-loop shows that first for loops correctly sets to i for i in

2089364
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

2089379
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
please don t use alert install firebug into your firefox or enable the javascript console in google-chrome or safari

2089395
many-to-many	one-to-many
i found a lot of examples that show only how to create one-to-many or many-to-many

2089411
hash	md5
ideally i d make checker swf that would load app swf and called its function that would return something from the database a naive service would count rows in table and hash it with md5 but security constrains won t let me call loaded swf s function

2089428
hash	salt
is there a way to identify a hash s type and whether it has been salt

2089435
hash	salt
obviously however if you have access to the program generating the hash and you can provide input then you can compare with some result you also calculate assuming you know the salt

2089438
verilog	vhdl
if you re looking for more examples of concurrent languages there is myhdl and the xmos xc which are other attempts away from the traditional verilog and vhdl

2089459
int	double
if we knew the declaration of arrayofnumbers we would further know its type an int or a double

2089463
daemon	cron
a cron daemon fulfills this purpose on unix-derived platforms

2089533
hash	md5
md5 and sha-1 account for the vast majority of hash you ll find in the wild

2089570
put	get
you can usually get away with fairly simple parsing most programmers use a similar style - for example it s uncommon for someone to put blank lines between the class fred and its open brace

2089740
unix	bsd
if you were using bsd unix you would link with the standalone library

2089755
inherited	properties
sessionid is an inherited properties from an interface

2089775
ati	nvidia
another big plus to this approach is that nvidia ati can release a newer more efficient version of their drivers and you automatically benefit with no effort on your part

2089812
union	distinct
you d have to probably do a select distinct on the data set produced by the union

2089824
versioning	upgrade
has this problem and i cannot find a way to upgrade to a versioning of ftp7.5 that does not have this issue

2089852
pop-up	dialog
a simple solution would be to pop-up a dialog asking the user to restart the program in the correct space but for the life of me i can t figure out how to tell which space my target is in either through nsworkspace or the accessibility api so that i can compare it to the space that i m in

2089872
floating	right-align
| left-aligned right-align | in one cell then you can use floating divs inside the td tag

2089907
union	distinct
if you just use union without the all it will filter duplicates and therefore be equivalent to a full join but the query will also be a lot more expensive because it has to perform a distinct sort

2089974
post	get
webinvoke with method get is the same as webget but since some of my methods are post i use all webinvoke for consistency

2090011
oncreate	setcontentview
as i mentioned in a comment your view hierarchy should be working after your call to setcontentview early in oncreate

2090066
hex	binary
i would suggest that to be absolutely sure that your encoded binary is cookie-compatible then basic hex encoding is safest in java

2090107
notepad++	jedit
you should use notepad notepad++ jedit and whatever you want but if you want to be productive a serious ide is the best choice and adobe win by far

2090108
folder	directory
when you install moss 2007 using the default install locations the moss 2007 log files will not reside in the √¢ ≈ìprogram files microsoft office servers 12.0 logs√¢ directory folder as expected

2090108
folder	directory
they will reside in the wss directory folder √¢ ≈ìprogram files common files microsoft shared web server extensions 12 logs√¢

2090116
decoder	encoder
base64 wins because it s so common that i don t have to ever worry about rolling my own encoder decoder

2090123
implements	extends
i ve implements a hibernate save-update listener by extends org.hibernate.event.def.defaultsaveorupdateeventlistener.defaultsaveorupdateeventlistener and overriding onsaveorupdate saveorupdateevent e

2090134
superclass	subclassing
create a field for the superclass adjust methods to delegate to the superclass and remove the subclassing

2090137
union	distinct
if you have duplicates and need to factor them out you can use a union instead but that does an implicit distinct aggregation so will be much less performant

2090160
rss	feed
having had a very quick look at the cc docs i imagine if you were writing your own cruise control dashboard you could consume the rss feed of build results parse in all the date times and success failure states up to your threshold then sum up the totals

2090161
sorting	grouping
creating string userattribute or key value columns sounds appealing at first but it leads to the inner-platform effect where you end up having to re-implement foreign keys data types constraints transactions validation sorting grouping calculations et al

2090171
hash	salt
at the very least concatenate some salt such as the username plus some constant string for your site and store the sha-1 hash of it

2090177
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller aviewcontroller added to a uinavigationcontroller which in turn is added to a uitabbarcontroller

2090185
width	margin
make the left and right columns fixed on the same width margin and padding so the center column has the right offset from the left and right

2090234
put	get
i am not sure what to put with the get and end get

2090250
hide	show
so rather than just reading logs directly consider using a log-viewing application that can show and hide details

2090276
lisp	scheme
guy steele pointed out that its the same thing in lisp and scheme

2090286
nsurlcache	uiwebview
uiwebview asks the nsurlcache for assets if you load it up with a request but when loading with html or data it bypasses the cache completely and requests it directly from the remote server

2090287
rdf	owl
in order to accomplish this you have to use the owl rl profile of owl full which treats all things in owl equally thus allowing the use of an inference over rdf type

2090349
punctuation	words
they re actually mostly concerned with punctuation characters and do not try to keep words unbroken at all

2090386
inherited	subclassing
i can think of a couple of hackish ways of doing this inherited from a resource subclassing that handles the logging logic but it just seems like this is something that should be built-in to the framework

2090414
put	get
the solution is to put the alert in your callback function which doesn t get executed until after the response has been received

2090426
setinterval	settimeout
regular javascript animations using settimeout setinterval don t work very well in mobile safari

2090460
int	chars
the safe way to extract a 32-bit int from an arbitrary memory location is to declare a temporary 32-bit int and perform a copy to it treating the source memory as a raw chars array

2090468
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
you don t use a manifest.mf to put a jar in the classpath of a war file

2090478
post	get
at any rate you should post what you get

2090498
division	modulo
modulo returns the remainder of a division

2090500
division	modulo
the modulo gives the remainder of the division so number 6 is the amount left over when dividing by 6

2090569
dictionary	map
use tuple or array instead of dictionary map - tuples and arrays keep their sequence but do not allow using keys dictionary do not keep their sequence but allow using keys

2090597
children	parent
when dealing with foreign keys populate the table the foreign key references first - start with the parent and then tackle its children

2090628
profiling	benchmarking
you need to be in release mode to profiling benchmarking or modify your build settings

2090636
getter	setter
this is most commonly done through setter and getter methods

2090647
solaris	aix
i have a scenarios where i have a java agent that runs on a couple of platforms specifically windows solaris aix

2090654
folder	directory
i ask because looking around the internet i see wide variation for instance where the web-inf and meta-inf folder are..if there is a war directory etc.

2090665
post	get
in your magento index.php file and post here any error messages you get when trying to access magento connect

when adding subviews to a uiview what s the difference between the methods addview and insertview atindex

2090765
tripledes	aes
i ve found plenty of examples how to do encryption in c# and a couple for android but i m particularly looking for a way to handle encrypting using something like aes tripledes etc. from android and eventually wind up being decrypted in c#

2090777
firefox	safari
seems only in firefox 3.5.7 mac - works as expected in safari

2090828
folder	directory
you can either pull from the network location or copy the entire directory containing .git folder accross to the other computer

2090829
post	get
now without jquery submitting this form should get you could change it to post if you like on the current page

2090845
width	height
i ve go the code working except that my components that used to fill the entire space using width 100 and height 100 appear to display just using the default sizes

2090857
width	height
i might be missing what you are asking but all you should need to do is just set a height and width on both the embed and object tags to be the height and width you want

2090857
width	height
the following uses a width of 50px and a height of 40px but remember to omit the px when declaring it

2090898
firefox	safari
everything is working great in firefox safari ie6 well-i am getting a horizontal scrollbar there in ie6 for some reason and ie8

2090905
chgrp	chmod
if you re hell-bent-for-leather on doing it what chacha102 said plus you ll also want to chgrp it and chmod it so that only the internet user and your user can view it

2090928
gif	png
so the condition is if a string in post_content ends in jpeg jpg gif or png replace

2090941
sphinx4	htk
i want to use either sphinx4 or the htk toolkit to build me a speech recognition application that aims to estimate ones age from voice

2090965
gif	png
if you want to limit the updates to rows containing jpeg jpg gif and or png add

2090980
kerberos	ntlm
- internal users should be authenticated using ntlm with the ad to ensure a kerberos encrypted login while forms would be usable for the adam instance

2090981
folder	directory
you should use the applicationdata directory for your app data in delphi you can find this folder programatically using the shell api function shgetspecialfolderlocation

2090989
width	height
the web site was designed to be fluid width height so it would fill the screen on any resolution so because of that i m using a lot of percentages for height and widths

2090989
width	height
i ve set the height to 100 and width to auto

2090989
width	height
i expect it to scale the image to 100 the height of the div and then adjust the width accordingly

2091042
verilog	hdl	verilog	vhdl
as has been pointed out there are free hdl simulation tools like icarus verilog and ghdl a vhdl frontend for gcc

2091042
altera	xilinx
xilinx and altera have free web editions of such tools but they are definitely not open source

2091064
ubuntu	debian	komodo	aptana
stay in windows and use aptana or komodo with another git client or switch to debian ubuntu and use the tools there

2091073
webkit	gecko
webkit and gecko are two different rendering engines that browsers implement to display html

2091073
google-chrome	safari

2091081
google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
mozilla uses the gecko engine google-chrome and safari use webkit

2091081
webkit	gecko
as would the explanation of gecko and webkit

2091108
webkit	gecko
while webkit tends to have a speed advantage gecko has been making great strides in this area since version 3.0 as well as minimizing resource requirements tending to require less memory over time than webkit depending on implementation

2091118
notepad++	sublimetext
honestly i tend to do classic asp in a straight text editor like sublimetext or notepad++

2091144
dpkt	scapy
i think they are not at the same level if you want to manipulate the raw package take a look at dpkt scapy

i have put web.xml in which httpmethodfilter is used for converting post methods to put and delete but not working with urlrewrite

post	get
the post would be to submit a query and in response you d get a queryid something relating to what you ve submitted

2091259

his solution deselect all other items when an item is clicked so you have to ctrl-click items to multi-select

2091289
disk	ram
suppose you have some of the data you need in ram while the rest is on disk still

2091304
fseek	ftell
normal file related functions like fseek ftell etc in windows msvc6 can handle files only upto 2gb as per my current understanding please correct me if i am wrong

2091324
fseek	ftell
the ftell fseek functions are using 32 bit integers so you won t be able to handle file bigger than 4gb

2091324
filesystems	ntfs
last word you have be aware that some filesystems limit the maximum filesize the fat32 won t handle file bigger than 4 gb by design ntfs would handle any size but the api generally is made for 4 gb or less big file

2091344
filesystems	ntfs
so the size of the file you can handle will depend on which filesystems the hard disk has been formatted with and which operating system you are using although you are almost certainly using an operating system which can handle the upper limits of ntfs windows 2000 or above

2091425
queue	fifo
you can use a queue which will ensure fifo for all your data packets

2091434

hide	show
you may have 3 dialogs i defined an additional logged out dialog here for each state connect the state entered signal to dialog show slot and connect state exited signal to dialog hide slot

2091502
hide	show
in this way you don t need to worry about when to show hide a dialog just focus on the transition of states

2091502
hide	show
after log in information has been verfied a loggedin signal emitted and the state of the machine will change from guest to logged in so the loginwindow will be hide when guest state exited and your taskswindow will show up when logged in state entered

2091516
uitableview	reloaddata
you should use reloaddata on your uitableview

2091524
outputstream	inputstream
assuming that you are using a jdbc driver that implements the standard jdbc blob interface not all do you can also connect a inputstream or outputstream to a blob using the getbinarystream and setbinarystream methods 1 and you can also get and set the bytes directly

2091527
outputstream	inputstream
there is no conversion between inputstream outputstream and the bytes they are working with

2091540
outputstream	inputstream
there are many types of inputstream and outputstream for different data sources and destinations

2091540
outputstream	inputstream
lastly you would write the inputstream to the outputstream

2091548
strlen	strcpy
so you are copying bytes to charfilename you probably want strlen charfilenameandpath +1 bytes instead or you can use strcpy

you can definitely use a cron daemon on unix linux to schedule the jobs if that is what you have available

2094161
postgresql	mysql
easiest is some sort of database backend pick your poison based on your needs reqs budget - from berkleydb sqlite on simlistic end to mysql postgresql on free side to sybase oracle for real world stuff

this seems to be a common error when installing using addon nunit or moq but i have yet to find a link that has a solution

2094525
children	parent
if you have potentially many children per parent then you might want to limit by the date to start with for example include criteria in the left outer join and subquery such that it limits to only children within 3 days of my_date as an example

2094538
post	put
i would let the button post to an .ashx-handler here s a tutorial on those and put the code you have written in your post with some small changes perhaps in the processrequest method in the handler

children	parent
i am using jquery to get a count of children elements within a parent div

2095227
hash	md5
the program takes the strings and outputs them to a time-datestamped text file but only if the password matches the set md5 hash

2095250
jquery	scriptaculous
see jquery and scriptaculous

2095292
equals	gethashcode
note that if the city class doesn t implement equals and gethashcode correctly this will return duplicates

2095339
inherited	properties
my viewmodel inherited from inotifypropertychanged and i am raising the propertychanged event correctly since i use the same process for other bound properties in the viewmodel and they work as expected

2095367
ant	maven
so i tried to explain the maven ant tasks in detail with examples here

2095367
ant	maven
why you should use the maven ant tasks instead of maven or ivy

2095396
ant	maven
here s my take use the best of both worlds maven just for dependencies and ant for your day-to-day build heavy-lifting

2095396
ant	maven
why you should use the maven ant tasks instead of maven or ivy

opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome support are coming soon

2095522
google-chrome	firefox	width	margin
google-chrome seems to measure an elements width from the inside of the margin including padding but firefox and ie measure the boxes width where the border is not including padding but inside margin

2095522
google-chrome	firefox
measuring the elements width from the border makes sense to me and is also helpful when coding because turning on borders will let you see the width of the element very easily but my question is what the css specification says is the correct way to measure the width of an element and if google-chrome is wrong or ie and firefox are

2095563
nginx	lighttpd
according to these benchmarks it also uses less memory and cpu resources than nginx or lighttpd while running faster

2095583
subscript	superscript
how can i set some text as subscript superscript in formattedtext in wpf

2095650
width	margin
the w3c css 2.1 box model specification says that the width of an element does not include margin border or padding

2095650
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in fact by specifying the css width or height properties you specify the space available to the content of a box that is called content area in the specification which does not include padding margin or border

2095661
hash	md5
another obvious answer is to take the same concatenated string and take the md5 hash - quick and easy but runs the granted small risk of collision

2095670
post	get
disabling ini_set typically is good security practice since you could easily have an eval statement in your php code that uses a get post session variable as input for example

2095677
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
i ve got existing experience with svn cvs git perforce and pvcs but have always worked with individual dev environments

2095684
draggable	droppable
i think you should implement this on the droppable instead of the draggable

2095688
inherited	properties
to determine if a given control on a window or user object is a com visual control if you select it the title on the properties pane will say something like ole_1 inherited from olecustomcontrol

2095691
draggable	droppable
i can do it from a draggable into a droppable area by using the following in a function for drop in droppable

2095729
translation	localization
i know how to work with resources in asp.net but i do not want to make localization myself i am sure that microsoft has already translation all captions and error messages

2095731
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
just to be absolutely clear you cannot write to a file that was acquired using the openfiledialog only read you cannot read to a file that as acquired using savefiledialog only write

2095734
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview that is populated from a linqdatasource

2095746
getter	setter
one option would be to wrap the graphics object that you are passing around and add getter and setter for individual properties that are otherwise only available as parameters

2095750
uitableview	nsindexpath

2095798
typedef	struct
for those of you like me who are looking to forward declare a c-style struct that was defined using typedef in some c++ code i have found a solution that goes as follows.

2095808
width	height
so if a given element contains only floated elements it will not have any height or by extension width -- unless it has an implicit width that is default on block elements

2095808
width	height	children	parent
setting the overflow property to hidden tells the parent element to respect the width of it s children but hide everything that falls outside it s width and height

2095843
nunit	moq
i am using c# nunit and moq

2095844
packets	pcap
you capture the packets and write them to a pcap file sharppcap probably has a way to do this

2095872

ssl	https
my site has https sections ssl and others are regular http not using ssl

2095987
ssl	https
some times that user will click on a link which will be ssl then click on another link that leaves https to http based urls

2095987
ssl	https
i understand that when on a ssl page all images have to be also served using https

2096032
cpu	affinity
most operating systems have a facility for changing a process cpu affinity thereby restricting it to a single physical or virtual core

2096067
return-value-optimization	nrvo
all i ll say about optimizations in other languages is that you should look up the term named return-value-optimization or its abbreviation nrvo

2096073
jquery	simplemodal
i am trying to use the simplemodal plugin for jquery to load a popup div with a ckeditor in it but when the modal box opens up the ckeditor is all disabled and won t let me type text into it

rails generate standard textarea tag but safari google-chrome webkit display all not only rails textareas as resizable

2096190
daemons	systemd
i ve created a php daemons script to continually monitor a particular directory on the server s file systemd for new files and then process and archive them

2096193
getter	setter
if we follow your logic through then getter and setter violate encapsulation too

2096222
tortoisegit	svn
the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same svn central repo

2096234
width	height
i see they have a set height and width

2096334
multiplying	add
it would be quite trivial to rewrite in c but i am not sure whether doing so will make any significant difference as all it really does is call the underlying math functions add multiplying or divide

2096345
filtering	grouping
if you have a huge project i would suggest making a smart grouping as opposed to xcode s normal dumb grouping which will let you filtering only .m files

2096359
coalesce	isnull
you can use coalesce or isnull on your payment.statuscode field this will allow you to do a substitution for null with a specific value

2096382
inline	inlining
it can be aggressive in inlining and the hotspot jvm actually can inline non-final methods

2096387
hide	show
during user flow if user needs to be logged in we hide current div and show a login div

2096436

put	get
i have a problem where i get an int as input at the wrong time in my c++ program so i need to put it back on cin later

2096493
lxml	beautifulsoup
you need to use urllib2 together with a html parser such as lxml or beautifulsoup in order to extract the links from the retrieved pages in order to crawl the site

2096521
jobs	cron
or you could run cron jobs which check for new work to do from time to time

width of purple and green boxes is fixed but height of purple can vary according to content

2096639
hide	show
i want to be able to hide the first x elements and show the next x and they fall in position on their own

2096692
restructuredtext	textile
if you dont necessarily need restructuredtext but markdown or textile is just as fine then check out jekyll

2096731
spaces	linefeed
the s matches a single white spaces character including spaces tab form feed and linefeed

2096746
folder	directory
would it not be more appropriate to install the files to c program files myapp create a virtual directory and then point that virtual directory to that folder making sure that the proper permissions have been assigned to the folder as it will not inherit any permissions from c inetpub wwwroot

2096771
filesystems	ntfs
this works precisely like a normal file however it only works if the filesystems used is ntfs

2096784
post	get
arkin is a good starting point but by googling some keywords from my post you might get to some interesting places as well

2096803
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
localstorage globalstorage firefox 2+ google-chrome 4+ safari 4+ internet explorer 8+

2096806
width	height
you actually need to specify the width and height manually

2096806
width	height
in order to do this during load time you would need to load the rdlc file into memory alter the value for width and height then load the report with the altered report definition

2096820
gif	png
is it possible to load an image jpg png gif from another domain and manipulate the pixels

2096848
ubuntu	linux
i want to port my .net application on linux ubuntu which calls native libraries so i have dllmaps to make my code work

2096861
int	double
the type scala.numeric provides the ability to write code that abstracts over the numeric system -- it could be called with double int or even your own exotic numeric system such as complex numbers

2096898
children	parent
i also want the parent to be no wider than it needs to be to contain the children

2096899
mod-alias	mod-rewrite
after your realize the difference it is easy to understand exactly why mod-rewrite processing takes precedence before mod-alias - filesystem mapping is just about the end of the road in the long chain of apache finding what to do with an url and since the latter maps an url to a file it has to follow not precede the rewriting of an url by the former

2096899
mod-alias	mod-rewrite
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of course

2096933
hide	show
then when the user clicks next it hide the first and show the second and so on

2096951

2097152
gif	png
i am having some trouble creating a bitmapimage from a memorystream from png and gif bytes obtained from a web request

2097152
gif	png
the problem only occurs when the downloaded image is of type png or gif works fine for jpeg

2097172
pop-up	dialog
while it isn t ideal the default modal overlay was nice and smooth looking it s better than leaking that much memory per dialog i pop-up

2097197
chr	multibyte
for fixed-size multibyte encodings careful use of struct.pack in place of chr should work

2097244
post	get
the difference between and is then that makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload while the makes a text field and just get the contents for that text field from a file

2097275
hide	show
the simplest way to accomplish this is to forget about fading and use sliding to hide and show everything

2097287
min	max
one at min z one at max z

2097287
min	max
2 with these two values calculate the vector that goes from min z and point to max z

2097310

i m currently using firefox 3.5 on ubuntu 9.10 but the same happens on the latest beta of google-chrome

2097321
puts	gets
i d then like to run a batch file that gets several files including that one from the repository puts them into a local temp folder runs them then deletes them

2097367
setinterval	settimeout
this cannot be done using settimeout or setinterval since these functions execute the code thats given to them asynchronously

2097369
stdout	stderr
i do believe that my problem is arising because i am using pthreads and the threads share the same stdin stdout stderr

2097466
udp	tcp
they have udp and tcp ports open and using a packet sniffer i can see there is not much udp communication but mostly it is the tcp communication going on

2097466
udp	tcp
thats why yahoo have mentioned in their documentation that yahoo messenger switch to tcp if udp communication is not possible

2097466
udp	tcp
if udp is not possible then those chat applications use tcp stream for voice

2097466
udp	tcp
so far i think that if client send data as udp packets to server and server distribute the packets to clients over tcp streams is this a proper solution

2097534
udp	tcp
sip is a voice media standard that supports udp and tcp

2097534
udp	tcp
the skype protocol prefers udp where possible and falls back to tcp

2097549
filtering	grouping
now i want to filtering out anything that doesn t start with record and grouping it by the name column jason devon sherrie and then cross join it by name so it looks like this

2097553
gridview	linqdatasource
it should not be needed but it seems that a gridview with linqdatasource can t function without it

2097616
versioning	upgrade
if the module was already installed and is being upgrade from 04.09.04 it would skip the previous versioning scripts assuming they have already been executed and just run the newer 05.01.00 script which should bring everything up to date

2097628
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested in firefox 3.5 ie7 ie8 google-chrome and safari 4

2097656
fast-forward	merge
if the merge wasn t a fast-forward then you ll have generated a merge commit

2097656
fast-forward	merge
if the merge was a fast-forward then you just need to know what the sha1 of your branch was before the merge and compare that to the current

2097670
inherited	properties
because manager inherited from emp it has a .manager and .assistant properties

2097670
inherited	properties
are there any modifiers in .net s inherited implementation to remove the .manager and .assistant properties

2097685
mouse	keyboard
once you determine what it means to be inactive you can clear your timer when the opposing events occur mouse is moved clicked scrolled window is focused keyboard event is a received etc

2097732
jstl	taglib
a well-known taglib is jstl

2097732
post	get
a well-known example is the httpservlet which provides methods to hook on http requests using the popular http methods such as get and post

2097750
equals	gethashcode
my interpretation of the nhibernate documentation lead me to believe that once you override the equals and gethashcode methods nhibernate can load entities into the same reference

2097840
put	get
i am trying to get it so that when a certain value is put into a textbox the focus will stay on the textbox and an alert will be shown in production

2097853
button	checkbox
i ve got a list with checkbox one per row and i d like to have a link button not a common button or submit so when i click it i call an action from a controller

2097866
cassini	iis
if you are using the vs in built dev iis server cassini then it should trying to connect as the current logged on user from memory

when an ssl connection https is established apache mod_ssl has to negotiate the ssl protocol parameters with the client

2097919
testdriven.net	coderush
does running via testdriven.net coderush or resharper help

2097919
post	get
the route i went down i needed fail-proof monitoring was to use the watin recorder and then port those to htmlagilitypack with linq querying with hand-coded get post stuff using webrequest which works quite well but obviously doesnt handle javascript which obviously renders it academic for many scenarios

2097933
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to newer versioning of c++builder have a look at tms advsmoothimagelistbox from tms software

2097955
post	put
as to encoding the string if you must convert the string into ascii text base64 is as good a way as any but i would suggest you investigate use of http put or post to spare you this additional step

2097959
int	boolean
it has one string key one boolean key one function key one non-integral key one table key and five int keys

2097999
onchange	onblur
and also i had to catch it when the focus was lost not necessarily when the text was changed so i had to use onblur instead of onchange

2098063
memcached	apc
memcached apc cache file cache sessions cookies

2098077
post	get
ps this is not such a big issue for get requests but consider form-based uploads post data should not be sent twice to the server

2098154
temporary	tablespace
this creates a temporary tablespace an area on disk where the intermediate sort results will be stored

2098154
temporary	tablespace
temporary here means that the data that is stored is temporary by nature not that the tablespace itself is temporary

2098154
folder	directory	temp	tmp
think of it like of tmp directory in unix or temp folded in windows the directory folder itself is permanent but the data stored within it are temporary

2098154
temporary	tablespace
not sure about 11g but in previous versions of oracle this option was not available for temporary tablespace

2098154
temporary	tablespace
this makes the user me to use the newly created temp tablespace as a temporary storage medium

2098154
temporary	tablespace
this drops the temporary tablespace

2098158
getter	setter
dot notation is intended for setter methods named setsomething that take a single parameter and getter and can also be used for any method that takes no parameters though it s very poor style to use it for an action like myobject.dosomething

2098158
getter	setter
properties are designed to declare getter and setter more easily and even generate the code for you

2098158
getter	setter
so the two concepts are related but it s entirely possible and not always poor style to use dot notation with your very own getter and setter that you wrote by hand

2098158
getter	setter
to use properties even with getter and setter generated for you with normal bracket syntax and not dot notation

2098160
memcached	apc
in php if i create a singleton method for like 5 different caching classes memcached apc session file cookie

2098173
keydown	keyup
i have the same code for keyup and keydown events is there any way that i can pass the element to the function so i can call it like element.addevent keyup function event element

2098245
pascal	delphi
the following is taken from the delphi encryption compendium by hagen reddmann an thus in pascal but i guess this can be translated easily

2098264
post	get
post a follow up on the mod_perl list if your problem is related and you want it to get attention

2098308
firefox	safari
please look at the home page in firefox or safari first then look at it in ie8 and you ll see what i mean

2098344
jar	manifest.mf
i d like to get confirmation of these points but the final answer is that you should use a manifest.mf in the jar of your startup class to reference third party libraries

2098387
width	height
i have many elements floating href tags in a div with a set height width with scroll set to overflow auto in the css

2098387
draggable	droppable
worthy to note if i am dragging one of the draggable elements and move the mouse over the droppable div with id tf_dropbox then the hoverclass is fired i just can t see the draggable element any more

2098421
filtering	grouping
did you tried to add the filtering to a port grouping instead and have all the other properties in the specific ports

2098436
folder	directory
in iis 7.0 can you specify sub directory in a virtual folder you want to disable recycling on

2098459
minimum	max
limits.h lists a minimum size of 8 bits but the definition leaves the max size of a char open

2098459
int	chars	unsigned	short
if you use for instance a uint16_t then you can be sure that this value is an unsigned 16-bit value on whatever architecture whether that 16-bit value corresponds to a chars short int or something else

2098471
width	height
usually this is because the content is hosted in a container which has an explicitly set width and height - like grid for example

2098471
post	get
post your xaml or that answer is the best you will get

2098476
kerberos	ldap
it stores everyone s usernames and passwords and implements ldap and kerberos

2098489
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
-cmatch is always case-sensitive while -imatch is always case-insensitive

2098510
kerberos	ntlm
iis only supports kerberos for ntlm authentication as far as i know

2098510
kerberos	ldap
true kerberos i mean now you could use the ldap libraries in .net to communicate between the servers in a kerberos fashion but the connection between user client and asp.net server would still be an ssl plain text connection

2098510
kerberos	ldap	kerberos	ntlm
if the asp.net server had a trust relationship with the apple open directory server with an ldap connection made between the two it might be possible to enable the ntlm authentication at the iis level and that would in theory extend the kerberos connectivity to the aod through the trust

2098510
kerberos	ldap	kerberos	ntlm
i have successfully used directoryservices to connect to other active directories through the ldap protocol but i still have not found a way to embed the kerberos connectivity between client and authentication server without ntlm

2098518
hide	show
if you have a lot of ajax communication and need the loading often it might be better to hide it so you can just show it later instead of creating the html again

2098518
hide	show
statement1 would be uset to create the loading element statement2 with hide instead of remove to hide it and statement3 with show instead of hide to show it again

2098528
for-loop	loops
the for-loop present in c doesn t technically count as a for-loop because you don t necessarily know how many times loops will iterate before executing it

2098528
for-loop	loops
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

2098528
for-loop	loops
you can find out more about while loops computability and for-loop computability in these cs lecture notes csjvt jvtteaching tpl.html

2098550
versioning	upgrade
nobody likes to be told please wait while we upgrade you to versioning 3.0.1

2098691
bazaar	git
you may want to have a look at this question for some views on the modern source controlsystems git mercurial and bazaar

2098712
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari and firefox show this google-chrome however doesn t

2098712
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
again safari and firefox show this google-chrome not so much

2098719
filtering	grouping
some people do not want a page flow paradigm some people do need advanced widgets a grid component with advanced filtering grouping excel like features like basic formulas etc or low latency or real time etc things that a rich internet application - or ria - is not really made for and is thus not the right tool to choose

2098726
resx	csproj
the resx file entry in the csproj file looks like

2098727
button	checkbox
attach imce button in button checkbox you ll see in image insert form browse button where imce show to you form of uploading

2098744
width	height
i would also have the width and height constraints of the entire shape

2098751
int	double
well i can understand what int double precision is

2098763
hide	show
gwt doesn t provide similar features to show hide a loading frame on the fly

2098769
mouse	keyboard
i can add a watch by right-clicking in the expressions view but having go back and forth between the keyboard and mouse cuts down on efficiency

2098819
width	height
you should first find out the center of the circle cx cy and the radius r by the width and height constraints which is trivial

2098824
post	get
the get request method woks just fine but when i am using the post method i get the message

2098825
width	height
i think i explicitly set the width and height of one of the other components in the viewstack and i think that affected the viewstack itself so that all of the other components that were added to it also go those dimensions

2098827
memcached	apc
the bottom line is that you could create a plesk 8 centos 5 apache 2 php 5.2.6 mysql 5.0.45 memcached apc ami and run as many of them as you want

2098832
int	boolean
if i have a function that performs some procedure and then needs to return the truth value of something is there a compelling reason to use either a boolean variable or an int variable as the return type

2098840
