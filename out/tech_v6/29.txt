mbunit	nunit
i am sure mbunit would have attributes that are similar to nunit

2100141
bazaar	git
i suggest distributed version control like mercurial bazaar and git because it is very refactoring is not exactly structured like adding features

2100209
lisp	scheme
however from what i ve read scheme might not be the best dialect to use for a project and it might instead be better to use common lisp

2100209
lisp	scheme
i also considered the option of first learning scheme and then common lisp but apparently there are some subtle difference which could be very hindering

2100209
lisp	scheme
learn scheme and then learn common lisp

2100209
lisp	scheme
or skip scheme and sicp and simply learn common lisp

2100226
equals	gethashcode
we recommend implementing equals and gethashcode using business key equality

2100311
mbunit	nunit
mbunit doesn t have excessive documentation but quick googling gives this article from which i can tell that mbunit has similar attributes to nunit setup and teardown

2100318

2100802
google-chrome	firefox
i had noticed that in ie the pages were taking a very long time to load when i had a lot of hidden nifty players i looked closer using fiddler and found that each instance of niftyplayer was preloading the mp3 in full rather than loading on demand as with firefox and google-chrome etc

2100824

for instance i have a checkbox that allows me to show or hide certain rows in the advanceddatagrid

2101137
cvs	svn
in the older systems with a central repository like cvs svn and clearcase then it s a much more serious issue which needs to be decided at a team level and the answer should be more like to maintain an old release whilst allowing development to continue on the main line or as part of a major experiment

2101145
accessor	properties
looks like you need to do it in the set accessor of your properties

2101164
put	get
how to get current date from windows and put into my textbox

2101217
innodb	myisam
however in this special case i ll stick to myisam and leave the foreign key relations outside for now because i want to auto increment the second attribute in that multi-key and that is not supported by innodb and that s a bit more useful for this application than having foreign keys especially when having data where updating and deleting will be done very rarely

2101257
width	height
the simplest tiling is simply to roll through each view lining it up to its height for the given width then line up the next one after it.

2101264
put	get
of course i m over-exaggerating it but you get the point - it s easy to imagine that an unexperienced programmer could put a full-blown widget with lots of handlers in every cell of a flextable .

2101264
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
oophm - out of process hosted mode with this they fixed one of the biggest disadvantages of gwt - now you get to use hosted mode in the browser of your choice if that choice is firefox safari ie or google-chrome but at least you can use any version you want

2101264

the slider values and settings are fine but when i move the handle i can t get it all the way out to the ends it stops a few steps from min max values

2101488
post	get
i think redirect option is ugly for both server and client as in this case you first post on the page and than get that page

2101504
post	get
i would also use the prg post request get pattern so that each next link post the form data of that step to the session then redirects the user top the correct next url

2101511
folder	directory
directory or folder and drive

2101514

srp	principles
in regards to crud operation responsibility - that should belong to your data layer not any of your objects see srp - single responsibility principles

2101623

the way i do it is each object that has children objects contains a list of them and each object with a parent contains a property with its type

2101631
width	height
stackpanel makes its own decisions about its width height depending on its orientation and its children

2101860
versioning	upgrade
make sure that you name your .sqldataprovider file with the appropriate versioning prefix if your module versioning in 01.00.01 then your sqldataprovider file name should be 01.00.01.sqldataprovider -- dnn will install upgrade based on a comparison of what you are already have installed vs what you are installing and it will execute the appropriate script to bring the module up to date

2101862
kerberos	ldap	kerberos	ntlm
so ad could be authenticating with kerberos or ntlm or ldap bind

2101862
kerberos	ldap
so maybe your application in question is multi-protocol capable and because it is operating in an ad domain it is defaulting to kerberos but if it were operating in an ldap only environment it would default to ldap bind

2101866
post	get
is it possible to get a value from a sensor every x seconds and send the data out over an http post

2101894

2102212
accessor	properties
make accessor and translation properties for all of the chart control properties so that i don t have the dependency but add lots of complexity

2102212
mvp	presenter
to me it seems that it would be against the mvp pattern to bubble a display control up into the presenter but it seems that trying to map all the properties to dtos or similar would be a lot of work that would add a lot of complexity and while the solution would be somewhat more loosely coupled i m not sure the gain would be worth it in this case

2102229
bash	zsh
i use bash and zsh as shells

2102261
put	get
you can certainly write perl scripts that provide a tk gui that will work on any platform and you can even package the libraries they need to work with par to put together an application that will run anywhere with an appropriate version of perl installed without requiring the end use to install a bunch of stuff from cpan to get it to work

2102261

2102382
multi-query	mysql
you re right multi-query does not work by default and it s not supported at all by the plain mysql extension in php

2102516
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been testing in various browsers since my return home and it seems that firefox 3.5+ gives the same behaviour -reporting button one on both windows xp and ubuntu 9.10 all webkit browsers midori epiphany safari and google-chrome fail and report button two.

2102517
width	height
i think that changing the height and width from 80 to the actual pixel values above will fix it in webkit

2102528
jfreechart	jchart2d
the one i ve used are jchart2d and jfreechart

2102528
jfreechart	jchart2d
jchart2d is supposed to be very fast so if you need to do live plotting have a look at it although jfreechart didn t have any problems doing a plot a few times per second

2102534
translation	localization
the example given on msdn is really insufficient for serious localization it assumes every string is entirely present and has no parameters the reality is you will have values you wish to embed within the string but need placeholder to mark the location of that variable in the string so a translator can move the marker as they translation

2102534
converter	multibinding
you can achieve a more advanced mechanism by implementing multi-binding yourself into silverlight - colin eberhardt did a nice implementation silverlight multibinding how to attached mutiple bindings to a single property - adjusted a bit and combined with a multivalue converter you can perform multiple bindings allowing the first binding to be to the language file and subsequent bindings to be to the parameters to be embedded

2102626
getter	setter
simply to distinguish them by more than just case from corresponding getter setter

2102658

2102789
factors	matrix
conversely if you use maximum likelihood factors the choice of either covariance or correlation matrix does not affect the results

2102801
post	get
my problem is that where more than one reply has been made to the original post i naturally get more than one result for that discussion id

2102813
vb.net	vb6
the key to shifting it from vb6 to vb.net for example is to use the interop library - here s one article

2102950
put	get
get some complicated constants nearby which cannot be written in 1 simple instruction mov r3 #0x12345678 is impossible to complete in 1 instruction so the compiler may put this constant in the end of the function and use to load it instead

2102973
hide	show
another thing you could do is make sure you have a unique viewmodel for each of these views you want to show and hide

2102973
hide	show
then from your parent or main viewmodel you show or hide the views you want by virtue of having them in a collection of viewmodels

2103010
post	get
this question is a result of a post by jeffery palermo on how to get around branched code and dependency injection

and not all primitive wrapper types just the supported ones - byte short chars int

2103122
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

2103124
free	malloc
it is hard to say but i think at the heart of the problem is that there are two heaps in your application which need to be maintained -- the standard java heap for java object allocations maintained by the jvm and the c heap which is maintained by calls to malloc free

2103165
xen	openvz
often you have to use more expensive hosting to get something like xen rather than a more efficient vm system like openvz that doesn t let you use swap space

2103178
hex	binary
to show the binary representation of the floating point number in hex

2103205
associativity	operator-precedence

2103242
bazaar	git
also for various reasons i won t be able use git unless there is a bulletproof strategy to convert this specific repo from subversion to git to hg bazaar

2103245
lattice	plotrix
some other options include levelplot in lattice or color2d.matplot in plotrix

2103303
put	get
a good hash function is supposed to more or less randomly distribute the hash values so that when you put the hash values into a binary tree you get a good evenly distributed tree and not one that is just a linked list down one side

2103355
int	chars
int types have a small list of 10 chars that are valid 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

2103381
post	get
edit i forgot to post that my current workaround is setting the selectedindex -1 after i get my node xml

2103392
lisp	scheme
sicp is more a general book about programming and computer science not so that much about scheme or lisp programming

put	get
so if you put the function definition in some separate .cpp file you ll get a linker error

2103789
packets	multicast
the oid part of the mac address you give 01 00 0c isn t the same as the one used for ipv4 multicast 01 00 5e so you can t use anything in winsock to send this packets

2103849
uilabel	uitextview
between uitextview uitextfield uilabel and uiwebview you can find a few different ways to do this

2103849
uilabel	uitextview
one nifty trick is to use either uitextfield or uitextview as a clearcolor input and render what you want to change in another field that is composed of multiple independently formatted uilabel or piecewise as uitextview

2103914
post	get
how do you set the result of an action result to use post and not get

2104093
octal	hex
i ve tried all kinds of combinations of single quotes double quotes backslashes and the octal and hex version of this character

hash	md5
alternatively how about a md5 hash

2104173
hash	md5

post	get
is it ok to use just get and post

2104463
width	margin
set a width on your #intro_container container otherwise margin 0 auto

2104469
post	get
in rest the http verb is used to denote the operation type you won t be able to express all the crud operations with only get and post

2104478
put	get
is there a better place to put domain-specific code that won t get wiped out if the db table changes and i have to delete and re-drag the table over

2104505
width	margin
you can put everything within a container div with something like width 900px margin 0 auto or you can simply apply these styles to intro container

2104509
post	put	post	get	put	get
in rest only get post and put delete are defined

2104562
post	put
if you don t have ability to make put and delete requests it s considered a good practice to tunnel them through post

2104569
centos	linux
i am trying to install the perl module font freetype on a centos linux box using cpan

2104590
pascal	delphi
the lazarus ide is an ide for the free pascal language this is very similar to that of delphi i must admit that i am not a delphi guy myself so i am unable to go into too much detail about this

but when i use the first of the next two lines my script issue a http 500 error and nothing is displayed except the 500 error and nothing is logged in my php.log

2104688
min	max
this matters because the definition of max and min for floating point arguments is more complex

2104717
websphere	ibm
i am not sure of how it works with above app servers you mentioned but given below are links for geronimo wasce ibm websphere

2104724
lift	wicket
why did would you prefer wicket over lift

2104735
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i think it would be better to create a pointmarker instance within the for-loop and then push it onto the arrays at the end of each run in loops

2104751
rss	feed
i have been using lxml to create the xml of rss feed

2104890
width	height
you page width and height must match the one the one you re aiming for

2104901
sortedmap	sortedset
use a sortedset or sortedmap specifying a comparator class in the sort attribute or or

2104912
sorting	filtering
i ve been looking in some of the latest grails books and many open source projects for samples and best practices for adding search filtering functionality to scaffolded list.gsp s eg making it work with pagination and sorting etc

2104966
postgresql	mysql
current_timestamp is ansi standard supported on mysql sql server oracle 9i+ and likely postgresql

2104974
getter	setter
the getter and setter for hours minutes and seconds are deprecated

2104992
qthread	qobject
one potential issue you could run into is that normally to get full signals and slots support working across threads you need to start an event loop in the child thread using qthread exec or the pyqt equivalent so that signals can be delivered to slots in the qobject that live there

2105041
backtracking	greedy
the greedy version will find the first alphanumeric match all the way to the end and backtracking to the last alphanumeric finding the longest possible match

2105052
portrait	landscape
anyway crash occurs if i change portrait landscape mode several times

2105108
mouseover	mouseenter
i ve tried using hover mouseenter leave and mouseover out to no avail

2105115
versioning	upgrade
you will save yourself of countless problems with things like installed jre versioning distributing upgrade application permissions disappeared shortcuts.

2105135
put	get
an easier quick and dirty way to get notified of every exception that is created at runtime is to hack some tracing code directly into the constructor s of the throwable class compile it and put it into the bootclasspath before the rt.jar

2105145
lxml	beautifulsoup
use beautifulsoup or lxml to parse it

2105146
put	get
it operates like a regular map with get put and remove methods but has a gettopkentries int k method to get the top-k elements sorted by the key

2105146
put	get
i m hoping for o 1 get put and remove operations and for gettopkentries to be dependent only on k not on the size of the map

2105178
google-chrome	firefox
however it does not work in firefox it works in google-chrome i don t really care about ie and i ve tried all sorts of combinations to get it right but to no avail

2105206
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in every other browser i tried firefox google-chrome safari it works fine

2105220
hide	show
in my case i choose to show or hide based on an expression to which i set the expression to the value of a parameter which is a boolean type

2105220
hide	show
the visibility dialog has three options show hide show or hide based on expression - if i explicitly set hide option the csv export does not include the column as you would expect however if i use an expression it will - i even went so far as to make the expression explicit like true and still it was ignored

2105247
hide	show
a workaround would be to hide the columns by default and show all others using the expression

2105247
hide	show
it seems what you will have to do is make a parameter that will show which columns to hide or display then when the report runs just don t display any data in those columns

i have an unsigned integer and i am trying to extract each individual digit

2105272
division	modulo
don t use the modulo floating point division is fine

2105272
integer	unsigned
the value in question is a 32-bit unsigned integer

2105276
post	get
if you can get the contents of the ckeditor as some other post describe i have an idea about how to get the count of the characters entered

2105294
chunked	transfer-encoding
if using rest you don t need to define your own chunking protocol as the http headers content-length content-range and transfer-encoding are all used for sending chunked data

2105338
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if you want to force a default color of a navigationbar why don t you set the tint color in viewdidload viewdidappear of your view controller

2105344
client-side	server-side
instead of looking at yet another server-side framework how about a client-side framework

2105361
width	height
i have a worksheet with cells that may contain text that sometimes exceeds the width and height of the cell

2105367
allocator	stl
the dynamic library uses the default stl allocator so it doesn t do anything funky

2105389
width	height
you will see the same effect if you place an element with a fixed width and height in a viewbox

2105389
width	height
the viewbox doesn t change the width height or fontsize properties themselves but the final rendering appears different

2105443
children	parent
i have a parent class that contains a list of children

2105477
post	get
if some test are done using a get then your post vars will be empty

2105518
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
if it s a list why you re assigning onclicklistener - use onitemclicklistener

2105583
versioning	upgrade
at first i tried using a properties file that lived inside the jar but i was concerned if someone were to upgrade to a later versioning replace the existing jar they would loose all of their settings

2105605
hide	show
you could hide the object from the interface indefinitely or you could choose to show it - depends on usage needs

2105633
children	parent
there is nothing wrong with aggregate roots having other aggregate roots as children or even with children with a reference to the parent

2105646
put	get
so you can use startup to get and set your data for views and if you need some initialization before like getting reference to controller put it in component s initialize method

2105686
uilabel	uitextview
i set + 30 because over the message uitextview is a uilabel

2105702
put	get
if id can have any limitation i can simply put small word as name attribute for link but is it possible to get link by name

2105759
width	height
one possibility is you have set the cgsize width to be different in each function for row height you have cgsizemake 268 max_height and for settweettext it is cgsizemake 262 max_height

2105816
rar	zip
i m doing this because i have a portable gui image viewing app that will need to detect archive file types rar zip more

2105874
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2105917
lift	wicket
even dave pollak once suggested this combination if you prefer wicket to lift or have an existing wicket application you want to retrofit scala with

2105919
hide	show
what s wrong with loading the entire questionnaire html and hide all the blocks except the one you want to show

2105946
hide	show
then use jquery to show hide each of the questionnaire pages

2105980
getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection
so what appears to be happening is that ie-up-to-7 redirects all use of attributes called name to an otherwise-invisible property internally called submitname that for form fields changes the data the field will generate as part of a form submission but which doesn t change the real name attribute used for htmlcollection indexing radio-grouping getelementsbytagname or in the case of i frames targeting

2106008
put	get
why don t i have to put to get the reference

2106108
put	get
if i put the arrayquerystring behavior first i get no results

2106108
put	get
if i put it second then i get the same results as the xml endpoint

2106115
uiview	uiwindow
can you use your mainwindow uiwindow as the container view as uiwindow inherence from uiview

2106138
google-chrome	firefox
the behavior i m looking for is that similar to tabs in firefox and google-chrome

2106140
google-chrome	firefox
otherwise it works in google-chrome but firefox shows a blank screen

2106140
youtube	vimeo	width	height
as vimeo unlike youtube doesn t allow url parameters to be passed for determining the video size and percentage widths apparently have quirks my only other suggestion would be to specify a fixed width and height on the video object like on this page see the page source set the visibility of the content div to invisible use a javascript or jquery function to determine the page width change the width height attributes of the object tag accordingly and set the object to visible again

2106157
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
the primitive types in c# are boolean bool byte byte sbyte sbyte int16 short uint16 int32 int uint32 uint int64 long uint64 ulong intptr uintptr chars chars double double and single single

2106176
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
subframe refers correctly to the iframe alert subframe returns object htmliframeelement and the function runs in both ie7 and opera 9.23 but not firefox 3.0 google-chrome 3.0 or safari 3.03 beta windows

2106224
stdout	stderr
a reasonable default to stdout or stderr would make more sense

2106225
implements	extends
will i have to extends bunglows also and implements the same function again

2106230
subclass	abstract-class
constructors for abstract-class are used by subclasses invoked from subclass constructors using super params

2106234
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce	perforce	cvs
this extension is distributed with mercurial and understands cvs subversion git darcs monotone bazaar gnu arch perforce and mercurial as source formats and mercurial and subversion as destination formats

2106252
tabcontrol	tabitem
i cannot figure out how to bring a tabitem to the front of a tabcontrol in a visual studio 2008 wpf project so that i can see the controls i m editing

2106274
subclass	abstract-class
you don t instantiate abstract-class but the constructor is invoked when a subclass is instantiated

2106278
nsstring	nsdata
i suggest looking into the nscoding protocol and examples which will allow you to use nskeyedarchiver and nskeyedunarchiver to serialize your objects to nsdata for transfer or base64 encoded to an nsstring if necessary

2106302
integer	unsigned
the maximum for an integer int 10 is 4 294 967 295 unsigned ofcoarse

2106311
onmousedown	mouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup
if you want to listen for any mouseup event you ll need to register an onmouseup listener on the page body in your onmousedown callback and then unregister the onmouseup listener from within the onmouseup callback so it only happens once

2106321
maven	pom.xml
i ve found a workaround using maven and the javadoc plugin with the following configuration pom.xml

2106321
maven	pom.xml
once this pom.xml is in your project root directory you will be able to run as - maven build .

2106328
servicepoint	webrequest
i m still trying to figure out this whole thing and i m really stuck on the servicepoint as well as webrequest because really i m using a proxy class in paypal which does the under the hood sending of the request

2106442
gridbaglayout	miglayout
i would avoid gridbaglayout as much as possible - use a nested jpanel or miglayout if you can external jar

2106443
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and postgresql use backslash-escapes for this by default

2106443
postgresql	mysql
i would presume the simple backslash-replace method also goes wrong if you turn off the backslash-escapes which are themselves non-compliant with ansi sql using no_backslash_escape sql_mode in mysql or standard_conforming_strings conf in postgresql which the postgresql devs have been threatening to do for a couple of versions now

2106443
postgresql	mysql
this gets used instead of the backslash-escape in mysql and postgresql making them conform to what everyone else does and giving a guaranteed way to include the out-of-band characters

2106443
postgresql	mysql
this works on postgresql mysql and ansi sql-compliant databases modulo the paramstyle of course which changes on different db modules

2106471
haskell	ocaml
have a look at bnfc which can generate working code and the makefile from labled bnf for a number of target languages like haskell ocaml c c++ and java

2106503
min	max
i would like to generate some pseudorandom numbers and up until now i ve been very content with the .net library s random.next int min int max function

2106584
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari and google-chrome all fail to run the function

2106612
apache	nginx
as an aside i see you ve tagged apache but i would really like to recommend that you serve static content through something like nginx

2106630
lxml	beautifulsoup
try beautifulsoup or lxml

2106665
arraylist	treeset
if you want the collection of nextword s sorted why not use a treeset rather than an arraylist

2106853
sorting	filtering
table sorting paging and filtering with jquery

2106868
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
always have your nibs file s owner be a subclass of nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller on mac os x or uiviewcontroller on iphone and use property retain iboutlet for all of its outlets doing appropriate releases in your controller subclass -dealloc method

2106868
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
this pattern will work fine on both mac os x and iphone os because nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller on mac os x take implicit ownership of top-level objects for you and relinquish that in their own -dealloc methods and iphone os doesn t take any implicit ownership of top-level objects for you during nib loading

2106887
min	max
i need to generate a bounding box of min and max latitude and longitude values so i can return addresses within a given radius

2106906
performselector	dealloc
i just don t understand i thought when you dealloc it the object everything associated with the object should be removed or canceled even the performselector with delay

2106972
nosuchmethoderror	verifyerror
button i get a nosuchmethoderror or verifyerror

2106977
getter	setter
potentially you could also use this method to store the statuses as integers in the database by changing your strings to integers in the hash converting your column types and adding a getter and a setter

2107007
prototypejs	mootools
other frameworks like prototypejs and mootools also provide similar functionality

2107014
width	height
i am trying to load the dynamic swf file which has 100 width and height generatd by my flex 3 in a div

2107014
width	height
i have tried to provide fixed height and width to div but no luck

rss	feed
i am parsing rss feed.but i cantable to parse encoding data from thee rss feed.how to parse encoding data from the rss feed

2107147
post	get
vim doesn t have support for the squiggly underline we re all so used to but you might be able to get the red marker in a column effect used in eclipse with help from this blog post

2107157
ironruby	ironpython
you can t really do this easily and if it s really something you need to do consider using a .net language more in line with your needs like ironpython or ironruby

2107159
jar	war
the problem is that to re-install them on the new server the websphere dialog asks me for the jar ear war file which i don t have

2107159
jar	war
in the install section it doesn t even mention ear or war only jar

2107159
folder	directory
i am currently thinking that perhaps the best thing to do might be to just copy the directory over to another was 3.5 system and then upgrade that system and hope it converts the folder structure and updated the config as part of the upgrade

2107187
versioning	upgrade
does the table have an entry for your upgrade code does the product versioning of the currently installed versioning fall within the range of versioning specified for upgrade do the attributes look ok for instance is the msidbupgradeattributesonlydetect attribute not set and so on

2107229
downloadify	jszip
i am trying to put together a test case using jszip and downloadify together the end result being that a zip file is created dynamically in the browser then saved to the disk using filereference.save

2107238
jobs	cron
a real limitation of heroku currently is that the most rapid frequency they support for cron jobs is hourly

2107256
memcached	ncache
there are many free distributed caching solutions in the market like memcached or ncache express

2107256
memcached	ncache
dont know much about memcached but i ve used ncache express by alachisoft it lets you use asp.net caching without requiring any code change

2107354
google-chrome	safari
for instance the following page renders different controls depending on the browser - tested using ff3.5 google-chrome and safari

2107363
button	checkbox
cast control property on the eventargs to the type you want textbox checkbox or button

2107372
submit	submission
you can tell the validation plugin not to operate on form submission then manually validate the form when the correct submit button is clicked

2107377
mouse	joystick
if yes how we can read the user input using input devices like keypad mouse joystick from dlls

2107386
vim	gedit
vim gedit also has such plugins i think

2107401
post	get
how post and get symbol in url

2107457
fancybox	simplemodal
i ve looked at fancybox and simplemodal but as far as i know these are positioned relative to the viewport only

2107461
django-extensions	django-evolution
basicly this error is because your code in models orm change but your database isn t and django-evolution doesn t fix many problems with changes in the database i suggest you look for django-extensions and the command sqldiff but look my another answer

2107525
width	height
where sample.swf is generating dynamically and has 100 height and width

2107544
unsigned	short
short int - 2 bytes - signed -32768 to 32767 and unsigned 0 to 65535

2107556
public	protected
and automatically all public protected methods properties fields etc of the super class become a part of the sub class which can be overridden if necessary

2107565
wordpress	joomla
i don t mind whether it is joomla drupal or wordpress

2107586
inherited	properties
this technique can be better than simple object augmentation because the inherited properties aren t copied over all the new object instances since the base object is set as the of the extended object in the above example subinstance contains physically only the member3 properties

2107593
yslow	pagespeed
have a look at the w3c qa toolbox for markup links css validation and the popular yslow firefox extension pagespeed another firefox extension and speedtracer sort of like yslow

2107643
affinity	processors
also i agree all others answers such as processors thread affinity

2107677
int	chars	int	double
performance is identical to making specialized classes except in cases where you are using what would have been a raw data type int float double chars bool short

2107677
int	chars	int	double
in these cases the value types must be boxed to their corresponding reference types int float double chars bool short which has some overhead

2107710
gif	png
set this flag to true when you are loading an image jpeg gif or png from outside the calling swf file s own domain and you expect to need access to the content of that image from actionscript

2107718
rss	feed
it is now default behaviour for most browser to apply their own xslt to any atom rss feed they come across very annoying

2107718
rss	feed
a feed is identified through the application atom+xml mime type for atom and application rss+xml for rss

2107829
super	abstract	superclass	subclassing
i use generics as i have 2 models one model s superclass is a generic abstract subclassing by 35 classes and the second model actually has 2 different super classes which combined are subclassing by again 35 classes

2107829
superclass	subclassing
the parameter type can be a generic superclass or one of it s subclassing

2107830
disk	ram
my colleague insist that as dom could only support about 1 million times of write operation we should running our database entirely in a ram disk and backup the database to dom

2107842
post	get
i am not writing this to get a load of people react on my post i am trully interested in knowing how much work and money it will cost a webdeveloper when starting from scratch

2107879
accessor	properties
things may depend on how do you declare your tempplayer properties in your class and as it looks that it is temporary object consider do you need a properties accessor for it

2107968
rss	feed
to the application itself requires very little user interaction just a initial list of rss feed and some parameters

2107974
backgrounding	multitasking
there re rumors though that multitasking and backgrounding processes will be allowed in iphone os 4.0

2108014
inherited	properties
disadvantage popup is not connected to button or surrounding elements so it won t inherited properties datacontext from them

2108014
width	height
instead wrap the button in a alongside a with zero width and height and the desired position

2108027
junit	jmock
the runwith runner as defined by the jmock guys is only valid with junit 4.x

2108050
mouse	keyboard
the control is visually unchanged but you can t interact with it using the mouse keyboard or stylus

2108109
int	chars
prefer passing primitive types int chars float ... and pod structs that are cheap to copy point complex by value

2108151
spaces	delimiter
as it seems the delimiter should be not spaces

2108171
inject	interceptor
in this case we inject different spring mvc interceptor for one client or for another

2108229
post	get
obviously to get 256x256 we need to get the w to be 3 so that post w divide we have those coordinates a 3rd of the size xscale 1024 256 should be equal to yscale 768 256 to get a square projection

2108255
post	get
when i get the value from the select field to post back to the server it correctly has an integer value which i persist

2108255
put	get
if i put the tag in my i get the page code as text in the browser

2108358
mouseup	mousedown
it is very simple to make your items draggable without a thumb by just intercepting mousedown mouse move and mouseup events

2108358
mouse	keyboard
by doing this thumb won t be intercepting keyboard and mouse clicks and messing with your listbox

2108366
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
you can access the harddisc sector by sector but then you would have to interpret it s structure which obviously depends on the filesystems fat ntfs hpfs etc

2108423
post	put
i read via this post how to turn on error reporting in zend framework but where exactly do you put these statements

2108437
width	height
if the change is less than both the width and height of the map the transition will be smoothly animated

2108446
stateless	stateful
i m not entirely sure if my bean should be stateful or stateless

2108482
bash	subshell
one that uses shell specific stuff like redirects job ids etc. you d have to either run that command in a subshell using or using the -c option to shells like bash

2108492
post	put
i see the convention is to have the post action be the same name as the page but to put a

2108492
post	get
this seems clearer to me as compared to having the edit get and the edit post

2108499
folder	directory
there will be no clash because they are in different folder and they are not compiled simply copied to the folder structure under the output directory

2108504
post	get
but now i am trying to connect to a sql-server 2005 and i get an error something about a database vendor code 17 it s a german version so i won t directly post the whole error message

2108530
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
alternatively you could try using the new as of java 6 grouplayout instead of the gridbaglayout - it s imo much easier to use and almost as powerful

2108538
free	malloc
then i can go through my code and replace all calls to malloc free with my_alloc my_free

2108646
pascal	delphi
pascal and also delphi is more centered on readability than the c syntax languages which are more centered on character power as much information per character as possible

2108648
width	height
you can confirm this by adding the iframe with non-zero width and height and set the src to a correct url

2108684
createelement	domdocument
in your case you first have to create a document then use domdocument createelement domelement appendchild to append that element to another element

2108721
children	parent
in your context to give a parent element a class when it or one of its children is active the opposite of what i ve done you d do

2108769
postgresql	mysql
most mainstream databases are good for that including mysql postgresql oracle etc

2108769
postgresql	mysql
be sure look at licenses as well mysql is gpl the database and the connectors postgresql is bsd oracle and a few others you need to pay for

2108778
trie	tree
the trie ternary tree .

2108806
post	get
i have disabled http post and http get for webservices in my web.config file

2108824
postgresql	mysql
is it means unicode char has maxlen of 4 bytes in postgresql but 3 bytes in mysql which caused above error

2108827
pull	push
i know mercurial is a dcvs but does that mean we push pull changes from each other directly rather than via a peer repository on a server

2108831
serializable	deserialization
i suspect but can t say for certain that this may be some strange issue in xsd datetime serializable deserialization

2108845
int	chars	int	double
the only things that are value types are the simple numeric types int long short byte float double chars bool etc.

2113593
folder	directory
so for example if an entry originally was c folder file.jpg i want an entry in directory for c folder and the entry in files would be updated to have file.jpg for the filename and the directory id of the new entry in directory

2113648
equals	gethashcode
is intended for reference equality do the variables refer to the same object while equals is intended for value equality and you may need to override equals and gethashcode for your type to get that right

2113672
maven	pom.xml
hudson supports maven based builds very well so you could just use the grails maven plugin and point hudson at the maven pom.xml file and away you go

2113699
getter	setter
create an new class that has two double properties with getter and setter and constructor if you like and equals and hashcode... and make the method return that type of object

width	height
so i want the whole this box-model to be controlled modified by javascript by only .box s width height and .bottoms s height all the rest is adjusted by css automatically

2113787
titlebar	window
i discovered that since the app doesn t have a titlebar win7 doesn t handle the window drag and therefore doesn t send the wm_syscommand at all

2113816
junit	easymock
i m trying to setup a test in junit w easymock and i m running into a small issue that i can t seem to wrap my head around

2113875
inherited	properties
if you really need to work off the same connection object for some reason why not have all your controllers inherited from a base controller that exposes your connection object as a properties

2113895
stdout	stderr
an autoconf test could check whether dprintf 1 blablabla writes to stdout or stderr and whether dprintf -1 blablabla fails in an interesting way or writes to stderr

2113896
folder	directory
you can also use bash commands within the php code if you would like to avoid having your server aka www-data create the directory but you ll still need to place the correct permissions on the folder to allow www-data to then write files to the directory

2113898
komodo	scite
to check what opening matches what closing i use a folding text editor like scite or komodo edit so i can browse the properly indented code by opening and collapsing sections

2113900
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
use a fileinputstream to read the file and a fileoutputstream to write it

2114003
children	parent
usually you term the other entities children instead of parent but that is just a matter of style and convention

2114014
firefox	safari
i ve only tested this code to work in firefox 3.0 or more recent versions - in fact aside from possibly safari it s unlikely to work elsewhere as it doesn t honor cross-browser differences in dimension properties.

2114052
width	height
create a controltemplate for your button with a storyboard to animate height width or transform properties and a trigger to fire the storyboard on mouseenter event

2114101
subtraction	addition
this would considerably simplify addition and subtraction

2114124
superclass	subclassing
classes can be subclassing to make them serialisable though you will need to manage the superclass data or use a serial proxy see effective java

2114143
gif	png
you could prepare animation as a bunch of images wximage loaded from png gif jpg or whatever files and then use a timer and paint them on a control

2114183
for-loop	loops
if you will be updating often on the other hand it might be much easier to use a preparedstatement object especially in situations where you can use a for-loop or while loops to set a parameter to a succession of values

2114188
hide	show
it s quick and dirty i know but...alternatively set the foreground colour of the window to the same colour as of the background in order to hide the texts flashing by see here for an example of how to do this its in the 7th posting on that page that show the code to do so

2114205
client-side	server-side
we ve only just started cleaning up the legacy of broken php scripts serving up server-side xss now you want to introduce a whole new massive range of client-side xss exploits

2114226
bazaar	git
send directive in bazaar is the same as push in git

2114233
int	double
ibpp exposes those via c c++ double but also via 16 32 64bit int

2114244
bazaar	git
why not read git for bazaar users

2114246
children	parent
group has a to-many relationship with group named children group also has a to-many relationship with group named parent and they are inverses of each other

2114246
children	parent
or if your data model only calls for one parent group has a to-many relationship with group named children group also has a to-one relationship with group named parent and they are inverses of each other

2114274
subtract	add
getting a result of either -1 or 0 or of either 1 or 0 for that matter from your comparison operations is impossible if you are using only bitwise logical operators and add subtract where the carry is lost

2114315
hide	show
i haven t done this myself but you could layer a uiview at the top of the view hierarchy and use sethidden to dynamically show or hide it

2114332
strtok	strcmp
strcmp when fed the results of strtok in the following code seems to be blatantly lying to me

2114387
implements	extends
alternatively if the third party class isn t final you could just extends it have that implements serializable and write your own writeobject and readobject methods

2114395
stdout	stderr
it also provides options for generating xml files that includes collected stdout and stderr from these tests which is big plus for automated tests and can also generate html reports though you would need to install additional packages

2114415
getter	setter
whether that involves reflection or just getter setter and constructors depends on the class

2114422
ubuntu	linux
i ve also reproduced the problem on two different linux machines albeit both running the same version of ubuntu one 32bit the other 64bit

2114448
post	get
this post i know its vb but just to get an idea has an example

2114454

hit the show hide code button and it will show you the code required to turn the original into the filled in version

2114505
innodb	myisam
convert 5 write-intensive tables to use innodb engine and keep the rest on myisam engine

2114537
innodb	myisam
cons memory must be shared between the innodb buffers and myisam key buffers

2114537
innodb	myisam
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

2114550
innodb	myisam
these days i always default to using innodb especially on the write-intensive tables you mention where myisam suffers from full table locking

2114550
innodb	myisam
automatic crash recovery â in case mysql shutdown was unclean innodb tables will still - recover to the consistent state- no check repair like myisam may require

2114553
mvp	presenter
another alternative to mvc is mvp model view presenter

2114627
jython	pypy
now there is jython ironpython and pypy and the pydâ s do not work with any of them ironclad aside

2114627
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
you could also program a pyd for cpython a similar c# dll for ironpython and a java class or jar for jython i m not sure about pypy

2114720
dsn	dbase
dbase files is an odbc data source name dsn i believe its installed by default with ms office

2114759
robotlegs	puremvc
i have looked at some puremvc robotlegs but our flash projects are usually relativly small so i wonder if it is not a overkill

2114761
uiview	subviews
the nsinteger value exists in the view controller and the uiview subclass is implemented as a subviews in the same view controller

2114789
int	chars
i don t think strcspn is going to help - it works on a string chars array but you say you have an array of int

2114793
profiling	instrumentation
once you have your app working profiling it using shark or instrumentation to find where it really is slow

2114809
imagemagick	mogrify
i would suggest that you use -d and -q and then post-process the generated image using imagemagick s mogrify or something similar to scale the image back

2114819
lisp	scheme
to begin not only are there two main dialects of the language common lisp and scheme but each of the dialects has many individual implementations

2114826
toolbar	tabs
you can hide the tabs then implement your action methods for the toolbar items to act as the tabs changing the selected tab view item to whichever one corresponds to the pressed toolbar item

2114827
mutators	setter
the difference is that the self dot version goes through the synthesized mutators setter method which would perform a retain before assigning to the ivar

2114846
profiling	debugging
this is generally used for debugging and profiling and not as interprocess communication but its a possibility

2114847
post	get
a week of searching and all i can really do is create a resource that handles get and post all to itself

2114847
post	get
should one really use separate resources in twisted get and post operations

2114851
lisp	scheme
you get scheme common lisp elisp arc

2114878
tostring	icomparable
and myobject has overriden tostring and has implemented the icomparable interface

2114881
floating-point	integer
all the function does is copy some data but uses floating-point registers to do it when you could use the integer registers just as well

2114929
ubuntu	linux
how do you extract the contents of a jar file in ubuntu linux

2115012
put	get
get a job as a junior developer that will put you on a project that is developing a web application

2115015
strcpy	strncpy
firstly strlcpy has never been intended as a secure version of strncpy and strncpy has never been intended as a secure version of strcpy

2115015
strcpy	strncpy
some programmers today get confused by its name and assume that strncpy is somehow supposed to serve as limited-length c-string copying function a secure sibling of strcpy which in reality is complete nonsense and leads to bad programming practice

2115019
nswindow	nsapplication
see for example nsapplication s and nswindow s methods relating to that concept. accessibility uses the same name so to make a single window frontmost set the value of its kaxmainattribute to kcfbooleantrue

2115021
lisp	scheme
i m wondering if it would be beneficial to start with scheme read the little schemer and sicp or some other lisp variant

2115030
apache	lighttpd
most web servers like apache lighttpd are configured to serve .html files as static files while .php files will have to first go through the php engine to be interpreted and only then delivered to the client

2115043
lisp	scheme
scheme is among the simplest of lisp variants and it s well-documented

2115068
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you don t want the things provided by qmainwindow you don t have to use it - you can use any qwidget subclass

2115070
lisp	scheme
i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

2115070
lisp	scheme
in addition there are plenty of excellent resources on either common lisp or scheme so that shouldn t be the deciding point

2115072
strcpy	strncpy
when people say strcpy is dangerous use strncpy instead or similar statements about strcat etc. but i am going to use strcpy here as my focus they mean that there is no bounds checking in strcpy

2115077
memcpy	strcpy
drepper says we should somehow know the length and use memcpy and avoid string functions altogether the standards committee argues that the secure strcpy should return nonzero on truncation unless otherwise stated by the _truncate flag

2115099
lisp	scheme
i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler

2115099
lisp	scheme
as you are new to lisp a good starting point will be teach yourself scheme in fixnum days by dorai sitaram

2115101
lisp	scheme
there really only are two common variants scheme and common lisp

2115113
division	multiplication
division and multiplication have the same precedence and have left-to-right associativity so this is parsed as

2115118
division	multiplication
since multiplication and division happen left to right that works out to

2115145
lisp	scheme
scheme and common lisp are standardized

2115188
beyondcompare	winmerge
then go on and call diff tools like beyondcompare or winmerge on the two temp directories

2115207
stateless	stateful
how about what is a session bean and describe some differences between stateless and stateful session beans

2115218
integer	unsigned
any code that uses a recent version of python extracts an integer in range 256 from each byte sums those integers and finally does should do the job assuming that your unsigned long is 32 bits wide

2115247
division	multiplication
now division and multiplication both have the same precedence in c but the associativity is left to right for both

2115247
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
also if u remember the old arithmetic rule of bodmas bracket off division multiplication addition subtraction this is the order of precedence then we do division first and then multiplication

2115253
yacc	bison
i am trying to build a parser with bison yacc to be able to parse a flow of token done by another module

2115317

my sticky footer works great in all the browsers expect safari google-chrome particularly the work.html page itself

2115339
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
afaik webkit-based safari google-chrome etc. firefox opera and ie 8 support some not all of the html 5 features

2115377
public	protected
fields are typically private or at the most protected internal or protected internal the term field is typically not used for anything public

2115394
division	modulo
so have looked at the obvious ways to recover i j from ij using division modulo expensive operation and using if statements breaks vectorization branch prediction problems .in the end i came up with the following using c-style comparisons

2115410
httprequest	httpresponse
httplib now http.client and friends all have conn.getresponse and an httpresponse class but the server-side operations of conn.getrequest and an httprequest class seem to be lacking

2115437
erlang	lisp
choosing lfe will give you both erlang and lisp at the same time

2115449
width	height
basically just setting the width and height attributes btw if it s opening in a new tab it s your browser that opens it that way not the javascript

2115475
octal	decimal
regular expression of nonnegative integer constants in c where numbers beginning with 0 are octal constants and other numbers are decimal constants

2115479
selecteditem	selectedindex
also you are setting both selecteditem and selectedindex

2115479
selecteditem	selectedindex
so to fix the problem after setting itemssource set either selecteditem or selectedindex depending on your requirements and your data model

2115483
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve got this working with xhtml 1.0 strict in firefox 3.x+ opera 9.x+ ie6+ but not in google-chrome 3.0.195.38 or safari 4.0.4

2115524
firefox	safari
the word-wrap property is supported in ie safari and firefox 3.5

2115527
google-chrome	safari
figure out where google-chrome and safari go silent by putting alerts before this ajax call

2115529
getter	setter
my take is that no class local variable should be accessed without a setter getter property and thus they are all private - given that why not name them in a way easier to read and use autocomplete on

2115543
min	max
you can do this if you can keep track of the min and max value of the price during the time interval - this assumes that the time interval is not being constantly changed

2115543
min	max
one way of keeping track of the min and max values of a changing set of items is with two heaps placed back to back - you could store this and some pointers necessary to find and remove old items in one or two arrays in your store

2115543
min	max
min and max are available at constant cost

2115595
getter	setter
in order to provide a read-only property provide a getter use propget attribute and don t provide the setter propput

2115615
int	double
int double or string

2115645
client-side	server-side
the vs designer is not good at handling cases where your markup jumps between server-side and client-side script

2115689
cpu	hyperthreading
if you have a cpu with just one core leaving aside hyperthreading then your observation that only one thread is executing at a time is completely correct

2115701
post	get
first of all autocomplete calls a service uing get not post

2115705
cpu	hyperthreading
as well like others have suggested you probably have two cpu or a hyperthreading cpu at least

2115719
draggable	droppable
you would think that the draggable s stop -event would be called before the droppable s drop event though.

2115738
postgresql	mysql
db mysql server 5 postgresql server 8

2115758
pop-up	dialog
i want to display a dialog pop-up window with a message to the user that shows are you sure you want to delete this entry

2115758
pop-up	dialog
i have written a click listener for those buttons but how do i invoke a dialog or pop-up and its functionality

2115816
put	get
if i use a different jpg i get the same kind of window and if i put an invalid filename in i get a very tiny window expected

2115855
tcpdf	fpdf
i thought all was lost until i learned about tcpdf and fpdf

2115856
button	checkbox
upon clicking the add row button i m able to create the second row dynamically which contains the checkbox state select and city select fields

2115862
selecteditem	selectedindex
and also use either selecteditem or selectedindex not both

2115880
factors	matrix
i m trying to do factors analysis for a co-occurrence matrix c which is computed from the term-document matrix td as follows

2115881
apache	nginx
afaik the only thing that is not server-independent is the rewriting of links as apache nginx iis and others all have different rewriting engines syntax

2115904
bluetooth	usb
what i ve found so far is that one just can send an at commands directly from terminal to special ports like dev ttyusb0 if modem is connected via usb port or dev rfcomm0 if connection is handled via bluetooth

2115935
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii	cakephp	yii
i have worked on many php frameworks such as zend framework cakephp codeigniter and yii

2115935
codeigniter	yii
yii unlike codeigniter works on php 5 only which gives it capabilities like auto loading of classes

2115956
eigenvalue	diagonal
if your matrix really is positive semidefinite then all of the eigenvalue the entries on the diagonal of d should be non-negative

2115956
factors	matrix
this is probably the test that your factors analysis algorithm is doing as well to see if the matrix is positive semidefinite.

2115995
width	height
my dilema is that the first time i load the page it works 100 but when i refresh it it seems to ignore the width and height set in the css file

2116067

the was removed stopword cat is now singular stemming punctuation is gone and the words are lower cased

2116138
post	get
then i have a couple of get post actions that deal with the dictionary

2116221
int	chars
a table of chars with their corresponding int values

2116221
int	chars
i can t really think of any other way the above can be done apart from having the chars value being converted to it s int counterpart opposite of current method or simply not having the conversion at all and have letter store

2116268
int	chars
there is nothing particularly inefficient about the way you are doing it but it certainly is possible to just convert between chars and int a chars is an int type

ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby is great for being able to create applications that run on the clr because they give you the .net goodness with the speed of writing python or ruby

2116344
for-loop	loops
note that using a for-loop keeps all the logic of setting up testing and incrementing loops variable in one place

2116349
move	drag
now let the user drag on the screen and move the point the uiscrollview is looking at

2116378

dwoo	smarty
is there something similar in smarty s or dwoo s function

2116400
vb.net	vb6
this msdn page seems to confirm that support was dropped from vb6 to vb.net

tolower	toupper
you would have to implement it yourself look around on the internet for some 3rd party code or preferrably rewrite the code to use string.format and or toupper tolower

2116414
folder	directory
if you mark rsc as a source folder eclipse will copy its contents to the output directory

python may have a main site but there are several slightly different implementations cpython ironpython jython python for s60 pypy unladen swallow cl-python .

2116517
lisp	scheme
at some point in time some dialects appear that pick up the state of art scheme for everything with functional programming in lisp in the 70s 80s and common lisp for everything maclisp-like in the 80s - that causes some dialects to disappear mostly namely standard lisp interlisp and others

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
this essentially causes the sql server to effectively bypass the rdbms storage sub-system and store the binary data directly on the underlying ntfs filesystems whist maintaining transactional integrity for this data from the rdbms perspective

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems instead of in the

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
this essentially says that using a sqlfilestream object will act almost identically to a standard filestream object except that sql server for transactional integrity purposes will act as a very lightweight gatekeeper or wrapper for your reading and writing of binary data to an underlying ntfs filesystems file

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
since no previous version of sql server has offered such functionality and direct integration with the underlying ntfs filesystems i d say that it would not be possible to implement a sqlfilestream against any version of sql server prior to sql server 2008

2116546
expander	grid
i ve just tested this method to retrieve the parent expander for a checkbox on one of my usercontrols it s several levels up the visual tree nested in a heap of stackpanels grid and dockpanels worked a treat

2116557
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
the cleanest approach would probably be to port cpython to produce native ironpython jython pypy extensions

2116561
maven	pom.xml
actually starting with version 2.0.9 maven uses the pom.xml order to build the classpath so you can manipulate it now

2116572

geocoding	geocode
that will set the base country for geocoding so that if you try to geocode plymouth it will distinguish between the uk and the massachusetts cities

2116807
implements	extends
you need to implements a tablemodel for example by extends the class abstracttablemodel or by to using a defaulttablemodel

2116831
children	parent
my problem is that the parent modules need to be included before the children

2116836
disk	ram
while writing code that doesn t waste resources is good craftsmanship and should be a human right ram and disk space are awfully cheap these days

2116907
children	parent
my problem is that the parent modules must be instantiated before the children

2116909
int	chars
is there a way in visual studio either through it s native features or a plugin to show an int long chars variable in the debugger window as a bit array

2116915

grep cvs etc services says 2401 both tcp and udp

2117136
tabcontrol	tabitem
this is ok as it gives me a button in the tabcontrol to allow for deleting the current tabitem

2117143
serializable	deserialization
the java implementation in gwt of the rpc protocol in the packages com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc and com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc.impl unfortunately only covers deserialization of requests and serializable of responses

2117144
vb.net	vb6
vbmigration.com have a commercial solution for migrating vb6 to vb.net

2117144
vb.net	vb6
their website documents various differences in behaviour between vb6 format and the vb.net versions including the ones in this question

2117170
profiling	benchmarking
for your benchmarking you can use jmeter + a profiling which should give you direct overview on the behaviour in such a heavy-loaded environment

2117268
websphere	ibm
migration between different versions of websphere might be somewhat more tricky but i m sure ibm published at least one redbook on that topic

2117295
put	get
if we were to put up a white flag and draw a line in the sand over such simple issues nothing would ever get done in large data processing projects

2117372
postgresql	mysql
i m used to using relational databases like mysql or postgresql and combined with mvc frameworks such as symfony ror or django and i think it works great

2117382
pylons	turbogears
frameworks like pylons turbogears and bfg use it as part of their api

2117406
folder	directory
if it is difficult to become that user you will want to copy the authorized_keys file and id_rsa or id_dsa file to the .ssh folder of the home directory of that user

2117415
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari end up on top in 5 out of 6 tests while ie8 ranks last for all tests except one

2117497
int	chars
by far the easiest solution is to realize that you can convert chars s to unsigned int s and unsigned int s to zz numbers

2117520
post	get
first you should follow the post redirect get pattern by returning a redirect result instead of a view after a successful post

2117523
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
update 2017-06-28 a good article from google-chrome developers discussing the state of math.random prng quality in google-chrome firefox and safari

2117617
cos	sin
how do you calculate trig functions like cos sin tan in the iphone sdk

2117649
cakephp	yii
anyone who disagree just can try a demo project with cakephp and yii and he will see how things are easier with them as crud form validation etc

2117655
cos	math.h	cos	sin	sin	math.h
functions like cos sin and tan are in the standard library and can be used by including math.h

2117688
cvs	svn
with the cvs and svn approach to merging if you did not manually copy your files before the update and it scrambled them on merge you have to manually re-edit to get back to a good state

2117697
getter	setter
when you have a class with instance variables and you also created properties that are simply getter and setter for these instance variables should you use the properties inside your own class or should you always use the instance variable

2117697
getter	setter
of course things change when the property setter or getter does a little more than just wrapping the instance variable

2117723
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
making subclassing inherited superclass

2117723
inherited	subclassing
in the latter example assuming subclassing is a function you are saying that all new instances of subclassing should inherited ie

2117723
superclass	subclassing
subclassing superclass

2117723
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
when i wrote above that subclassing inherited supertype using prototypical inherited i mean that all new instances of subclassing inherited from one particular instance of superclass not from the superclass type function itself

2117739
groovy	gpath	rss	feed
while trying to parse rss feed in groovy i found a gpath example using wildcards

2117749
dictionary	map
it needs a much larger dictionary to map backwards and has a lower chance of collision

2117802
hash	md5
bruce schneier wrote of the attack that w e already knew that md5 is a broken hash function and that no one should be using md5 anymore.

2117808
hash	md5
second off md5 is no longer secure as a cryptographic hash function indeed it is not even considered a cryptographic hash function anymore as the forked one points out

2117808
hash	md5
so if you ve got a ssl certificate with a md5 hash on it i can generate a duplicate certificate that says what i want that produces the same hash

2117808
hash	md5
thirdly similar to messages you can also generate different files that hash to the same value so using md5 as a file checksum is broken

2117826
post	get
here s a blog post to get you started on webcenter 11g

2117837
vim	textmate
a good solution which i use is to print from textmate via vim which gives you a syntax-highlighted and line-numbered result or however you choose to configure it. in addition to vim it requires ps2pdf but these are easy to install with macports etc

2117842
gif	png
i don t know the rest of your code but maybe you want someone to allow uploading png or gif images

2117853
yslow	pagespeed
you re better of training them on yslow or pagespeed

2117877
min	max	width	height
min max width and height are accounted for as well as variable borderwidths

2117878
getter	setter
this gives you the freedom to change the simple field access to a more sophisticated getter setter method lateron without changing the interface of your class

2117879
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i modified the ajax call to grab a static html which i edited to various scenarios using 0 1 ... and it worked perfectly opera google-chrome firefox

2117882
google-chrome	safari
i have found that jquery window .width return a wrong value in safari and google-chrome

2117895
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but not in safari google-chrome

2117895
google-chrome	safari
what happens in safari and google-chrome is the handle of the slider when the page loads is non existent until you click on the slider rail and when it does appear it cannot be dragged hower you can still scroll by clicking along the slider rail

2117971
user-controls	tabcontrol
also you can have many user controls on one form so if you have a form with a tabcontrol that has 5 tabs the content of each tab could be a user-controls so instead of having hundreds of controls all mixed up in one form each user-controls has its own controls and validation logic and you end up with just six controls in the form the tabcontrol and the 5 user controls

2118040
getter	setter
doing this means that i only have to put a breakpoint in the getter setter of the property if i need to debug an issue with the instance variable rather then having potentially a lot of breakpoints scattered all over the code

2118041
post	get
i recently wrote a blog post on how to get mercurial running an http-based repository under nginx with fastcgi ubuntu 9.10

2118041
pull	push
just make sure that you pull changes down from the repository before you start your work and then push them back when you re done

2118050
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

2118157
action-filter	onactionexecuting
how can you test the combination of a controller action with a action-filter attribute using onactionexecuting to modify the actionresult returned by the action

2118246
inherited	subclassing
not only is there no need for it to be concrete but after some more reading i am convinced that object not being abstract is in conflict with the basic inherited model - we should not be allowing abstract subclassing of a concrete class since subclassing should only add functionality

2118255
free	malloc
as an alternative you can allocate the space you need with malloc as long as you will remember to free it when you don t need it anymore

2118259
hash	whirlpool
there is a hash function called whirlpool which builds on a derivate of rijndael rijndael being the initial name of what became the aes

2118264
apache	nginx
edit a quick http head request of one of the sites you listed shows me they are using nginx and not apache

2118264
apache	nginx
nginx probably has similar configuration capabilities as apache

2118294
cout	cin
you should look at how the and operators work for the stream classes cout and cin for example

2118355
post	get
why does the blog entity get post back with an added status and not modified

2118358
hide	show
add each of the views in ib and lay them out on top of each other then show hide them

2118403
min	max
a backwards loop is one that goes from the max to the min

2118406
division	addition	division	multiplication	division	modulo	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
most typical operations like addition and multiplication can be reversed while modulo division can not be reversed

2118406
division	modulo
modulo division

2118406
division	modulo
with that being said one-way hash functions have the same mathematical quality as modulo division

2118406
division	modulo
first i found two numbers that when divided using modulo division gives me a number in the range between 1 and 1000 second i erased the original number and written on it the divisor from the pair of numbers second i chose a bus terminal that has a guard protecting the lockers from miscreants by only letting people try one locker a day with their key third the banker already knows the dividend so when he gets the key he can do the math and figure out the remainder and know which locker to open

2118560
firefox	safari
on the newest browsers firefox 3.5 safari 4 this works fine

2118583
vbscript	jscript
your application can expose its properties through active scripting and write rules in vbscript jscript

2118607
gdal	ogr
currently ogr from gdal does not perform any recoding of character data during translation between vector formats

2118650
hide	show
the way around this is hide the select boxes when you want to show the overlaying div and un-hide them when the overlaying div goes away

2118719
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
firebird it s easier to administrate than postgresql and it does have various linux ports ubuntu fedora debian if you need n secure os selinux

2118734
post	get
if you still can t get it to work i would post a new question with the specifics of your problem - what you ve tried what you re expecting and what s happening instead

2118765
int	double
use the type double instead of int to get the value you re probably looking for

2118772
int	chars
the user should be able to enter as many chars as he wants as long as the text fits the decimal or int mold

2118831
inherited	properties
what you may have seen is different flavors of attempts to simulate class inherited by using the available inherited mechanism in javascript which is based on prototype objects sharing properties with linked instances

2118831
inherited	properties
very important the prototype properties used in this inherited mechanism is set on a function not directly on objects

2118831
inherited	properties
in simple english if you call new constructor where constructor is a function the operator creates a new object with a link to inherited properties from the constructor applies the constructor function to it and returns either the value returned by the constructor or the new object in case the constructor returned something else which is not an object

2118831
inherited	properties
using this newly acquired knowledge how would you create a new class of objects that inherited all the properties of arrays together with a new method empty to remove all elements

2118831
inherited	properties
second i want instances created with customarray to inherited array properties

2118835
hide	show
how do i program the ability to hide and show the dock when i roll over a certain space on my desk top

2118852
profiling	debugging
i ve not used the remote debugging element of xdebug see above but the profiling code coverage and - in particular - improved browser error messages i find helpful

2118884
maven	pom.xml
what i have is maven pom.xml files which are set up when the branch is created and updated for each release from the branch

2118896
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	safariwatir	firewatir
it provides an abstract interface to browsers for testing including interfaces to internet explorer by default firefox firewatir google-chrome chromewatir and safari safariwatir - ie only on windows obviously and safari only on os x i m not sure i don t think they ve made it work with safari for windows

2118909
post	get
working with get and post data among other http communications is inherent in php development

2118916
int	double
that s accomplished by double clicking clicking the middle mouse button or using the dive option on the context menu -- all after having placed the mouse cursor on the variable int he source code pane or the stack frame pane

2118922
qtkit	quicktime
i currently have an application that should capture real-time video from a camera via qtkit which is based on quicktime but is cocoa and i would like to further process the frames via core image glsl shaders etc.

2118987
public	protected
q what is the difference between public protected and private in a class definition

2118987
public	protected
a public makes a class member available to everyone protected makes the class member available to only itself and derived classes private makes the class member only available to the class itself

2118987
getter	setter
q what is wrong with classes that predominantly define getter and setter that map straight to it s internal members without actually having methods that execute behaviour

2118998
ubuntu	linux
note that to use this older version of ipp in a modern ubuntu you may need to get older versions of other libraries it depends on the requirements are listed in the release notes or even just run it under a chroot of a supported linux distro at least to test if it fixes your issue

2119016
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

is there some handy way to declare an int long double float string literal without having to use this format

2119060
audiotrack	audiorecord
i currently have code that reads a recording in from the devices mic using the audiorecord class and then playing it back out using the audiotrack class

2119061
int	chars
basically i want to convert a chars array containing 5 chars into an int however the 5th chars in the array is always a letter

2119063
salt	md5
this is relatively easy as the username is there in plaintext and the password is just md5 ed so no salt or anything to muddy up the waters

2119067
hide	show
1 create a single wxframe then put all of my wxpanels inside of it hiding all but one then performing a sequence of hide and show as the next button or the current equivalent are triggered

2119116
16-bit	64bit
all of the parameters are identical so it doesn t have anything to do with 16-bit vs 32-bit vs 64bit as far as i can tell

2119127
ffmpeg	libavformat
you could use libavformat and libavformat libraries behind ffmpeg to do the same thing but unless you need to do some processing on the raw audio before outputting to wav there would be nothing to gain except for knowledge

2119164
int	chars
atoi requires one chars argument and returns an int

2119166
int	chars
if you want to convert the first four chars of a string to an int do this

2119185
cout	cin
if you say its a pure console app i assume you re using std cout and std cin or other stuff from the c++ standard library

2119210
int	chars
so i am interested in only ascii table representable chars which i assume after conversion to int should be less than 256 am i right

2119245
int	chars
if your compiler treated chars as signed by default the cast to int could result in negative values instead of the values from 128 to 255 and this is assuming that your chars s are 8-bit too

2119262
folder	directory
instead of adding a resource fork to the executable file you can simply create a special directory folder

2119267
int	chars
i think you re thinking about an int value overflowing a chars and therefore convert it to an int

2119268
int	boolean
int 0 is not strictly equal to boolean false even though they have the same value of 0

2119351
folder	directory
however i don t see my war file inside the webapps folder of tomcat home directory or for that matter its exploded format

2119360
hide	show
how can i show hide that based on the view im in

2119394
pull	push
there is a git-to-svn bridge called appropriately enough git-svn which allows one to use git locally and then push pull to a remote svn server

2119424
mouse	keyboard
all of the keyboard and mouse messages fit that category

2119472
subtract	add
if not what s the simplest way to add subtract an hour

2119478
sorting	grouping
add order by null to avoid the implicit sorting mysql does when doing a grouping by

2119488
min	max
so x y are given by the arg min of max d_i

2119498
integer	fractions
this will put brand new entries right at the top of the first page and then they will move slowly down the list over the course of the next 5 days i m assuming age is a fractions number not just an integer

2119524
jqplot	flot
flot is an open-source plotting library based on jquery like jqplot

2119575
nsstring	nsdata
if your plist data is not in a file you can also convert an nsdata object containing plist data to a dictionary with or convert an nsstring to a dictionary with

2119590
free	malloc
edit 2 fixed there was two free calls before and after malloc _ i feel so stupid now

2119621
pop-up	dialog
so when the user clicks into the color cell on a given row the dialog pop-up like this

2119701
textview	imageview
i have a simple linearlayout with one textview and one imageview

2119725

2119820
for-loop	loops	division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
to generate the multiplication table of 1-9 with a single for-loop you could loops 81 time and use the division and modulo to get the two operands

2119889
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
in all the source files where you use malloc realloc and free

2119889
free	malloc
based upon your edit it could be that you re changing tex after malloc and then passing that value to free

2119889
free	malloc
are you sure tex isn t changed between malloc and free

2119892
google-chrome	firefox
it s quite a bit faster in google-chrome than firefox i haven t tested it in any other browsers

2119895
put	get
using hashmap would destroy any attempt to order by in your sql since you are not guaranteed to get back the order you put the items

2119896
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so if they are using ie8 without the latest security patch or if they are using firefox 3.0 instead of 3.5 or 3.6 at this point or using an older version of safari google-chrome when a newer stable version has been released

2119936

jython	jacl
don t use jacl since was 7 only uses jython

2120113
ant	maven
.you need to hire a special maven guru which you don t for ant

2120113
versioning	upgrade
i personally don t upgrade to newer versioning of open source frameworks blindly without seeing the need to do so

2120130
16-bit	64bit
my word list is about 100 000 words so about 16-bit per word which for four words gives a 64bit keyspace

2120171
interbase	firebird
my understanding is that in keeping with interbase v6 firebird 2.5 does not support the sql-92 interval keyword

2120175
dlsym	dlopen
on windows this is done using loadlibrary getprocaddress and on posix systems using dlsym dlopen

2120183
onclick	onsubmit
the onclick attribute of the uicommand component and the onsubmit attribute of the uiform component should not return false or cause a javascript error

2120273
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if you are putting a html fragment onto a page and you do not know ahead of time which mode will be used are there any reliable hacks css javascript or otherwise that will ensure that the div has the same overall dimensions in both strict quirks mode on all major browsers ie6 7 8 firefox opera google-chrome

2120283
fseek	ftell
if the line-size if fixed then you could use fseek and ftell to move to the end of the file

2120286
put	get
in oracle the constraints get default names if not specified however in mysql i don t know i think i heard once that if you don t specify a name for the constraint mysql will not put a default one

2120291
put	get
i couldn t get this to work so i put alert imagebrowsercontent

2120339
min	max
aggregates part 1 count sum max min

2120340
int	chars
unfortunately two of the return types are chars and int which are not classes in first place

2120422
config	ini
as for your config i would suggest using an .ini file for your config because php has a built-in ini parser see the parse_ini_file function

2120422
config	ini
this would be consistent with php s choice of ini file format for its own config php.ini

2120424
config	ini
and lastly we test storing config parameters in an ini file or in a php file as an associative array

2120443
wordpress	joomla
just read about a benchmark where joomla drupal wordpress plone3 4 had been tested

i m developing a webapp for ie6 unfortunately but also using firefox and google-chrome on the side

2120499
google-chrome	firefox
they were rendering fine in ie6 ie7 and firefox 3.5 but after upgrading to firefox 3.6 it now looks the same as google-chrome

2120499
google-chrome	firefox
and here s what it looks like in google-chrome and firefox 3.6

2120499
firefox3.6	google-chrome

2120527
int	chars
in c single quotes are used to denote single literal chars constants and the resulting type of such constants is int

2120533
vim	emacs
i ve tried to migrate to emacs several times for clojure development following a variety of blogposts screencast and tutorials but somewhere along the way something always went wrong - keybindings that didn t work incompatible versions etc and i found myself scrambling back to vim

2120533
paredit	slime
but i know i want paredit and slime

2120554
getter	setter
of course if you want a getter and a setter and you don t need any extra processing just pure java-bean-like get set youc an do this

2120596
firefox	safari
to work in safari and firefox but not ie7 or ie8

2120637
config	ini
this is not answering your question but in my opinion a better way to deal with config is actually to use a real config file like an ini or xml file

2120645
cvs	svn
as there is a base copy exists while merging files in a repository cvs merge svn merge can auto-merge the changes

2120660
addition	multiplication
i would first implement addition as your algorithm for multiplication might use addition as an auxiliary

2120674
multiplying	addition
multiplying as your example by appending zeroes and calling the addition method per step so for multiplying with 20 append the 0 and addd that number twice

2120674
addition	multiplication
implement multiplication by repeated addition like in your example

2120695
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
i don t think asp.net asp.net-mvc assembly itself has html.actionlink with the control as its template the template version you are using it only has html.actionlink you may need to find some other assembly to support that function

2120723
int	double
what s much worse is that you re then passing those double to printf with the d conversion so it s trying to treat the as int instead of double you d print a double with f

2120743
prepare	execute
logging prepare statements will not contain the bound data and if more than simple inserts are execute you might be forced to implement parts of sql to reproduce what you recorded

2120804
fossil	git
from the article it sounds like fossil isn t a database any more than git is a database

2120842
maven	pom.xml
when i merge maven projects i use tortoisesvn and deselect the changes to the pom.xml done by the release plugin so it does not try to merge in the version changes

2120846
sorting	filtering
i also require the sorting and filtering apply to the parent elements only based on their own data

2120846
children	parent
any visible parent can show their children and the children never sort

2120846
children	parent
my two-stage solution is first to process the data by iterating through it and creating an array of parent elements and adding a children array property to them that holds the child elements

2120846
sorting	filtering	children	parent
next i apply any sorting and filtering to the parent array perhaps by using an arraycollection wrapper and iterate through the parent copying the visible ones and their children if the parent is marked expanded to a display array

2120846
children	parent
a custom item renderer will indent the children and change the expanded property of the parent elements which will regenerate the display array

2120882
post	get
what is the best practice for implementing the post redirect get pattern in asp.net mvc

2120958
hide	show
im trying to show and hide a div element with the jquery toggle method

2120963
bluej	jcreator
you d better use an ide - for educational purposes there s bluej and jcreator

2120978
int	chars
parse it into an int using integer.parseint string 16 then cast it to a chars

2121008
stdout	stderr
a somewhat a better option is to let nohup run your script and redirect the output both stdout and stderr to nohup.out

2121008
put	get
make sure you use proper shell escaping there i just put it between apostrophes but the braces might need other escaping this way you only suppress occurences of this particular message from stdout but let all other messages get through

2121046
int	chars
apparently there s a view function expecting a string containing only digits but for some reason that string contains literal chars and made his way to a int constructor

2121091
hash	hmac
i notice for instance that the java code implies you are using a sha1-based hmac whereas the .net code implies you are using an unkeyed sha1 hash to generate the key

2121093
sorting	grouping
this file is used to grab multiple items of manufacturing flows up to 4 different set ups with a total of up to 10 distinct flows of up to 1000 steps each with the information being flow specific sub-flow specific for grouping sorting purposes and data such as movements inventory ct ...

2121129
getter	setter
the contenttemplate can be an itemplate property with a getter setter while the other you could maybe take advantage of the listitemcollection class

2121132
client-side	server-side
i am using client-side and server-side certificates with message security

2121177
getter	setter
a simple set of public variables in a class is faster than using getter and setter

2121182
int	double
in fact a double sounds like it d be double the regular size and if you think of int as a good baseline than a double is indeed double the size of an int

free common lisp implementations include cmu cl sbcl openmcl clozure cl clisp gcl and ecl

2121814
lisp	scheme
with regards to scheme and common lisp although admittedly an inaccurate analogy there are times when i would consider scheme is to common lisp what c is to c++ while scheme and c are small and elegant common lisp and c++ are large and arguably more suited for larger applications

iboutlet	ibaction
i have a logcontroller that has access to all these items via iboutlet and ibaction

2122428
clang	llvm
while xcode tools still has a command-line c++ compiler i recent versions of os x i think 10.7 and later have switched to clang llvm mostly because apple wants all the benefits of open source without having to contribute back and clang is bsd licensed

2122428
fink	macports
so in order to get g++ you ll have to use something like fink basically debian s apt system for os x darwin or macports basically openbsds ports system for os x darwin to get it

if you think you are maybe using too much you could identify the larger allocations using the instruments tools run with performance tool from within xcode and then post that chunk of code here to get ideas of how to reduce it

2122613
client-side	server-side
no matter how you decide this for the server-side you can easily consume webservices and wcf services using only wcf on the client-side

2122614
int	chars
be aware that types like int or chars aren t necessarily the correct bit-width

2122698
client-side	server-side
you cannot mix server-side code php with client-side code that way

treelist	grid
dev.express quantum tree list if you know the grid component you can use this component as well treelist and grid combined

2122878
getter	setter
so annotate it s getter with lob i would make the getter and setter private to not expose them

2122878
getter	setter
then expose fake getter and setter to return or set a from the

now i ve returned to buffers and for navigating files and buffers i use only the nerdtree and fuzzyfinder i guess ex textmate users may prefer fuzzyfinder_textmate plugins both are great

2123169
nerdtree	fuzzyfinder
for locating files i use either nerdtree bound to n or fuzzyfinder s file mode

2123213
post	get
this change causes the autocomplete script will now send form data by post rather then get

2123255
awt	swing
see swing libraries thread safety and is it safe to construct swing awt widgets not on the event dispatch thread

2123282
post	get
the trick is to use post instead of get when using get gets erased but when using post complete thing is passed so the autocomplete needs some adjustments extra one line here it is

2123345
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ve tried this but cant seem to get it right i get a iqueryable - ienumerable cast error

wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i know about wsdl.exe and svcutil.exe - but not too familiar with what s what

2123439
put	get
the funny thing is if i put a file in the same directory with a different extension .txt for example and try to load that it doesn t get treated as an action

2123453
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
the wsdl.exe is the deprecated utility to convert a wsdl file into a asmx asp.net webservice stub - don t use that anymore use svcutil.exe or visual studio s add service reference for wcf

2123490
elf	coff
some compilers spit out coff others spit out elf etc

2123527
hide	show
on the show function i am trying to hide the txtemail box but it doesnt seem to be able to find it

2123528
stdout	fflush
stdout is line-buffered when connected to a terminal but i remember reading somewhere that reading at least from stdin will automatically fflush stdout

2123528
stdout	fflush
would need an extra fflush stdout

2123528
stdout	fflush
so is stdout guaranteed to be fflush here

2123543
put	get
this can happen when you attempt to put get or delete too many entities or an entity with too many properties or if the datastore is overloaded or having trouble.

2123545
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout

2123547
stdout	fflush
to answer your question you do need the extra fflush stdout

2123547
stdout	fflush
reading from stdin doesn t fflush stdout

2123560
hide	show
i believe that the ajax call hasn t completed by the time the show method is invoked and thus the element doesn t exist at the time that you are going to hide it

2123572
stdout	fflush
you need to explicity fflush stdout in order for the buffered data in the video memory unix terminal s memory to be pushed out on to a view device such as a terminal

2123572
stdout	fflush
edit thanks jonathan to answer the question reading from stdin does not fflush stdout

2123575
pull	push
application instance may pull data from sensor or sensor can push data to an application instance but controller is the one who will control which application instance is linked to which set of sensors

2123825
g++	gcc
also see this duplicate similar question for g++ gcc

2123837
inherited	subclassing
version is a class method of nsobject so all subclassing of nsobject inherited it

2123870
jar	war
your last assertion is wrong your exported resources can and should be copied to b war web-inf lib as a jar file

2123888
equals	gethashcode
i have a class a that implements iequatable using its fields say a.b and a.c for implementing overriding equals and overriding gethashcode and everything works fine 99 of the time

2123888
equals	gethashcode
they can all be stored together in a dictionary dictionary thus it s convenient when they all carry their own default equals gethashcode

2123888
equals	gethashcode
in that case i don t want to use the default equals gethashcode overrides provided by a

2123888
equals	gethashcode
thus i was thinking of implementing a referenceequalitycomparer that s meant to force the use of object s equals gethashcode

2123888
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
one way of course would be for a to not implement iequatable and always supply an iequalitycomparer to any dictionary that i create but i m hoping for a different answer

2123913
width	height
now that you ve separated the width and height logic and noticed that it s identical - what if you were to add say getdimension direction direction and setdimension direction direction int length to your classes

2123916
post	get
you could also do this in r with a combination of something like rcurl or xml to get the blog post and something like igraph for the sna

2123918
rss	feed
i know that rss feed is news...is it possible to get rss feed s from yesterday or day before yesterday... more exactly archive of rss feed

2123928

it looks strange to me to include each request parameter on each answer but it is the only solution i found to create a stateless api ready to be called asynchronous

2123975
rsa	aes
also considering ill be doing some basic aes and rsa based encryption - is there an advantage in using bouncy castle instead of the tools provided off the shelf in the jce

2123977
width	height
where w and h are the width x and height y of the grid respectively

2124022
many-to-many	one-to-many
a has a one-to-many relationship with b and b has a many-to-many relationship with c

2124023
jar	war
the advantage of this approach is that you use the ivy conf attribute of each project dependency to ultimately decide if the jar gets included within the war file or not

2124046
portrait	landscape
i ve seen references to being able to specify two separate layout xml files for an activity one for portrait and one for landscape

2124046
portrait	landscape
how do i specify for each activity which xml file is it s portrait layout and which is the landscape layout

2124065
spweb	spsite
i want to know whats the best method of instantiating spsite and spweb objects

2124104
rsa	aes
if jce supports the algorithms you want to use and it does support aes and rsa switching to bouncycastle is extra hassle with no benefit

2124138
width	height
i have a requirement to have a small form with some text boxes on them and a button at the end which with a specified aspect ratio in hidden textbox enable the user to type in a value into the width box for example and when the user changes the value the height textbox will change also..also when you type in the height box the width will change

2124143
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the text links are correctly vertical aligned in safari and google-chrome and so are the image links but in firefox 3.5 the text links are slightly out of position a bit towards the bottom

post	get
but shows how to get the post data during an input stream after the initial http headers

2124231
google-chrome	firefox
this was tested in firefox google-chrome and ie 7 but it should work all modern browsers

2124247
strdup	strncpy
you need to copy the string using strncpy or duplicate it using strdup

2124324
tostring	toarray
would the toarray and the tostring methods be the best options

2124364
multibyte	substr
the reason is that you use utf-8 it s multibyte encoding and substr works with singlebyte only

2124415
abc	subclassing
another usage is if you somehow want to specify that an object implements a specific interface and you can use abc s for that too by subclassing from them

2124459
ninject	spring.net
ninject or more advanced frameworks enterprise library spring.net

2124468
hash	md5
i am so convinced that i saw an override of a hash function that allowed me to calculate a md5 or other hash at the same time as writing ie calculating the hash of one buffer then feeding that resulting hash into the next iteration

2124476
inherited	subclassing
the more tragic flaw however is the new subclassing brings with it all the baggage and opinion of the inherited chain

2124563
folder	directory
the .subversion directory in you home folder is only intended for settings

2124609

this is a spaces delimiter list of elements where each row represents something i don t know and it just gets forced into a fortran model shudder

2124649
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick multi-threaded derivative from imagemagick

2124675
width	height
you can use height and width attributes

2124691
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
check graphicsmagick which is multi-threaded toolkit derived from imagemagick available under x11-style license

2124775
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there are two browsers or http clients in this scenario the one that is giving you the result you want ex. firefox ie google-chrome or safari and the one that is not giving you the result you want ex. lwp wget or curl

2124782
cvs	svn
i adopted the technique of using source control first with cvs and then with svn to synch and backup my environments around ten years ago probably more

2124923
chown	chmod
should it try to chown chmod the file

2124938
post	get
when i get this working i ll post the code to my blog and an update to this thread

2124958
vim	emacs
simply edit and save the file in vim or emacs switch back to your editor and hit compile

2124962
implements	extends
the other problem with using abstract classes is that you can then no longer implements mixins that is you can implements multiple interfaces however you can only extends one abstract class

2124967
udp	tcp
you have unix functions for tcp udp communication and you have windows functions for tcp udb communication

2124970
int	chars
just like after declaring the value of an int you might later set its value after declaring a pointer to chars you might later set its value to be a valid memory address that contains a chars -- or sequence of chars -- that you are interested in

2124978
subclass	abstract-class
i would advocate the use of abstract-class more in situations where you wish to provide a partial implementation of a class possibly delegating some behavior to concrete subclass implementations

2125020
joptionpane	jdialog
so we have to create the joptionpane and the jdialog by hand

2125022
chown	chmod
i would go with eilon s answer for the most part but would add the following caveat - i would not try to chown chmod a file unless you really need to if the purpose of your program is managing file permissions or acting as an installer of some sort

2125022
chown	chmod
this is because a your attempted chmod chown may not work and b your application should respect the user privileges with which it is run - if these are not sufficient you should inform the user via whatever mechanism you do this

2125126
min	max
i want to define a min and max methods in a utils class

2125145

maven	pom.xml
i ve just recently started writing maven plugins and was wondering if there is a common way to modify the values within the pom.xml file changing an artifacts version number

2125219
int	double
2 how can i convert t to a double given that it s an unsigned int

2125236
lisp	scheme
i was in your position and split my attention between scheme and common lisp

2125271
min	max
since you aren t using the os x implementation of objective-c you may not have access to the predefined min and max macros

2125302
min	max
as richard corden pointed use c++ functions min and max defined in std namespace

2125302
min	max
if you find that c++ library you use defines min max as macros as well it may cause conflicts then you can prevent unwanted macro substitution calling the min max functions this way notice extra brackets

2125329
put	get
we are going to put the stdgen instance in a state monad then provide some sugar over the state monad s get and set method to give us random numbers

2125329
put	get
we use get to get the stdgen and we use put to install a new state

2125330

subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization s own internal naming conventions

2125356
google-chrome	firefox
this works great on firefox and google-chrome but ie gives me a javascript error

2125386
hash	md5
i should add however that md5 is a hash algorithm which is a one-way process which generates a unique string on each input collisions aside

2125401
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 and google-chrome and firefox but ie8

2125412
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
other browsers firefox opera google-chrome ignore the css file and render the page without styling

2125424
webkit	gecko
same goes probably for the other gecko webkit based browsers

2125429
int	chars
that is simple enough furthermore with the ansi c standard the size of a chars data type is 1 byte which can explain how the runtime can obtain the value of this semantic assuming cnt is an int eger and has a value of 3 for example the runtime steps up by one automatically and counting from zero the value of the offset is t

2125429
free	malloc
yes the block of memory is free up and handed back to the runtime environment for use by another upcoming code execution of malloc

2125429
free	malloc
also remember this for every malloc there is a corresponding free if there is no corresponding free you have a memory leak in which memory is allocated but not free up

2125445
post	get
using sessions you can store the parameters on the server and avoid sending sensitive data with get or post both are insecure

2125481
postgresql	mysql
if you use sqlite as a database you don t even need to setup mysql or postgresql

2125485
int	boolean
derived1 has a constructor taking a int and derived2 a constructor taking a boolean

2125485
int	boolean
value where value is of type int or boolean

2125491
config	ini
i have put a config ini file config.ini for reading and writing to from my c# program the thing is if the user has uac enabled then for some weird reasons the program doesn t read or write to the file but it managed to create the file but cannot read or write to it

2125532
width	height
what i mean by victim is that the height and width of a text box is the sum of the height width properties assigned above in addition to the padding height width and the border width

2125534
width	height
elements can be sized with the height and width attributes

2125536
ienumerable	ienumerator
recently erik meijer and others have show how iobservable iobserver is the dual of ienumerable ienumerator

2125552
cvs	svn
select a version control system cvs or svn to be honest cvs would suit this particular use case better by the sounds of it and then set up build triggers on finalbuilder so that checkins cause a compile and send the results back to you

2125591
int	double
value types such as int etc live on the stack reference types live on the managed heap however if a reference type has for example has an instance variable of type double it will live along with its object on the heap

2125633
int	chars
two and this is something weird i ve tried out once if and only if your identifier strings fit in 4 chars as in all your examples and they are ansi strings not unicode strings you can map strings to int directly

2125639
accessor	properties
properties accessor

2125643
post	put
the documentation says that the file should reside on the pythonpath and i ve seen several blog post inviting to just put the file in the root directory of the project

2125649
many-to-many	one-to-many
you can form a one-to-many in one of the two directions but in order to get a true many-to-many you need something like

2125674
int	chars
i see this line the type a where chars is substituted for the type parameter a and i want to know why i can t substitute it for this the type a where int is substituted for the type parameter a

2125681
typedef	struct
you don t need to typedef struct in c++ just is sufficient

2125698
integer	unsigned
this declares a function that takes two arguments - an integer and a pointer to unsigned probably large integer and returns an integer

2125698
integer	unsigned
size_t is unsigned integer type usually a typedef returned by sizeof operator

2125743
datamapper	activerecord
it would need to be significantly more sophisticated than that since the apis are quite different between datamapper and activerecord

2125769
int	chars
here s what ghci says about int chars and string

2125769
int	chars
int and chars are both simple types without type variable parameters

2126494
cpu	affinity
note that i don t recommend to do it in your case all i m saying here is for the sake of completeness that it exists it has valid uses and there s a reason why both linux and windows developers have written apis and end-user commands allowing to set the cpu affinity on a per-process basis these functionalities are fully available both to programmers and to end-users

2126503
mouse	keyboard
if the application don t process wm_char etc windows messages xinput directinput your best bet is to make a dll to inject into the app overriding some of the functions cause those use directly the system resources to access the keyboard mouse gamepad

2127955
google-chrome	safari

not likely to be a common issue but it s possible to have an object with a volatile variable as part of it s state that might be part of a cloning operation not that this is a good design just that it s possible and such a field would not get copied in a serializable deserialization process

2128283

getter	setter
i don t like writing dumb classes with mostly getter setter and would rather use an all-public struct to indicate it s just a bundle-o-data

if you want a higher level interface especially just to communicate with another instance of your own program you don t necessarily have to worry about the networking layer and can consider something higher level like rpyc or pyro instead

2128900

judging from the fact that you might introduce operators with more than two arguments you would have to replace left right with a list of children anyway which is mutable again and would allow creating the parent node before all the children

i ve kept the original behavior of the operands loop that decrement the depth at each iteration

2128904

2131879
innodb	myisam
it only works in myisam which is in all other respects a much worse database engine than innodb

2131879
innodb	myisam
a common alternative to this which you might also consider would be to keep the â canonicalâ copies in the main table potentially in an acid-safe innodb table and store a separate copy of all the title desc and tags together in a fulltext-indexed myisam table purely for fulltext search bait

2131890

i ve looked at jquery tablesorter and quick search plug-ins but they work just on the currently-fetched data and won t help in real sorting and filtering that may need to touch the database

2132156
sorting	filtering
i know implementing filtering and sorting for an individual case is simple although it has some issues like using dynamic linq which is not yet a standard approach but creating a sorting or filtering tool which works in all cases is the idea i m looking for

2132318
realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc functions is unspeciï ed

2132319
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is valid for all three allocation functions ie calloc malloc and realloc

2132387

indeed aop would be the right tool here and i would write a little aspect to use jamon which can precisely gather statistics such as hits time statistics avg total min max concurrency statistics and more

2132454
getter	setter
in eclipse there is a source- generate getter setter can you do something similar to synthesize properties in xcode

2132454
getter	setter
i do know that synthesizing properties will generate getter setter for me but i am looking for a way to generate the property synthesize code by selecting the variables

2132517
getter	setter
generating getter and setter for properties is done with the property and the synthesize keywords

2132523
getter	setter
in eclipse there is a source- generate getter setter can you do something similar to synthesize properties in xcode

2132523
getter	setter
in your implementation if you want to generate getter and setter for my_array

2132524
prepare	execute
i m writing a semi-simple database wrapper class and want to have a fetching method which would operate automagically it should prepare each different statement only the first time around and just bind and execute the query on successive calls

jar	manifest.mf
when you use -jar then only the class-path attribute defined in the meta-inf manifest.mf file inside the jar file will influence the classpath

2132555
jar	manifest.mf
you could unpack the jar file with jar -xf mainprog.jar and look at the meta-inf manifest.mf file

2132571
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i think recent versions of safari opera and firefox support the nth-child css selector so thatâ s another option

2132599
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
how malloc realloc free do this is implementation-specific

2132599
free	realloc
you should never do this from your code it s only for use by realloc and free

2132638
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout or setinterval again

2132643
floating-point	fractions
and using floating-point values is more realistic - you need fractions values because when you rotate something the new coordinates will nearly always be non integral

2132670
mvp	presenter
q2 model view presenter mvp and model view controller mvc are two or one depending on your view common design patterns which help design guis so that everyone has the data they need

in ant it s easy to have multiple build targets to handle this but i m trying to determine the best way to handle this in maven

2132975
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

2132984
getter	setter
generally you want to use getter and setter for public field access and you don t want to have global public variables

2132987
equals	tostring
you can make sure that hashcode equals does what you want can override tostring for sensible logging and it probably reads much better anyway

2132999
jar	war
the maven philosophy is that each project should build one and only artifact jar war whatever

2132999
ant	maven
you can call ant from maven so if you really want to do this then i suggest you start looking at the maven ant plugin

2133058
inherited	properties
see here getproperties to return all properties for an interface inherited hierarchy

2133077
inherited	properties
you can define additional dependencies and libraries in them an make your projects inherited these properties

2133107
integer	unsigned
my opinion is for readability think about it if you were to look at 0 what does that mean does that mean its a unsigned integer or if it was 0x0 then instinctively it has something to do with binary notation more likely platform dependent

2133107
pascal	delphi
since the tag is language agnostic and the word null pointer in delphi object pascal it is nil in c# it is null in c c++ it is null

2133126
children	parent
example for a parent object with a collection of children the parent can have a addchild method that ensure the coherence of the bi-directional relationship

2133142
postgresql	mysql
we re on a linux apache postgresql php stack but a mysql supported installation is not the end of the world

2133147
min	max
i d just make two properties min max assign them the value of the first item you add to the array then each time you add a new item just check if its datetime is less or greater than the min max ones

2133147
min	max
its nice and fast and it will be much faster than iterating through the array each time you need to get min max

2133161
client-side	server-side
there is already a customvalidator validator control which can fire a client-side javascript method to evaluate the value or a server-side method to compare the values

2133206
setinterval	settimeout
n.b. don t pass strings to settimeout or setinterval - best practice is to pass an anonymous function or a function identifier as i did above

2133217
setinterval	settimeout
note that settimeout and setinterval are very different functions

2133229
google-chrome	firefox
the submit only works random in google-chrome and dont work in ie and firefox

2133238
sorting	grouping
sorting makes same elements grouping together and so makes checking for duplicates easy

2133383
stdout	stderr
instead read from the stdout or stderr attribute to read the output

2133383
stdout	stderr
if the process outputs to both stdout and stderr and you want to read it separately you will have to be careful to actually read from both without blocking or you can deadlock

2133386
cpu	processors
processors make and cpu type

2133388
free	realloc
one point nobody cared to talk about yet in your first program is that realloc with length 0 is the same thing as free

2133464
folder	directory
now i create an entry in the sites-available sites-enabled folder of my apache directory etc apache2 sites-available called mydomain.com

2133495

ssl	https
the responsetext will be a valid xml that i can manipulate but the webservice can be accessed both via http and https ssl and i must do it over https because authentication is required to do some stuff

2133562
inline	inlining
to avoid inlining along a deep call chain inlining stops when the accumulated inline bytecode size along the call chain exceeds 40 bytes. although they have runtime profiling information method call frequency they are still careful to avoid inlining large functions or chains of functions to prevent bloat

2133567
yslow	pagespeed
you can also test your page using yslow or pagespeed add-on for firebug

2133585
free	realloc
when you pass in a non-null pointer and size of zero to realloc realloc behaves as if youâ ve called free â

2133585
realloc	malloc
when you pass in a null pointer and size is non-zero realloc behaves as if youâ ve called malloc â

2133595
children	parent
practically i have a tree of elements like parent and children with a dept of more levels

2133643
width	margin
i have a block of jquery javascript code that sets the left margin of an image depending on the browser width

2133643
google-chrome	firefox
this works on ie firefox google-chrome

2133643
google-chrome	firefox
then firefox and google-chrome work fine using diff as a value for the images left-margin as i intended but ie throws a run time error and stops running the script citing an invalid argument in jquery file

2133644
move	drag
users would choose from the first box and either drag value items to the second for selection or would select items and then click a button to move them over to the 2nd box

tinyint	varchar
hi i m working on my first sqlite project and i was just wondering if sqlite supports all the same field type that mysql does e.g - datetime tinyint varchar ect

2133882
mouse	keyboard
besides the fact that you don t have to check for the specific mouse key it also has the advantage that this enables the user to create the context menu using the keyboard or maybe to use a totally different way if the user is working on a platform where context menus are requested via other means

2133905
put	get
it doesn t hurt if you put in more sections than these but this is enough to get dynamic linking working

2133961
stdout	stderr
that will start the process redirecting stdout and stderr to dev null

2133971
versioning	upgrade
that will effectively make your schema harder to upgrade when that versioning of sql server will be released

2133975
accessor	properties
the best way to do it that i ve found is actually to build a custom class that is based off of usercontrol give it a master properties with a get accessor that fishes through the this.page.parent until it stops encountering master pages if you are nesting this step is unnecessary otherwise and then return that web control as the type of the master page you want to use

2133995
vmware	bootcamp
i have the wcf service running on windows vista in a bootcamp partition on a macintosh hosted in vmware fusion self hosted mode

2133998
perl	tcl
perl tcl python etc

2134021
submit	submission
with the key scheme when the submit is received by the server submission for that key can be locked

2134022
post	get
need a function call that is designed solely to get the count of post matching a criteria

2134034
put	get
later within the body i manually inserted rows into a table so i could get rid of textfields content and put their contents in the table

2134056
post	get
but now i m trying to use it in a form and confused by post get etc

2134076
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are shared

2134076
stdout	stderr
process share the same stdin stdout and stderr filehandles

2134083
ienumerable	ienumerator
of course it will blow up at runtime because it returns a null ienumerator . but note the absence of ienumerable or any generics

2134096
richfaces	icefaces
however either of these would require you adding and setting up another library richfaces or icefaces which is probably not what you want

2134102
postgresql	mysql
i have confirmed as much on postgresql and mysql but i cannot find a resource for sql as a whole

2134150
jscrollpane	jviewport
given a vertical orientation it may be convenient to make the preferred size of the jscrollpane s jviewport an integral multiple of the message pane s height

2134152
put	get
put timers around so that you get a good feel of it

2134170
postgresql	mysql
unlike mysql and postgresql in oracle and sql server no internal datatypes can be used as boolean values in where clauses or when predicates

2134217
client-side	server-side
i guess i d suggest writing a procedure that takes a lower and upper bound for selecting records then writing a client-side program that forks off a few threads allocates a db connection per thread then calls the server-side procedure with appropriately-sized bounds say five threads with four million rows apiece

2134331
trojan	virus
edit from the link given by dth it appears that code downloads and executes a trojan virus called sinowal

2134341
button	checkbox
those checkbox can then be checked and then the button accept to group is clicked

2134375
children	parent
raveren s approach will stretch the parent div if the children are float right or float left

2134378
hide	show
you can then use javascript the smart way to show hide row details

2134381
public	protected
you can create header files in which you only declare the public and protected api

2134391
switching	screens
i m trying to create a utility similar to microsoft s abandoned super fast user switcher download which allows fast user switching without going through the welcome screens

2134403
ironruby	ironpython
apparently its against our corporate standard to be using ironruby or ironpython right now

2134420
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i do know the location of where the extensions will be after you download them under your profile folder and i was wondering where does google-chrome hides the crx after you install them

2134461
min	max
i have been trying out a few index views and am impressed but i nearly always need a max or a min as well and can not understand why it doesn t work with these can anyone explain why

2134461
min	max
is allowed why not min max i m looking for explanation.

2134465
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add
the matrix multiplication should use and for multiplying and or for add

2134494
min	max
aggregate functions like min max aren t supported in indexed views

2134494
min	max
you have to do the min max in the query surrounding the view

2134494
min	max
the avg max min stdev stdevp var

2134500
post	get
the only way i can get it to return the correct value for the post count is to change the myrecentposts2 calculation as follows.

2134509
opensymphony	webwork
webwork is part of the opensymphony set of components and is considered to be a nice and simple framework

2134524
xstream	dom4j
you can use dom4j xstream to read the xml into an equivalent java modal and then use jsonlib to convert into json

2134532
stdout	stderr
if you are unfortunate enough to come across an error in the ls command say the path doesn t exist for example or any other system command the output will be displayed to stderr causing it to display to the screen whether you like it or not which the backticks won t capture they will only get stdout

2134549
inherited	subclassing
my idea is to create an account models.model model with the following custom manager and subclassing it using multi-table inherited with all of my models

2134557
pop-up	dialog
we can t import a targets file without adding its path to the registry otherwise visual studio pop-up a security dialog asking for confirmation to load it

2134566
affinity	processors
the goal there is basically to set the processors affinity to core 0 which by looking at the windows task manager is working as expected

2134601
chown	chmod
you ll need to chown or chmod the auth file so that user can read it

2134617
postgresql	mysql
if i was getting a similar error with mysql or postgresql two systems i m more familiar with i d check to ensure that a database process was running and then attempt to connect manually to the database using the username password connection string

2134642
equals	gethashcode
just override gethashcode and equals - this allows you to use the object itself as the key in a dictionary with multiple values being taken into account

2134647
rss	feed
i have two sites with rss feed

2134647
rss	feed
in each site i gather the data and then pass it off to a simple formatter i wrote that does the work of creating the rss format so each site is essentially using the same code to generate the feed

2134657
capitalize	uppercase
i was wondering if there was any way using only css and this can be browser specific css to convert all uppercase text to words that are only initially capitalize for example

2134771
disk	ram
just like hibernate in laptop i would to write all the memory used by a process to disk free up the ram

2134798
int	chars
on the very high level i know that we need to wrap the primitive data types such as int and chars by using their respective wrapper classes to use them within java collections.i would like to understand how java collections work at the low level by asking why do we need to wrap primitive data types as objects to be able to use them in collections

2134801
public	protected
the design decision to allow for a protected virtual void dispose bool disposing method allows for extra flexibility that wouldn t be easily and safely handled in a public interface

2134805
filesystems	ntfs
to verify this mount a ntfs filesystems or whatever type you are mounting over samba on your local machine and see if you get the same coloring behavior from ls

2134812
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the viewdidload is called everytime as the viewwillappear

2134843
inherited	subclassing
alex s on-point diagnosis of the problem notwithstanding i would strongly argue that you should not multiply inherited from dict in this case or in general for that matter. while it may seem convenient to subclassing from it and automatically inherited all the dict behaviour dicts and builtin types in general are often subject to shortcuts internally

2134844
put	get
i understand the troubles you can get into when you put a using declaration inside a header file so i don t want to do that

2134864
int	chars	int	double
you can easily build your own collection class that doesn t need wrapper but at the end you will have to build one for each type chars int float double etc multiply by the types of the collections set map list + their implementation

2134888
getter	setter
in response to setter getter comment

2134890
min	max
other aggregates like min and max cannot be recomputed just by looking at the data that is being changed

2134890
min	max
if you delete the value that is currently the max or min then the new max or min has to be searched for and found in the entire table

2134914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
our website uses the superfish jquery plug-in for our menus and they work fine in firefox ie6 ie7 safari google-chrome etc

2134938
ienumerable	ienumerator
instead of collecting the values in a list you can return an ienumerator or ienumerable and use the yield keyword

2134953
cos	exp	cos	sin
most matlab functions will take vectors matrices as arguments including cos sin exp log etc

2134958
min	max
if app is a web server in cluster mode i could start a new instance with changed min max heap size and than shutdown initial instance

2134972
zoo	chron
i have imported data with a five minute interval into a zoo object where the index is a chron with both date and time

2135074
put	get
in all their examples they seem to put all the logic in the controller and just use the model to get and set data

2135129
int	double
when the compiler wants to infer the type of the mt it fails since k which is specified as the loop bound has one type probably something like double and the loop step implicitly the int constant 1 has the type int

2135149
hide	show
the problem is i can t get the divs to space accordingly in ie6 while having an effective hide show

2135149
hide	show
the problem is the show hide

2135149
hide	show
this isn t so bad for this small example but if there are many questions depending on a show hide large gaps start to appear between rows of questions

2135159
execvp	fork
i now call fork and execvp myself

2135159
execvp	fork
i fork and then in the child i close all the server sockets and then call execvp to execute the script

2135159
execvp	fork
based on that information i suspect it s something in my fork execvp code below.

2135164
vim	emacs
maybe the emacs plugin for bazaar created it and thats why vim doesn t care

2135184
versioning	upgrade
regarding telling it which to use unless you re running vs2010 you can t multi-target silverlight apps so when you open a sl project it will be upgrade to whatever versioning you have installed

2135207
put	get
they seem to put all the logic in the controller and just use the model to get and set data

2135230
hfs+	ntfs
for example ntfs fat32 hfs+ or ext3.

2135249
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox ie 7 and 8 and google-chrome

2135256
hide	show
wrap these in divs for hide show

2135256
hide	show
it finds the next element with the given class name and will hide show that element

2135257
stdout	stderr
sys.stderr is a file handle to stderr stdout is what print writes to

2135261
cvs	rcs
generally vc does not do what you would expect because it s designed for centralized version control systems such as rcs sccs cvs and subversion

2135262
post	put
you ll be able to see all the information that s been post put d to your rest service

2135272
zoo	chron
i don t believe that there s any way to do this built into zoo or chron but you can create your own function by using a little math

2135298
post	put	post	get	put	get
i ve gone through the firstresource bit of the restlet 1.1 tutorial and put together a web service that handles get post delete put by subclassing the resource class and overriding the appropriate methods and using a router to attach the subclassed resource classes

2135298
post	get
get post etc

2135302
realloc	malloc
the question is about realloc malloc 0 0

2135302
realloc	malloc
would the answer be same for realloc malloc 0 0

2135302
free	malloc
then the call is equivalent to free malloc 0

2135302
realloc	malloc
in this case malloc 0 and realloc malloc 0 0 are not equivalent

2135302
realloc	malloc
this will result in a call like realloc null 0 which would be equivalent to malloc 0 which may or may not return null

2135302
free	realloc
i am not sure if the omission in c99 is an oversight or if it means that in c99 realloc ptr 0 for non- null ptr is not equivalent to free ptr

2135302
realloc	malloc
in the second the malloc call is made twice whereas in the first you re passing a previously allocated pointer to realloc

2135302
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
also the return value from malloc on the lhs hasn t been free d yet so any other malloc calloc or realloc may not return that value

2135302
realloc	malloc
you won t see possible on the output unless both malloc and realloc fail and return null

2135428
maven	pom.xml
i typically add the jetty plugin to my pom.xml assuming you use maven and launch the web app in development using mvn clean jetty run

2135446
expression-blend	silverlight
from a tooling perspective - expression-blend is really a xaml designer that can target silverlight or wpf applications

2135501
gridview	formview
does anyone have an example of a formview with a gridview inside the edittemplate using c#

2135514
superclass	subclassing
one thing i haven t tried is to convert the subclassing to override the new designated initializer and see if the places in the code that use these cells now get the deprecation warning from the superclass

2135536
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	tomahawk	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	trinidad	richfaces	tomahawk	richfaces	icefaces	richfaces	trinidad	icefaces	tomahawk	icefaces	trinidad	tomahawk	trinidad
if you want sorting look at richfaces or another component framework icefaces primefaces trinidad tomahawk etc

2135539
implements	extends
you can extends iterator which will require that you implements the next and hasnext methods

2135539
implements	extends
but you will get more flexibility if you extends iterable which requires you implements elements or iterator in 2.8

2135542
postgresql	mysql
so from what you all are telling me this would be an equivalent mysql table schema of the original postgresql table

2135596
versioning	upgrade
yes this is possible there are multiple places tmp and documents that you can write files to - if you write the downloaded file to the documents directory the file will be available the next time you launch the app and will even persist between versioning of your app as it is upgrade

2135644
sudo	passwd
in addition is there a way to setup a command that runs sudo mycommand then enters the passwd

2135679
hide	show
if you show the loader element before the ajax call then hide it again in the success handler it should work allright

2135696
bash	zsh
these are sh zsh bash commands

2135787
gtk	fltk
gui support native or gtk wx fltk etc

2135830
hash	salt
don t store passwords in the db in plaintext store their hash sha1 with a salt works well

2135832
public	protected
somewhat more concerning it s going to make maintaining the code painful and will quite possibly cause issues when attempting to use visibility keywords such as private protected public depending on what ide you re using

2135838
oncreate	setcontentview
an activity doesn t have any knowledge of its view it just has its root window until you call setcontentview in the oncreate method

2135849
elf	coff
executable file formats see a list here for example coff xcoff elf

2135851
folder	directory
i have built a treeview control that lists the directory structure of any drive or folder

2135857
elf	coff
output of final executable in elf or coff format

2135857
elf	coff
note that there s a container of elf or coff format around the actual executable binary

2135870
codeigniter	kohana
i m also pretty sure that codeigniter has a basic auth module if not its not to late to switch to kohana for a good auth module and orm goodness

2135874
super	extends
i want something more like super where i could extends it as many times as i needed and each extension with alias its parent

2135905
bash	tcsh
i came also from csh tcsh to bash

2135905
unix	solaris
for scripting i would recommand ksh because it s available on most unixes solaris hp-ux osf 1 the best unix ever

2135905
put	get
sporadicaly you would like to get more then a number as return value from a function or you have some data that you can not put in a simple array or you need something that has better capabilities in case of regegs or what ever then i would propose perl

2135909
width	height
all i have is the size of the translating thumbnail and its coordinates like origin center width and height

2135927
width	height
it can also be done without ever seeing it visually if you switch the rotationz back once you get your width and height like so

2135940
children	parent
what i am trying to figure out is the best method of communication between the host mdi parent application and forms that will be in the .dlls which i intend to make mdi children

2135948
debugdiag	debugging
whenever i m debugging on a webserver windows debugdiag is good for memory dll issues

2135958
jobs	cron
by default cron executes its jobs using whatever your system s idea of sh is

2135974
move	drag
ctaskbar supports multiple task bars that the user can rearrange at will each of which can have multiple tiled and or tabbed panes and for example the user can not only move a complete task bar by dragging but also drag panes between task bars drag a pane out on its own to become a separate task bar etc

2135976
put	get
i need to get information from a php file and put the information in jquery and i also need to know if the information has changed

2135991
width	height
i would expect the result to be x -5 y -3 width 5 height 3

2136002
google-chrome	firefox
this code perfectly works in google-chrome and even ie but not in firefox

2136029
actualheight	actualwidth
you can determine the origin of a control using a generaltransform on point 0 0 to the root visual coordinate system and actualheight and actualwidth are surfaced directly

2136029
width	height
in the sample above i have transformed -1 -1 and added 2 to both height and width to compensate for the single pixel border region around an iframe - this code is lifted from a working application that uses an iframe to render embedded html when browser hosted

2136125
google-chrome	firefox
if i include jquery 1.4 and wire up a live click event to anything on the page whether it exists or does not this unrelated event handler stops working as expected in ie and continues to work in firefox and google-chrome

2136184
folder	directory
the way i do this is that i have a styles directory under my theme folder and inside of that i have a single folder for every one of my templates that work with the theme

2136214
freebsd	linux
i say generally because sometimes -- if the os vendors care enough -- it is possible -- like freebsd executing linux binaries or wine implementing a large part of the win32 runtime

2136292
rss	feed
then using simplexml you can parse the rss feed

2136308
ienumerable	ienumerator
encapsulate as a composed field inside custom class mydictionary and implement a custom ienumerable and ienumerator or variations thereof for mydictionary or make a method that implements handy c# yield keyword to produce the items .

2136344
post	put
i was wondering if i have some simple authentication system in place like authlogic how does one use curl to post and put data and even before talking about posting and putting data how does one login with curl and have the server remember or have curl remember that it is logged in

2136404
mbunit	nunit
fyi the latest nunit includes the features that mbunit set out to add to unit testing

2136442
gdal	ogr
check gdal ogr which is two libraries in one - gdal for raster data and ogr for vector data

ubuntu	centos
i m getting this problem on both on centos 5.3 w php 5.2.6 apache 2.2.3 and ubuntu 8.04 w php 5.2.4 apache 2.2.8

2136455
svg	vml
svg on standard-based browsers rendered as vml in ie

2136455
svg	vml
so unless you intend to build static graphs with no event handling svg vml solutions should be better

2136455
svg	vml
for svg vml solutions there are many options including

2136455
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
raphael is a very active well maintained and mature open-source graphic library with very good cross-browser support including ie 6 to 8 firefox opera safari google-chrome and konqueror

2136460
gdal	proj	gdal	ogr	proj	ogr
most of my time i work with cadcorp sis technologies as well as with large number of free and open source software for gis proj mainly those from the osgeo foundation stack like gdal ogr geos proj.4 postgis as well as boost.geometry aka generic geometry library - mainly as a programmer and contributor but also as a user of course

2136469
put	get
we removed the option completely in beta 2 and still didn t get very much negative feedback until the last 2 weeks at which point it has become too late for us to put it back in for rtm at least

2136489
vbscript	jscript
you can write code for asp in any language for which an activescripting engine exists ruby via activeruby but most commonly one would write code in either vbscript or jscript

2136489
vbscript	jscript
which brings us to the third reason the implementations of vbscript and jscript that ship with windows as well as activeruby and all other activescripting engines that i know of are pure interpreters they cannot compile

2136506
realloc	malloc
let the user supply a which points to a buffer that your function will allocate using a combination of malloc and realloc if needed

2136524
put	get
i am trying to use the debugger in a thread but the values of the watched variables dont get updated in them unless i remove the break point make it run for a while then put break point back

2136540
idictionary	ilist
looking at your code if you want to bind to an idictionary not an ilist you can use key value pairs in the view instead

2136560
free	malloc
but perhaps you don t trust malloc and free not to cause fragmentation in the long run or have some other reason to prefer the static buffer solution

2136601
post	put
not sure if this is the only problem with the code though can you put an example up on jsbin and post the url as an edit in your question

2136609
opera	firefox
explorer mozilla firefox opera and

2136631
solaris	aix
it works fine on macos x and linux and hp-ux and aix and solaris

2136634
inherited	properties
modular scripting in filemaker adapts the inherited properties of object-oriented programming to the particular grain of how filemaker works

2136642
udp	tcp
or switch to using udp if you don t actually need tcp s reliability although this isn t its proper name think of udp as the unreliable datagram protocol in other words there s no guarantee of delivery nor of delivery in the correct order

2136650
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval not settimeout

2136696
children	parent
put it another way if none of the children components receives click event will the click event passed through to their parent the layout

2136699
client-side	server-side
when i move the group_concats from the cool_json field they work as expected but i d like my data formatted as json so i can decode it server-side or client-side in one step

2136724
pull	push
in git i d do this with temporary private branches that i d push and pull between my machines

2136833
rss	feed
what would be the architecture of the generic solution using these tools to aggregate several rss feed and then query the result

2136850
width	height
i draw the rectangle from the image s x y position with its width height being what the image reports

2136850
width	height
however after rotating a rectangular image its new width and height is much bigger as these two screenshots should help clarify during rotation and after rotating then rotating again -- the little handles show where the images x y width height extends to

2136905
int	boolean
if it makes a difference my data is just int and boolean

2136907
g++	gcc
those are finally will pass to gcc g++ -d.

2137020
maven	m2e
if you are using m2e then just import your project as a maven project right-click the package explorer then import.

2137020
maven	m2e
update did you install the maven integration for wtp optional when installing m2e

2137023
put	get
you can put the tasks in threads when you get want them to run

2137038
scipy	scikit-learn
in numpy scipy you have several choices note answer updated in dec 12 to reflect updates in scikit-learn library

2137041
lua	scheme
in alphabetical order lua perl postscript python and ruby are all wildly successful and icon scheme and squeak smalltalk are moderately successful

2137052
post	get
edit i have managed to get rid of this problem but i will post some code anyway to point my plan

2137078
uiview	subviews
a uiview can contain many subviews of any type they all inherit from uiview

2137078
uiview	subviews
uiview have an ivar subviews which is an array of subviews

2137078
uiview	uiwindow
i assume you mean not full screen generally the topmost view is a uiwindow and to this you add any uiview subclass you like such as uislider

2137078
uiview	subviews
your uiview has a subviews uitabview i don t know specifically but i would guess it has two subviews one of which is visible at a time and one of these is the uitableview

2137086
pop-up	dialog
i created a java program that will pop-up a dialog and scheduled it as a task

2137086
pop-up	dialog
everything works fine except when the scheduled java program runs and the dialog pop-up there is another window svchost.exe hanging behind the dialog box and doesn t go anywhere until the java program finishes its execution

2137091
post	get
but without .aspx - get work fine but post redirects me onto itself but with get

2137091
post	get
a browser according to the http specification must redirect the request using same method post in this case but instead it handles 302 as if it is 303 and issues get request for the new url

2137149
keyevent	keyrelease
have you tried registering a keylistener with a custom implementation of keyrelease keyevent e

2137150
children	parent
i also want children classes to inherit from this and other classes to get parent s features

2137183
strlen	substr
if the string has new line characters in it you ll need to split it around the new line characters and then call strlen on each substr

2137217
width	height
say i have the url of an image is there an easy way to get it s height width using php

2137220
pull	push
push and pull to that from all your machines and promote -devel into formal with a push when you re ready

2137220
pull	push
either way though push and pull are all you need to keep in-progress work going to from a -devel repo or versioned queue and then migrate up to central when you re ready

2137223
width	height
with the file type and a height width

2137223
width	height
the width and the height of the image

2137223
width	height
also there is imagesx and imagesy functions to get width and height of images individually

all 3 of those nodes on the xsd have min 0 max unbounded

2139219

2139703
factors	matrix
after a satisfactory rotation the rotated factors loading matrix l will have the same ability to represent the correlation matrix and it can be used as the factors loading matrix instead of the unrotated matrix l

2139703
factors	matrix
the purpose of rotation is to make the rotated factors loading matrix have some desirable properties

2139703
factors	matrix
one of the methods used is to rotate the factors loading matrix such that the rotated matrix will have a simple structure

2139703
factors	matrix
each row of the factors matrix should contain at least one zero

2139703
factors	matrix
if there are m common factors each column of the factors matrix should have at least m zeros

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix there should be several variables for which entries approach zero in the one column but not in the other

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix a large proportion of the variables should have entries approaching zero in both columns when there are four or more factors

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix there should be only a small number of variables with nonzero entries in both columns

2139703
versioning	upgrade
a new versioning if i would ever tried to upgrade it would accept a 3d matrix a set of 2d matrices as an argument and the algorithm should return the one that better fits the above criteria

2139703
factors	matrix
p.s.2 from the same book a test of successful factors analysis is the extent to which it can reproduce the original corr matrix

2139741

you can hide and show the complete taskbar by using this code

2139818
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
if you re wrong about your assumption about the type your program will fail immediately and you ll be able to see the cause of failure immediately rather than waiting for a nullreferenceexception or argumentnullexception or even a logical error sometime in the future

2139831
intersect	contains
how can i check if another uiimageview rectangular or not intersect or contains a point in that object not its frame

2139862
google-chrome	firefox
thanks gazler although there was no problem with actual html and firefox error console didn t show any messages i checked developers tools in google-chrome and it said that div tag was inside table body which apparently caused all the troubles

2139871
int	chars
assuming you re using c# you can get the 16-bit chars of strings as int using

2139877
put	get
however the issue is for example if users input data with say more than 1 whitespace or if they put some of the text in a new line etc the pattern does not get picked up because it doesn t exactly match the pattern set

2139915
post	get
what you can do is assuming this is happening on a web server place a get post to a php script passing in any necessary parameters to execute the right php method

2139933
uilabel	uibutton
for example if you have a property defined for a uilabel called label inside of the uiviewcontroller-derived class that hosts it the code would look something like this an example of an event handler for a uibutton touch up inside event

2139945
put	get
i think once you get the range it fixes up the html but when you put it back in it could cause problems

2139979
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i have tried subclassing the uitableviewcontroller and looking at events such as viewdidload and viewdidappear unfortunatly also in these events the cells aren t drawn yet

2139983

2140134
post	get
so use wp_query as you normally would to get the specific list of post that you re after and change the fields that are pulled to get the count wp_posts.id

2140134
post	get
also make sure you change posts_per_page to -1 so that you get all post

2140137
hash	md5
take for example the md5 hash string -- it has 128 bits that means 2 128 different hash can be generated

2140137
hash	md5
even taking into account the birthday paradox it is highly unlikely that a string which isn t the actual password can be found to generate the hash value of course md5 has been found insecure but that s another issue md5 is just an example

2140182
int	chars
now i have an ambiguity when calling foo s constructor with should the template argument be int or chars

2140191
implements	extends
when you extends the mapview there are only a few methods that you need to implements and they are really straight forward

2140196
superclass	subclassing
alternatively if you want to allow subclassing you should test only for properties that are in the superclass

2140236
comparator	icomparer
just write an icomparer that would work as a chain of comparator

2140241
dictionary	map
so if at all possible depending on the size having a huge memory map hashtable dictionary with just keys the actual words may be an option and would be quick as lightning

2140246
maven	cargo
cargo maven plugin doesn t support deployment to remote weblogic

2140254
width	height
i want the contents of the togglepanel whatever facet is active at that case to have width 100 and height 100

all of my accounts with financial information have different and good passwords but i use the same not-so-strong password on assorted forums. with salt and hash it s not possible to tell if my password on site a is the same as on site b even with both password tables

2140289
prepare	execute
this is most often done by using some sort of prepare statement where your parameters are injected via a mechanism that prevents arbitrary sql from being execute

2140320
textview	imageview
i would think it wouldn t be that difficult to get a horizontally centered imageview with a horizontally centered textview below it then just tweak the image dimensions and the text size till they look just like other icons on the home screen

2140320
switching	screens
as for the problem you are seeing when you switching to landscape view on your home screens you will need to provide a landscape version of your layout xml file tweaked to display correctly in landscape mode

2140320
portrait	landscape
when i make app widgets i usually get the portrait view looking perfect then copy that layout file to the layout-land directory and start making tweaks until it looks like i want it to in landscape as well

2140322
clang	llvm
both the msp430 and the arm family have gcc solutions as well as it is easy to use build and use llvm with its clang llvm has a 64 bit problem with its gcc front end

put	get
i have spent some time recently fiddling with an opencore msp430 which you could put in an fpga and get more memory and speed and features if you like could even add usb if you wanted

2140418
int	chars
memcpy is not type-safe because you can easily copy the memory of some int into a chars array and end up with meaningless data

2140424
atomic	interlocked
this doesn t need volatile in fact you d get a warning if you had it because interlocked already ensures an atomic update

2140435
memcpy	memmove
type-safe alternative to memcpy for arrays and containers could be std copy in - it may be implemented in terms of memmove if all involved types satisfy certain requirements otherwise it performs assignments - with some classes you can break certain invariants if you bypass their public interface and just go and move copy them around in memory for example i suppose any class with a non-trivial copy constructor is going to misbehave if you make copies of it with memcpy

2140478
teamcity	ncover
the command you posted looks correct check the rest of the teamcity build log to see the entire command that they re sending to ncover

2140492

2141111
ssl	https
my task is to make it secure using https ssl or tsl

width	height
instead of reacting to a resizeevent which will fire every frame during a resize if you hit maximize and it takes 3 frames for the component to redraw from widh ehight 0 to width height maxvalue then the resize event will fire three times you could watch the properties of width and height

2141223
width	height
this will in effect watch the properties similar to data binding and execute your resizehandler whenever the width or height change

2141223
width	height
this has a slight drawback as to firing your handler twice if width and height change at the same time but that can be solved with a third function that does the work which gets invoked by your handlers if it isn t schedule to be invoked

2141223
width	height
i prefer the change watcher method because it fires after the width and height properties have changed unlike a resize event wich fires before the width and height properties are correclty updated

2141254
children	parent
if you can id the parent then you could do something like this to get the children

2141268
google-chrome	safari
the hover background-color of the rightmost list item about us is cut off at the very right edge of the text seemingly only in webkit tested safari and google-chrome in windows xp

2141289
folder	directory
short from storing the dll in the same folder as the exe you can store it in a directory that s listed on the path environment variable

2141307
realloc	memset
write your own function say reallocz that accepts the current size as a parameter and calls realloc and memset for you

2141312
httphandler	httpmodule
note that i say practical way you could write an httphandler or httpmodule that handles all of the interaction but you d be reinventing the wheel

2141319
ssl	https
my task is to make it secure using https ssl or tsl

2141336
put	get
that is it has a data structure that needs to be persistent and a ui to let the user put information into that data structure and get it out

2141337
profiler	yourkit
i have a problem with a java memory leak which for some reason does not show up in my profiler yourkit

2141338
public	protected
as to why you would actually make something public in base but private in derived without private or protected inheritance is beyond me

2141355
getter	setter
date setter and getter

2141399
inherited	properties
you add a class that inherited from system.configuration.install.installer create a serviceinstaller and add that serviceinstaller to the installers properties

2141417
move	drag
i have tried moving the files using the repo-browser right-click drag the files and select move items to here as well in the working folder right-click drag select svn move versioned files here and commit the parent folder

2141437
jhat	jvisualvm
to analyze the dump you could use jvisualvm or jhat

2141455
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout slidedown etc - all these are nice but animate is the granddady of them all

2141455
addclass	removeclass
if you don t need to animate properties only change them it s much cleaner to define css classes and use addclass and removeclass or toggleclass

2141499
folder	directory
there is no concept of folder or directory in s3

2141503
many-to-many	one-to-many
this code sample includes a step-by-step guide about how to work with entity data model in various ways including one-to-many association many-to-many association one-to-one association table merging table splitting table-per-hierarchy inheritance and table-per-type inheritance

2141510
cassini	iis
you will then have to have your projects kick up with iis instead of cassini which takes a little bit of work but i think it will solve the problem with oracle at least

2141574
udp	tcp
as i understand it your application is supposed to receive some udp messages and pass them onto a client or clients connected on a tcp socket

2141574
udp	tcp
what do you do with udp messages received when there is no client connected on the tcp socket

2141574
udp	tcp
every time a message is received on the udp socket send it over the tcp socket

2141574
udp	tcp
once the tcp client disconnects tear down udp socket go back to waiting for tcp connections

teamcity	nant
teamcity is very easy to get up and running if you have msbuild or nant scripts set up to build your projects

2141639
gtk	vte
an implementation that might be easier to read is vte terminal which gnome uses since it ll be mapping between vt100 and glib gtk which is probably a lot closer to what mac os x provides

ogre	irrlicht
personally if i had a project and was trying to convert from one solution to the other i would actually try to convert to a rendering library that supports both such as ogre irrlicht or a commercial engine

2141695
direct3d	directx
on the other hand faking directx direct3d with opengl could be much harder because you have to support the whole com thing

int	boolean
the third option is intended for functions which are convenient and natural to be called within conditions and i usually emulate a boolean type here by using int values 1 and 0

2141857
getter	setter
in oo c++ java i tend to use getsomething and setsomething because very often if not always i am either getting a private attribute from the class representing that data object or setting it - the getter setter pair

this behaviour is the same on google-chrome 4 and firefox 3.6 however it works as i expected in ie8

2142030

mef	prism
testability and decoupling seem to be the main focus of these non-datatemplate v-vm creation relationship designs and articles and often they have to do with mef or prism

2142277

any good links to articles covering these topics is appreciated provided they are not mef prism related

post	get
you don t really know how the data got to you since it carries post get and cookie data

2142516
postgresql	mysql
update mysql does not have a rank function ms sql oracle postgresql have one

2142531
post	get
refers to all sorts of requests get post etc..

2142534
post	get
get requests should be idempotent and post requests are generally not

2142534
post	get
if your application is using data from it will behave the same for both get and post requests which violates the idempotence of get

2142541
ssl	https
according to msdn https is provided externally to wcf which means tls ssl cipher suite and certificate selection are not possible programmatically

2142546
post	get
it gives you the flexibility to use get or post which can come in handy for things like search forms where most of the time data is posted but sometimes you ll want to say link to a particular search so you can use get parameters instead

2142546
post	get
also if you look at many other languages asp.net for example they make no distinction between get and post variables at all

2142546
post	get
i ve never used request to get cookie values but i think kyle butt makes a great point in the comments on this post about that

2142546
post	get
so if you have the same variable passed in via both post and get which one actually gets into request depends on those ini settings

2142565
post	get
it s important to understand when to use post when to use get and when to use a cookie

2142565
post	get
if you expect to get the value from a post or a get or from a cookie it s more informative to someone reading your code to use the specific variable instead of _request

2142586
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu linux development machine and a macbook that i work on

2142586
emacs	textmate
i think it looks like one tab in textmate is for some reason several tabs in emacs

2142586
emacs	textmate
so my code takes up the entire screen in emacs but only the left part of the screen in textmate

2142612
emacs	textmate
for instance if you want 4 spaces per tab then you need to make sure that emacs and textmate are both set up to use 4 spaces per tab

2142662
udp	tcp
if udp ends up being a bit too unreliable it does not guarantee the data will arrive where it is sent you could also try tcp connections

2142662
udp	tcp
with udp you re looking at just about 10 lines of code to send and receive data with tcp is a bit more but more reliable

2142662
udp	tcp
then send that data via tcp or udp

2142667
getter	setter
can i use the normal getter setter methods to get set the blob data from a mrblobby object

2142677
cpu	processors
the vmr7 is the least processors intensive 6 - 7 cpu but worst quality the evr 8 - 12 cpu is a little more efficient than the vmr9 12 - 13 cpu however they both look similar

2142684
merb	ruby-on-rails
not all do and even fewer will in the future as ruby-on-rails 3 the merger of ruby-on-rails and merb uncouples activerecord

2142691
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
you would then respond to your uiimageview s touches in each object s touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended methods

2142699
udp	tcp
you will likely want to use tcp or udp directly and send recieve the raw bytes

2142702
put	get
if anything the productivity you get depends on how much effort your willing to put in to learning the tools which goes for just about any ide but it did fit my style of software development better than eclipse

2142703
google-chrome	firefox
in both ie7 and firefox but not google-chrome or ie6 the layout of this page is very odd

2142710
put	get
get a solid-state drive and put your os and development tools on it

xlwt	xlutils
there is a set of cross platform python utilities - called xlrd xlwt and xlutils - for reading writing excel files

2142753
accessor	properties	inline	inlining
in addition to preventing the compiler from inlining very small methods simple properties accessor are inline very often the lookup takes a couple of cycles

2142754
post	get
for a plain idempotent request usually submitted via get there s the possibility the amount of data you want won t fit in a url so it has be mutated to a post request instead as a practical matter

2142754
post	get
no the problem with is nothing to do with conflating get and post parameters

2142755
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m new at this but it works in firefox and yet breaks in google-chrome and safari

2142776
public	protected
a friend of derived can access exactly what derived itself can - that is any member of derived and any public or protected member of any base class or of any public or protected grand-parent class but not any private members of base classes or members of private grand-parent classes

2142823
post	get
as such if one tends to use everywhere i can do anything via get that i could via post which means setting up tags on my malicious site that cause users logged into your e-commerce module to purchase products silently or i can cause them to click on links that will result in dangerous actions or the revelation of sensitive information probably to me

2142823
post	get
referencing my example from above it is perfectly reasonable to allow the response format variable to be sent via get or post

2142825
width	height
i ve got a map in a gwt app up at - i want the map to cover 100 of the height and width of its container

2142845
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2142854
stdout	stderr
note that fds 0 stdin 1 stdout 2 stderr by default but these can of course be re-directed or closed typically if you are a daemon you close your file descriptors and re-open the ones you want

2142889
arp	dhcp
if you are trying to get the mac s and ip s it would be better to use the arp -s command instead of looking at the dhcp lease file

2142898
jquery	simplemodal
i m using eric martin s sweet simplemodal jquery plugin

2142916
mouse	keyboard
everything done with the mouse only extra actions like keyboard keypress not required

2142955
firefox	safari
is there a way to communicate with usb devices within regular browser firefox safari ie8 etc

2143015
serializable	deserialization
you could create your own persistence service that can handle this situation either by supporting conversion of the old workflow into the new workflow or something more abstract like a persistence service that serializable as xml json something that might more easily support deserialization of one version as another version

2143022
int	chars
is there a way to initialize the variable in both cases t class t int chars bool ...

2143032
width	height
i guess this is to make up for sizes where the width isn t a multiple of the number of columns or the height isn t a multiple of the number of rows

2143034
int	chars
int float chars don t have any data members or methods

2143042
post	get
exists it will always overwrite the get post content and therefore

2143042
post	get
it is not about the fact that someone can forge get post

2143042
post	get
it is about the fact that cookies will overwrite get and post data in

2143042
post	get
variable_order sets the order of the egpcs environment get post cookie and server variable parsing

2143042
post	get
but then again you might also consider not using _request altogether simply because in php you can access environment get post cookie and server in their own globals and have one attack vector less

2143042
post	get
_request to mean get or post not realizing that it could also contain

2143045
int	chars
int chars and other ordinal types do not have method tables so there s no way to add methods or override them which is really the heart of inheritance

2143087
getter	setter
i ve read in the eclipse help that it is possible to delete getter and setter together with a field

2143087
getter	setter
in the eclipse help file the following is written when you delete a field from within a view eclipse can propose deleting its getter and setter methods

2143087
getter	setter
if you use a name prefix or suffix for fields be sure to specify this in the java code style preference page. the way i understand it eclipse should somehow ask me if i want to delete the getter and setter methods for a field that i just removed without any special configuration

2143090
debian	linux	unix	bsd
it does a little more and comes from bsd or more exactly at t unix as the manpage says so if you are on linux you may need to install an additional package on debian its in bsdmainutils .

2143091
hide	show
that normally has the icon to show hide the keypad

2143111
put	get
finally i wish i could recommend a book to get you started but alas i ve never considered trying this so i ve never put anytime in researching this

2143134
getter	setter
this doesn t seem to work from the source editor however try deleting a field from the outline view of the class - there it does offer to delete the getter setter too

2143171
getter	setter
little off topic but get rid of all your getter setter

2143171
getter	setter
it is because the getter setter method is linked to the field in the outline view

2143188
dictionary	map
map as dictionary and you get your datastructure

2143202
gif	png
i need a preg_match syntax or something similar to extract jpg or png or gif urls from a mixed text and put them in an array or at last store the first url

2143202
gif	png
maybe some syntax which searchs for strings that are beginning with http and ending with jpg png gif

2143210
width	height
right now i was going by the ratio of width and height

2143216
hid	keyboard
if your cc and barcode scanners work as hid devices basically keyboard emulation yes you can and i have seen it done

2143250
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i am using vb.net and have 50 checkbox that shall show up from the database data depending on the selected value of the previous dropdownlistfor

2143252
stdout	stderr
svn command line errors go to stderr not stdout which is why you aren t able to see them

2143252
stdout	stderr
what you want to do is redirect stderr to stdout and then to determine the cause of the error

2143252
stdout	stderr
this is not ideal because it mixes stderr with stdout when it would otherwise be unnecessary but i don t know of another way to get the desired output in this case

2143265
superclass	subclassing
this will call the - id initwithframe from your subclassing instead of the superclass and perform your custom code

2143265
superclass	subclassing
this also sends the calls to your subclassing instead of to the superclass

2143272
qabstracttablemodel	qmap
i have a class which inherits qabstracttablemodel and holds some complex structs in a qmap

2143300
public	protected
i m maintaining a rails app that has content in the public folder that will now need to be protected by a login

2143315
typedef	struct
edit i was experiencing the above extraneous old-style parameter list error because i was using the typedef name stack rather than using the struct keyword with stack to define it was the structure i am currently defining

2143344
config	ini
essentially nini is a simple ini read write library for config files

2143345
uiview	subviews
so the uiview will have 2 subviews

2143354
memset	malloc
i want to construct read malloc and memset my hashtable in c

2143370
for-loop	loops
and then display the timeline by a for-loop to loops through the hours of the day

2143377
post	get
imo get and post are two different animals and i can t think of a good reason why you would ever need to mix post data and query strings

2143377
post	get
it can be convenient to use _request when your scripts might respond to either get or post in the same manner

2143377
put	get
in addition to the security problems and wtfs caused by cookies and environment variables in the request variable don t get me started on global consider what might happen in the future if php started natively supporting other methods such as put and delete

2143377
post	get
is post safer than get

2143377
post	get
however the question was not about the merits of get vs post it was about how the receiver should treat the incoming data and why it s bad to merge it so this is really just a btw

2143388
mouseover	mouseout
when i mouseout of the floating box and on to canada it will trigger the mouseover event for canada

2143388
mouseover	mouseout
however if i mouseover the floating box again the swf doesn t receive the mouseout event so canada stays highlighted

2143388
mouseover	mouseleave
that way you can simulate the mouseleave event to reset the country highlight and popups then when the mouseleave the floating box you can check to see if the mouse is over a country and perform the mouseover event normally

2143405
listview	gridview
this listview uses a gridview with two columns each templated appropriately one column is the caption just a label and the other column is the control

2143419
apache	nginx
the best way of doing this that i know of is the x-sendfile header which is supported by nginx apache with module and others

2143423
stdout	stderr
just what you need is to make sure you re not inserting weird data to the script to avoid any breaks and to redirect stderr to stdout to avoid to have errors and not to be able to see them

2143441
zsh	tcsh
i m quite certain you could easily google other good alternatives such as zsh or tcsh

2143457
rss	feed
in fact for parsing of rss feed without jquery you can use the google ajax feed api

2143476
int	double
i need to cast a double to an int in java but the numerical value must always round down

2143485
min	max
however the above might pull the min and max for the entire list not for each a.id

2143489
qmap	qdatastream
on the receiving end you can get your data structure qmap if that s what you want to use back out of the qdatastream

2143502
int	double
casting a double to an int does not round it ll discard the fraction part

2143559
maven	pom.xml
we use maven 2 and what i was thinking is to do something like a maven project that pulls the dependencies using dependencymanagement from the parent pom.xml and the default goal is something like unjar all the dependencies and jar them in a unique jar

2143579
addclass	removeclass
it s the addclass removeclass .extend functions that i think are the problem but i can t seem to successfully convert it to work with jquery v1.3.2

2143598
groovy	gsp
i m new to grails groovy and gsp

bigloo	gambit
there is gambit scheme mit scheme plt scheme chicken scheme bigloo larceny ..

2143605
lisp	scheme
yet there s not to my knowledge a single popular scheme lisp on llvm even though llvm provides lots of nice things like

2143605
lisp	scheme
so why is it that there isn t a good scheme lisp on llvm

2143611
width	height
a div 100 of the window height 50 of the width left 0 red

2143611
width	height
a div 100 of the window height 50 of the width left 50 green

2143646
pull	push
you can now replace foo-clean .hg hgrc with foo .hg hgrc in order to preserve your repository-local settings such as the default push pull path

2143657
post	get
you should implement something like the post redirect get pattern and redirect to another view at the end of your action methods after all validations were verified and everything executed fine

2143664
getter	setter
as far as i know there is no way to use the old prototyping methodology for getter setter infact i believe the grand total of internal flex sdk classes that use any type of prototyping is 0

2143664
getter	setter
in any case getter setter aren t available in the prototype-hacking game

2143722
postgresql	mysql
personally i love postgresql -- but other free dbs such as mysql or if you have reasonably small amounts of data -- a few gb at most -- even the sqlite that comes with python will be fine too

2143765
post	get
this relies on post redirect get pattern - which is a good practice anyway

2143771
updatepanel	onclientclick
you make an onclientclick event on targetcontrolid for init tinymce if you use also an updatepanel

2143772
getdate	datepart
select datepart dw getdate

2143792
subtract	add
so each time you add subtract from your foolist you ll have to redo all your lookup objects

2143799
tunnel	vpn
you would need to set up a vpn tunnel to your private network

2143843
mouseup	mousedown
edits can be encoded as actions tool mousedown movement mouseup before they are rendered into pixels - this allows a cheap paint to be done as patches at the current mipmap level and quickly displayed while a background thread creates patches at the other mipmap levels

2143848
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code which works in firefox google-chrome

2143859
hide	show
what i had intended to add in was how this would be achieved in the case of show hide toggling these with an animation speed code above changed accordingly

2143879
put	get
now thread 1 wakes back up and tries to get lock b and will be put to sleep

2143940
division	multiplication
i hate to say it but i don t handle this in my code since i don t use bit shifting for multiplication or division

2143994
unix	bsd
shebangs are only native to the filesystems of unix linux bsd variants due to their design and layout the filesystem knows that when a file begins with a shebang the filesystem triggers the user s terminal process to invoke the shell based on the shebang usually bin sh

2144012
value-initialization	rvalue
the expression t where t is a simple-type-specifier 7.1.5.2 for a non-array complete object type or the possibly cv-qualified void type creates an rvalue of the specified type which is value-initialization

2144037
min	max
can i set the heap size min max bt entering the following into the catalina.sh file

2144042
public	protected
promoting a private protected virtual method to public in a derived class does not expose the base class method

2144065
put	get
i was wondering how to do this in iis and how he put a slash in between the script and the get variables and how he had the script with no extension in the first place

2144070
svg	vml
the library will then handle this outputting to svg if supported or fallback to canvas vml flash silverlight etc if not depending on what s available

2144091
put	get
when i put the variable name into a textbox i get the correct text

2144111
centos	linux
os linux centos 5

2144190
folder	directory
i think the right way to do this is to go to the project properties click on mapping and then enter the path to the web folder in the remote directory and local directory parts and url pointing at the main site

2144204
portrait	landscape
what i m trying to do is create a series of uniform thumbnail images always 68 x 46 from a variety of larger images some portrait some landscape

2144204
width	height
in both cases resizing the image to fill the height or width of the thumbnail and then cropping the excess image equally off either side top bottom left right

2144206
folder	directory
the cms system running as a virtual directory gives the admin the ability to upload photos for display on the main site the target folder of which is www.mysite.com images - when attempting disk access from the root app i am able to write to the virtual directory but cannot do the opposite -- that is write to the root from the virtual directory getting security violations

2144206
folder	directory
if i can only upload to the admin virtual directory the entire point is moot because it s a secured folder that the public can t see

2144214
width	height
it is sized to content width and height and works well in that regard

2144214
width	height
the width and height can change

2144214
width	height
when positioning the window lets say in the bottom right corner i simply take the workingarea of the screen width and height and then minus the width height of the window to get the top and left position that i need

2144214
width	height
the logic works but the trouble i am having is the window s height and width is not returning the size it is after the content was updated but is returning the size it was the last time it was displayed

2144214
width	height
does anyone have any idea how i might get an accurate width and height of this window before it is faded in

2144216
gif	png
if you re not opposed to python one option would be to use the python imaging library pil which provides python bindings for native decoders for many file formats including png and gif

2144226
ready	each
instead of each command saying yes i m ready or no i m not which will be the same for each command just have lastrun and interval fields which main can then use to determine when each command needs to run

2144234
children	parent
assuming you have a db with parent and children have a look at

2144294
cassini	iis
i assume that your login form has an external css file and that you re using cassini or iis 7 integrated mode

2144301
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the reason why this is recommended is because it makes setting of environment variables needed for your installation portable you can easily copy setenv.sh to other tomcat installation you can upgrade tomcat to a newer versioning which might overwrite catalina.sh but still have your existing setenv.sh

2144304
typedef	typename
nevertheless for portability you can use a typedef uint16_t or uint64_t although those might not be right or quote the typename with a template

2144304
unsigned	short
that leaves unsigned short unsigned char and signed char as the only types you can t easily explicitly construct

2144307
getter	setter
secondly if you are setting the dependency property from xaml the getter setter is not used the dependency mechanism uses its own internal setter routines

2144332
switching	screens
this way i could easily control the logic to switching between screens like

2144340
single-quotes	double-quotes
in both cases you re nesting single-quotes directly inside double-quotes which i don t think is correct

2144341
qtimer	qthread
i have done this before with a qthread but this time i would like to do it with a qtimer

2144350
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been working on a website that is very jquery intensive in google-chrome and firefox

2144350
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to see what the website is supposed to do open it in firefox or google-chrome

2144398
min	max
that would give you the following min and max number of intervals shown afterwards

2144423
expressionengine	joomla
so i m new to both joomla and expressionengine and want to know if i can use it like i d like

2144432
free	malloc
all in all each and everyone within the dev team have their own responsibility to ensure the code works and know the rules about memory management for example such as for every malloc there should be a free for every new there should be a delete but no blame should be accounted for the dev team themselves neither is finger pointing at the management for piling on the pressure on the dev team either

2144456
width	height
or even by calculating the width and height of css to preserve the proportions and make the image touch the box from inside like

2144502
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
in some of my application designs or for just some uiviews following a navigationcontroller s pushviewcontroller my new view will be shifted off the window by the height of the status bar

2144515
haskell	ocaml	lisp	prolog	ocaml	prolog
introduce a programming language paradigm like functional or logical with a demo of prolog lisp ocaml or haskell

2144516
punctuation	words
but what are words and punctuation marks all together in general

2144531
free	malloc
however i have free all malloc ed memory

2144532
punctuation	words
a common term comprising the two sub-categories words and punctuation often used when talking about parsing is tokens

2144541
punctuation	words
so words punctuation and white-space are all tokens

2144553
free	malloc
if you are sure that you have free all malloc ed memory then no there s nothing wrong

2144587
multiplying	add
add everything up and multiplying the result by 3

2144600
width	height
it takes the greater of height or width sets the matching image dimension to that then calculates the ratio of original dimension to the new dimension then applies that ratio to the opposing dimension

2144607
stdout	stderr
okay option 4 have a wrapper script that redirects stderr stdout from your unmodified c++ program to a java program that translates the output into log entries would not be very complex

2144685
kde	gnome
i think both gnome and kde have their own ways to determine this and also to set the icon and the standard application for it

2144692
post	get
and when you get stuck on a specific part of the process post and you will get help w that

2144753
for-loop	arrays
now i need to read the arrays to get the values one-by-one using a for-loop like

2144786
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you need consistent ordering you can use linkedhashmap for insertion access order or treemap for comparision order

2144826
skip-lists	hashmap
a skip-lists allows you to traverse the entries in key order and also look them in random order but not as fast as a hashmap

2144878
dhtmlx	webix
webix spun off from dhtmlx touch a project with 8 years of development behind it - see below and went on to become a standalone ui components framework

2144878
sorting	filtering
these libraries don t implement complex widgets such as tables with sorting filtering autocompletes or trees

2144878
client-side	server-side
supports writing either server-side java applications that don t require developer knowledge of html http or javascript or client-side javascript-based applications do not require a server but can communicate with one via ajax

2144884
ia-32	x86
x86 ia-32 or the i386-architecture

2144916
vb.net	vb6
vb.net and vb6

2144921
popupwindow	pop-up
i want to open a popupwindow with close button only when the user clicks a button and the parent window should be disabled until the pop-up window closed

2144987
inherited	properties
this allows your character to have as many actions as you want meaning you can add remove actions without changing character class and each action is responsible for only itself but knows about the character and for actions which have more complex requirements inherited from iaction to add properties etc

2145021
width	height
say i have the url of an image and url file-access is disabled in the server configuration and that s not something i can or want to change is there an easy way to get it s height width using php

2145035
put	get
i tried playing around with eval but i m not sure where to put it or how to get js to actually interpret the data

2145064
ciimage	nsimage
the main thing to be careful of is that the conversion from nsimage to ciimage can be expensive performance-wise so you should ensure you cache the ciimage if possible and don t re-create it during each drawing operation

2145115
folder	directory
you don t need to add the folder separately in fact mercurial doesn t handle plain folder directory at all

2145144
memcached	apc
it also comes with prebuilt xdebug apc and memcached modules which are for me the usual pecl compiled extensions

2145155
junit	testng
they all have some integration with junit or testng

2145166
free	malloc
if you must use the cfdictionary approach you have to find a place to free those malloc -ed memory when the values are not needed

2145176
unix	solaris
i come from unix world i m quite familiar with linux solaris cygwin

2145201
int	chars
int start int argc chars argv

2145231
g++	gcc
in a webserver if gcc and g++ are not provided by the hosting service to the user.can we download it and compile through it in rhel5 os

2145234
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
i have an abstract-class the superclass class super and 5 subclassing which should use the proprieties from the class super and add a new propriety a new column

2145234
super	extends
should i extends the class super from java or it s enough to join the classes using a jpa annotation

2145257
qtp	loadrunner
i cannot find the basic information about loadrunner does it record browser actions like qtp or network traffic i mean packet sniffering

2145265
super	extends
on each subclass extends the super and add the annotation discriminatorvalue with different value for each of the subclasses

2145302
pull	push
each developer should have their own remote public repository which they can push pull to from

2145302
pull	push
then a will pull b s work to his local clone try things out merge commit and push to his own a s public repo for release

2145318
twitter	myspace
twitter myspace aol windows live msn hotmail or any other openid provider

2145325
width	height
also the correct constructor is bufferedimage int width int height int imagetype you inverted width and height

2145328
stdout	stderr
you can use os.execv to replace it with another process the perl cgi and the new process will inherit the current process environment stdin stdout and stderr

2145336
put	get
that s if they even allow arbitrary code running on their machines at all - they may if you get your own vm but if you re sharing resources with any of their other customers i ll guarantee you ll be restricted in what you re allowed to put on their machine and unless you re in your own little vm it s rightly still their machine - all you do is pay for the ability to use their server infrastructure

2145343
mvp	presenter
in a mvp system such as django the view decides what data should be shown and the presenter decides how it should be shown

2145349
freebsd	linux
ratproxy is currently believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environments

2145350
post	get
when using webapp from google app engine how can i distinguish post and get

2145350
post	get
a piece of code below shows the way to obtain a post get field value

2145350
post	get
i d like to ask more how to handle get post and cookies smoothly and transparently without writing your own parser

2145415
post	get
semantically both seem to perform a get operation even though they are technically post requests as they just retrieve data without changing any state on the server ok that s another assumption

2145430
button	checkbox
if you can t do that without making changes to the form like in most of my cases you can try to utilise the soft keys and get rid of any button checkbox etc

2145438
post	get
if my user clicks more than once on a submit button of a form he essentially sends multiple get post requests depending on the form prefs

2145442
jobs	cron
if you can t create cron jobs on your server i suggest you switch your hosting provider otherwise the website you linked is your only viable alternative but you are depending on some third party this way which isn t really cool

2145456
post	get
thus get requests call get post requests call post and so on

2145517
prng	random
by the way the random module in python uses the mersenne twister prng which is considered very good has an enormous period and was extensively tested

2145585
int	double
this may not meet your requirements but it does give you the ability to specify the input type you are expecting which could be any one of string int double date or currency

2145607
public	protected
a static class cannot have any instance constructor see cs0710 whether it be public private protected or internal

2145657
jar	war
they are of type jar or war

2145708
for-loop	loops
either way this does not explain why the gmarker property is not available inside that for-loop that can not even be a race condition since loops starts immediately after that point where the object is still ok

2145715
int	double
the only exceptions are string it s allowed to add string objects and the primitive wrappers like int and double in java 1.5+ autoboxing converts them back to primitives

2145750
width	height
if that contains 0 try calling measure passing in a size structure containing large values for height and width then reading the desiredsize

2145767
children	parent
in real world parent s can accommodate children but children cannot accommodate parent

2145799
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of firefox the issue is fixed in 3.6

2145851
children	parent
i think you chose a wrong model for real-life parent and children

2145851
children	parent
because not all children are parent

2145853
int	double
i iterate through the map using int keys and the functions firstentry and higherentry and modify the double values

2145853
int	double
those int keys are important to me and because the double values are not unique i cannot have a double key

2145858
post	get
but the problem is before my post method returns a result flag the method already finished so i always get the error message

2145860
children	parent
the xml structure is recursive so the children s can have the same element as the parent

2145952
downcasting	upcasting
the assignments you are performing are called downcasting and upcasting

2145959
int	double
however the only way in which i see this happening with another data structure is keeping a wrapper over the int and the double and writing two comparators - one which compares the int and one which compares first by the double and then by the int

2146047
put	get
i use gnarf s method though i fall back on document.writeln ing a tag for ie 7 as i couldn t get dom creation to work reliably in ie6 and tbh didn t care enough to put much effort into it

2146069
exponent	modulo
choosing a small modulo or a small exponent both have their own drawbacks

2146071
hex	binary
mongodb uses 12-byte binary value an objectid -- it can be converted to 24-byte hex string

2146082
valgrind	memcheck
zsun nel6005001 valgrind --tool memcheck . fl.out

2146113
lxml	beautifulsoup
use beautifulsoup or lxml

2146129
getter	setter
is there any easy way to do this or do i have to do it manually by checking every attribute by its getter and setter

2146191
post	get
also saw other post and most of them really wanted to get the external ip not the local one

2146192
int	boolean
obviously there would need to be some way of describing the binary file formats - a schema or some such - this would need to support all the obvious data types strings int of various sizes boolean etc floats would be nice too and things like count fields length fields padding alignment etc to handle all the typical stuff that you find in a data file

2146206
getter	setter
if the names are different add the getter setter for all the radio buttons in the actions with there same names the in action exectute method check the values of the radio button for true or false as

2146264
beyondcompare	winmerge
i have tried both winmerge beyondcompare and kdiff and they are not good enough if i have functions with the same name but placed in different areas of the file they show it as differences

2146267
width	text-align
the text-align left may not make a difference eg if there s no width specified and nothing inside has an inherent width like an image.

2146268
int	boolean
__eq__ returns a boolean which determines if two objects are equal __cmp__ returns an int which determines if the two objects are greater or less than each other and so is called unless you have specific __eq__ __ne__ __le__ __ge__ __lt__ and __gt__ methods

2146282
bitblt	gdi
i am trying to use the gdi gradientfill function to draw on a offscreen bitmap then bitblt that to the screen

2146288
getter	setter
no more getter or setter every field has to be defined by the constructor

2146288
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you can still check every argument as suggested by cletus but i ll suggest you to throw illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception that doesn t give no new hint about what you ve done

2146295
public	protected
private and protected variables are for internal use while public members are for public use

2146358
directx	gdi
i draw the circle in c# using directx.i like to draw the circle with same dimensions in c# using gdi.it means i like to convert that circle from directx to gdi

2146358
directx	gdi
and also i give the input for center of the circle is x y in this point format.but in gdi it is pixel format .so how can i convert the directx points to gdi+ pixels

2146411
vb6	vba

2146415
ssl	https
it doesn t do ssl validation but this isn t required to connect over https

2146457
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
when you add a s view to the window it becomes the active uiviewcontroller and only a will receive the viewdidappear message while e won t actually be getting any uiviewcontoller related methods viewdidappear viewwillappear etc.

2146464
post	get
use the post redirect get prg pattern

2146467
ssl	https
note https support is only available if the socket module was compiled with ssl support

2146467
ssl	https
note https support is only available if python was compiled with ssl support through the ssl module

2146472
post	get
so you should use the http get method and not post post should be used when you intend to create modify data and get should be used when you intend to fetch some data

2146472
post	get
see the post redirect get page on wikipedia about this

2146479
margin	height
so trick is keep div1 s height same with content s top margin

2146551
pull	push
often it s enough to simply ask whether a subsystem can pull the information it needs from a simple interface instead of having to push the data in

2146594

vmware	virtualbox
i came to think though when the application is installed on a virtual machine ms virtual pc vmware virtualbox etc. and licensed on that - would it is possible to clone the virtual pc and then start multiple instances of the virtual pc on the same physical pc and still distinguesh the virtual pc s hardware or other different information from eachother

2146762
mouse	keyboard
there are only likely to be a few different types of event that need to be recorded - button clicks keyboard input on any text fields keyboard shortcuts and mouse input on any mouse-input fields so it s not an enormously taxing task although of course working out how to store and bind macros and how to facilitate import and export if you were inclined to do so is time consuming but not technically challenging

2146764
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

2146805
integer	unsigned
since you cannot specify an integer column as unsigned in sql server i tried using binary 8 however that s not working like i expected

2146805
integer	unsigned
is this my best bet if i want to store an unsigned 64-bit integer in sql server

2146863
ssl	https
does the browser intervene see that i want https initiate a ssl session with secretplace.com without passing the path in plain text and only after the ssl session is set up pass the path

2146909
getter	setter
imagine i have this two entities suppose getter and setter exists too

2146921

i believe the question is can my #divnew css rule inherited the properties of the existing .test rule so that

2147662
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
so my question and it s not meant to be too subjective is in which dynamic languages or fields of application are all these more advanced dynamic-languages features that couln t be replicated in static compiled-language that easily actually and idomatically used

2147684
inherited	properties
if in your html #divnew is a child of .test then css properties of .test are already inherited by it unless you override them by setting specific #divnew properties

2147696
websphere	ibm
ibm in particular tend to make a lot of noise about websphere process server

i ve seen incomplete installations of sql server 2008 components on machines - in that case just head on over to microsoft s download site and grab yourself the microsoft sql server 2008 management objects just a bit below the middle in the appropriate version x86 32-bit or x64 64bit or ia64 64bit - depending on your needs

octal	hex	octal	decimal
the output seems correct to me since you are formatting the output of i j and product in decimal d octal o and hex x respectively

2148089
octal	hex	octal	decimal
10 decimal 10 octal 50 hex

2148089
octal	decimal
d means decimal o means octal and x means hexidecimal

2148132
public	protected
does someone knows c# best practice about the way to define attribute visibility private or protected behind public property in abstract class or parent class

2148132
getter	setter
i think children class should have the way to handle directly this protected attribute but it may not be a good practice if getter or setter contains more code.

2148154
public	protected
children classes should access it via public or protected properties

2148155
vim	emacs
almost all the programming editors vim emacs etc support subversion integration

2148318
disk	ram
if you absolutely want the content of the files to be present in memory a much simpler solution would be to create a ram disk and store them there

2148353
profiling	instrumentation
use instrumentation to profiling your application and see exactly what is causing the slowdown

mouseleave	mouseenter
basically i have mouseenter and mouseleave on both elements which of course are slightly overlapping for this to work

2148385
implements	modifiers
i tried marking the keys property as public in myrow but got the modifiers public is not valid for this item i think because it s necessary to implements an interface

2148410
google-chrome	firefox
you could push your html js site to couchdb from a browser provided the user installs an extension easily done in firefox google-chrome

2148413
getter	setter
the docs mention that they are handy for function-based getter and setter but in my case i want an actual object

2148421
getter	setter
also i would probably make all of the variables private and use getter and setter for whenever you need access to them if you need access to them

2148460
put	get
you could put them all inside a sprite and get the bounding box of that sprite

2148461

i captured the post request with firebug but when i try to pass it on the url i get a 403 error

2148513
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i would recommend always send uiviewcontroller delegate messages to super viewdidload viewdidappear

2148513
superclass	subclassing
some classes uitableviewcontroller require subclassing to do that as it is documented you may override loadview or any other superclass method but if you do be sure to invoke the superclass implementation of the method usually as the first method call.

2148517
persistent	transient
transient are indeed used to stop fields in domain objects from being persistent

2148520

2148774
gridview	sqldatasource
i am databinding a sqldatasource to a gridview in 2 different ways

2148774
gridview	sqldatasource
1 declaring the sqldatasource in the .aspx page and setting the datasourceid property on the gridview to its id

2148774
gridview	sqldatasource
when i use the declarative method 1 sorting works fine without any extra work on my part but if i create the sqldatasource in the code behind and try to sort i get an exception saying the gridview mygridview fired event sorting which wasn t handled

2148802

2148853
inherited	properties
i have some issues in rails active record inherited i need to create a model that inherited parents class properties fields and should also hold its own properties

2148856
hash	salt
they sniff the hash + salt password

2148869
gridview	sqldatasource
did you try adding the sqldatasource which you have created programatically to the control hierarchy of the page for example into a placeholder and then binding the gridview to it by using the datasourceid property

2148875
width	height
the functions on this page will help - you can use them to get the width and height of a string something like

2148889
versioning	upgrade
i think a better solution would be to upgrade call you callback to either use boost function or a homegrown versioning like kornel s answer

2148905
hash	salt
something on the client side must decide on a salt and hash

2148905
hash	salt
that salt and hash must be consistent

2148905
hash	salt
if the salt changes so will the hash and then your server won t be able to hash it back to the original

2148905
hash	salt
that salt + hash have essentially become the user s new password

2148905
hash	salt
if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions

2148932
lisp	smalltalk
it is not pure oop like smalltalk but the type hierarchy in lisp is at least complete which is more than can be said for java and most other languages even oo languages don t have generic methods multidispatch method combinations esp before after and around

2148965
msg	eml
eml mime msg

2148965
msg	eml
eml are in most cases mime encoded files with mail msg

put	get
and if i put an explicit cast in the definition i get

2148974
width	height
the images are 300x57 black and white actually grayscale but most colors are either black or white it is comprised of two main features let s call them blobs separated by black space each blob slightly varies in width and height the position of the blobs also varies the blobs never overlap

2148974
width	height
i m currently using a bufferedimage getting the width height iterating over each pixel etc

2148974
graphics2d	bufferedimage
i want to stick with java s built-in libraries so is bufferedimage or graphics2d the most efficient thing to use in this case

2148988
inherited	properties
and you can call the methods of the thelibraryclass class as yours inherited the properties and methods of that one

2148999
inherited	subclassing
rails uses single-table inherited sti for model subclassing

2149021
vim	emacs
you could try out emacs in terms of functionality i believe it is similar to vim

2149087
getter	setter
a typical gui field might have forty or more parameters mostly repetitive having getter and setter

2149110
pop-up	dialog
in the same settings dialog you can also add this specific site to the allowed sites list and then pop-up blocker will let all new window creation attempts on said site succeed

2149161
ienumerable	iqueryable
you ll also notice that i m using iqueryable rather than ienumerable

2149259
equals	gethashcode
the thing is that dictionary uses two things to access the value by a specific key equals and gethashcode in the following manner

2149259
equals	gethashcode
get all keys that match requested key value by gethashcode value gethashcode value must be equals for equals objects and should be different for different objects

2149259
equals	gethashcode
taking this into account default gethashcode must be consistent with how the default equals implementation works - if a b a.gethashcode b.gethashcode - either way there would be really no point in providing default implementation if it wouldn t even meet the required minimum

2149275
g++	gcc
i have no xp sdks so i grabbed mingsys and mingw to access gcc g++

2149279
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome

2149313
int	double
use single precision or int types for large matrices instead of the default double precision

2149366
gmail	hotmail
most clients gmail lotus notes 8 hotmail live windows live mail outlook express receive the emails just fine but outlook 2007 does not

2149373
folder	directory
store the file in the apps myapp lib helper directory or in any helper directory created under one of the lib folder of your project so it can be found automatically by the use_helper foobar helper for inclusion

2149375
children	parent
ordinarily children will not include the self and parent entries

2149446
live	netstream
live streaming and a buffer on a netstream do not mix

2149479
width	height
i know the coordinates for the 2nd tween below is not correct cos all coordinates shld follow the defined reference point so i need to find out the logo s width and height

2149483
width	height
i need to create a dib rather than ddb but specify the height width and pixelformat

2149505
ienumerable	icollection
datatable.rows returns a datarowcollection which implements internaldatacollectionbase which in turn implements icollection and ienumerable

2149620
implements	extends
abstract class all its method except some at least one method s un-implemented so that you can extends it and implements the un-implemented method

2149620
implements	extends
advantage by extends from abstract class you get all functionality of base class you will be forced to implements the un-implemented method

2149649
valgrind	gprof
you cannot use valgrind and gprof together

2149655
128bit	64bit
a 64bit double ieee-754 double-precision will help you be more precise with your error term but a 128bit base-10 floating-point value is just performance-killing overkill and almost certainly won t improve the precision of your results one iota

2149676
width	height
calls to the width and height then return accurate values

2149738
filtering	grouping
can easily be modified to grouping filtering data by hours

2149745
hide	show
so i added checkboxes to show hide a given column and set the visibility of the columnseries as such

2149745
hide	show
this show hide the given column correctly the problem is that it does not reset the y-axis so the other column never actually grows in height when the column with the larger values is hidden

2149759
websphere	ibm
now to use ibm process server you ll need a license you ll need an app server to deploy it at random websphere some ibm machines maybe some expensive connectors some licenses for the modeling tools etc

2149781
implements	extends
for now though this was very fast to implements and a cool way to extends functionality to the sql group

2149807
folder	directory
there is no built-in way to get the size of a folder you are going to have to walk the directory tree recursively using the listfiles method of a file object that represents a directory and accumulate the directory size for yourself

2149810
svg	vml
nice thing is that this solution also works with vml svg raphael or other content that has alpha transparency

2149819
superclass	subclassing
-check to make sure any calls to the super ... constructor have the correct number of arguments for the superclass not for the subclassing

2149841
division	multiplication
if you fix the scalemod and initialdistance to powers of 2 you could use shifts for faster multiplication and division

2149842
post	get
how can i get jquery to target the parent element to add a class showing the whole post

2149857
cpu	affinity
since cpu affinity is inherited this should cause every other process on the system to also run on cpu 1 until you start your specific special process with cpu affinity set for cpu 2

2149859
floating-point	integer
floating-point divide is faster than integer fewer bits to divide assuming your cpu has floating-point unit

2149859
division	multiplication
also try to factor out division as multiplication by a reciprocal

2149951
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
not tested in opera works in firefox 3 google-chrome safari and internet explorer 6 7 and 8

2149954
spaces	delimiter
seriously you ll need to parse user input and when your parser engine see a # symbol it just wait for the next spaces for example as a element id delimiter create a new dom element with this id and after that it must update innerhtml of this element by everytime user entered a symbol

2149978
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been working on a website that is very jquery intensive in google-chrome and firefox

2150011
versioning	upgrade
versioning upgrade a setting was changed something else

2150027
xsl-fo	xslt
in that case you probably have already some developers with xml and xslt knowledge for whom it is not a big deal to set up templates that generate the xsl-fo structure that can be parsed by a generator

2150041
width	height
when i resize the canvas will the width height of the stackpanel adjust itself accordingly

2150110
maven	pom.xml
maven will compare the local pom.xml s timestamp stored in a repository s maven-metadata file to the remote

2150120
google-chrome	firefox
i am seeing the same thing you are - a postback on google-chrome and firefox but not on ie all latest versions

2150131
for-loop	arrays
so i m assuming guessing that you have some kind of each or for-loop that creates the divs from the arrays perhaps like this

2150183
hash	salt
the hash could be a generated using a unique identifier for the linking website salt plus a dynamic identifier like the date although if the server times are off by any amount of time this could be problematic so i recommend an alternative value

2150233
equals	gethashcode
implement equals and gethashcode properly using the ones from the supplied strings and take care with null references in your struct and possibly to make it even nicer

2150233
equals	gethashcode
you should always implement equals and gethashcode as pair and this is even more obvious since the valuetype.equals is terribly inefficient and unreliable using reflection unknown method of equality comparison

2150249
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
basically you can take the following css and apply it to a div and it should work with firefox safari google-chrome opera ie5.5 and up

2150270
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and safari all handle this gracefully .

2150287
portrait	landscape
but for some reason that application is always in landscape mode despite my g1 is in portrait mode

2150332
versioning	upgrade
normally with a commercial project i d just upgrade the project to the most recent versioning applicable.

2150347
stdout	stderr
using shell redirection only redirects stdout cout not stderr cerr

2150352
stdout	stderr
to print stdout onto terminal and stderr into a file

2150353
stdout	stderr
if later on you want to redirect both stdout and stderr you can do

2150353
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect only stderr but allow stdout to display use

2150354
inherited	subclassing
is there any way to leverage inherited using subclassing nsmanagedobjects

2150365
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
the 754 standard specifies what result you should get from certain basic operations notably addition subtraction multiplication division square root and negation

2150365
cpu	processors
if for example the processors has registers capable of holding extended-precision floating-point numbers and doing arithmetic with extended-precision does not take any more cpu time than doing arithmetic with double-precision a compiler is likely to generate code using extended-precision

2150365
multiplying	add
some processors have instructions to compute a multiplying and an add in one instruction so b c + d might be computed with no intermediate rounding and get a more accurate result than on a processor that first computes b c and then adds d

2150367
dlsym	dlopen
i m thinking this would be based on a similar set of functionality that posix provides to load and call dll s ie dlopen dlsym and dlclose

2150367
public	protected
how does inheritance from a dll work - does every call to the base class have to be to an exposed member function i.e private protected public is simply ignored

2150368
super	extends
even if you extends you will not be able to call the new methods through the super class reference

2150435
children	parent
if you now select only the last children that are also not the first childen of their parent element youâ ll get only the last children that are not the only children of their parent element

2150455
hash	md5
using c# i want to create an md5 hash of a text file

2150460
getter	setter
i completely understand the need for the getter and setter

2150483
getter	setter
if you ever need to do anything else in the setter or getter though the automatic property won t work -- you ll need the private field to manipulate

2150501
getter	setter
maybe you want to change the behaviour of the setter or getter at a later point

2150517
next	except
i met the next problem all resources except one has api for logging in

2150527
google-chrome	firefox
this method works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie8 doesn t seem to want to accept the cookie

2150533
accessor	properties
first thing to keep in mind is that properties accessor are compiled into methods

2150540
hide	show
to answer your subquestion if you want to emulate tag behavior without using noscript make a element with the content you want to show to non-javascript users and then hide it with javascript on domready event

2150550
nsurl	nsstring
returns an array of nsurl objects which you treat as nsstring objects

2150558
portrait	landscape
this should change the program to switch from portrait to landscape when the user rotates the device

2150577
post	get
one would have your authenticate method the other would have your get post

2150602
jboss	glassfish
also consider that in todays landscape with most commercial j2ee containers on top of osgi bea is websphere is jboss to some degree glassfish in the works maybe the upfront cost is reduced drastically by the fact that you can obtain off-the-shelf ready-to use bundles from various different providers which was always a basic element of the osgi vision

2150671
daemons	systemd
if your linux systemd supports it clock_gettime clock_monotonic should be a high resolution timer that is unaffected by systemd date changes ntp daemons

2150687
ubuntu	linux
i just migrated my dev environment from ubuntu linux to mac osx snow leopard

2150707
actionscript	mxml
it would be nice to know this in both actionscript and mxml

2150717
hash	md5
what i d do is make an md5 or sha1 hash of the file store it in the registry and check to see if that s changed on application startup

2150755
min	max
update mytable set spread max homescore awayscore - min homescore awayscore

2150756
des	aes
or the one for aes if you think triple des is too old-school or whatever

2150757
actionscript	mxml
i m new at actionscript though so i can t quite figure out how to duplicate this without mxml

2150757
actionscript	mxml	width	height
how can i duplicate mxml s 100 height and width in pure actionscript

2150780
addclass	removeclass
you can figure out the other one although i would generally advise to addclass and removeclass instead of messing with css styles directly

2150784
uploadify	swfupload
also for file uploads you may want to look into flash based uploaders like swfupload or uploadify that enable you to display a real progress bar among other things

2150789
stdout	stderr
this will work even if stderr is redirected as well as stdout

2150799
getter	setter
getter and setter are the public interface that other classes interact with

2150799
getter	setter
in complex systems you usually end up doing validation and other work inside the getter and setter

2150816
width	height
how do i get the real height i can t input the width and height in img tag - so that s not an option

2150828
dlsym	dlopen
i m thinking this would be based on a similar set of functionality that posix provides to load and call dll s ie dlopen dlsym and dlclose

2150828
dlsym	dlopen
the com runtime provides a lot of extra services that apply to the windows environment but arn t really needed when implementing mini com in a single application as a means to dynamically link to a more oo interface than traditionally allowed by dlopen dlsym etc

2150828
dlsym	dlopen
ole com then loads dlopen the dll calls its dllgetclassobject dlsym method passing in the guid again presuming that succeeds ole com then calls the createinstance and returns the resulting interface to app

2150828
public	protected
how does inheritance from a dll work - does every call to the base class have to be to an exposed member function i.e private protected public is simply ignored

2150834
rar	zip
just package it as a compressed file such as a zip or rar for example

2150880
inherited	properties
there is a horizontalalign properties and a verticalalign properties on the vbox and hbox components it s inherited from box

2150895
hash	salt
the password is stored as a salt hash so there s no recovery possible

2150924
post	get
could you post a snippet either isolate the bit of code either write a simple analogy to your situation so we can get a clue of what might be wrong

2150929
guava	java.util.concurrent
the linked implementation appears to have been written for java 4 and can be simplified a little using guava and java.util.concurrent

2150937
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
pcrypt uses the old style crypt function - if you are using something more moderns like an md5 hash you ll need to change pcrypt

2150966
qapplication	qcoreapplication	qthread	qcoreapplication	qthread	qapplication
at some point i had changed qcoreapplication processevents for qapplication processevents but that caused the gui to freeze im pretty sure thats what was fereezing it because since i put qcoreapplication processevents back it hasnt frozen again am i right to think that calling qapplication processevents from both the main thread and qthread can freeze the gui

2150973
put	get
now he wants it so when you try and put in a special character it simply will not get entered into the text box

2150981
kerberos	ntlm
how can i tell if it is using ntlm kerberos or whatever it may be

2150995
opera	firefox
in both opera and firefox my facebook connect application successfully loads xd_receiver and everything works

2150995
opera	firefox
the url the popup is visiting is the correct xd_receiver page as is hinted by the fact that everything works in firefox and opera

2151052
ant	cruisecontrol
the xml file you posted is supposed to be an ant build file or cruisecontrol xml configuration file

2151052
ant	cruisecontrol
usually show up in the ant file while is something typical for cruisecontrol configuration

2151060
put	get
as far as swapping the high and low bits your right it did get put into the wrong spot

2151082
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

2151095
post	get
it works fine but when i make changes on a page and then select a different item in a dropdown on a page which causes a post back i get a warning which i should not.is it feasible to implement this feature in jquery give warning on really leaving page but ignoring postbacks and what changes to the script i need to make in that case

2151103
put	get
the formview is returned on a get request and the successview is returned by default if everything succeeds in the put request

2151137
wordpress	oscommerce
i can not say the same for wordpress oscommerce etc

2151141
multiplying	add
to simulate this with a single dimensional array you multiplying the row index by the width and add the column index thus

2151166
securitymanager	classloader
i am hoping there is a simple way around this that does not require jumping through complex hoops using a custom securitymanager classloader etc

2151169
stdout	stderr
from my experience it s better to consume stdout and stderr of child process until they eof and then block in waitfor

2151169
stdout	stderr
however whether the child program will terminate crash when it s stdout or stderr pipe is closed at the other end is totally up to that child s implementation

2151173
hash	md5
what you must do is a server-side validation let s say you will validating against a md5 hash md5 1 c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b

2151173
hash	salt
obviously you should salt the hash function but even with out it your app will be pretty secure that way

2151193
folder	directory
i usually keep bpls in the same shared directory delphi uses because it is already in the path and avoids to litter the system32 folder

2151193
folder	dir
- no separate folder for dcus dcu d11 dcus are left in the source dir no good when sharing a library across differend delphi versions

2151239
hash	md5
it may be sufficient to append a md5 hash generated from the file contents and some secret only known to your application note that this could be circumvented easily by reverse-engineering the application

2151258
mouse	keyboard
various events i quote because i what the c++ concept of events is for things like keyboard and mouse events

2151269
hide	show
you can use it to show or hide the soft input.

2151302
multiplying	subtract
and now to count the digits on the right hand side well i ll just multiplying by 10 subtract the digit and do this until it reaches zero

2151310
profiling	debugging
as long as you just do debugging builds i suppose it doesn t matter which provisioning profiling you use

glut	glfw
also much of your requirements is already handled by the various opengl utilities - namely glut and glfw

2151321
integer	unsigned
the resulting unsigned integer type is

2151321
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type

2151321
int	chars
there is no undefined behavior because a promotional conversion from unsigned chars to int happens in the case of variadic arguments

2151335
integer	unsigned
17 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

2151346
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu hardy heron

2151390
disk	ram
at some point you ll reach a point of truly saturating the machines network disk cpu and ram

2151412
serializable	deserialization
the need for the getter stems from serializable - you want to be able to set during deserialization

2151450
width	height
the final method is to load the jpeg into a bitmap object and compare the number of pixels with the forumla width height bytes_per_pixel

2151450
width	height
so if you load the bitmap and number of bytes of actual raw data is equal to width height then you know it s a safe bet that the image has 1 byte per pixel and as such is grayscale

2151456
width	height
set it up so the selection box s properties width height will be updated on numericupdown controls in real time

2151456
width	height
the width height values are not updated in real time

2151476
getter	setter
so i ve got my getter and setter setup and my xpath all good

2151489
post	get
if your form s method is get instead of post then substitute _post with _get in the code

2151492
svg	vml
nice thing is that this solution also works with vml svg raphael or other content that has alpha transparency

2151526
free	malloc
in c you allocate memory with malloc or another similar function and delete it with free

2151578
width	height
let s say you are only interested in two properties width and height then you can use code along the lines of

2151594
os.walk	enumerate
to enumerate the source files use os.walk and os.path to find the files and build full paths to the source

2151615
firefox	safari
doesn t work in either firefox 3.5 or safari 4 webkit nightly

2151652
range	max	range	min	min	max
because search will be performed between now and now also if i put min and max values as default it would solve first problem but there would be another problem if user wants to search by date range he would need to click many times to come from default 1700 something to now

2151725
post	put
if you can think of any extra information you could verify in a post connection check you could put that info in the certs maybe in commonname and write your own checker to use instead of none above

2151758
x86	mips
i m using x86 ubuntu hardy herron to cross-compile to mips

2151811
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it only on ubuntu 9.10 though with google-chrome firefox epiphany and opera and it seems to work reliably in those which implies reliability in their windows counterparts

2151825
slug	permalinks
now if you dont want to expose your order ids in the url you could come up with some sort of other params to select the order itself although this would require a join query in your view order controller like customer username order date or what have you simialr to how you might see a blog permalinks as a date a title slug

2151901
internationalization	localization
if you want unicode characters for localization internationalization you shouldn t embed the strings in the source code

2151937
ubuntu	linux
build operating system linux 2.6.24-23-server i686 ubuntu

2151989
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
should i define width height margin padding line-height in em also if i m using em for text sizing

2152021
width	font-size	width	margin	margin	font-size
for width padding margin of a text container where it s constrained by other layout elements you might choose to have them sized independently of the font-size for aesthetic reason

2152050
accessor	properties
you would want to serialize the underlying data members as opposed to the values returned by properties accessor

2152057
portrait	landscape
launch simulator in portrait change to landscape right

2152063
min	max
you can find remove the min and max elements in o log n time compared to o n time using a dictionary

2152084
getter	setter
in java an immutable class is generally means that it doesn t have setter and any field that can be accessed with a getter should also be immutable

2152086
unsigned	short
as arrays of unsigned short

2152092
irc	xmpp
this is what we want to do and this too makes it real easy. irc would be great but thinking about it there s nothing inherently wrong with xmpp either

2152094
xval	fluentvalidation
it s also possible to use another validation method fluentvalidation since these can be made to work smoothly with xval

2152139
accessor	properties
you should think of properties as being just like the accessor and mutator functions you used to write the trick with them was if you found that you did want to do some code whenever a variable was accessed you had to change all the calls to that variable to use an accessor instead calling a function rather than just accessing a member variable that is why you would create default accessor and matadors just in case

2152155
fancybox	colorbox
you could also use some php to spit out the markup iteratively and then wrap everything into a div and employ a lightbox plugin like colorbox or fancybox

2152179
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and opera there is a scrollbar that appears when my gridpanel has an overflow of properties

2152195
gradle	ivy	ant	maven
i d like to find a simple non-trivial java project that is expressed in terms of ant + ivy maven gant and gradle

2152204
min	max
ideas i have so far is having a character definition of valid characters that can be used and then build the string from this definition and use a pseudo random length for length variation with a max min length defined

2152206
gradle	ivy	ant	maven
it is expressed in ant ant + ivy maven gant and gradle

2152265
post	get
post the code somewhere and you should get a better response

2152307
post	get
when i submit a form using method post and full canvas callback url action inside facebook iframe canvas i cannot get the form elements in the request

2152323
getter	setter
i remember having a similar problem due to using all caps in the name of the getter field or like your case ftqs have you tried changing item.ftqs to item.ftqs or even renaming your getter setter to ftqs instead and using item.ftqs

2152343
min	max
use fields or private properties to hold the from and to dates instead of reading them from the dtp and set their defaults to min and max

2152343
min	max
also in the valuechanged event set the from and to fields to the values of the dtps you have to set both when either dtp changes because the user will see the other one as set to today but the search value will still be min or max

2152343
min	max
then you search from min to max unless the checkbox is checked and when the checkbox is checked you use the two dtp dates no matter what they are

2152360
folder	directory
if you dont need the default apps that come with tomcat then just go to your webapps directory where myapp is probably located and look for another folder called root in my tomcat 6

2152395
nsscanner	nsstring
i haven t used them for a while but i think you can do this with nsstring nscharacterset and nsscanner

2152404
post	put
given the information in your post although i d have liked to see the code itself let me put forth the most probable issue and its fix

2152421
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method

2152512
pop-up	dialog
yes no dialog pop-up launched by test method - text drawn properly

2152537
integer	unsigned
note that java does not have unsigned integer variables but these will be retrieved with the exact same bit pattern

2152537
unsigned	short
edit updated the example to show how to convert a short 16-bit signed to an int 32-bit signed with the unsigned value with tc_2_as_int

2152559
hide	show
does the scrollbar appear if you resize hide show the panel

2152562
hide	show
i have made the program window to hide and show based on an external button input

2152562
hide	show
but if i set the window to active and triggered the show hide function it crashes with error

2152562
hide	show
also when i tried to use show function after hide it gives 2-3 of a same error applies when the window either active and inactive

2152603
ubuntu	linux
that extension is installed by default for security reasons on some linux distributions -- ubuntu provides it by default for example if i remember correctly

2152643
width	height
you could use javascript to get the computed height and width of the element that you want to resize to and pass them to the window.resizeto method

2152835
salt	md5
my thoughts of creating a unique token use hashing algorithms that use salt so the results cannot be predicted or decrypted problems with md5

2152838
filesystems	ntfs
we have a feeling it might be something to do with the ntfs filesystems ours is currently 75 full of fragmented files and we are going to try a few things around this principle

2152841
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse
i have to work between at least the cygwin environment and some standard linux distros ubuntu and opensuse and i have files lines of code that are only specific to say cygwin

2152852
filesystems	ntfs
i had the same problem because my project and its source code was in a folder that had ntfs s encrypting filesystems efs enabled

2152885
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
if your looking for something else that is more configurable less for scraping take a look at lxml.html and beautifulsoup also for python

2152942
daemons	launchd
if you re strapped for space then what you can do is create a little mini exec launchd daemons

2153064
spaces	delimiter
this function splits the variable title_words into separate array elements using a spaces as a delimiter

2153103
mouse	keyboard
to more concrete the application simulates key presses and mouse clicks when a certain key is pressed on the keyboard

2153152
int	chars
in java a sub-string maps on top of the original chars array and just takes memory for the base object and then the start and length int pointers

2153172
cvs	svn
cvs branches would have been another matter but not with the way svn handles branches it doesn t

2153187
width	height
i m not sure i ve understood your question completely but it s worth nothing that if you rotate a 100x200 object 90 degrees it will give 200x100 for width and height

2153187
width	height
there s a number of ways to get around this but i normally use scalex scaley as they are not affected by rotations and multiply those with the original width height of the clip

2153192
width	height
you can style your iframe give it a width and height and all that jazz

2153209
int	chars
boxing referes to a primite type int chars long etc... being wrapped into a class boxed

2153223
hash	salt
it uses its own rules email instead of username and a differently salt hash password so i can t use built in authentication

2153245
mamp	wamp
i never installed phpdocumentor on mamp but i did on wamp

2153307
public	protected
i found one limitation for public get protected set comments

2153307
public	protected
because comments should not be the same for public and protected respecting stylecop

2153316
width	height
update if i set width and height here

2153330
x86	64bit
one possibility is that the ppc has a large number of temporary registers that can store 64bit intermediate values whereas the x86 code may have to unload and reload the fpu truncating to 4 bytes and losing precision

2153352
hash	salt
another problem in addition to those mentioned above unless you hash and salt the received value again you are essentially storing all your passwords in the clear

2153367
ubuntu	debian
it seems like the tomcat version 6 at least packages available in ubuntu and debian are not working correctly

2153367
ubuntu	debian
while this might not be the premium choice of installation it seems necessary to get tomcat version 6 running without problems on ubuntu and or debian lenny

2153371
unix	bsd
i m using the the excellent unix comm command line utility in an application which i developed on a bsd platform osx

2153371
ubuntu	linux
when i deployed to my linux production server i found out that sadly ubuntu linux s comm utility does not take the -i flag to indicate that the lines should be compared case-insensitive

2153384
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
rather than bind to the height and width properties of the usercontrol have you tried binding the height and width properties of the border to the actualheight and actualwidth properties of the usercontrol

2153389
onclick	onkeydown
you can use javascript jquery comes to mind to bind all kinds of events to almost any dom element and in my opinion it ll generate cleaner code to if you don t use the onclick onkeydown etc

2153400
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s a string formatter and it works fine in firefox google-chrome opera and safari

2153418
mouse	keyboard
i love keyboard and i use quite a few in textmate but just realise i still use the mouse for 2 of the most common actions

2153424
yourkit	jprofiler	yourkit	hprof	hprof	jprofiler
use profiling tools such as yourkit jprofiler and hprof this one is a command line tool

2153428
profiler	visualvm
so maybe you want to give it a try first.it should be included with the visualvm that comes with your jdk6 visualvm profiler

2153471
nunit	moq
i have nunit moq rhino.mock installed referenced but i cannot find any reference to mockunitofwork

2153473
versioning	upgrade
the icu versioning is upgrade to 4.2

2153504
implements	extends
usually plugins advertise themselves by extends some sort of plugin base class or implements an interface

2153536
nant	cruisecontrol
when checking the cruisecontrol log file whatever buildargs i try to pass are not passed to the call to nant

2153538
pop-up	dialog
it also listens for the out_going_call broadcast and traps the call if connected to wifi and then pop-up a dialog that tells the user the call has been blocked and offers the user cheaper options than gsm if there are any

2153575
stdout	fflush
to make sure your prompt shows do fflush stdout

2153575
fgets	strtol
if you want to read from stdin anyway use fgets + sscanf combination or fgets + strtol

2153579
formview	datalist
the problem my expectation was that the counter would be increased by 1 on every page load but the counters on my datalist and formview are always behind and stepped by 2 i.e

2153640
firefox	safari
all in firefox safari works fine

2153650
post	get
i know how to send a get post request with curl

2153707
hash	md5
or you have to use md5 library not tested to create the md5 hash out of any password

2153750
children	parent
instead a parent â œadoptsâ children

2153775
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
a nascent script-free alternative is position sticky which is supported in google-chrome firefox and safari

2153785
wadl	wsdl
also i think you should stick with wadl rather than wsdl 2.0 because it is less verbose and way simpler imho

2153805
post	get
i have a standard edit scenario with get and post the form has a save button and a lookup button that allows the user to lookup a postcode which fills out the address and returns it in the form fields

2153827
prepare	execute
prepare statements are much faster if you execute the same sql and just change parameters in it

2153852
ssl	https
i expect that this problem happens when your application is establishing an ssl https connection

2153892
vim	emacs
i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs

2153897
next	except
editor s note sort -r almost shuffles except that duplicate lines sort keys always end up next to each other

2153911
outputstream	inputstream
i ve written background inputstream and outputstream implementations that wrap other streams and read ahead on a background thread primarily allowing for decompression compression to happen in different threads from the processing of the decompressed stream

2153990
range	min
however upon executing the code and having min specified in the range variable i get the following exception

2154070
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you can have your view model define what is the corresponding value type and in action-filter onactionexecuting call you converter - automatically

2154125
quicksort	mergesort
on small arrays the other approaches are much faster and on bigger arrays mergesort quicksort has a much better performance

2154130
put	get
i want to put overlay like this search in google map but i need to have .kml file for that area or region or city which is i don t have.so if anybody know how can we get .kml file for particular location then please let me know

2154159
richfaces	tomahawk
rather use the jsf-supplied iterating components such as tomahawk t datatable or richfaces a4j repeat or facelets ui repeat or maybe even a nested h datatable

2154164
snmp	mib
i m using java mibble library to process mib files and create mib implementation for my snmp agent

2154171
ceil	sqrt
the cost of traveling is ceil ceil sqrt x1-x2 2+ y1-y2 2 v + days spent in the city

2154196
webkit	gecko
it works in good browsers gecko webkit but jquery has a known bug on using .innerhtml with html5 elements documented here

2154225
qtabwidget	qtabbar
i tried qtabwidget qtabbar ktabwidget ktabbar bau no effect

2154229
ant	maven
for the build use a dedicated build system like maven or ant

2154231
ant	maven
you can use ivy if you wish to stick with ant or you can use maven which was designed for exactly this task

2154318
std	ostream	ostream	istream
there are several shared base classes for streams std ios ios_base is the ultimate superclass but there are also ios istream ostream and iostream for different types of functionality

2154341
put	get
the thing is that on submit the plugin will have to put the text back to the textarea for it to get passed to the next page

2154396
superclass	subclassing
therefore if the non-final method is overriden in the sub class and is executed during the initialization of the superclass it may be accessing uninitialized fields of the subclassing giving erroneous results

2154439
range	max	range	min	min	max
you can see that the range of a float directly depends on the number of bits allocated to the significand and the min max values depend on the numbre of bits allocated for the exponent

2154474
ubuntu	debian
set up a debian or ubuntu server edition

2154522
springsource	grails
grails is now supported out of springsource too so it should have legs so to speak

2154538
getter	setter
is it ever appropriate to put functionality other than basic setter and getter in a dto

2154541
min	max
the values for max min cannot be hard-coded but has to come from my action class probably from the request

2154541
min	max
a solution would be to parameterize the whole thing have a validation rule for advanceamt with parameters min max and call that for each input element containing the class .advanceamt

2154541
min	max
and pick up the parameters min max from the input tag itself from scriplet i can generate a min x and max y

2154568
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
however if i query a value of a input type file on some browsers opera i get a full path to a selected file but on other browsers firefox google-chrome just a file name without path

2154572
subtraction	addition
source unary + - bind tighter than addition subtraction + - and associate right

2154577
redmine	trac
some people for example use redmine instead of trac

2154577
vmware	esx
optimised for vmware esx vmware server and kvm intel or amd x86 architecture

2154577
debian	linux
well you can try damn small linux it s only 50mb and debian based and i believe it s the most famous minimal distribution you can check more distros in this list

2154617
x86	64bit
in win32 intelockedincrement intelockedincrement64 and associated operations compile to x86 instructions that allow processor level atomic operations on 32 or 64bit words depending on your architecture

2154640
persistent	transient
java s transient keyword is used to denote that a field is not to be serialized whereas jpa s transient annotation is used to indicate that a field is not to be persistent in the database their semantics are different

2154646
persistent	transient
the transient annotation tells the jpa provider to not persistent any non- transient attribute

2154667
rss	feed
is it possible to connect to an rss feed retrieve the xml object then parse and display it all within client side javascript ajax

2154764
wma	asf
wma over mms asf

2154778
persistent	transient
as others have said transient is used to mark fields which shouldn t be persistent

2154778
persistent	transient
when this class is fed to the jpa it persistent the gender and id but doesn t try to persistent the helper boolean methods - without transient the underlying system would complain that the entity class person is missing setmale and setfemale methods and thus wouldn t persistent person at all

2154792
wma	asf
wma over mms asf

2154795
mp3	m3u
implement an m3u pls parser which is just a text list of mp3 streams and use the code here to play the mp3 s

2154801
google-chrome	firefox
can some body tell me why this is not working in firefox and google-chrome but working in ie

2154801
google-chrome	firefox
it return correct value in ie but not in google-chrome and firefox in firefox and google-chrome it return undefined

2154806
getter	setter
vb requires to override both getter and setter while c# does not

2154813

bazaar	git
use a sufficiently clever vcs so that you don t actually have to write much code twice git bazaar mercurial and branch

2154906
fadein	fadeout
you can do fadein fadeout or fadeto depending on what you need

2154914
dictionary	map
i would like to map the contents of the history array according to the date values each dictionary has i need to dynamically create sections named and sorted according to the date values of each dictionary the iphone app wikipanion does this in its history view

2154928
post	get
you should be able to view the ajax reponse in firebug and see what is gtting posted back to you - you can get a 200 error but still get an error in the post back

2154945
int	boolean
since the type is determined automatically by the build system boolean int floats and strings i wondered if there is any way to force the datatype to string

2154993
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome

2155040
lxml	beautifulsoup
you re better off using the tried-and-true 3rd party modules out there like lxml or beautifulsoup that are not only more resilient to errors but will also give you exactly what you are looking for with little trouble

2155043
rss	feed
using jquery i get my own stackoverflow rss feed and print out a link to each entry

2155046
rss	feed
you can add a data source which can be a json file or an xml file or and rss feed

2155059
min	max
some assumptions - your collection of validation rules contain three properties id min and max

2155081
many-to-many	one-to-many
a many-to-many relationship with extra attributes is mapped as two one-to-many relationships

2155199
int	chars
this program reads in the data from the text file splits it into two chars arrays and then tries to use atoi to convert this into an int

2155220
avr	microcontroller
if your looking at getting into the real microcontroller space and really taking a look at low level system programming i would recommend you start on a very simple architecture such as an avr or pic something without an mmu

2155270
post	get
there are security issues you should consider like trusting the value of user_id and checking user input but i won t go into that. if you used method post on your form then you get the values with _post formfieldname

2155281
width	height
the constructor of the imagesnapshot method takes width and height as its first two arguments

2155293
inherited	subclassing
if not then instead of trying to add it to 500 classes you might want to spend the time refactoring and subclassing the base object into your own then have all the classes inherited from that

2155314
sudo	passwd
i m using qt c++ they work fine but i can t get them to run bash in a tty which you need if you are going to use anything like sudo which requires a tty pty to accept a passwd

2155322
cos	sin
y sin x cos x

2155340
min	max
using max min or any of the other aggregates can only handle one duplicate row per group

2155395
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
desired solution is a workaround to enable sorting filtering and grouping on a compositecollections i don t care to override and create my own compositecollection i just don t know how i can override this and enable its functionality in xaml

2155406
pygtk	gdk
it s not documented in the pygtk reference but it s in the gdk api documentation and is exposed through pygtk

2155433
post	get
send your post get vars to the php app have it run the necessary operations and then whatever php prints to the screen should be captured by wpf for processing

2155441
erd	diagram
i think you should create an erd diagram and map it to the tables in the following way

2155452
folder	directory
i have this script to display all the files within the directory the script is in but i will have a directory that will contain multiple folder with documents in each

2155452
folder	directory
i want to do this because this directory will have additional folder and files added to it

2155466
serializable	deserialization
when working with instances of an entity class it completes serializable without exceptions but deserialization always throws a null reference exception when excecuting formatter.deserialize

2155466
serializable	deserialization
but i have tested by temporarily removing the event handlers and both serializable and deserialization works correctly so i assume this is the problem

2155477
versioning	upgrade
this means that the next versioning s installer doing a windows installer major upgrade will fail because it is unable to first remove the previous versioning

2155502
hide	show
toggle hide or show elements

2155532
opera	firefox
perhaps this does the trick in ie and firefox not in opera

min	max
it is guessed that min 555 or max 2000 insert requests must be done per second to sql server and some kind of scenaria will be fired as in my first post

margin	height
to reduce the slowness of scripting a thousand items you could replace the above-and-below-the shown-items items with a single top and bottom margin of the same height as that many items and catch the scroll event to fill in new items to replace them

2155625
queue	fifo
there s a single-linked list here recipe 17.14 in the python cookbook 1st ed but it s hardly mature or rich -- it s just doing a fifo queue so it s pretty minimal

2155625
cdr	cons
this recipe is a very concise c implementation of read-only lisp-like cons-boxes -- just car cdr and cons

google-chrome	firefox
- with keydown or keypress is working fine for firefox and google-chrome

2155744
mouse	keyboard
i use the mouse sometimes in concert with my left hand on the keyboard

2155771
vsto	add-in
i m experiencing a bit weird problem with vsto outlook add-in i m developing

2155798
mouse	keyboard
the more i used the keyboard movement in vim the less i wanted to use the mouse

2155798
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t help that extended periods of time where i m constantly moving from keyboard to mouse can take a toll on my wrist

2155844
put	get
the existing code uses a wrapper around a xercesdomparser to parse the xml as it comes in and after using setdonamespaces and setdoxinclude to true it is attempting to parse the xinclude but i get a persistent fatal include failed and no fallback element found in document 0 error no matter where in the directory structure i put testguioutput.xml

2155853
client-side	server-side
also check out codeplex as there are tons of projects hosted there for server-side jquery wrappers and client-side extenders

2155854
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in firefox 3.6 safari windows and google-chrome windows

2155896
mouse	keyboard
the mouse seems fast but in reality it isn t precise so you lose time in addition to the constant back and forth with the keyboard

2155914
children	parent
the important thing is not to expose the children collection itself to the outside world - the parent should be able to mediate all the access

2155914
children	parent
i don t understand your specification example it seems like your childspecification would return true if any of the parent s children has somecondition as true

2155931
pull	push
devs with required ssh keys can push local changes to the code on github back up to github so any bug fixes or new features that would be of benefit to all projects using the plugin module can pull them down too

2156006
width	height
this will return the size width and height of the text

2156021
width	height
make the size property a struct with the width you want and use a large height value

2156031
queue	fifo
so linked lists are a nice way to implement an arbitrarily long fifo queue of large objects

2156046
uiview	subviews
for uiview ios development only you can safely use makeobjectsperformselector because the subviews property will return a copy of the array of subviews

2156046
uiview	subviews
thank you to tommy for pointing out that makeobjectsperformselector appears to modify the subviews array while it is being enumerated which it does for nsview but not for uiview

2156069
octal	hex	integer	unsigned
is there a function or library that can convert any default octal hex ... integer in c given as a into an unsigned long long int

2156092
mako	genshi
consider genshi mako jinja2 django templates or more

2156120
bcel	cglib
javassit bcel or cglib might be use to generate a dedicated cloner as fast as one hand writed

2156128
versioning	upgrade
when i say that it doesn t work i mean that using the resulting installer does not attempt to do an upgrade like it would if i manually increased the versioning string in the product properties table from inside installshield

2156145
octal	decimal
other than that you need want to pass 0 as the conversion base in which case it implements the usual c convention that a leading 0 signals octal 0x signals hexadecimal and 1-9 signal decimal

2156155
stdout	stderr
if i m doing something stupid in the java code not clearing my stdout stderr buffers why is it only an issue on this machine

2156161
put	get
...i get undefined when i put this var in an alert within the success function

or will there be any need to itake the help of php to proces one loop and based on the values that i get i put some conditions to apply rules that the client wants

2156188
postgresql	mysql
if you are doing tests on mysql you should store the results in a different database such as postgresql this way you won t increase the load with your operations

2156216

2156287
put	get
values that i get i put some

2156312
int	boolean
now you have something that you call with no parameters and it returns something that can take a int boolean function and give you a list int in return

2156319
put	get
values that i get i put some

2156388
post	get

2156426
mouse	keyboard
i am using an mfc listctrl is there anyway to know if a selection change was caused by mouse keyboard input rather than a programatic change

2156483
move	drag
jide has a rangeslider with 2 thumbs and a nice extra one on top to move both thumbs at once drag the range around in their open source common layer

2156522
multiplying	modulo
after multiplying two polynomials make sure you divide the result modulo the irreducible polynomial chosen in 4

2156522
multiplying	add
thus you ll achieve a generic simple program which can add and multiplying elements over all finite fields

halting on error or failure in junit - this halts when i run the ant script only but the build succeeds in maven and does not halt even thought junit has an error

2156814
width	height
just specify one dimension either the width or the height but not both and it will keep the ratio

2156814
width	height
with css you could also specify just the maximum width and maximum height

2156822
post	get
gets the http data transfer method such as get post or head used by the client

2156822
post	get
gets or sets the http data transfer method get or post used by the client

2156822
post	get
such as get post or head

2156822
post	get

2156824
width	height
setting both the width and height of an forces the browser to rezise it to match what you tell it to

2156824
width	height
setting only one either width or height resizes it so that the image s ration is kept

2156824
width	height
you can use the php function getimagesize to get the image s actual width and height and then rerform a proportional resize based on

2156828
width	height
i you plan to always use this height width you could insert the resampled image directly in the database

2156828
width	height
if you plan to use many height width or change these sizes in the future you should keep the originals as you do now

2156868
width	height
now i want an array which contain those books id s which their height is greater than or equal to their width

2156892
int	chars
in java or c chars and int are practically interchangeable and in certain loops it s very useful to me to be able to do increment chars and index arrays by chars

2156898
ord	chr
in python 2.x just use the ord and chr functions

2156898
ord	chr
by default a string is unicode so the above works ord receives unicode chars and chr produces them

2156913
public	protected
1 in protected inheritance the public and protected members become protected members in the derived class

2156913
public	protected
the derived class can access the public and protected members in both cases

2156917
post	get
...and get all of relations of post instead i got an array of post row

2156920
implements	extends
can anybody please point me to a example or a simple c++ class that implements this so i can study it and extends from there

2156963
public	protected
1a protected inheritance means the child can access everything it could in public inheritance but others using that object can only see the public interface to the child anything in it s parent is hidden

2156968
public	protected
public and protected members become

2156968
public	protected
access the public and protected

2156968
public	protected
note you can still manipulate some state if any maintained in the base class using non-overriden public protected member functions

2156982
public	protected
derived classes can access protected and public members of it s base class and the derived class can not access the private members of it s base class

2156982
public	protected
the private members are inherited for the following reason the base class can define a protected or public function that modifies the base class s private member

2156996
public	protected
specifying private protected or public when inheriting from a base class does not change anything access-wise on the derived class itself

2157000
httpresponse	request
the page source is the the raw html that is returned from the web server so you can get this text by simply submitting an http request to google and reading the httpresponse

i am on .aspx page and i want to take the width and height of a control from a static class

2157180

personally i like to use slideup and slidedown rather than slidetoggle

2157526
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari are still acting as they used to

2157526
google-chrome	safari
naturally google-chrome and safari still work as expected and only give the viewable size

2157588
uiview	subviews
it then adds a subviews using uiviewanimationtransitionnone showing a uiview containing a tableview

2157588
portrait	landscape
although both flipping and rotating appear to work at first if i flip while in landscape mode the flipped view is sort of cropped to portrait width although actually displayed in landscape rotation then doesnt fix it u have to flip back rotate back to portrait then flip back again

2157605
inherited	properties
if i use inherited then everything the view needs would always be a direct properties of the view model hence pvm.name

2157605
inherited	properties
inherited from person or keep person as a properties or something else entirely

2157605
inherited	properties
with inherited you naturally expose all public properties from the domain model which may not be a good idea

2157648
children	parent
since you re only inheriting from one parent to one child rather than to many children you re not avoiding a lot of duplicated code in the first place

2157657
inherited	properties
this isn t strictly a viewmodel in the classic sense of the word but i feel it allows for much of the same functionality without introducing awkward inherited or code duplication with tunneled properties

2157702
pop-up	dialog
the code pop-up a dialog showing

2157702
firefox	safari
i ve been researching and it looks like the problem is that firefox is attempting to preflight the request because of the custom headers while safari isn t and is instead just sending the custom headers without first checking if they re valid

2157705
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of hudson hudson ver

2157762

textarea	textbox
textbox doesn t holds n only textarea does

2157779
button	checkbox
edit originally i mentioned radio button this is wrong - checkbox is correct

2157785
post	get
you re setting the ajax request type to get but your action method is set to only accept requests of type post

2157789
post	get
you are requesting a get from your jquery code but you are stating that the action is only for post

2157790
dictionary	map
python has dictionary perl has hashes java and c# has map and c++ has the stl map

2157794
min	max
you should use rbsplitview google it it also gives you option for min and max height

2157802
disk	ram
you can create a ram drive and write the stream to it this way you are still keeping it all in ram assuming the disk operations are what worries you

2157900
post	get	salt	md5
when passing data to another php script using get or post should i encrypt it with a md5 with salt

2157910
cpu	processors
consequently it s pretty perverse really to seriously consider this as an option for shaving a few machine cycles when we re multiple generations of processors beyond the point when it was considered to be a good trade-off of cpu vs complexity to aid clean maintainable code

2157932
ssl	https
if you re transmitting critical data credit card bank account or social security numbers you should use a secure ssl connection https

2157980
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

2157980
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

2157988
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer google-chrome and firefox manage to read the actual status text

2157997
x86	mips
and seeing as on my laptop i have compilers for x86 x86_64 two kinds of mips powerpc arm and avr.

2158015
rank	max
alternately you could not use max and use order by rank limit 1

2158022
webrat	cucumber
in terms of using cucumber with rails webrat is considered the standard way of faking a request through the web stack - it is pretty powerful and results in nice readable step definitions

2158033
post	get
but when i try to run it inside i still get a full page post response

2158033
post	get
the code in oninit causes the control to post correctly but i don t get the updated text for the linkbutton

2158074
post	get
another way to do what you need is simply send a request to an external website via xhr post and then another get request to retrieve the file back which will appear as a save file dialog

2158095
inherited	properties
mike is right that if you just want to use the properties name on all derived objects you don t need it to be marked abstract at all as it s inherited

2158165
keydown	keyup
although the silverlight textbox class does not support a keypress event it does have a keydown and a keyup event that can be used to retrieve character information when a key is entered into the textbox

2158177
hide	show
rita if you re happy to have the html present on the page and you only want to hide show the divs then here is the code for that

2158177
hide	show
based on the amount of html you have to hide show i don t think a jquery postback is required

2158215
versioning	upgrade
i had a couple of user script that worked in versioning 3.5 by adding command line option --enable-user-script after i upgrade to versioning 4.0 all those scripts stop working

2158221
post	get
that way if it s the blogger he won t get emails on his own post but everyone else will

2158259
post	get
when its handle method is called it s supposed to interpret the request dispatch it to a suitable child restlet or query the matching resource the get post .

2158263
width	height
it returns width and height used by string and i can estimate how many lines and points or inches it will use inside a column

2158268
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome this runs fast

2158308
width	height
instead i manually set a width value and have a function change the gridpanel s height and width on the property panel s body resize

2158308
width	height
below is my modified code along with the function to manually set the size of my gridpanel when the property panel s width and height changes

2158324
post	get
while not specifically related to get post data i found an article entitled php encryption for the common man that discusses how to secure data in your php application

2158328
mouseleave	mouseenter
i almost always find that it s better to use the hover method or the hoverintent plugin rather than separate mouseenter mouseleave handlers if you are planning to do things both when the mouseenter and leaves an element

2158328
mouseleave	mouseenter
both of these seem to handle the range of possible mouse movement events rather than just mapping onto mouseenter mouseleave

2158379
min	max
an all model group must appear in a particle with min occurs max occurs 1 and that particle must be part of a pair which constitutes the content type of a complex type definition

2158382
implements	extends
for validations that occur multiple times just extends the interface argumentvalidation with your own and create the implements class that extends from the class argumentvalidationimpl

2158396
google-news	feed
if i add an extraneous alert hello world in between loading the google news feed and asking the dom for div elements in google-news it finds 20 div elements

2158400

2158421
textile	asciidoc	restructuredtext	asciidoc	restructuredtext	textile

addclass	removeclass
second you can chain addclass and removeclass to save looking up the element twice

2158517
rss	feed
if you really want to do it from the python side then you ll need to fetch and parse the rss there using other libraries universal feed parser

2158572
fflush	gets
alternatively try and make sure you modify the header and add the cookie before it gets fflush

2158650
cvs	svn
no double administration of bugs into planning tool and or planning items into bug tracking tool for the correct cvs svn etc commit numbers

the reality is that you re likely going to get people trying to put js in their profiles submitting weird stuff to your site out of both curiosity and malice

2158659
fadein	hide	hide	show
why not just show hide the div with fadein and .fadeout

2158660

getter	setter
i tried to implement my own setter and getter methods that align with the kvc standards but the getter method i have is not getting called

2158779
goto	break
if you don t have the break then the case blocks would be missing the goto end stmts and in fact if you landed in the car case you d actually run both sections

2158785
post	put
i told him that the design is restful and it is a good thing to keep two separate calls one with post and one with put

2158851
punctuation	words
in fact they are the same string what differs is formatting punctuation and a few words

2158864
post	get
i want to be able to get a post object that includes a list of associated tags

2158921
hide	show
i m using jquery to show hide the child div whenever a mouse hovers over the parent div parent div spans the entire bottom of the page

2158921
width	height
width 100 and height 100px

2158921
google-chrome	firefox
i can hover over the empty parent div in both google-chrome and firefox and everything works fine

2158947
datalist	repeater
could you not use a repeater datalist datagrid

2158962
cpu	processors
out of order execution is a strategy employed by most modern cpu pipelines that allows them to re-order instructions on the fly to typically minimise read write stalls which is the most common bottleneck on modern hardware due to the disparity between cpu execution speeds and memory latency i.e how fast my processors can fetch and process compared to how fast i can update the result back to ram

2159010
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari it says no which is expected

2159037
cvs	svn
if they know about tfs svn cvs or anything else that s great but it wouldn t get me to hire them if i had doubts about their core skills

2159045
innodb	myisam
if yes is innodb slower than the common myisam but i shouldn t worry about that

2159129
width	height
to calculate how far from the bottom or right you would have to use jquery s width and height methods

2159224
google-chrome	firefox
here is what i have now works in the latest versions of ie firefox and google-chrome - test.cultureconquest.com

2159239
tinyint	varchar
also the regexp only matches tinyint bigint int long and varchar as an example to get you started

2159320
width	height
for example i have a relativelayout that fills the full screen and i want a child view say an imageview to take up the whole height and 1 2 the width

2159332
mouse	trackpad
in my windows application while registering for raw input devices i wish to register only mouse but the trackpad which is also a pointing device also gets registered

2159334
profiling	debugging
you have your debugging code list memory profiling for the stuff you suspect and look for jumps in memory sizes

2159346
int	double
then the c++ compiler will compile a version of sum for int and a version of sum for double

2159351
width	height
there is an inner div of fixed width and variable height contained by an outer div

2159351
margin	height
if the inner divs height is not set the bottom margin between where the inner div ends and the outer div ends is always 2-3px too long

2159362
mouse	trackpad
in short it sounds like the mouse driver in the case of usb is a hid device unfortunately sub-classes of the mouse driver could get registered also as you have found out have you tried changing the mouse driver to some generic or perhaps disable the trackpad

2159362
mouse	trackpad
but then again you mentioned trackpad which i suspect is the laptop in which you are running the driver off on have you tried it on a desktop pc with a standalone usb mouse

2159385
width	height
there are a few ways around it one of which is to introduce a thin 1px border which blends into the background of the div and then compensating with the width height

2159427
inherited	subclassing
i m trying to use nhibernate to map a table per subclassing inherited structure that looks something like this

2159455
subtract	add
the solution in this case is to either do the calculation manually or if your application will allow for it add a very small buffer around the subtract point to make it occupy space

2159486
width	height
when you define a layout and view on xml you can specify the layout width and height of a view to either be wrap content or fill parent

2159493
cpu	processors
at the cpu level yes every processors will eventually see the change to the memory address

2159498
typedef	struct
i m a bit uncertain of how the typedef struct and pointers play together

2159526
colorbox	thickbox
i use colorbox it is because it is recommended alternative in non-maintained thickbox

2159674
simplecursoradapter	autocompletetextview
i am using the following code to set the adapter simplecursoradapter for an autocompletetextview

2159682
ready	each
you should consider getting a ready made linked list of buffers then traverse the linked list as you read the buffers in each node of the linked list

2159690
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
also i m using linux mint 8 - the rough equivalent of ubuntu 9.10

properties tells the compiler to specify a particular properties accessor get set method

2159765
getter	setter
you can replace this with your own setter and getter methods but only do that if you need to as the built-in ones have some features that you would otherwise have to code yourself

2159765
getter	setter
the property is just a hint to the compiler and other programmers that you are making a property and not just getter setter methods

2159765
getter	setter
the synthesize just creates simple getter and setter for you to go with your property but you can also just code those getter and setter yourself like any other method

2159769
accessor	properties	getter	setter
this means that the compiler expects to see setter and getter accessor methods for the properties

2159769
getter	setter
when you use the synthesize keyword you are asking the compiler to automatically generate setter and getter accessor methods for you

2159769
getter	setter
neither synthesize nor property are actually required you can create your own getter and setter methods and as long as you create them using key-value coding-compliant syntax the property will still be usable

2159769
accessor	properties
note that there are numerous keywords you can use with your properties declaration to control what sort of synthesized accessor code is created such as readonly for a getter-only accessor copy atomic nonatomic and so on

2159789
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
since methods are public in objective-c the answer is to write an accessor getter method that returns avar and a mutators setter method that sets avar

2159796
short	base
in short the idea is to build a certain measure of partial replaceability into the base template -- whether by using content styles templates or a combination of these

2159837
ant	maven
i think you would benefit greatly with a build tool such as ant or maven

2159846
hide	show
better do this in a thread from viewdidload and call your method in a thread before calling the thread show your label and when the data is loaded through the thread hide the label

2159878
actionscript	mxml
mxml is also a tag based language and is used in conjunction with actionscript - but i compiles to flash .swf

2159941
put	get
i don t know the specifics but i m sure you could get statistics about the behavior of players that cheat this way--in other words find things that the cheaters have in common length of turns consistency etc and have your application automatically find those and put a red flag on players that look suspicious

2159941
put	get
whatever barriers you put up determined cheaters will get around them

2160018
dictionary	map
i would just create a javascript ecmascript map or dictionary that has the relevant information for the language

2160019
onresize	onload
body onresize resizewindow onload resizewindow

2160019
width	height
the solution i m currently working on needs a few changes as to width otherwise height works fine as of so far

2160042
ironruby	ironpython
you can use ironpython or ironruby with wpf or silverlight

2160042
ironruby	ironpython
here is one article on wpf with ironpython and another article of wpf with ironruby

2160042
ironruby	ironpython
as for javascript there is work on ironjs as well as jint which you should be able to use in wpf similar to how ironpython and ironruby are used

2160081
width	height
simple answer set the width and the height of every single element

2160084
int	boolean

i m not using x509 or openpgp keys certs as they are too big and bulky for my needs and they don t fit in the security model

2160165
cvs	svn
sudo is a non-posix example as are svn and cvs

2160209
fgetc	isspace
since isspace may include space form-feed f newline n carriage return r horizontal tab t and vertical tab v in its check for white-space characters your best bet may be to read one character at a time in a loop using the fgetc function

2160209
int	chars
note that if the int value returned by fgetc is stored into a variable of type chars and then compared against the int constant eof the comparison may never succeed because sign-extension of a variable of type chars on widening to int is implementation-defined

2160209
istream	getline
the istream getline method will allow you to read in one line at a time and optionally specify the delimiter default is n

2160247
int	chars
if you stick with the basic c like java operations + - using the native data types int chars string and avoid the fancy libraries java will perform nearly as fast as c

2160251
listview	gridview	gridview	datalist	gridview	detailsview
i see there re controls like gridview datalist detailsview listview

2160291
hide	show
if so i suggest that you may use a simple viewcontroller to show the label loading... and then create the mainviw or next view which you want show to user in the end when it was done hide the first view show the mainview on screen.

2160310
getter	setter
my php objects mostly contain private properties that have a custom getter and setter method

2160346
put	get
models.py is just a file where you put model classes which are just classes that get accessed from all over the place

2160349
gridview	detailsview

i think you ll need to delve into the findwindow and showwindow api calls

2160490
stdout	fflush
try using fflush stdout before your if condition

2160545
hide	show
so i have a three column layout left column is my accordion widget when the h3 is selected a middle div will appear animation doesn t matter and a floating right column within that div to give the appearance of a three column layout which the right column will be used to show hide contents within that middle div

2160545
hide	show
show hide

2160545
hide	show
so i guess what i m trying to do is give the effect that content is being populated from links within the divs to show hide toggle or something when the user clicks a link rather than display a laundry list of items content

2160685
hide	show
this example will show hide the element when the window resizes

2160754
submit	submission
it is not especially easy but the standard way to do it would be to use drupals forms api for the callback submission as well - that way you ll get the same validation that would happen on a non js submit

2160775
memcached	apc
also you should consider using some caching techniques like apc and implement a memcached support in the db layer

2160775
nginx	lighttpd
it s even better if you could use dedicated servers for php lighttpd database and static content images flash etc nginx

2160786

mouse	keyboard
you can check the cpu usage to find out when the computer is idle but it s not necessarily a good idea or you can listen for mouse keyboard activity

2162832
mouse	keyboard
to check for keyboard or mouse activity you ll need to use a keyboard mouse hook

2162854
fadein	fadeout
explicitly calls fadein after fadeout is complete

calloc	malloc
you can t have arrays with variable numbers of elements in c so you have to resort to calloc or malloc and do your own memory management like this

2162882
int	chars
if contains something like 0xff and you want to assign the int value corresponding to that to an unsigned chars the easiest way would be probably to use strtoul to first convert it to an unsigned long and then check to see if the converted value is less than or equal to uchar_max

2162896
sorting	grouping
the execution plan shows how which indexes are used which join methods are chosen nested loops or hash join or merge join how the results are grouping using sorting or hashing how they are ordered etc

2162939

i just find this freaky weird since i have another list of custom objects which are much more complicated consisting of inherited interfaces and also containing properties which are generic lists of other complex objects and the caching of those lists work without issue

2163027
pop-up	dialog
like we see while browsing www.rediffmail.com is a poor definition so i m going to assume you re talking about regular pop-up windows with title bar etc not a javascript-implemented in-tab dialog and not new pages that open in new tabs

2163071
google-chrome	firefox
assuming the firefox code is running in some window you edit browser.js and the extension function you want to call also exists in that window you overlay google-chrome browser content browser.xul which is the uri of the main firefox window in which the browser.js code runs you can just call it as you would normally do

2163460
hash	md5
but if you are trying to find all duplicate pairs in n files then a md5 hash is better because you can create and store the md5 hash value once and compare this much smaller value to each pair of files

post	put
and building on the other post put the path to python in the system path you could have the best of both worlds

2163475
free	malloc
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that

2163475
free	malloc
when programmers make the effort to write and debug programs with dynamic allocation of chained structures in non-gc languages they sometimes find that their programs are no longer faster than in a gc language because malloc and free are not free

profiling	debugging
if i create a custom executable then i have a few troubles 1 changing the target doesn t change the executable because you can t link a custom executable to a target 2 debugging the command line program is problematic because breakpoints set in xcode don t get registered the chevrons at the line numbers turn orange when debugging the executable so i have to break into the running code and then handle debugging manually from the console 3 most frustratingly if i create a properly provisioned distribution version of my iphone app then transferring the iphone app to the device fails complaining that the provisioning profiling doesn t match the code signing entitlement

2163612
awt	swing
i have been with java since the beginning so from my point of view the fame of being slow was created by non-responsive and slow gui frontends awt and then swing and in applets probably because of the additional slow startup times of the vm s

although you can overcompensate for point 3 by increasing the height of the iframe to allow for any extra height you can t really deal with point 1 without changing the layout mainly the width of your site

2164226
pull	push
the idea is that for central repositories that you just push and pull from there s no need to have the files

2164229
sin	sqrt
now each row of prisms is displaced from the next by a multiple of sqrt 3 2 because the dimensions of one prism are 1 sqrt 3 because sin 120 2â sqrt 3 2

2164236
fortran	ada
compared to the languages that are normally compiled to pure machine code and have often large teams of people working on nothing but improving their optimizers c c++ fortran ada java does pretty well at a few things but overall tends to be at least somewhat slower

2164267
vim	emacs
i may use it in addition to or alongside vim or emacs but refactoring is now an integral part of my development style and having automated refactoring tools is essential

2164289
notepad++	textpad
previously i used plain editors such as notepad++ and textpad my efficiency coding increased using an ide with code-completion and runtime debugging

2164294
debian	linux
when running the same java process a jar under windows and linux debian the linux proces uses a lot more 12mb vs 36 mb just from starting up

2164299
vim	textmate
i use textmate or vim for small projects while i reserve ides for larger more complex projects or ones with underlying apis i am not familiar with

2164327
gif	png
spreadsheetgear can also render png gif jpg images from cell ranges or charts as demonstrated here

2164331
wordpress	joomla
i use codelobster which is really great and free but it is especially good if you can afford to shell out money and acutally have use for for their various extensions for popular open source applications like wordpress joomla etc

2164366
children	parent
this functionality removes the navigationgrid grid from it s parent s children and adds it to the children of the layoutroot grid

2164366
children	parent
if the user clicks on the pushpin button again the intended functionality is for the grid to be removed from the layoutroot children and to be added back to it s original parent s children with the grid.column grid.rowspan etc

2164366
children	parent
the problem i am running into is when the navigationgrid grid is initially removed from it s parent s children all of the other elements in the grid resize etc

2164366
children	parent
but when the grid is placed back into it s parent s children it s location is not the same as it was originally

2164373
folder	directory
putting the .h files under an include folder and the .c .cpp files under a source directory

2164379
profiler	visualvm
i recommend using a profiler such as visualvm to get a more granular view on what s going on

2164399
integer	unsigned
you can think of each as a variable length unsigned integer

2164406
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in ie8 safari and google-chrome but in firefox the same video the one at 0 in the simplexml array is shown for all the videos on the screen

2164458
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
because if you need ejbs specifically you re probably better off going with a full app server jboss glassfish weblogic etc.

2164465
jboss	glassfish
actually why not just replacing your servlet container with a full java ee server if you need ejbs i don t get it something like jboss or glassfish

2164467
public	protected
in particular interfaces members cannot be declared with the modifiers abstract public protected internal private virtual override or static

2164514
innodb	myisam
is there a reason for using myisam above innodb

2164543
uiview	calayer
if this is to be drawn to the screen you ll need to locate your drawing code within the -drawrect method of a uiview or â drawincontext of a calayer

2164543
uiview	calayer
to update its contents you d need to call -setneedsdisplay on the uiview or calayer

2164573
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
when an item is accessed using ilist icollection ienumerable the tree is used to find the data item

2164573
converter	multibinding
the converter for the multibinding returns its first value the itemssource if the second value the isexpanded value is true otherwise it returns null

2164583
vb.net	vb6
it is actually fairly easy to add some plumbing to a vb.net user control to expose it via com as an activex control that can be used by vb6 and other com clients

2164598
hide	fadeout
to fine tune the fadeout timing you can use hide instead

2164599
dlsym	dlopen
however it is possible to use dll functions without either of these things by using the loadlibrary and getprocaddress functions equivalent to posix dlopen and dlsym

2164658
post	get
the param method on the cgi object returns a list of all query parameters including get and post parameters

2164690
squash	branch
i m aware that i could just do a squashed commit let s call it squash squash which would contain cdefghi but then it seems like i would have to kill the bug_fixes branch and start a new branch to cleanly continue

2164712
profiling	debugging
you can also get the sql executed by running profiling but usually it s simpler to just run with the same values in debugging mode

2164770
expander	grid
the extender sits inside the first row of the grid and i would i would like the contents of the expander to expand over top of the contents of everything below when it s clicked

2164881
profiling	debugging
but these tools will help in debugging and profiling what s going on in the gpu

2164881
ati	nvidia
both ati and nvidia provide public documentation with recommended steps to find and fix specific types of gpu bottlenecks

2164883
google-chrome	safari
if you combine it with the trick for ie you can have one that works on both main browsers i m not sure if it works in safari and i know it doesn t work in google-chrome

2164895
spaces	delimiter
however when i specify delims it treats the spaces as delimiter even though the docs say specifies a delimiter set

2164895
spaces	delimiter
this replaces the default delimiter set of spaces and tab. doesn t seem to be replacing just seems to be adding to

2164895
for-loop	loops
but i have an uknown set of inputs here so i could be getting 12 directories coming in and don t want to have a repeated line for the command execution same line n times in loops body seems to defeat the purpose of a for-loop

2164903
queue	fifo
the normal queue methods won t work for your case because well it s a queue so fifo

2164925
actionscript	mxml
i m searching for at least simple open source flex mxml actionscript table creator and editor

2164972
cvs	svn
our team had a cvs repository which we converted to svn via cvs2svn

2165004
stringbuilder	stringwriter
if the files are small to medium sized you could load the contents into a stringbuilder or a stringwriter and store these in a dictionary indexed by file name

2165005
profiling	debugging
4 - tool supports debugging profiling testing etc

2165008
inherited	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
how can i tag this so when the subclassing inherited the documentation from the superclass it replaces the abstract-class s name with the subclassing s name

2165026
cpu	processors
li if done right it can take the best advantage of the number of processors your cpu has

2165040
stdout	stderr
on stderr showing up before standard output on stdout

2165040
stdout	stderr
remember that stderr may be merged with stdout

2165040
post	get
request_method set to get head or post as appropriate

2165074
width	height
if i output the bitmapdata to a bitmap on the stage i see that bitmap is in fact rotating but now it s exceeding the bounds width and height of the bitmapdata

2165074
width	height
it rotates outside the bounds of the bitmapdata set width and height

2165162
children	parent
for example we can query all parent which have children such that say 2 of 5 possible values of foo are present

2165195
ant	maven
i don t know exactly how your sources are structured under jdeveloper but you best option here to automate the packaging and the deployment of this ear is imo to use ant or maven but if all this is totally new for you i would recommend using ant

2165204
implements	extends
the question is why do they need both extends hashset and implements set when hashset already is the set

2165230
mouse	keyboard
i m working on a c++ directx 2d game and i need keyboard and mouse input

2165230
mouse	keyboard
microsoft recommends that new applications make use of the windows message loop for keyboard and mouse input instead of directinput

2165258
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

2165291
mouse	keyboard
problem is that by default keyboard mouse messages are routed only to the window currently in focus and typically in games you want to be able to switch focus to a hi-score view enemies on radar view or whatever and still maintain interactivity

2165291
mouse	keyboard
the easy solution would be for every module which requires keyboard mouse input to query for it directly and not rely on message forwarding - hence directinput

2165323
agile	greenhopper
greenhopper an add on for agile based on jira

2165334
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox can run those as standalone apps

this means that unless you declare your field as protected or public the .aspx will not have access to your field

2165345
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to to get a subclassing method to return the variable from the superclass however the return value keeps giving me empty returns

2165384
uiview	calayer
as kendall suggests if you just need to move the triangles around draw them once in a uiview or calayer and animate the positions and or rotations of those items

2165401
post	put
i want to perform a file upload function to the web service via http post and put

2165401
post	put
the browser clients will use post to upload a file to the php app and then will post or put the file to the web service

2165415
stdout	stderr
and a suitable error message to stdout at all the points where you re output an error message to stderr and you ll be to see what s going wrong

2165425
fadein	fadeout
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time

2165425
fadein	fadeout
you want the reset form logic to be trigger on the fadein call not the fadeout

2165446
button	checkbox
so if the user checks multiple boxes hits a button i need to send all the checkbox values to a controller s action that will take those id s and process them

2165467
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but if i read the iboutlet uiimageview.image.size.width or .height in the viewdidload viewwillappear or viewdidappear method i always get 0

2165476
post	get
so it seems like your question is in 2 parts 1 does php get handed off to before a post operation has uploaded all it s data

2165507
vtune	shark
performance tools shark instruments etc - nothing even close on windows apart from maybe intel s vtune which is nowhere near as functional as shark

2165558
post	get
after you get this part fixed post another question about how to make your controller more restful and i or someone else can help you there

2165593
rtp	rtsp
my network camera products support the rtp rtsp streaming

2165593
rtp	rtsp
the service standard rtp rtsp from my network camera is served and it also supports â œrtp rtsp over httpâ

2165593
udp	rtp
rtp start port udp 5000

2165600
post	get
my get requests all worked fine but my post particularly status updates failed

2165603
post	get
can you post the surrounding loop code to help get a bigger picture

2165630
inherited	properties
it s not the codebehind that s important it s the inherited properties

2165650
pop-up	dialog
first way is obviously the easiest but this doesn t give you a fullworthy pop-up modal dialog

2165673
unix	bsd
osx having a bsd backend gives you access to the usual unix toolset with a terminal for running shell scripts and other nice command line stuff

2165679
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there is a better way of getting the id inside a fragment i ve remembered since then for browsers that implement selectors-api ie8 firefox 3.5 opera 10 safari 3.1 google-chrome 3

2165709
int	chars
i have three int 4 bytes of memory for each int and i want to assign each of their binary values to a chars array with 12 elements

2165709
int	chars
so if each int had a value of let s say 2 then i want the chars array to have these values

2165709
int	chars
however it is mentioned as the terminating null chars in destination is overwritten by the first chars of source which i obviously don t want since most of the times int will have a null chars at the end unless the value is really large

2165743
getter	setter
you can use a static class with fields synchronized and getter setter used

2165844
fast-forward	merge
on xentac s suggestion i went back and found on the laptop that i had made a merge that wasn t pushed to the server which was the culprit and once i got all three really in sync git pull --ff forcing only fast-forward merge works just fine and warns me if something is out of sync before doing the merge

2165900
put	get
but i just cannot get this to work with asp.net mvc 2.0 rc - the put and delete verbs do not get used

2165900
post	put
i disabled the default route and now when i try to submit a form with the override set to put the error the http verb post used to access path contacts 2 is not allowed. is coming up

2165905
rss	feed
i m looking for an open source xml parser that is easy to integrate with my nstableview and will handle large amounts of rss feed

2165920
children	parent
parenting in a 2 layer tree via #afd98f for parent and .afd98f for children

2166048
exif	xmp
i would like to know about whatever is in there xmp exif iptc iim etc.

2166121
children	parent
if you apply visible or inherit which the parent of b is visible by default the bounds return and the children divs define the margins

2166131
implements	extends
i am having difficulty determining which base controllers to extends or implements

2166163
hash	md5
to minimize abuse you could obfuscate the javascript and provide the answers to the client in hash form md5 sha1 etc hash the answer the user submits then verify against the hash

2166197
children	parent
when the names are the same and you do a build the generated code on the client uses a different constructor for the entitycollection used by the parent to refer to the children than it does if the associations aren t set up right

2166207
getter	setter
i have a basic shell set up i have coded some domain objects mainly getter and setter for various object attributes which i ultimately want displayed on the page

2166220
rss	feed
if microsoft provided a rss feed people would install way more hotfixes than they should and we don t want people to unintentionally break their own apps and not be able to find out which of the 30 hotfixes they installed is to blame

2166233
int	chars
from what i can recall read literally reads the file as a stream of chars of which a blank space and carriage return are but i believe these should be ignored as you are reading into an int array

2166312
width	height
basically you want to listen for the when the stage is resized then change the width height of your image so that it matches in at least one dimension

2166313
setinterval	settimeout
do not use strings in setinterval or settimeout

2166335
partition-problem	np-complete
i am aware of partition-problem which is np-complete but that deals with unordered sets and not ordered sequences

2166341
mouse	keyboard
since you pretty much have to run a message pump in order to have a window you might as well use that pump to handle keyboard and mouse input as well

2166368
post	put
i found out why - the httpmethodconstraint does not check the x-http-method-override field and so for example in that article the httpmethodconstraint was set to only allow put but of couurse post was being returned by httpcontext so it failed

2166394
google-chrome	firefox
the focus function worked exactly as expected without any timeout in both firefox and google-chrome of course

2166398
trie	tree
you can google for keywords hashtable binary tree trie

2166409
for-loop	loops
i d use a for-loop just to keep everything out in the open your original loops seems to only print up to 12

2166432
docx	xlsx
a zippackage isn t a regular zip file but a file meant to be used by new office xml-based file format docx xlsx etc

2166443
getter	setter
typically properties need a backing field unless they are simple getter setter automatic properties

2166443
public	protected
i usually do a field then if i need it to be protected or public i will change it to an automatic property

2166448
public	protected
personally i would never expose any protected public instance fields

2166449
getter	setter
avoiding overuse of property getter and setter

2166449
getter	setter
most people don t realize that property getter and setter are similar to methods when it comes to overhead

2166449
getter	setter
a non-virtual property getter or setter that contains no instructions other than the field access will be inlined by the compiler but in many other cases this isn t possible

2166461
pull	push
but you always can use heroku console and do rails stuff there which is a good alternative especially on production when you can t put everything on hold until you pull and push back

2166472
width	height
this means nothing inside of rectangle can alter the width or height after construction

2166500
implements	extends
i ve had some luck extends jlabel and implements icon to get a translucent component working the way i want

2166543
post	get
of course i get a list of all my post titles followed by all my post contents

2166573
listview	gridview
for my own winforms apps i actually have an extender provider that lets me attach this behaviour to a gridview or listview by tossing in a list of column name link text pairs but that code is just a wee bit too long to post here

2166590
post	get
also i was wondering if there would be any way to pause the jms queue processing via an app server admin tool or to easily see what s in the queue i would be enqueuing an object which would be the message xml plus some other data including timestamp received etc. i ve read a few post on here that deal with related issues but wanted to get some direct feedback

2166602
firefox	safari
supports at least firefox ie safari potentially targeting iphones ...

2166646
urllib	httplib
you can make an http get request in python with such standard library modules as urllib and urllib2 though the lower-level httplib module is also fine

2166647
websphere	ibm
message brokers range from free open-source like activemq at or openmq at to large-scale commercial solutions ibm s websphere mq at is one of the largest

there are very good reasons why there is absolutely no object-orientation in the c++ stl and most of boost for that matter

2166694
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a script that works fine in all browsers that i have tested so far firefox safari camino google-chrome but not in ie and i can t figure out why

2166713
children	parent
1 modifying accessing children does not modify access a parent

2166718
uiview	subviews
then some uiview game pieces are added as subviews of the gameboard uiview and everything is displayed as i think it should be

2166718
uiview	subviews
when some of those uiview subviews are tapped a menu should appear

2166718
uiview	subviews
iphone - after dismissing modal view controller - gap is left at top of page - but the given solution was don t have another view controller loaded as a subviews of the view controller that displays the modal - but i don t only uiview

2166748
post	get
if you want to make a property read only as far as functionality is concerned you do so by only supplying the get method as you indicated in your post

2166778
implements	modifiers
eric gunnerson expresses it as every feature starts with minus 100 points . to implements read-only automatic properties would have required additional compiler effort to support the readonly modifiers on a property it currently applies only to fields to generate the appropriate backing field and to transform sets of the property to assignments to the backing field

2166800
getter	setter
i think fundamentally the problem is that properties are merely syntactic sugar for a field with optional getter setter methods

2166800
getter	setter
for traditional properties you can put arbitrary code in both the getter and the setter

2166800
getter	setter
even if the setter were able to be invoked only in the constructor of the class the getter could still mutate the value based on whatever logic you decided to put in it

2166801
post	get
screenshots below are made using firebug firebug logs the post or get request the response headers

2166810
onfocus	onblur
add onfocus and onblur event to the input field and set a global variable value

rss	feed
the feed format needs to be either an atom or rss variant

2166940
cpu	processors
if you have only 2 cores cpu processors hyperthreads you know what i mean then openmp cannot give such a tremendous increase in performance but will help

subclass	abstract-class
if your method in the subclass is merely an implementation of an abstract method then i think it would be correct to leave the abstract-class name in there

disk	ram
a well set-up rdbms server will perform the majority of it s queries on hot-pages in ram with little physical disk or network i o

2167035
post	get
then when you get down to the post you could click to load the previous page or the next page and it would roll out like a scroll

2167045
width	height
you say that the bounds of the bitmapdata are causing the clipping but you are setting the bounds to be the width and height of the object

2167045
width	height
this suggests that the width and height returned are actually incorrect not taking into account the rotation

2167045
width	height
perhaps try using getbounds to find the actual width and height of itest

2167046
printf	strncpy
i believe your strncpy isn t putting a terminating null character at the end of the string so printf is running off the end of the allocated memory

2167053
strlen	strncpy
you need to give strncpy room for the terminating null so it should be strlen input +1

2167053
strcpy	strncpy
what strncpy was designed to do was copy a string into an output buffer and then fill the rest of the buffer with zeros . it s not really designed as a safe strcpy

2167064
int	chars
neither int s nor chars s are automatically initialized to 0

2167121
width	height
the only thing that seemed to fix this was setting width and height on each picture on the page rather than in css

2167123
post	get
why does my link to use the get method and my button_to use the post method after i specified my method post within the link_to parameters

2167140
hid	keyboard
as far as communicating with the card reader generally you interface with a card reader over usb and the card reader can be placed into keyboard wedge mode or hid mode

you also have to send a keyup for every keydown

maven	pom.xml
with maven things are relative to the directory containing the pom.xml which is represented by the property and is called the base directory

2167243
integer	unsigned
yes you can pass it in as an integer or unsigned integer type

2167278
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you should be using the scriptmanager to emit your javascript where there is an updatepanel involved like so

2167297
client-side	server-side
vascript how can i simulate clicking on a server-side link button by using eval function in client-side

2167305
firefox	safari
it s almost right in safari but not at all right in firefox not bothering with ie testing as the app uses html5 localstorage which ie doesn t support

2167340
getter	setter
so far i ve come up with two methods in the class below i ve removed setter and getter that are superfluous to this question

drools	jess
what are the pros and cons to adopting the java rules engines jess and drools

2167358
drools	jess
i understand that drools is open source and jess is not but how do they compare in other areas like ease of use performance level of integration with your code

2167362
children	parent
if you change one parent size then all children sizes will be affected

2167375
google-chrome	firefox
i m normally a google-chrome user and away from my pc atm so can t be sure for ie and firefox

2167381
int	chars
but a chars get promoted to an int in a function call anyway you might as well use int

2167385
versioning	upgrade
i found that the issue was caused by having multiple versioning of appengine sdk jars in war web-inf lib folder caused presumably by the upgrade

2167407
for-loop	loops
changing your for-loop to a loops with an iterator or an increasing index value solves the problem

using aspose.words for .net developers can easily open and save doc ooxml rtf wordprocessingml html mhtml txt and opendocument documents

2167498
post	get
the best way imho is to use the post redirect get pattern

2167498
post	get
when using the pattern the post to the original page will not end up in the browser history and refreshing the result page will cause the final get to be repeated which should be safe

2167507
post	get
usually when you refresh a page you think of geting the page again or doing an http get but since the last thing you did was a post when you clicked the submit button the browser will perform the post again to attempt to invoke the same response

2167507
post	get
i suggest using the post redirect get pattern as suggested by jorn schou-rode

hash	md5
then you would replace the checksum with 0 before re-serializing the document and calculating it s md5 hash

2168423
hash	md5
with any luck it should be quite easy to write a regular expression to locate the md5 hash in the file and replace it with 0

2168706
post	get
use typed model viewmodel objects for get post and if you need more complex binding create a custom binder

2168717
spaces	linefeed
it sounds like you are reading all of the unparsed data into a big buffer and now you want to write code that makes the big buffer of unparsed data look like a slightly smaller buffer of parsed data the data minus the checksums and linefeed to avoid the spaces overhead involved in copying it into the slightly smaller buffer

2170384
free	malloc
no need for a separate malloc for each token unless for some reason you need to free them individually

2170392

2170438
realloc	strncpy
the only string function that i used was strncpy ..sure it is a bit long-winded but it does reallocate the array of strings dynamically instead of using a hard-coded max_args which means that the double pointer is already hogging up memory when only 3 or 4 would do also which would make the memory usage efficient and tiny by using realloc the simple parsing is covered by employing isspace as it iterates using the pointer

2170438
realloc	malloc
when a space is encountered it realloc ates the double pointer and malloc the offset to hold the string

2170438
realloc	malloc
in fact i thought this would serve an excellent example of a simple c program pointers realloc malloc passing-by-reference basic element of parsing a string.

2171062
post	get
that includes posting form data in http post requests or querying via get then getting back either json or plists which turn into dictionaries json is more widely understood by server developers but you have to be more careful to correctly define the structures being passed since you can do things like have a dictionary with the same key repeated.

wrap the inputstreamreader and stringwriter with bufferedreader and bufferedwriter respectively for better performance

2171608
prng	random
sqlite contains a high-quality pseudo-random number generator prng used to select random rowids when inserting new records into a table that already uses the largest possible rowid

2171608
prng	random
the prng is also used for the build-in random and randomblob sql functions

2171622
post	put	post	get	put	get
in the case of httpservlet the point is that servlet programmers typically don t want their servlet to support all 4 oft the main http methods post get put delete so it would be annoying to make the doget dopost etc

2171644
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a variable that i am calculating the length of and in all browsers except firefox ie google-chrome safari the value is 0

2171659
post	get
the only scenario where the browser could play a role is when the data is input by the user some way or enters the script through a get or post variable

2171666
for-loop	loops
the value of this variable gets changed in loops and before you even get first settimeout it gets endopacity value last value from for-loop

2171677
width	height
width height or offset

for example for a hypothetical programming language and its specification does not restrict any of its implementation from using a shared database or a global hash to store variables

2171746
folder	directory
in my python2_6 include directory is a folder with pygame headers

2171767
inherited	properties
however the best way is to use a has-a relationship making customerwithgroups not inherited customer and instead have a read-only customer properties of type customer

2171772
gridview	repeater
i know gridview control comes with lot of built in functionality which we can achieve from repeater

2171772
gridview	repeater
you will be thinking why this question if you can achieve the functionality and performance using repeater use it but i want to understand why and when we should use repeater and gridview

2171783
ant	maven
for the build we have the maven and ant

2171783
ant	myeclipse
i know that myeclipse is bundled with loads of plugins to support the jsf spring hiberate ant etc

2171794
gridview	repeater
like you said the repeater can perform certain aspects of the gridview

2171798
gridview	repeater
i prefer using a repeater almost every time but i can see the usefulness of the gridview

2171830
put	get
if i don t put the cast it says that it cannot bind an object to a jpanel when i do system.out.print me.getsource it prints a line saying that it s a jpanel so i don t get what the problem is

2171878
superclass	subclassing
keeping track of superclass subclassing relations for a known subset of classes is easy enough

2171914
fast-forward	merge
you can also configure those same remote repo to not accept non fast-forward merge forcing you to solve any conflict first locally before pushing them to your other projects

2171932
webclient	webrequest
is there a reason you re not using webclient or webrequest inside silverlight to do this posting

2171950
outputstream	inputstream	content-disposition	content-length	content-disposition	content-type	content-length	content-type
create a servlet which gets an inputstream of the image using fileinputstream and writes it the usual java io way to the outputstream of the response along with at least content-type content-length and content-disposition headers

2171971
ant	maven
webservices maven and ant are also supported

2171981
folder	directory
i would configure ftp folder under iis which is pointing to that mentioned directory and then using ftp protocol and windows or active directory user give some application access rights to it

2171996
free	malloc
i found memory corruptions while allocating deallocating some memory in the native c++ code using malloc free

2172000
mp3	wav
i am using python bindings for gstreamer and am using the following pipeline to convert a wav file to mp3

2172024
glut	sdl
glut is implemented on top of cocoa and so on the mac inherits that restriction- and so does any other framework you might choose to wrap on top of that qt sdl glut etc

2172081
ada	pascal	dylan	smalltalk
although design patterns describe object-oriented designs they are based on practical solutions that have been implemented in mainstream object-oriented programming languages like smalltalk and c++ rather than procedural languages pascal c ada or more dynamic object-oriented languages clos dylan self

2172100
hide	show
you can use jquery to show hide divs

2172126
unsigned	short
mysql s unsigned int s range is 0 to 4294967295 which is 1 short - or my math is wrong

2172161
cells	tablecell
tablecell cells row.owntablecells i

2172190
width	height
i think your problem is with the width and height properties in your iframe

2172190
width	height
when in html don t add the px to width and height values only add those when in css

2172205
button	checkbox
use radio button over checkbox and dropdown selections where possible

2172205
button	checkbox
use radio button to flatten combinations instead of checkbox a and b that can t be on at once offer a b none radio button

2172211
setinterval	settimeout
i prefer re-scheduling on each iteration via settimeout as above to using setinterval but it s totally your call

2172224
queue	fifo
use collections.deque instead of list it s faster for fifo queue

2172283
children	parent	getter	setter
in general if you are attempting to give access to a parent class the correct and future proof way to do this is to create abstract methods that are getter or setter or even more complex if necessary and then have the children honor those or not and respond as appropriate

2172326
loops	while-loop
when you have an infinite while-loop then check your loops for this pattern

2172389
firefox	safari
only safari seems affected but i m suspecting firefox just masks the problem due to more tolerant parsing

2172395
stdout	stderr
some applications write to dev console instead of dev stdout or dev stderr

2172399
google-chrome	firefox
the code works perfectly fine in google-chrome but in internet explorer and firefox it just redirects to a page with the text block

2172421
hide	show
if you need to show an element when javascript is enabled you can first hide the element with css and enable it with javascript jquery

2172422
min	max
you can tweak the cardinality the min and max possible values in your ef model

2172461
operands	scalar
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

2172463
hide	show
and apart from some crazy redirect scenario your best bet may be to use css + js to show hide what you need

2172463
hide	show
what i normally do and your mileage may vary depending on what you need to show hide is this

2172463
hide	show
then you can use css to hide show based on if javascript is enabled disabled

2172492
xslt	xquery
altova offers its xslt and xpath 2.0 and xquery 1.0 processor as a download for windows see

2172500
hide	show
i am not sure but is the window of the richedit recreated when geing from hide to show

2172507
getdate	dateadd
if i run the query select dateadd d -500 getdate

2172508
hide	show
you don t need to -- just send frame show #f to hide it

2172511
getdate	dateadd
lose the quotes around dateadd d -500 getdate

2172525
gtk	cairo
i think i must be missing some basic gtk cairo concept because it seems to be running too slowly stutteringly for what i am doing

2172552
codeigniter	cakephp
none in particular are better to look at but try cakephp symfony codeigniter or agavi

2172569
ubuntu	mint
did a new install of postgres 8.4 on mint ubuntu

2172574
int	double
however the swing jslider only works with int values whereas i need something that can support double for 1 decimal point

2172583
wtl	atl
note i use the following in code that covers - and sometimes mixes - raw win32 atl wtl and mfc so don t take it literally only the principle

2172583
button	checkbox
the standard control type already contains very obvious information about functionaltiy of a control - a checkbox to enable disable a group of features or for a boolean option an edit or drop down to enter select a value a button to open a sub dialog a static control for the label etc

2172650
google-chrome	safari
an example is the html5 version of youtube recently introduced as beta for safari google-chrome users see here

2172651
google-chrome	firefox
latest version of safary and google-chrome firefox 3.6 too can play tag in a html5 page directly

2172660
post	get
for what i understand of this- security- allowedcontrollers and this- security- allowedactions i should be able to get post data only from the action view of the controller users

2172682
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome opera 10 opera 9

2172690
geany	notepad++
i would recoment geany for serious programming editor because it have a lot of neat feature almost same with notepad++ in windows

2172690
pull	push
but since you already using git why not just use git push to get the update and git pull to upload the update

2172693
post	get
it s possible to get what you want scottgu made an excellent blog post describing how

2172699
vsto	add-in
i ve written this little ms outlook 2003 vsto add-in using c# and visual studio 2008

2172711
postgresql	mysql
pdo has drivers for sqlite mysql postgresql firebird db2 microsoft s sql server oracle odbc devices and probably some more that i m forgetting about

2172718
for-loop	arrays
i tried using a for-loop so it d be a bit neater and out of curiosity to see if it could be done but it doesn t compile when i do it this way because it doesn t recognize an item in an arrays as a method i think

2172729
clutter	cairo
i d probably try the cairo mailing list or look at clutter or pygame for drawing a large number of items on the screen

2172748
factors	mean
by significant i mean factors of 10

2172777
firefox	safari
firefox and safari are already supporting the feature

2172792
hide	show
i then use jquery to go to next or previous step - in other words hide or show a specific div

2172853
cassini	iis
since you did not specify either home or professional if you are they do not have iis installed nor does it come with xp home you could try cassini web server which can be found here

2172856
persian	farsi
in typical persian fonts which are true type there is a historical problem with yeh and kafs since these fonts are created for windows 98 which didn t include full persian support and now we have 2 kind of kafs keheh 0x6a9 ú and arabic kaf 0x643 ùƒ and 2 kind of yehs farsi yeh 0x6cc ûœ and arabic yeh 0x64a ùš

2172867
lua	scheme
the perl version is quite popular in dynamic languages icon lua scheme

2172876
vb6	vba
i have no personal experience doing this although i have used vba vb6 and have written vb6 dlls that are add-ins for other 3rd party software although not office

2172876
vb6	vba
the easiest way would be to convert your vba code to a vb6 com add-in

2172876
vb6	vba
then you shouldn t have to change the guts of your code since vba is 99 identical to vb6 and you can code against the same office object model

2172876
vsto	add-in
alternatively you could migrate your vba to vb.net as a vsto add-in

2172876
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is fully supported whereas only the vb6 runtime is now supported

2172936
postgresql	mysql
the dblinq project supports all of linq to sql s features over mysql postgresql oracle and sqlite as well as some unique features

2172948
int	chars
in c the type of a chars constant like a is actually an int with size of 4 or some other implementation-dependent value

2172967
post	put
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested

2173016
width	height
if i create a rectangle with 100px width and 100px height and then rotate it the size of the element s box will have increased

2173016
width	height
how should i get the normalized width and height of a displayobject aka the size when it has not been rotated

2173037
textview	imageview
here is the contents of my personal view to display my main application just to demonstrate how i can switch view s your view would be different including a textview and an imageview

2173038
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s supported by google-chrome and firefox on the pc and safari on mac os and iphone to the best of my knowledge

2173055
width	height
i want it to adapt to the vertical height of the screen but stay square even as the horizontal width edges

2173061
folder	directory
to be prepared if anything comes up here you should stop your mysql server and make a copy of the physical directory containing the database so nothing can get overwritten further a simple copy+paste of the data folder to a different location should do

2173063
min	max
and the min max values calculated using the axes

2173084
width	height
bezier - draw based on top left containing rect and width height

2173084
width	height
bezier with center - draw based on center and width height

2173084
width	height
if you want a symmetrical oval you could always create a circle of radius width and then scale it to the height you want edit notice this will affect stroke width appearance - see acdameli s answer but if you want full control of the ellipse here s one way using bezier curves

2173153
put	get
at the time the application read the socket data or when the underlying layers get the data and put it in the buffer

2173159
kde	gnome
now lets suppose that 50 of all desktop environments are kde the other half is gnome

2173209
free	malloc
if size is 0 then malloc returns either null or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free

2173218
width	height
so x1 x2 middle_xâ â width 2 and y1 y2 middle_y â height 2

2173227
hide	show
hey i wan t to make a cool effect on my page and i m thinking how about to hide everything while loading and show each div with effect one by one

2173242
free	realloc
if realloc ever has to move the data in order to resize it it calls free internally you do not need to worry about that

2173242
realloc	malloc
realloc will work just like malloc the first time

2173255
northwind	adventureworks
if you are simply experimenting trying to understand performance differences between different types of queries in an abstract sense then i would have to say that you ll be better off just grabbing a copy of the northwind or adventureworks database and banging around on that one - it s already normalized and indexed and you ll be able to glean meaningful information about query performance in an actual production database

2173257
hide	show
just hide the divs you want to show using css s display none

2173263
chunked	transfer-encoding
that transfer-encoding chunked seems like a clue

2173280
free	malloc
all of the above point out the obvious thing for every malloc there is a free if not you have a memory leak so it is imperative that you free the memory when you are finished with your pointer variable that is malloc d

2173282
post	get
did you set the curlopt for a post request the default is get

2173321
put	get
if you want the descriptor property to trigger when you get an attribute from object x then you must put the descriptor in type x

2173356
vim	emacs
i ve been using emacs for few weeks and it s been great so far - coming from vim was easier than i expected actually - emacs keyboard shortcuts feel more.

2173372
int	chars
an int or a chars

2173414
for-loop	arrays
i aim to beat the speeds of sequenceequal or a hand-coded for-loop over every item by avoiding the repetitive bound checks for both arrays

2173414
memcpy	memcmp
in the same way that array.copy could lead to fast memcpy what will lead to a memcmp

2173420
typedef	struct
sockaddr is a struct not just a typedef for a character array

2173420
nsstring	nsdata
also you don t need an nsdata at all to go from a character array to an nsstring

2173460
realloc	malloc
the reason you should use the second one is because with realloc failure is bad but is quite recoverable in many situations unlike malloc where failure usually means stop everything and die.

2173460
realloc	malloc
this is a more contentious issue but it is questionable whether or not you should cast the return value of malloc and realloc like you do

2173467
asterisk	pbx
i m looking for ways to use this methodology in configuration of an existing system in this case the asterisk soft pbx

2173509
vim	emacs
just use viper-mode vimpulse or vim mode emacs keybindings are just not as ergonomic

2173521
stdout	stderr
just for debugging purposes redirect stderr to stdout and use passthru to display the complete output possibly including error messages

2173524
width	height
first let s do the opposite problem given a rectangle of unrotated width w unrotated height h and rotation r what is the rotated width and height

2173524
cos	sin
w r abs sin r h + abs cos r w

2173524
cos	sin
h r abs sin r w + abs cos r h

2173524
width	height
now try the problem as given given a rectangle of rotated width w r rotated height h r and rotation r what is the unrotated width and height

2173524
cos	sin
let c represent abs cos r and s represent abs sin r

2173541
post	get
move up the parse tree until i get to the tag that encloses all the content div class post in my case

2173564
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox

2173574
profiler	yourkit
i would also recommend using the profiler to determine the cause yourkit profiler is a pretty decent one

2173576
pthreads	epoll
if you want to integrate pthreads aio with epoll then you need to translate the signal into an event on a dummy fd a pipe maybe and listen for it with epoll while catching the signal either in a classic manner or with ppoll select

2173576
pthreads	epoll
may i safely assume that if i have an epoll based app and i want to add pthreads aio support then i m screwed

2173586
vim	kate
for example under linux i would use kate or vim so something similar is preferred

2173590
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried the following sscce and it works flawlessly in ie firefox safari opera and google-chrome all of the most recent versions

2173595
accessor	properties
one advantage to using properties syntehsize is that it pushes you to use accessor methods for the ivars

2173599
innodb	myisam
in mysql autocommit is on by default for innodb - myisam doesn t support transactions

2173608
notepad++	textpad
for windows i use notepad++ or textpad

2173609
getter	setter
property declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods

2173609
getter	setter
obviously you have to be getting and setting something so we create the ivar that goes along with the getter and setter

2173609
getter	setter
the getter returns the value in the receiveddata instance variable and the setter changes the value in the receiveddata instance variable

2173609
public	protected
inside your own class you have direct access to all your own instance variables and any protected and public ivars of your super classes

2173612
getter	setter
this happens because the compiler automatically synthesizes the setter and getter and then calls them for accesses through the dot operator

2173612
getter	setter
one final note is that these setter and getter are automatically protected by a synchronize block that ensures that the operations happen atomically and that a second thread couldn t disrupt the activity midway through

2173615
division	modulo
we have to translate the offset by which the tile extends beyond the screen not the total cameraposx offset so we re using the modulo instead of division

2173619
imperative	declarative
imperative run-time code trumps declarative settings

2173642
post	get
if when you get stuck come back to stackoverflow and post a question stating exactly how far you ve gotten and what you don t understand

2173661
stdout	stderr
this will redirect file descriptor #2 stderr into file descriptor #1 stdout which you ve already directed to the named file

2173661
stdout	stderr
which should direct both stdout and stderr

2173673
put	get
in onrestoreinstancestate for your activity get the hour out of the bundle and put it in the timepicker

2173677
gmail	hotmail
the email has a background image that is not showing when i test it with gmail hotmail or yahoo mail

2173706
post	get
your script sends no data trough the post method and ad the target file is something with get data php just sees it as date passed trough the url

2173721
post	put	post	get	put	get
in a perfect world client browsers would all support get post put and delete for request operations

2173721
post	put	post	get	put	get
however only get and post are supported which means we re stuck trying to identify operations that should be put and delete by using common action verbs in the url like view create edit and delete

2173727
put	get
that because you put the parameter in the url which is kind of a get way

2173727
post	put
to use post parameter you must put it in the data area

2173733
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in safari firefox and google-chrome

2173735
hide	show
i have a link and would like to show hide one form

2173804
unsigned	short
total_length is a unsigned short

2173831
versioning	upgrade
i m guessing the problem does not occur in later versioning but an upgrade is not an option at the moment

2173853
apache	nginx
assuming your http server is nginx or apache install phusion passenger

2173853
apache	nginx
on the passenger site there are very good docs for configuring apache nginx with rails

2173860
opera	firefox
this seems to be a phenomenon happening with firefox and opera

2173865
viewdidload	viewdidappear
this works with viewdidappear not viewdidload

2173869
profiling	benchmarking
iow in the end if you truly care about performance you must carefully benchmarking and separately profiling your actual program s not just toy micro-benchmarks in the general case

2173919
post	get
i started out in php so i really have no experience using them i have read many articles and post on here about namespace in php and i get thebasic idea of how to use it but it is still something that will probably take me a while for it to really sink in

2173964
int	chars
the sort order you describe suggests the int values are actually being stored as a chars type or maybe converted to chars before sorting

2173966
onclick	onsubmit
you can convert the existing form but it is not as simple as just changing the onsubmit or onclick events

2173982
google-chrome	firefox
this is quite easy to do in firefox and google-chrome and would give you a good temporary option for users of those browsers

2173986
subtract	add
saving dates as strings could open a world of trouble when you maybe parse them from xml where the gmt is specified separately or try to add and subtract nstimeintervals

2173994
firefox	safari
it works well in firefox and safari but not ie8

2173997
pop-up	dialog
i have disabled the exception assistant in the vs options but a different unhandled exception dialog pop-up instead

2174000
for-loop	arrays
vectorising in cython shaves about 25 off the for-loop on my computer however more than half the time is spent building the python string the return statement - i don t think the extra copy can be avoided legally as the arrays may contain null bytes

2174037
post	get
make sure the html form on the production server has method post instead of method get

2174067
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari and firefox still work but opera and google-chrome send the user to java installation page as if the plugin was not found

2174084
ati	nvidia
all i need is a list of the most common problems between ati nvidia cards with solutions

2174090
ceil	floor
it is good to user ceil or floor when you know what you want to round up or down

2174163
win64	windows	win64	wow64	windows	wow64
windows 32-bit runs 16-bit applications by wowexec.exe and win64 runs 32-bit application by wow64

2174163
windows	wow64
so without wow64 it s impossible for your program to create a universal launcher on windows

2174168
width	height
insert image tag with width height alt tag

2174168
gmail	hotmail
and gmail hotmail and yahoo would display ur image

2174285
unsigned	short
returns a type unichar which is an unsigned short so you should be able to compare this directly to a space character if that s what you want to do

2174301
sorting	filtering
but there are considerable limitations to this when it comes to sorting in order to get bigtable to accept a filtering like you have to order the list by geohash as well which makes it impossible to sort it by other criteria especially if you want to use pagination

2174304
width	height
however i am hearing that it is better for the user if i instead refer to the original image and resize it with the browser by changing the height and width in the image tag

2174312
width	height
it s fine to resize images with css or the height and width tags

2174313
width	height
if the browser resizes the image for you by using height width tag you might end with a lesser quality image really depends on the image type like photo vs

2174333
post	get
this post did not really get me much further

2174357
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i need to be able to detect the installation of this existing program using the particular upgrade code and halt the installation if the versioning of this program the one i am trying to detect is equal to or less than 1.3.0.0

2174369
boost	stl
in libraries such as boost and gcc s stl an alternative approach is ubiquitous

2174446
int	chars
i m having an issue with my programming assignment where i cycle through a string and sum the int value of chars

2174475
subtract	add
you can change 3n or do simple add and subtract to it

2174490
int	boolean
in perl it is an int type-agnostic operation which happens to treat the first argument as a boolean value

2174494
switching	screens
the grid will switching the screens like so

2174494
button	checkbox
most examples i see use checkbox or radio button so there is no error in data input

2174544
scons	qmake
i never try it myself because i use scons for big multi-projects application but the qmake subdirs target may be what you re looking for

2174559
width	height
that offset is for x but he misleading thing is it is defined by the height of the bounding rectangle not the width

2174591
serializable	deserialization
i found a pretty easy way to deal with serializable of these classes by simply using iserializable to properly handle members of this type converting them to lists for serializable and undoing it on deserialization

2174602
width	height
i d like to create a jquery function that accepts an image url and when executed displays the image full screen matching the height and width of the current page

2174604
qrect	qstyle
best solution was to make your own qstyle which handled the painting of the backgrounds of listitem sub controls and draw the icons qrect as white

2174613
width	height
.css height 100 width 100

2174613
width	height
.animate height 100 width 100 position absolute top 0 left 0

2174643
fadein	fadeout
i couldn t get toggle to work with fadein fadeout

2174655
post	get
the only communication between js and php is via standard http get and post requests and there it doesn t matter whether the request comes from a standard browser or js or flash or whatnot

2174671
width	height
2 makes the width height 2x

2174725
width	height
the square s width and height would be just size

2174725
width	height
now go back and figure out that x and y are half the panel s width and height respectively

2174731
post	put	post	get	put	get
naming urls based on nouns makes it natural to create behaviour that is consistent with the intended purpose of get put post and delete

2174768
centos	linux
i do not want to add another dependency to my application by requiring the user to install libuuid seems like libuuid isn t included in most linux distros like centos

2174805
bmp	png
the timagelist component in delphi 2009 and up handles png and bmp files among many others

2174856
many-to-many	one-to-many
if your analogy is like a question and answer on so then this is not a many-to-many relationship it is a one-to-many relationship

2174861
integer	unsigned
size_t is just an unsigned integer type in c

2174869
16-bit	64bit
emulation tests the functionality on the specific environment 64bit 16-bit fingers and toes

2174938
post	get
the image is the only field no other post or get variables are used

2174956
tax	shipping
this solution is fine although in the orders table i would put in a total price tax and shipping

2174970
rss	feed
i am using feedzirra to parse my rss feed and it works very well -- it is twice as fast feed normalizer in my initial testing

2174975
user-controls	elementhost
even if you using winforms you can interop with a wpf user-controls using the elementhost control

2175015
width	height
because of the fact that there are variations in box model for ie and ff such thing can happen you need to increase the width and or height of the content area and then see

2175016
google-chrome	firefox
but as i was just working on that can cause issues with firefox google-chrome

2175038
int	double
i d investigate whether the variables could be cast to a 32 bit int for float or 64 bit int for double and see if they re equal to 0x8000.

2175090
google-chrome	firefox	fadein	fadeout
why is the quality of this fadein fadeout demo much smoother when viewed in firefox google-chrome than when viewed in ie8

2175231
hash	md5
check out the md5 hash algorithm

2175238
postgresql	mysql
database_engine sqlite3 # postgresql_psycopg2 postgresql mysql sqlite3 or ado_mssql

2175248
post	get
in your code you handle a message from some client through one of the http methods like get or post

2175263
min	max
below is my sample code that already done unfortunately the the popup window doesn t has min max icon on right top of the window

2175267
width	height
take the width multiply by height and multiply again by 4

2175272
kde	gnome
i want to create a thumbnail view of a file type similar to thumbnails displayed in gnome kde

2175272
kde	gnome
wondering if anyone knows which libraries gnome kde uses to display thumbnail view of different file types in linux

2175316
folder	directory
if you want to make something available for distribution the easiest way is to create a new folder directory copy all of the files and folder you want to distribute into it and then use either the os x disk utility application in applications utilities or the command line hdiutil utility to create a new disk image file from the contents of the folder

2175324
cpu	processors
however if you have a multi-core processors and a single-threaded program the cpu usage of your process displayed in the task manager will always be limited by 100 ncores

2175331
des	aes
it is the official replacement for des termed the advanced encryption standard aes

2175339
websphere	ibm
the ibm websphere application server v6.1 security handbook chapter 9.6 enlightened me

2175343
pop-up	dialog
older browsers used to pop-up a confirmation dialog to the effect of the page contains post data which will be resubmitted and you could either proceed resubmit or cancel out

2175390
inherited	properties
also it is worth noting that these properties are transitive down the inherited and composition road the compiler will only generate default versions of the default constructor the copy constructor the assignment operator and the destructor if it may

2175406
post	get
i have a simple textbox in a form and i want to safely store special characters in the database after post or get and i use the code below

2175420
ubuntu	linux
my question what is the best way to script this kind of repetitive procedure in bash linux ubuntu for a remote server

2175435
bash	zsh
you can do this with the shell bash ksh zsh + ssh + tools or programming languages such as python perl ruby or php or java etc basically a language that supports ssh protocol and operating system functions

2175445
int	double
the data can be double int string and could also be an array vector etc

2175446
sudo	passwd
you may want to set up sudo so that it can run the command without asking for a passwd

2175446
jobs	cron
this makes your script non-interactive which means it can be run in the background and from cron jobs and such

2175477
pop-up	dialog
i believe that this is preferred over having a dialog pop-up since after all that is what edit-in-place is all about

2175505
pop-up	dialog
we have some class library that will pop-up a dialog is this a bad idea to do so

2175507
int	chars
with this way you will store ips in int type field that is smaller in space than chars type

2175521
pop-up	dialog
unless you library is some kind of gui library don t use pop-up dialog

2175542
pop-up	dialog
file.open mode... and then keeps the last error both as an application friendly enum and as a human readable error string which your application can use to easily pop-up a dialog print it to a console or add it to a log etc

2175579
boost	stl
i am trying to write a simple stl iterator for carray mfc class using boost iterator adaptor

2175587
datatrigger	eventtrigger
somehow somewhere use a trigger datatrigger or eventtrigger

2175634
versioning	upgrade
if i recall well the latest versioning of the old telerik ajax is 1.8.7 - i suppose you can upgrade to it free of charge since it is a minor versioning compared to yours

2175694
hide	show
and that works fine but then i hide some items show some others and want to re-do this styling but only styling every 4th item that is visible

2175707
post	get
all this controls have to be done on the server side because you can never trust what the client sends you being it data through get post and even cookies

2175716
ftp	telnet
expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc..

2175772
children	parent
nth-child scans the children of the parent no matter what their styling is

2175799
yacc	bison
vim has excellent syntax highlighting support for flex lex and bison yacc files

2175856
cifs	smb
smb cifs

2175881
pull	push
then my group started to clone push and pull around in this project

2175907
post	put	post	get	put	get
i would suggest that the verbs get post put and delete are suitable for virtually any need

2175917
put	get
the reason is that a timer event cound be put on the message que and noge get processed brfor the destruction of other components

2175924
globalization	localization
therefore convert local to some standard in the non-sql code then use it to perform your query basically separate localization globalization and the query execution

2175963
uilabel	nsstring
if i assign this nsstring instance to the uilabel text the currency symbol is shown as a crossed box instead of the correct symbol

public	protected
does making dereference protected or public help

2175990
stateless	stateful
click is a stateless framework while wicket is stateful

2175990
stateless	stateful
its worth mentioning that wicket provides support for stateless pages and click supports stateful pages however this isn t the norm for these frameworks

2176023
post	get
for report generation the securitytoken is submitted as post for report download the same token needs to be submitted by the user browser this time using get

2176023
post	get
then i tried url encoding but this fails because for http post stuff such as 3d are transmitted without translation but when browser does http get with the data 3d is converted to

2176023
post	get
what encoding would you recommend to allow safe transmission over http post get without data being misinterpreted

2176040
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
my assumption is that the best way to handle this is to restructure the qabstractitemmodel - or should i simply throw that model away and assign a newly constructred one to the qtreeview

2176043
put	get
ideally i want to be able to create a queue on the fly which i can put get msgs within my test

2176046
cpu	affinity
if your cpu is multi-core and your problem is paralellizable create as many threads as you have cores research set affinity functions to assign them between the cores and still keep a separate thread for all i o

2176094
inherited	properties
if you re struggling with inherited properties then maybe you need to look at the design of your site

2176113
width	height
also deciding weather you stretch the left and right rectangles the full height or the top and bottom rectangles the full width is arbitrary and will either need to be a constant decision or a parameter to the method

2176113
min	max
other cases where the rectangles only partially overlap will require more logic looking at the max min of values to check for going out of bounds etc

2176116
rss	feed
i m making a rss feed

2176116
rss	feed
note that the description text comes from an untrusted source so they should never be able to break out of the description tag or making the rss feed invalid

2176129
width	height
this is .net i m not sure about the language of your code but i think most of the structures look simular in different languages in .net the constructor of a system.drawing.rectangle is x y width height

2176171
maven	pom.xml
i don t have made any maven changes and the pom.xml was also not changed

2176172
apache	nginx
nginx listening on 127.0.0.1 8003 is running beyond apache listening

2176172
apache	nginx
the problem might as well lie in the apache and or nginx config as well

2176188
cell-array	textscan
after that you can do some line-by-line processing -- using textscan again on the text content of each line for example is a nice quick way to get a cell-array that will allow fast analysis of each line

2176205
openfire	ejabberd
there are two servers that are pretty stable and feature rich ejabberd implemented in erlang and openfire implemented in java

2176210
rss	feed
i think you should take at their rss feed

2176210
rss	feed
check out this question on how to do that best way to parse rss atom feed with php

2176220
memcached	apc
user logs in with email password i then set a few things into session userid photourl username latitude longitude gender these are the basic items that will be saved into session and possibly apc memcached when a user is logged in

2176232
rss	feed
an rss feed a a special type of xml document

2176293
rss	feed
but anyway here s the regex you might want to use in case you find yourself doing something like this and can t rely on rss feed etc

2176303
ienumerable	icollection
your easiest option would be to expose your list as one of the following ienumerable icollection readonlycollection via a public property

2176361
onfocus	onblur
if you are content with requiring your keyboard users to have javascript activated i know not perfect you could give each link an outlined class onfocus and remove it onblur

2176394
m2e	pom.xml
if this is happening in your ide and if you are using eclipse and the m2e plugin i ve noticed that eclipse sometimes gets lost after pom.xml changes

2176409
innodb	myisam
the former is generally faster in innodb the latter in myisam

2176426
width	height
if the resizing occurs by resizing the form the height and the width of the panel won t change to the new values

2176426
user-controls	tabcontrol
this tabcontrol d contains a user-controls e in a tabpage

2176426
user-controls	tabcontrol
this user-controls e has a splitcontainer f in which another user-controls with a tabcontrol g is placed

2176426
user-controls	tabcontrol
this tabcontrol g has tabpages and in this pages is the described user-controls h placed

2176428
int	boolean
they are things that you can pass around to functions return from functions just like boolean int or strings

2176431
inline	inlining
you ll only see bloat from calls that have actually been inline and the compiler will only inline them if its heuristics indicate that it inlining will improve performance

2176499
min	max
depends on what you want to do when validation fails min max you can use bindingcomplete or parse events from binding

2176502
addclass	removeclass
you ll want to use the addclass and removeclass methods mentioned there not the default jquery ones

2176521
many-to-many	one-to-many
it is simply bad design to use many-to-many when you mean one-to-many and it will most certainly give you trouble later on

2176550
post	get
i read that get request can be bookmarked and post request can not be bookmarked

2176581
post	get
attempting to bookmark a post will just result in a get operation on the url

2176589
hash	salt
there are ways around this using a cached javascript client side to generate hash against a fixed salt of a challenge generated with each page but they are messy

2176600
postgresql	mysql
another benefit of this is that you do not have to rewrite your queries if you switch to a different database such as from mysql to postgresql

2176673
punctuation	words
the example uses standardanalyzer which removes punctuation and breaks words according to white space and some other more elaborate rules

2176683
width	height
then set the left top width and height of the window from bounds

2176706
comparator	comparable
since item is itself comparable you don t need an external comparator unless you want one

2176749
google-chrome	firefox
unlike firefox google-chrome provides no helpful bonus properties on the event object

2176807
post	get
well except if magic_quotes_gpc is turned on in which case you do either need to stripslashes everything that comes in from get post cookie or my favoured option just immediately fail

2176823
rss	feed
in fact every service extends a baseservice object with methods like throw which allow me to log my business layer errors to an rss feed

2176861
google-chrome	safari
ideally the solution should work across all modern browsers msie gecko google-chrome and safari

2176923
post	get
i have a form and the method is set to post on the action page when i use i dont get the value but if i use or i do

2176924
post	get
thus it should not be a get request instead it should be a post request

2176941
post	get
in php ini file the default setting gpc get post cookie and request array has that in itself

2176954
ienumerable	icollection
icollection the non-generic version only got ienumerable + count

2176955
int	double
you define an iterator on a list of int and use it to iterate on a list of double

2176973
post	get
post and get are different methods to transfer form data they both use different ways to send the entered values to your application and have to be handled differently

2176973
post	get
php uses _post for the values submitted by a form with method post and _get for values submitted by a form without a method or with method get

2176975
nunit	moq
i m using moq nunit as a unit test framework

2176990
writetofile	nsdata
check out uiimagepngrepresentation and - nsdata writetofile atomically

2177026
factors	mean
you don t involve the date factors in the group for counting then will it mean something to have a date in it

2177048
packets	multicast
at the server end you can combine these packets somehow maybe a bitwise or over all the bytes for a certain time slot from each machine and send them out again via multicast

2177059
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when you need to support older browsers what you can do is quite involved and a bit of a hack that will work in firefox 2+ ie 5.5+ and webkit browsers such as safari or google-chrome

2177073
many-to-many	one-to-many
you should not be mapping a one-to-many relation as a many-to-many relation then forcing it to be a one-to-many

2177082
equals	gethashcode
i ve overwritten the equals gethashcode methods to keep trace of the 3 objects in the composite key but what i ve discovered is that when it s creating the table in the database only the two did rid are part of the primary key and not the language

2177088
maven	pom.xml
you can use the maven deploy plugin to upload your jar file and optionally a pom.xml file though by default one will be created for you to your maven repository

2177119
cloudant	couchdb
it appears hosted couchdb services are also popping up such as couch.io or cloudant

2177138
profiler	yourkit
try the yourkit .net profiler

2177149
width	height
the reason for this in a nutshell is that flash s rendering internals are heavily optimized and among other things width and height are not stored internally as floats

2177149
width	height
as for what math occurs when you then read the object s width height it s difficult to say

2177167
nexus	artifactory
you could use nexus or artifactory

2177223
post	get
i believe http get and post are disabled by default

2177223
post	get
info http get and http post are disabled by default

2177226
post	get
of course that s probably not the only way you could do it and it is somewhat a compromise now querying for a single post is fast - you only do one operation and get everything back but you have no way of maintaining the relationship between authors and post since it all becomes part of the post document

2177419
pull	push
in other words there s no push technology for calendar updates the client program pull whenever it feels like it

2177431
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
as far as i know it s not possible to send icmp udp or tcp packets with arbitrary ttl values via javascript or flash

2177454
shadowing	named
also please don t use dir for a variable named you re shadowing the built-in

2177471
put	get
but if i put the runat server in for some reason i get this for the url

2177485
put	get
to get this work i have to put all the js code in the partial like

2177613
free	malloc
then the malloc free happen in the same place

2177623
udp	tcp
also if there is a way to find out whether is connection is udp or tcp ip it can be helpful too as the type 2 is udp based

2177627
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2177628
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
online example rendered neatly in firefox google-chrome safari and ie

2177638
folder	directory
this command will rename all files ddmmyyyy.xls under directory c path to test folder to yyyymmdd.xls

2177642
starttls	smtps
lookup smtps starttls you get a somewhat equivalent model with a vpn between the client machine and the smtps server

2177654
getter	setter
the getter and setter of a property should be a method of the class or it s parent - or - a field of the class or it s parent

2177654
getter	setter
you might create a getter function and setter procedure that will return this property of ftimer getter and set this property of ftimer setter

2177661
outputstream	inputstream
this may happen when you do not explicitly call closeable#close on the inputstream outputstream reader or writer which is constructed around the file in question

2177661
outputstream	inputstream
do it for any inputstream outputstream reader and writer etc whatever implements autocloseable which you re opening yourself using the new keyword

2177666
vb.net	vb6
problem is perhaps i think that i am writing in vb.net which has different data types than vb6

2177687
sudo	passwd
but this gives me sudo powers on my local machine it asks for my sudo passwd on the local machine

2177725
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2177725
sigkill	sigaction
sigaction sigkill sigact struct sigaction null

2177733
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
since the system.data.oracleclient library has been deprecated we are in the process of migrating our code base to use oracle data provider for .net odp.net instead

2177763
put	get
i ve tried to remove the view controllers from the morenavigationbar and put the top controller from my nib s navbar but i get and extra view from somewhere

2177764
ubuntu	linux
running eclipse 3.5 galileo under k ubuntu linux 9.10

2177764
pop-up	dialog
eclipse pop-up a dialog showing me my proxy host and asks for the proxy password

2177787
portrait	landscape
setting shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation makes it so that pushing viewcontrollers onto a stack will result in their views being oriented properly but you can t force an orientation to portrait or landscape with an explicit function call

2177796
hash	salt
i wanted to use a string as a hash salt so that a pre-known key passphrase could be prepended to whatever it was that needed to be hash

2177806
inherited	properties
that applicationdomain class exposes a internal properties to access your appdomain proxy that which inherited a marshallbyref class

2177851
move	drag
drag drop resize move all your controls on your forms usercontrols complete with databinding

2177897
hash	md5
the cookie contains an md5 hash of the session data and the encryption key of the cookie which is verified at loading the data see system libraries session.php function sess_read lines 140ff

2177954
folder	directory
cd to the directory that contains the script or put it in a bin folder that is in your path

2177972
powerpc	i386
moreover your gcc is called only with -arch powerpc -arch i386 which do not include -arch x86_64 which is the intel 64 bit flag

2178048
apache	nginx
you may be running into either nginx or apache automagically altering the location header

2178048
apache	nginx
fire up django as a fastcgi server and connect nginx to that instead of apache

2178051
int	double
likewise if you want the arithmetic mean of some int s instead of double s it can handle that as well again without changing the code

2178092
getter	setter
primitive types since they don t support many of the things objects do like getter and setter methods can only be declared

2178101
int	chars	int	double	unsigned	short
it is possible to create a nsnumber object from a signed or unsigned chars short int int long int long long int float double or bool

2178131
hash	salt
client must every time calculate hash from secret id and this salt and use it as parameter to each method

2178133
for-loop	arrays
i tried to do it with a for-loop but when the third arrays is going to be operate it always operate the firstarray 3 - secondarray 0 .

2178143
ilist	iqueryable
lazylist is an iqueryable container that implements ilist

2178167
ienumerable	ienumerator
i can see no reason for foreach not to be available to any class implementing the ienumerable ienumerator interfaces and this is a really useful method if you need to perform a small action 1 line is more readable than 1 line + 2 boilerplate foreach syntax...

2178177
min	max
using max and min will get the larger and smaller of the two elements in question

2178190
getter	setter
not just have getter and setter

2178190
subtract	add
it is perfectly common to have methods like add and subtract on an immutable class that return new instances of the immutable class

2178209
serializable	deserialization
try to rewrite your io so that you read bytes from 1 stream and write them to another without ever explicitly holding the complete object although i can t see how this would work with object serializable deserialization if you need to verify validate the objects

2178213
stdout	stderr
carefully distinguishing stdout from stderr also helps

2178223
minimum	max
however if all you want to do is enforce a minimum size for each dimension you could use the max macro instead

2178223
width	height
also just checking that you really meant for landscape size to be and not just height width

2178237
submit	submission
we have an issue where a malicious user implemented as a web-bot can submit a page w o submission all fields that are expected to be in the form

2178237
submit	submission
we would like to prevent users from being able to add remove fields from a form and submission the form if they want to submit a form all expected fields most be there

2178237
hash	md5
in the past i have done this using an md5 hash of the field ids on the page plus an unknown phrase saved as a hidden field on the page and a session filter that generates an expected hash given the field ids that were submitted and compares it against the value in the hidden field

2178241
put	get	getter	setter
i am trying to put getter and setter into my inteface but i get the following error1053

2178241
getter	setter
how are you suppose to put getter and setter into a interface

2178251
hash	salt
but password verifiers need to be able to recompute the same hash from the password hence they must have access to the salt

2178251
hash	salt
since the salt must be accessible to verifiers but needs not be secret it is customary to store the salt value along with the hash value

2178251
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
this computes a hash password with the hash function md5 suitable for usage in the etc password or etc shadow file for the password blah and the salt zap here i choose the salt explicitly but under practical conditions it should be selected randomly

2178251
hash	salt
there is a specification somewhere on how the salt and password are sent as input to the hash function at least in the glibc source code possibly elsewhere

2178258
getter	setter
i believe what the compiler is complaining about is that the getter returns an array but the setter takes a targetsystem

2178260
groupbox	panel
you should place all the radio buttons of the group inside the same container such as a groupbox or panel

2178262
groupbox	panel
put all radio buttons for a group in a container object like a panel or a groupbox

when in debug mode the variable is initialized properly in the get action but in the post action it just skips the call which means it is null

2187132
cos	sin
if your circle is centered at a b with radius r and you want it to come out at angle t then the start points are x1 a+r cos t y1 b+r sin t i ve assumed you want the line to start at the circumference which is what your question seems to imply and if you want the line to be of length z your end points are x2 x1+z cos t y2 y1+z sin t and you can use the processing command

you might expect 0.5 in this case but it will often evaluate the int value on the right first before assigning and converting the result into a double giving the value 0.0

2187794
web.py	pylons
it should be said i guess that reddit has since abandoned web.py in favor of pylons

pop-up	dialog
in my event handler i want to pop-up a dialog asking if the user wants to edit just one occurrence of a recurring event or the whole event

2188135
ant	maven
why does maven refuse to execute ant tasks in both of these profiles

2188144
subscript	superscript
for example compatibility variants might represent various presentation or styled forms of basic letters superscript or subscript forms variant glyph shapes or vertical presentation forms

2188149
accessor	properties
the problem is that you are not using your properties accessor when setting the timers

2188149
accessor	properties
the syntax will call your accessor method and thereby automatically retain the object that you send to it since your properties is set up as retain

2188149
accessor	properties
simply calling does not use the properties accessor

2188155
mkmapview	mapkit
there s an operation pending so mapkit is retaining the mkmapview and it hasn t actually been deallocated yet

2188356
lotus	sametime
ibm lotus sametime has a support page about this

2188370
put	get
also this makes your code extremely portable you can put wrappers in for the put and get functions to cross networks run your hardware in an hdl simulator and reach into the simulation to read write registers etc with a single chunk of code that doesnt change from simulation to embedded to os device driver to application layer function

2188407
submit	submission
if so in step2.aspx you can override the submission of the form submit it in ajax then submit the third from regularly add the to the page submit it with jquery

ready	each
i used jquery on doc ready to build a new id for the dialog content and put that id in a place that made sense for the code that launches each dialog

2188447
nsurl	nsdata
you would need to serialize an nsurl to nsdata -- and the default nskeyedunarchivefromdatatransformername transformer will do this for you

2188447
persistent	transient
one transient property of undefined type for the url and a second persistent property of string type for the backing store

2188465
try-catch	exception-handling
now my understanding was that if an exception-handling was raised in the function that inserts into tableb when the try-catch block catches the exception-handling the original insertion into the table would be rollbacked

2188507
hash	md5
i understand md5 is a one-way algorithm and all of the functions that i have come across seem to hash everything together

2188507
hash	salt
if a database was ever to be compromised the hash along with the salt is in the database

2188545
inherited	subclassing
otherwise if you choose to not inherited from nsobject or any of its subclassing and just inherited from nothing which is clearly a bad idea because of how the nsobject class deals with everything the objc runtime needs to do and the requirements are quite high then you ll potentially end up with no init method at all

2188556
hash	md5
hashing secret using md5 leads to the following hash

2188556
hash	salt
now if mallory gets her hands on the salt hash chances are she will not find the answer in her dictionary

2188556
hash	salt
if you cannot use an existing column incorporate your salt in the same column than your hash

2188556
hash	salt
for example use the first 32 characters for your 128-bits salt and then the last 40 for your 160-bits hash

2188567
hash	salt
for instance if a hacker gets access to your database and the passwords are not salt then he can look up the hash in his database of hash see to get the original passwords

2188569
hash	salt
for your question about salting i would recommend to hash a password with a static salt string and some dynamic data from database which should not change after once created

2188609
super	implements
you invoke super s doesnotrecognizeselector because you might want to implements your own behaviour for unrecognised selectors for your class

2188631
puts	putchar
putchar would put the character out but why is it that after eof it puts all the characters out and where is it remembering all these characters

2188658
versioning	upgrade
the last resort would be to download a local copy of the hdf5-1.6.5 headers and be done with it but this is not future proof a matlab versioning upgrade is in my future.

2188700
hash	md5
the keywords you should have been looking for are strong name or strongname and or permutation since it seems that with the rpc request they send out the permuatation strong name that md5 hash so that you can possibly distinguish on the server side from which permutation the request was send

2188700
hash	md5
the core function is util.computestrongname it computes an md5 hash d oh of the provided byte array with the added catch

2188751

i m trying to insert ip addresses into lastip an unsigned integer

2188845
hide	show
i m using slidetoggle with click function to hide show a container div

2188879
int	double
i would think it s just an int but then in the cout statement it s used as a double array

2188897
cvs	rcs
this is in contrast to for instance cvs which inherited a latest-version-plus-reverse-deltas storage system from rcs

2188897
cvs	svn
based on what you quoted it appears that git and svn are actually more similar than either is to cvs for example

2188911
hash	salt
you don t want to use the same salt for every password because then if two people have the same password they ll have the same hash

2188911
hash	salt
as an example of having a unique salt per user and storing it alongside the password hash i ll point out etc shadow on your typical linux system

2188911
hash	salt
here the ol5ttzxl is the salt and rhfguzsbfwqn6jnx5d.ck is the hash

2188918

2188967
getdate	dateadd
you could get a day of the previous month with dateadd m -1 getdate

2189005
hash	salt
3 you can have a separate salt for each user the database will be used to store the salt and the hash derived from the password salt combination

2189005
hash	salt
b keeping the salt separate from the password hash is not an effective defense we are assuming administrators after all

2189020
submit	submission
it will prevent a submission on pressing enter and you re free to add a submit button or call form.submit as required

2189029
submit	submission
it will prevent a submission on pressing enter and you re free to add a submit button or call form.submit as required

2189039
gdal	ogr
first you don t specify what version of gdal ogr you use so it may be hard to diagnose where is the problem

2189039
int	chars
yes you are correct values 11 and 80 for int width and chars width respectively are default values set by ogr driver for esri shapefile

2189039
gdal	ogr
this software uses exactly the same c code which is used in gdal ogr to handle shapefile data

2189083
hash	md5
taking the md5 hash of that array

2189083
hash	md5
this mysterious bitconverter object appears to be converting that md5 hash array into a string of hexadecimal numbers

2189100

also it s a bad idea to mix awt and swing components

2189100
awt	swing
both ideas are discussed in painting in awt and swing

2189149
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have a scriptmanager and an updatepanel in the page

2189182
mouseleave	mouseenter
you do have the option of capturing the mouse when it enters the scrollviewer though so it continues to receive all mouse events until the mouse is released however this option would require you to delgate any further mouse events to the controls contained within the scrollviewer if you want a response...the following mouseenter mouseleave event handlers will be sufficient

2189196
post	get
i would like to write a requestmapping style form controller that redirects after a validation error and round-trips the values and error messages into the get requested form the spring docs always just show the view being rendered in directly in response to the post

2189198
trojan	virus
compile without changing anything and some antivirus packages will report the resulting exe as a potential virus trojan

2189198
trojan	virus
my guess is that someone somewhere once upon a time wrote a virus trojan malware with delphi and the signature heuristics associated with that now sometimes unfortunately collides with other delphi apps

2189230
put	get
put this in a bash script and try to get it to say it worked

2189249
onfocus	onblur
i suggest detecting the window focus events onblur and onfocus in javascript then sending an enable disable call through to the swf file using externalinterface so inside your html you might have something like this assuming swfobject here but this isn t necessary

2189249
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used it with ie8 firefox 3 and google-chrome 4

is it best practice to use get or even put when reading or updating information or is post the most appropriate to use in every case

2189414
postgresql	mysql
there is a clever solution here with cte s and rank over date_added in postgresql 8.4 but because you re using mysql the only thing i can think of of involves a very computationally complex query

2189494
inherited	properties
the interface could have name properties that i can return directly inside the inherited element structure like the positionelements name properties would just return positon

2189723
int	double
i am just curious to know what happens behind the scene to convert a double to int say int 5666.1

2189723
int	double
since the representation of the int and double are fundamentally different is there going to be temporaries created during the process and expensive too

2189740
subtract	add
datetime such as add or subtract

2189745
post	get
google for more info on get vs post

2189747

floating-point	integer
any cpu with native floating point will have an instruction to convert floating-point to integer data

2189768
put	get
put logic in their parent that temporarily disables the one that didn t get the touch userinteractionenabled no

2189785
int	double
when you convert a double to int on an x86 system the compiler will generate a fist floating-point int conversion instruction and the fpu will do the conversion

2189785
int	double
the gnu mpfr library is capable of doing double to int conversions and will perform the same conversion on all hardware

2189805
folder	directory
then to list out a directory using regex find all lines ending in then parse up to the xth slash based on the number of slashes in the searched folder and do a case in sensitive search based on whether or not you want this to be case sensitive

width	height
suppose i dynamically create a div using document.createelement add some inner text and want to determine its height and width

2190011
hash	md5
similar to the recommendation of using md5 or sha1 hash the dustbuster method largely relies on comparing file size as it primary signal

2190027
width	height
why is this code setting artistimage to an image with 0 width and 0 height

2190030
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
the wcf equivalent for xsd.exe is svcutil.exe - it has a parameter dconly which creates the data contracts only from a given xsd file

i am having trouble with validations on a has_many relationship where the children exist but the parent doesn t

2190149
children	parent
however when creating saving the parent object i want to ensure that specific children with certain attributes have already been saved

2190149
children	parent
when the children are assigned to the parent with they are not saved immediately as the parent s id does not exist

2190149
children	parent
and for the parent to be saved it must have at least those 2 children

2190202
for-loop	arrays
is there a fast and easy way to clone the arrays without using for-loop

2190205
children	parent
first thing if you want the children to be saved without the parent id then there is no point in doing this

2190205
children	parent
so within the transaction if at any stage code fails then it will rollback the whole db transaction i.e you will either have one parent with 2 children or nothing if that s the end state you are looking for

2190205
children	parent
edit since you can t create a parent unless it has 2 children in that case instead of

2190206
versioning	upgrade
i use redgate sql compare for this by comparing to an empty db as well as for doing upgrade between all my db versioning i save a copy of the db for each released versioning and then just do a compare between current and previous to get a change script for that versioning

you use the setlocale standard function with the lc_ctype or lc_all category to set the mapping the library uses between wchar_t characters and multibyte characters

2190405
int	chars
the wide-character wchar_t type is intended to be able to support any chars set the system supports - the standard doesn t define the size of a wchar_t type it could be as small as a chars or any of the larger int types

yourkit	jprofiler
there are several of these for java - with yourkit and jprofiler being the biggest commercial ones in my unqualified opinion

2190577
post	put
the post build files should be copied somewhere so that they are put to binariesroot automatically on tfs later on

2190577
post	get
the post build files references obj release some.dll so it must happen after some.dll was compiled but before the files get copied to the output directory binariesroot

2190640
int	boolean
this will validate if that is a number as it will try parsing and it will return a boolean true or false if it parsed the int successfully or not

2190673
folder	directory
assuming you ve checked all the obvious things such as the above then one other thing to try is to quit xcode delete the build folder in your project directory and try again - sometimes the build folder gets in a pickle internally

2190683
dlsym	dlopen
with posix.1-2001 you should use dlopen and dlsym

2190691
pop-up	dialog
either pop-up a dialog log them or ignore them but in that case be sure that it s really safe to do so

2190741
put	get
you re supposed to put something in between them that normally wouldn t be animated with you get a fading effect

2190744

2190829
put	get
you could try to wrap the hashmap get and put methods or whatelse you use with reentrantlock

2190873
post	get
today we only use a tiny bit of the http protocol s methods â namely get and post

2190873
post	get
for example rest dictates the usage of delete to erase a document be it a file state etc. behind a uri whereas with http you would misuse a get or post query like

2190907
client-side	server-side
the browserinfo is available at client-side as webbrowser ar the server-side

2191123
maven	m2e
m2e maven plugin

2191128
config	ini
i prefer to work with ini files as config that sit before public_html folder.i think that gives me a lot of flexibility and grouping var and create if necessary separate ini for modules etc

2191216
post	get
think about it as uber public method accessible through http get post etc. that returns html

2191218

which defeats the point of being able to use in-app purchase to upgrade an existing lite versioning to the full-blown one

2191288
cos	sin
it would be looking for a word boundary that didn t have sin cos tan before it

2191307

2191547
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i am getting a problem with this code in ie7 firefox google-chrome opera all seem to work fine

2191548
range	max
basically filter and map on range the result of 1 until max is non-strict meaning it will be computed on-demand and it will be computed every time you try to access it s results

2191559
aggregate-functions	sum
you need to use a aggregate-functions such as sum or count or max in your select clause

2191588
for-loop	arrays
you could use a framework such as prototype or jquery that give you an each method to use on the arrays but internally it would likely just use a for-loop anyway so there s not really much point to it

2191588
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
alternatively if this is because you are using the for-loop all over the place and want to have reusable code instead why not attach a buildurl method to your urls object which loops internally and returns your url arrays

2191600
division	modulo
so you will have to use integer division or normal division and modulo

2191616
datediff	difference
if you want the correct difference you need to use the actual dates then you can use php datediff -

2191724
boost	stl
yet i would prefer to use standard iterators stl or boost to support this structure rather that writing my own iterators

2191737
post	get
i wan t to pass a variable without using get to php so i m using post with jquery but i can t write the result into the document refresh all the page

i found that the busybox s ash syntax is different from the other standard shells sh bash tcsh

2191913

audiotrack	audiorecord
i currently use the audiotrack and audiorecord classes in android

2192151
disk	ram
if you re allocating close to 2gb of ram on 32 bit windows the system is probably paging a lot of memory to disk and that s where i d look first for the slow down

2192151
disk	ram
when you re using a lot of memory you should think of it as being stored on disk in pagefile.sys but cached in physical ram

2192151
disk	ram
in effect when you copy the file into one big allocation you re copying much of it disk- disk via ram then when you run over it again to analyse you re loading the copy back to ram again

2192160
memcached	apc
note that one could always use some kind of shared memory mechanism apc memcached etc.. to keep sqlite s in-memory databases persistent across connections

2192187
getter	setter
got getter and setter for this field

2192256
children	parent
say you have a parent and that parent has a collection of children

2192256
children	parent
hibernate now can lazy-load the children which means that it does not actually load all the children when loading the parent

2192285
int	chars
i ve also noticed that using int or unsigned int works without needing to swap variables but chars doesn t

2192307
int	chars
because u reads and stores an unsigned int which is very likely larger than the single unsigned chars you have

2192307
int	chars
there is no way to read an int string such as 42 and store it in a chars

2192327
sqldatasource	detailsview
i m using a detailsview with an sqldatasource in the aspx page

2192339

as the documentation states for audiorecord and audiotrack

2192379
mediarecorder	audiotrack	mediarecorder	audiorecord	audiotrack	audiorecord
if you want audio in other formats either don t use audiorecord and audiotrack try mediarecorder and mediaplayer or you will have to transcode it using your own code possibly leveraging the ndk

2192379
audiotrack	audiorecord
audiorecord and audiotrack are designed specifically for cases where the audio in question is not supported by the opencore multimedia engine either because it s not a supported codec or not a supported streaming protocol sip

2192386
int	chars
that is your bug your variables were of type unsigned chars which is 1 byte however you entered 12 which is 4 bytes a unsigned int that caused an overflow implementation defined by the compiler runtime and that would explain it overwriting the next variable in memory

2192386
int	chars
you used the u specifier for printf which is an unsigned int for a unsigned chars variable that is incorrect and does not match up

2192405
width	height
this opens a new xaml window which contains a documentviewer control and a listbox with the choice of different labels 1 sheet with 12 labels 2 columns 6 rows 1 sheet with a single label whose width and height can be user defined

2192406
gridex	janus
the reason for this is because janus gridex s do not read from the datasource until the control is visible the control has loaded

2192469
inherited	properties
are there any options or plugins that display inherited members methods properties inline when editing a class file in visual studio

2192477

i would like to model a person s relationship to another person where the relationship isn t necessarily hierarchical friends colleagues rather than parent children and i am interested in capturing more detail about each relationship notes type of relationship date established

2192481
children	parent
to answer your question above about what on delete cascade does it allows you to delete a parent key record in person and it s corresponding children records in hobby without having to delete all the children records first

2192506
maven	pom.xml
it shows how you can maven deploy to sf without the need for any pom.xml tricks or plugins

if you use a modern browser firefox + firebug safari on mac google-chrome opera ie8 you can right click on an element in a page and use the command called inspect vary from browser to browser

2192525
crypt	salt
it seems that the crypt dislikes + char in the salt and a lot of other special chars as well etc

2192602
int	chars
would this do by using the itoa function to convert the number and store it into a buffer and use the string s custom reverse function which returns back a pointer to chars and convert the pointer to chars to an int again using the atoi function

2192602
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2192610
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
i guessed it s because it shares one nsmanagedobjectcontext instance for all read operations so i rewrote the class so it shares only nsmanagedobjectmodel and nspersistentstorecoordinator instances and creates it s own nsmanagedobjectcontext instance

2192618
outputstream	inputstream
note that generally apis that try to handle files should be written to handle inputstream outputstream as well to allow this kind of operations to suceed

2192636
inherited	properties
for a strongly-typed view i have a basemodel class that has properties that the master page needs and all my other models inherited the base class

2192666

2192880
int	chars
when casting int to chars or chars to other simple types what are some of the side effects that can occur

2192935
superclass	subclassing
you can probably implement your idea by subclassing uiscrollview and then implement a different behaviour in touchedbegan moved ended modifying the touches and passing them to the superclass if needed

2192994
unsigned	short
in short you can t rely on shift working identically for signed and unsigned chars so if you need portability use unsigned char rather than char or signed char

2193006
draggable	droppable
these basically make a list draggable and other areas droppable sortable

2193007
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
if there s no dos2unix command then try opening the post-commit hook in an editor that lets you change line endings on windows i believe that notepad+ will but i m not a windows guy like emacs textmate or vim and remove the extra character at the end of the first line and probably all other lines

2193011
int	chars
when casting int to chars or chars to other simple types

2193011
unsigned	short
casting an unsigned char with value 0xff to a unsigned short however yields 0x00ff

2193044
maven	m2e
maybe you can configure m2e to do this automatically on resource changes right-click on your project then select properties maven and add the appropriate war goal to the goals to invoke on resource changes

2193118
inline	inlining
so f# also supports static constraints the type parameter is a instead of usual a and these are processed at compile time using inlining this also explains why the function has to be inline

2193166
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol with four tabitem in it

2193194
waitpid	posix
you can use posix waitpid with wnohang to do a no-blocking wait or signals to check if your child is still running or you can use pipes check when it gets closed

2193233
filesystems	fat
this would be similar to how the fat filesystems works

2193279
folder	directory
i don t do websphere anymore but i know that it s built on top of tomcat and that tomcat by default stores the compiled jsp files in work folder of the installation directory

2193309
lpwstr	bstr
arraysubtype of lpstr lpwstr bstr or

2193326
width	height
in general 3d bin-packing problems have the added complication that the objects can be rotated into different positions so for any object with a given length width and height you effectively have to create three variables representing each position but you only use one in the solution

2193330
put	get
what i ended up doing was using perl with the pdf reuse and pdf reuse barcode libraries to get all pdfs in the directory pull the pages i wanted put the barcode and save out to a new pdf

2193351
int	double
you are using double s not int s

2193425

2193546
stdout	stderr
sshclient.exec_command returns a triple stdin stdout stderr

2193581
post	get
it is possible to do everything just with post and get

2193581
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example today thinking about a mvc model you can limit your application to respond just to specific kinds of verbs like post get put and delete

2193581
post	get
even if under the hood everything is emulated to post and get don t make sense to have different verbs for different actions

2193586
subtract	add
very short operations short arithmetic add subtract simple state flag changes etc are better suited for a spinlock

2193589

2194207
actionscript	mxml

2194305
gridview	onclientclick
here is the code for the gridview onprerender event where the onclientclick event of the checkbox is set

2194309
implements	extends
i think i would like to implements it as something that extends a jpanel so it can be embedded as a component in other windows

2194324
post	get
i use separate view models for input get and output post as well unless the two models are identical

2194324

2194552
getter	setter
first the setter is probably called less often than the getter so you re doing less work

2194568

when implementing argument checking in apis i usually check for each condition separately and throw different exceptions argumentnullexception for a null reference or depending on the api specifications argumentexception for an empty string

2194594
post	get
my method is to have an action that handles both the post and the get scenarios

2194594

2194789
hash	salt
if you don t store the salt with the hash password in the configuration you d have to store it somewhere else and extract it from there to hash incoming passwords when you perform the test

2194789
hash	salt
since sha1 is a fixed 160 bits 20bytes it s easy to grab the salt by simply skipping the first 20 characters in the hash password in the configuration

2194829
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsview is often hooked up to a qgraphicsscene

2194834
width	height
another strangeness is that in sizechanged i am using glsurfaceview this is the override method in the renderer required by glsurfaceview i always get width 480 and height 800 no matter whether i start the app in full screen mode

2194844
public	protected
note the access tag was useful with php 4 when there were no public protected private but i never use it when i document code written in php 5 the code using the visibility keywords is self-documenting

2194857
min	max
this function will take values one at a time - so there is no iterating over all values to scale them all or see what the min and max is

2194860
subscript	superscript
i see for nsattributedstring has a specific attribute for superscript but i can t find one for subscript

2194879
dictionary	map
that said the f# runtime fsharp.core.dll does include a few immutable collection classes like list set and map which roughly are immutable counterparts to the list hashset and dictionary classes found in system.collections.generic since it is often useful to have immutable collections for persistent snapshots in multi-threaded code

2194914
innodb	myisam
i am updating this question to reflect the comparison between myisam innodb

2194914
postgresql	mysql	innodb	myisam
i ran a test against mysql innodb myisam and postgresql to see how well

2194914
postgresql	mysql
mysql version was 5.0.67-community-nt-log 32-bit postgresql version was 8.4

2194914
postgresql	mysql
these are the create table statements used in mysql and postgresql

2194914
innodb	myisam
why is it that innodb and myisam are so far apart in terms of time to complete a full table scan

2194914
postgresql	mysql
for reference here are my config files for mysql and postgresql

2194958
dictionary	map
the dictionary is implemented as a c++ stl std map which has o lg n lookups

2194964
hide	show
i was digging through the hoverintent logic and realized that it itself is triggering the function to show hide the menu

2194974
int	boolean
what about the color int rgb boolean hasalpha constructor

2194991
keydown	keyup
have you bound keyboard events keyup keypress or keydown to these associated elements

2195006
affinity	processors
unless a thread has a processors affinity mask the scheduler will move it from processors to processors in order to give it execution time

2195006
affinity	processors
to specify processors affinity for a thread use the setthreadaffinitymask function

2195087
folder	directory
hudson seems to expect nant_home to point to a folder that contains a bin directory where nant.exe can be found

2195095
gridview	repeater
i m binding this result to a gridview and i need the xml column to be bound to a nested repeater as it contains parent-child data

2195099
getter	setter
for something this simple you re better off just providing the getter and setter

2195118
put	get
to get the xml available on the client-side in part of your transform you can output the sections of xml that you need or the whole dom and put that either in a javascript variable or somewhere accessible on the page

2195118
client-side	server-side
i ve found that rendering client-side is nice for small controlled internal uses but for anything where you want tight control over the output server-side is more reliable

2195126
int	chars
they can be fixed by using a chars constant converting the numeric constant to a chars or converting the chars to an unsigned chars before the comparison operator promotes both to an int

2195148
int	chars
in regular c would give you an int from 0 to 25 for strings starting with lowercase-alpha chars

2195178
uiview	subviews
i am trying to graph large amounts of data in a uiview as a subviews of a uiscrollview

2195178
min	max	minimum	max
in order to overcome the memory limitations surrounding enormous uiviews i plan once the scrollview s offset has reached the maximum or minimum offset to redraw the view with the new data either with a lesser x value if it has reached minimum or visa versa and then increase the view s offset to the opposite of its current position ie max-- min and min-- max

2195195
range	minimum	subtract	add
for each number you want to scale add the inverse of the minimum input value scale by the scaling factor and then subtract the output range offset

2195195
range	max	range	min	min	max
you need to find out what the operating range for the mouse is and what values can come out of it and that will give you your min and max values

2195199
firefox	safari
when i attempt this in firefox and safari the html updates properly

2195203
ubuntu	linux
i use python based as well as rails applications on ubuntu linux

2195221
trie	tree
in that respect a trie is similar to the tree you already have and a hash map will probably be better-behaved than a naively-allocated tree

2195315
min	max
count sum avg aggregate min max

2195406
accessor	properties
remove the set accessor and mark the properties as readonly

2195496
many-to-one	one-to-many
this is not a pattern specific to data access and hibernate but it is particularly useful in such fields and hibernate supports lazy loading of one-to-many associations and single-point associations one-to-one and many-to-one also under certain conditions

2195524
setinterval	settimeout
first of all get out of the habit of passing strings as the first argument to settimeout and setinterval

2195659
width	height
the first line specifies width and height where the width is the number of characters per line the height is the number of lines

2195659
subtraction	addition
now because of the addition subtraction from and you will likely access out of range -1 or 25

2195662
ironruby	ironpython
if boo isn t your thing then maybe you could look at defining something similar in ironruby ironpython or f#

2195675
post	put	post	get	put	get
when you get the 204 it just shows you that there is nothing to return usually you expect if you make a post or put call that does not need to return anything

2195688
onclick	onfocus
onfocus and onclick states

2195703
mouseover	mouseout
i think that every time #bd1 crosses your mouse pointer which is presumably hovering over the image it is calling the mouseout then calling mouseover when it gets past

2195732
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m pretty sure you can achieve this using the lambda expression form by explicitly using the ienumerable version of select instead of iqueryable

2195741
width	height
i don t think the focus should be on how big the sprite is physically width x height but rather how big the sprite file size is and ask yourself the question if it would be worth splitting the sprite into multiple sprites

2195767
post	get
it s the same reason there is no good way to get a list of all the post across all of the blogs with just a query

2195782
int	boolean
bitwise operators only work against integral types like int and boolean but enum is not directly cast-able to int

2195826
pull	push
the public framework code and push to my private github repo and then send a pull request from the public framework.

2195870
solaris	aix
i ve personally done this for solaris sparc x86 aix hp-ux and linux x86 x64 .

2195886
dependency-injection	factories
to inject or build either use dependency-injection framework spring or build the object somewhere in bootstrap factories code yourself

2195950
actionscript	mxml
how does one initialize a collection instance from mxml in flex actionscript

2195971
cakephp	silverstripe
i also have a web application using silverstripe at www.domain.com and another at app.domain.com using cakephp

2195971
cakephp	silverstripe
the challenge however is that both www.domain.com silverstripe and app.domain.com cakephp have their own complex rewrite rules and i can t seem to build an htaccess script that successfully retains the functionality of the respective applications.

2195975
pull	push
edit you might try performing a pull from a linux machine or vm if you have it and then renaming the file without the weird characters then commit and push back to the repository

2196080
int	chars	atoi	fgetc
fgetc to read individual chars and parse them yourself accumulate digits until you hit whitespace and you have an int to convert with atoi

2196107
clearinterval	settimeout
the last thing i remember doing is adding a clearinterval method to clear some settimeout intervals variables

2196164
ostream	ostringstream
the operator returns the base type ostream while the str member function exists only on the derived type ostringstream

2196210
vb.net	vb6
first even if you migrate from vb6 to vb.net there are several language specific features in vb.net that will not translate directly to c#

2196220
outputstream	inputstream
i have an archive object which manages various byte arrays and hands out inputstream s and outputstream s for reading and writing them

2196226
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
just use threadpool.queueuserworkitem and a reset event manualresetevent or autoresetevent to trap the completion state and block your main thread

2196278
google-chrome	firefox
my tabs work flawlessly in firefox and google-chrome on windows and os x...but not in ie

2196299
google-chrome	firefox
i realize that declaring a variable with the name event is bad code but i am curious about the technical difference here that the use of var in ie reinitializes the variable to null whereas google-chrome will not overwrite with a var declaration unless a value is explicitly assigned and maybe firefox holds the event object outside of the window s var declaration scope altogether

2196325
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
see pdo prepare and pdostatement execute

2196339
maven	cargo
the maven cargo plugin allows to declare a that sets system properties in the jvm so it should be possible to configure the plugin like this

2196345
accessor	properties
therefore instead of looking for the method you can either omit the optional parameter instead of having to provide type.missing or you can avoid calling the get accessor completely and instead reference the properties name using square brackets

2196361
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there aren t any special requirements on the server side although only certain browsers safari google-chrome and in some cases firefox support html5 streaming

2196371
mockups	balsamiq
i was inspired by balsamiq mockups which has been hugely successful over the past couple years

2196399

i m using portableapps.com s portable java and i ve got it to store the home folder stuf using -j-duser.home data but how do i change the web cache preferrably to a folder called cache in the same directory

2196408
client-side	server-side
in my opinion a complex a rich client-side experience is going to require some in-depth javascript regardless of the server-side implementation

2196408
client-side	server-side
frameworks and ide tools have been traditionally weaker for client-side development compared to server-side this is slowly getting better

2196456
dreamweaver	aptana
try aptana i use it every day as part of my job even though i have an install of dreamweaver

2196465

2196593
width	margin
how to make inner div to get width of outer div minus 8px margin

2196633
post	get
the summary of my post is that the great thing about linq is that you can customize how the operators behave to get quite elegant code

2196653
width	height
before html 4 and css very few html elements supported both border and padding so the definition of the width and height of an element was not very contentious

2196653
width	margin
it adopted a definition width in relation to content border margin and padding similar to that for a table cell

2196676
portrait	landscape
this puts two landscape letter pages onto a single portrait letter sheet to be bound folded along the top

2196787
int	boolean
instead of int and boolean you have to use int and boolean

2196792
post	get
i also changed get to post

2196796
width	height
according to the css1 specification released by the world wide web consortium w3c in 1996 and revised in 1999 when a width or height is explicitly specified for any block-level element it should determine only the width or height of the visible element with the padding borders and margins applied afterward

2196814
width	margin
it s better that the default behaviour is that the width of the container is not affected by padding or margin values

2196823
post	get
i ve been trying to follow this blog post to get my python version back to the snow leopard default

2196833

2197309
put	get
if you put a breakpoint in convert does it get hit in the debugger in any of the 3 cases

2197708
post	get
the openid spec doesn t allow for the rp to mandate a post instead of a get

2197708
post	get	pop-up	dialog
in fact get is generally considered preferable to post since it s faster and doesn t tend to pop-up warning dialog to the user if the op is an https endpoint and the rp is an http endpoint

2197773
mouseover	mouseout
i have a sprite menu and i am using jquery for the mouseover mouseout and click

2199694
packets	pcap
for example to use dpkt to read packets from a saved pcap

2199698
stdout	stderr
never thought about it but why not write the usage instructions to stderr if the program was called with no or wrong arguments and write it to stdout when called with a --help or similar argument

2199698
stdout	stderr
this way if the usage is shown because of an error it goes to stderr and if it s not an error because the user requested it it goes to stdout

2200486
lisp	smalltalk
take for example smalltalk lisp java and c++

2200486
lisp	smalltalk
in fact several modern high-performance jvms are actually either smalltalk vms in disguise derived from smalltalk vms or written by smalltalk vm companies. lisp is also interesting because although it is a dynamic language there are some although not many static high-performance implementations

2200504
filtering	grouping
but with the pins on their own or in small grouping i want to make sure they don t get filtering

2202401
ascx	scriptmanager
the only problem is that i don t seem to find a way to include scriptmanager inside the ascx itself - only on the pages that host this control which is prone to error and defeats the purpose and just seems wrong

2202401
ascx	scriptmanager
is there a way to define scriptmanager inside the ascx and define web method as you normally would in the code behind of the control itself

2203123
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
i m also not sure that enable disable will work with a div or a-tag you might be better off using fadeout and fadein or just show and hide to disable the links

2203136
width	height
also you specify a cols and rows value on the textarea and then style a width and height

2203158

setup a virtual directory in iis that points to the website folder of your dnn installation

2203285
versioning	upgrade
note the use of a source versioning of dnn for production use is not recommended additionally it is my personal recommendation to not modify the source unless you are truly willing to accept that future upgrade might not be possible due to your modifications

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
then get it looking right for both firefox and google-chrome

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
only after you have it looking right in firefox and google-chrome should you start concerning yourself with how it looks in ie

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
after you do the above if it still doesn t look right in both firefox and google-chrome set the first and second padding values for your #s rule-set to 0 change 8px to 0px and then add a margin-top declaration to both #s and #searchsubmit and give both the same value for example margin-top 8px

2203313
post	get
however this post tells you how to get it working

2203327

uiview	subviews
i am developing an iphone app that places multiple custom uiview as subviews in a uiscrollview

2203804
width	height
this size matches the css width and height properties

2203807
rational-numbers	base
but if you re using integers or rational-numbers for your control points then you can use groebner base to rewrite your bi-variate order-3 polynomials into a possibly-up-to-order-9-thus-your-nine-possible-intersections monovariate polynomial

2203807
short	base
burchburger has a layman-friendly introduction to groebner base called grã bner base a short introduction for systems theorists that was very helpful for me

2203811
sysv	systemd
that link is for linux other systemd should do one or the other depending on their sysv vs

2203822
jar	war
the next day sit with him her and have them explain how to compile and build a jar or war

2203822
jar	war
the should be able to compile and build a jar war at the very least imo

2203841
width	height
you might have to override qwidget sizehint in the toolbox class to make the widget exactly as large as it needs to be to fit all the buttons in the case of your six buttons the width would be 64 and the height would be 96

2203894
put	get
it s like for example if you re writing a regex to detect backslashes you have to escape the backslash in the regex by doubling it and if you re using a language without regex literals you have to put it in a string with correct escapes so it ends up as four backslashes in a row which looks completely wrong but it s right when you think about the interaction of different levels of escape mechanism by the way i originally tried to write out those backslashes but in order to get around stackoverflow s own escape mechanism i would have had to write eight backslashes in a row and it didn t feel safe to write that

2203903
mouse	keyboard
it disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget

2203906
mvp	presenter
are there any reasons you can think of why direct method calls from the view to the presenter are bad in mvp

2203950
put	get
constant is an alternative way to get hold of a constant but a function call can t be put into a string without concatenation either

2203956
inherited	properties
you can inherited your own control from checkedlistbox and create a properties in c# it would be like this the rest of the functionality remains the same as it is inherited so no further additional code required

2204049
button	checkbox
probably best to implement this by having a checkbox with each row then when the delete button is clicked it calls sql to delete each checked row using the filter from 1 and primary key metadata mentioned in 2 as well as to remove it from the table

2204098
children	parent
for the test case there are 4 records in the table 1 parent 3 children

2204119
accessor	superclass
module is the superclass of the class class so if a suitably generic name could be thought of then the methods for defining accessor could be put on module and it would work for modules and classes

2204208
allocator	stl
you can use stl containers to do just about anything you would do with raw memory including allocator and initializing all in one fell swoop

2204216
boost	stl
its codebase goes back maybe 12 or 13 years and while we have put work into upgrading and maintaining it use of stl and boost - when i joined most containers were custom for example - fully upgraded to unicode and the 2010 vcl etc there s one remaining very significant problem it s fully singlethreaded

2204222
free	malloc
the second easiest is to malloc and free them

2204291
accessor	properties
when you declare a member of a class that has get and or set defined formally known as accessor you are defining a properties

2204359
inherited	properties
the advantage of this is that you are guaranteeing that the properties can only be set by either the base class or any class that inherited the base class

2204373
range	max
what i really need is exactly like the range slider except that the max shouldn t have a handle and shouldn t be movable by the user

2204373
range	minimum
one idea that comes to mind but i don t know how to implement is to superimpose a range with fixed minimum slider and hidden handle on top of a regular slider

2204382
inherited	properties
fb_controller inherited from controller and has a properties facebook that is instantiated using the api key and secret upon construction

2204395

a solution i ve seen implemented with grid components is to have a column chooser - some sort of pop-up dialog that lists the columns and you can select which ones you would like to see in the grid

2204421
post	get
the fact that you have a non-common domain will create the need to supply the encrypted piece in the header either post or get and pass it in plaintext

now i need to be able to retrieve a value databound in a label inside of a repeater and use it as an input parameter for the gridview

2204482
gridview	repeater
so i basically want the label control rollidlabelcode which is located in a repeater to also be an input into my gridview

2204497
war	manifest.mf
since all of the wars use the same jars we store them in the lib folder of the ear and then for each war we reference the jars in the ear lib folder in each wars manifest.mf

2204497
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
what usually happens is that another developer adds or removes a jar say changes myjar-1.0.0 to myjar-1.1.0 and updates all of the manifest.mf files in each war

2204497
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
the only way to cure this is to open the properties of each war go into the j2ee module dependencies tab uncheck a random jar which prompts the user to checkout the manifest.mf .classpath and .project click apply which saves the manifest and then re-check the jar and hit apply once again

2204501
width	height
i like it because it produces results in one pass but it assumes that font width scales like its height

2204548
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
to make every tab in my application autorotate properly i ve defined -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation in my custom view controllers but they are all inside uinavigationcontroller within a uitabbarcontroller so the message won t get sent down the chain to my vc until those two also respond

2204552
put	get
i install on the simulator and it works fine but as soon as i put it on my device i get the following error

2204566
serializable	deserialization
you shouldn t attempt to proxy a request to invoke a method inside the same application - this will incur needless serializable deserialization of objects to xml messages and back

2204579
multiplying	add
i m trying to write a simple function that takes two inputs x and y and passes these to three other simple functions that add multiplying and divide them

2204589
post	get
and finally here s a blog post outlining how to get it done and quickly

2204591
children	parent
setting such property on the parent will apply to all of its children unless those are set explicitly

2204615
ssl	https
when i deployed the project with the web.config below enabling ssl https www.mydomain .com service.svc sessions does not even pull up at all

2204657
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
say i have two uiviewcontroller all working under a uinavigationcontroller

2204657
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve put my cd calls into viewwillappear currently in viewdidload

2204728
centos	linux
operating system is linux centos 5.4 32bit

2204741
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
the first question as somebody noted has nothing to do with metaclass you simply can t multiply inherited from any two classes a and b in this order where b is a subclassing of a

2204818
int	double
yet why are the int written big-endian yet the double written little-endian

2204858
rss	feed
i iterate a rss feed like so where _file is the feed

2204904
mouse	keyboard
the controller interprets the keyboard and mouse and manipulates both the camera view and scene model

2204906
disk	ram
another possibility may be throwing a lot more ram at the problem and using it as a disk cache

2204917
ant	maven
the process i m constrained to use requires a single build which will be promoted through the environments to production so i m unable to use substitution ala maven or ant

2204952
ant	maven
if you use ant maven this should be fairly straightforward to achieve

2204952
ant	maven
ant maven that should provide you with the ability to substitute a value

2204966
children	parent
assuming you re right that its the ultimate parent i assume that it is so because it makes it easy to find all of forms in your application enumerating the children of this master form

2205016
width	height
text height and width are as though the text is being drawn horizontally normally. i m pretty certain .net s drawing framework probably includes graphics textheight ... and textwidth ... methods and if it doesn t by those names i m sure they re easy to find textrect perhaps

2205044
pop-up	dialog
i am using the below code to pop-up the authentication dialog

2205052
width	height
if you have a width and length then when somebody asks you have length width sqft and if you add height volume as well

2205064
rtl	vhdl
with vhdl you can define your own new types which lets you program at a higher level still rtl of course

2205064
verilog	vhdl	altera	xilinx
i m pretty sure the xilinx and altera free tools support both vhdl and verilog

2205071
width	height
if you like you can bind values to the width and height and turn off the scroll bars so they don t pop up if the image is bigger than the window

2205071
width	height
1 bind the canvas width height to a simple calculation or

2205071
width	height
2 add a listener that responds to resize events and sets the bound width height variables or

2205081
width	height
all the text and url are wrapped in a div with fixed width and height yet the url still overflows

2205151
listview	gridview
i m using listview with gridview

2205165
public	protected
another useful trick that is applicable while using properties is the ability to modify the modifier of the the derived properties like changing from public access to protected

2205195
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
i am not familiar with rad but i do store the jar war in clearcase without the version number meaning our manifest.mf file does not change that often

2205195
jar	war
that being said this ibm article references some methods to include those jar war files that could be worth a try to see of the manifest is updated

2205195
jar	war
either reference them through a common project not referenced on clearcase and only there to include the jar war files

2205205
switching	screens
if you login and go to your blog page then switching to structure editing mode by clicking the cubes icon at the top right of the screens you can then access the configure this page button for the blog page

2205228
profiling	instrumentation
1 have you or can you profiling with instrumentation during these hangs

2205245
post	get
one of the approaches i use is install fiddler and monitor the post and get packets while manually logging in the site

2205247
min	max
so at the very least you need to set the min and max properties on the print dialog object to something reasonable before you set the flags

2205247
min	max
if you just set min and max the page selection will default both the to and from fields to 1

2205247
min	max
if you set min to 1 and max to -1 and also set frompage to 1 and topage to -1 the from field will default 1 and the to field will be empty

2205247
min	max
it s interesting that this works since the documentation states that max must be larger than min but it looks like -1 is treated more like an empty or null value

2205256
pull	push
with the reactive framework due out in .net 4.0 we will see linq expand to not only pull queries but to push scenarios too

2205316
getter	setter
i have a dynamic list of variables for which i need to create getter and setter on the fly during runtime

2205319
uiview	subviews
so once the view controller calls this inside the uiview i have a button that changes the subviews so what i do is use the super addsubview newview

2205325
ssl	https
is ssl and https one and the same.

2205368
int	double
casting an int to a double doesn t require a cast

2205372
getter	setter
make sure all properties fields and public getter setter match and make sure they re clear

2205374
ssl	https
is ssl and https one and the same.

2205374
ssl	https
ssl ensures that data is encrypted and decrypted back and forth while you are viewing the website https is the uri that is need to access the secure website

2205378
int	double
if you are trying to convert the bits of your int to a the representation of a double you need to cast the address not the value

2205381
int	double
maybe it s doing an implicit conversion from int to float before it attempts the cast to double

2205382
profiling	instrumentation
as for instrumentation you really want to use time profiling to see where the system is spending all its time - preferably on the device itself

2205393
int	double
the compiler rejects what you wrote as nonsense because int and double may be objects with different sizes

2205393
int	double
this is potentially dangerous because if x and y are diffrent sizes let s say int is four bytes and double is eight bytes then when you dereference the eight bytes of memory at to fill in y you will access four bytes of x and four bytes of .

2205393
int	double
if you want to convert a int to a double use a static_cast and it will perform conversion

2205409
mouse	keyboard
you can use events filters on your mouse and keyboard events to filter some keypress or mouseclick when you need so

2205469
mouse	keyboard
this function can you call from either keyboard events of mouse events

2205471
16-bit	64bit
one thing i can say if it s a 16-bit application and your windows7 installation is 64bit vice 32-bit you re far less likely to succeed in getting it running

2205480
yacc	sablecc
sablecc is powerful yet much simpler to use than antlr javacc yacc etc

2205535
mamp	wamp
the best thing to get if you dont already have it is a wamp or mamp server to do testing on you

2205557
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
what you should probably do is compare your views which fields are displayed filtering sorting grouping etc. with each other and also with the view inside your web part

2205566
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
one option might be to write some kind of proxy that the httpwebrequest sends to maybe via the servicepoint and in that implementation buffer the entire tcp request

2205571
hide	show
consider the following example where two placeholders are show on-screen and we ll use jquery to hide them

2205598
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome

2205621
mouse	keyboard
the way i have right now is through calling a function in my main loop which queries the mouse and keyboard using getdevicestate in a nutshell and their respective arguments

2205637
jax-ws	saaj
one could use saaj soap with attachments api for java which runs at a lower level than jax-ws

2205645
ssl	https
is ssl and https one and the same.

2205653
mouse	keyboard
the ultimate goal pretty pages for mouse users accessible pages for keyboard users

2205653
google-chrome	safari
the following solution works in ie6+ ff2+ safari 3+ and google-chrome

2205655
inherited	properties
actionscript-3 documentation says this the avm1movie object can use methods and properties inherited from the displayobject class such as x y width and so on

2205660
put	get
try and put that url link on the browser and if you get a http 404 then you know that the path is the problem

2205679
post	get
not as practical as the first post but i have found the following articles to be great when i needed to get the big picture

2205723
icefaces	woodstock
for the maintenance and migration of some jsf woodstock applications to icefaces or other frameworks i would like to know if there are gui editors for java server faces available

2205770
vbscript	jscript
i know this might not look like it s answering your question but save yourself more pain and heartache than you can imagine by doing this in jscript or vbscript

2205770
vbscript	jscript
however you can be assured that windows script host jscript vbscript is already on windows from xp onwards possibly from w2k onwards

2205859
hide	show
show all http requests run by the browser there is no way to hide them

2205872
post	get
update so changing the .post to a .ajax call and having that call use get instead of post appears to work

2205904
put	get
generally when i program i look for a library or api to get and put data from and to the datastore in my chosen language

2205905
sortedmap	sortedset
a modified treap is used to back the included sortedset and sortedmap collections

2205921
post	get
maybe you could post your kernel code here and get some feedback

2205970
ssl	https
is ssl and https one and the same

2205982
rss	feed
an rss feed is generated when someone requests it and not when something is added modified

2205982
rss	feed
in .net there are many ways to generate an rss feed one of them is to use wcf

2205983
fiddler	charles
for windows there is a program called fiddler that does exactly what you need so i did a google search for fiddler for linux and came up with charles

2205990
rss	feed
rather than pre generating the feed why don t you have a dynamic feed url which will pic your data from data source structure the data to rss format and then publish on request

2205990
rss	feed
for more info read here how to create rss feed

2205994
uiview	subviews
if the first uiviewcontroller s view is the web view then instead you ll want to change it back to a uiview then add the webview as its own ivar property as a subviews

2205995
rss	feed
rss feed have a pubdate element using which you can detect whether new entries are added to it

2205995
rss	feed
in .net you can use system.servicemodel.syndication namespace to parse rss feed

2206001
union	distinct
if you used a union then that may well be slower as it has to apply a distinct but union all doesn t have to do that so it should be no different

2206003
rss	feed
nb it s only worth doing this if you read from the rss feed more frequently than you regenerate the information

2206003
rss	feed
i m sure there s plenty of ways to generate an rss feed in .net

2206064
many-to-many	one-to-many
- more complex mappings - bidirectional one-to-many many-to-many inheritance embeddables

2206068
strcpy	strncpy
after this you can use the normal string copying functions such as strcpy or strncpy to copy the value in to test

2206075
strcpy	strncpy
you can use a string copy function like strcpy or even better strncpy which has also some size checks

2206094
memcached	apc
apc is good for caching the code that will regenerate pages when needed and memcached is definitely overkill if we re talking about a small ish application

2206108
consistency	acid
acid tanscations and backup consistency come to mind

2206111
stdout	stderr
this suppresses both stderr and stdout and puts them both into

2206111
stdout	stderr
this kills the stdout and stderr and catches the exit code but it s ugly because i d have to remeber to switch the stdout back to original

2206115
pdfsharp	migradoc
i ve used migradoc pdfsharp for generating .pdf files to great effect

2206145
post	get
i am trying to use the post method in my jquery code but it using the get method for some reason

2206158
opera	safari
it works as expected in opera and safari

2206169
post	get
the type of request to make post or get default is get

2206177
int	double
if you want to reinterpret an int as a double you d have to convert it to a reference type

2206177
int	double
and in any case this of course can t make much sense on a platform with int and double of different size since in case of larger double you will read beyond the memory occupied by x

2206177
int	double
some kind of more meaningful int to double conversion

2206233
tcpdf	fpdf
you can try fpdf or tcpdf

2206281
stdout	stderr
this suppresses both stderr and stdout and puts them both into output

2206298
accessor	properties
i would like to adopt this change in my code but in order to avoid compiler warnings i need to add properties and dynamic declarations to my managed object classes for all those primitive accessor

2206385
mouse	keyboard
s dotted focus outlines only for mouse events but not for keyboard tabbed navigation

2206410
folder	directory
i have tried testing the application in other scenarios calling from a shortcut with the the working directory set to a different folder and it runs fine

2206430
noscript	meta
put a meta refresh in a noscript tag

2206440
wordpress	vbulletin
i m redesigning the template for a wordpress based site which is bridged with a vbulletin forum

2206442
noscript	meta
you should be able to use a meta refresh inside a noscript tag though

2206493
folder	directory
the way i got round this previously is to just create a virtual directory in the local dev machine instance of iis and point it to the folder containing your web project

2206502
gif	png
convert this picture into a gif png

2206528
noscript	meta
it may not be valid but the meta -in- noscript hack as everyone s already posted and been voted down for really is the only way to do what you want

2206533
put	get
put the id of the table classified as another key in the table options so that you get

2206563
postgresql	mysql
configure the hibernate properties to create-drop the schema against mysql or postgresql or whatever is handy on your system and to show sql in the console log

2206563
persistent	transient
explain transient detached and persistent objects with regard to sessions

2206563
persistent	transient
build a dao based on the spring hibernatetemplate that will allow a transient order dto containing a collection of orderitem dtos to be persistent

2206563
persistent	transient
distribute the code and get them to write a unit test to verify the operation of the dao look for transient objects becoming persistent through the id field

2206572
pop-up	dialog
and everything seems to work fine except instead autocompletion working as i expect i get a pop-up dialog displaying the message

2206588
getter	setter
can the getter setter be simplified to be more readable

2206610
google-chrome	firefox
update the code below will return the full file path in ie but for security reasons firefox and google-chrome only give you the file name

2206614
put	get
you will have to get rid of the generics and then cast the values appropriately when using the get and put methods

2206678
inherited	properties
if it is that you re downloading via a stream then what you could do is to make a kind of meter which inherited from stream and exposes a properties that is a summation of the bytes read or written to it s underlying stream object

2206710
width	height
if you add content to a table cell and don t completely fix the width and height of the new stuff you might find yourself with unpleasing gaps all over the page and forgetting to open or close s somewhere with 200 validation errors on the original page you are likely to miss something somewhere may lead to a completely screwed view

2206725
integer	unsigned
a poker hand is represented as a 64-bit unsigned integer with a 1 bit for each card that is present in the hand

2206739
post	get
i was wondering which is the best approach to get the catgeory id when listing the post within a particular category

2206743
tiff	png
when i m saving to tiff png jpeg2000 or draw on screen - it s fine

2206796
versioning	upgrade
sometimes you have to upgrade your curl certificates to latest versioning not to have errors with https

2206814
post	get
i did a little post on how to go about it also explaining how to get the cookie info into to you background script

2206815
profiling	debugging
unless you re doing a very memory intensive program in which it anyway would be more effective to overload allocators in specific places the main benefit of overloading the new and delete operators would be to track allocations and deallocations for debugging and profiling purposes

2206824
allocator	stl
try passing in an allocator with strategies so you can test which suits your needs the best similar to what the stl does

2206853
min	max
how do i declare the min max date structs in a header file without causing this clash

2206862
width	height
my only problem is that the natural behavior of the graphic is to have fixed width and height no matter how many items you have inside your graphic

2206867
inline	inlining
one strategy which compilers use to decide whether to inline is to keep inlining function calls until the resulting code is too big

2206867
inline	inlining
there s an obvious potential benefit in saving call overhead but as against that people don t really expect recursive functions to get inline and there s no particular guarantee that the usual inlining heuristics will perform well with recursive functions where there are two different places the call site and the recursive call that might be inline with different benefits in each case

2206882
dictionary	map
each key would map to a list of values or just one value if all your dictionary s had distinct sets of keys

2206913
komodo	aptana
as well as aptana which is great as suggested by marcgg you might want to try komodo edit or netbeans both of which are also excellent and multi purpose

2206943
ssl	https
as soon as i switch that over to https excel won t download the data anymore it s even a fully official ssl certificate so it s not a problem with a self-signed one

2207020
pop-up	dialog
if you then hit the discover button in the dialog that pop-up it should discover your new web service

2207079
ninject	spring.net
you could also use a dependency injection framework like spring.net ninject etc

2207095
width	height
i found the functions imagesx and imagesy which return the width height from a resource but i can t find any function that tell me the mime type from a resource

2207164
hide	show
i would like to show and hide the divs that are just under body tag not the ones which are under another div tag

2207204
google-chrome	firefox
the popup appears fine in firefox and google-chrome but it shown at the bottom of the page in ie8

2207217
daemons	launchd
every daemons is then started by launchd based on the plist file

2207225
lwjgl	jogl
it s a scenegraph engine which is layered on top of lwjgl or jogl

2207231
width	height
to answer the 2nd part of you question you could parse the jpeg file header to find the width height information without actually loading in the image

2207257
integer	unsigned
perform the actual squaring in a 64-bit unsigned integer

2207294
width	height
in imaging 1024x768 is simply the width height of the image so as others have mentioned you ve already shown the code that retrieves these numbers

2207296
nuxeo	alfresco
at the moment i am in doubth to choose between alfresco and nuxeo

2207326
nuxeo	alfresco
don t know the nuxeo system but we are using alfresco as a document storage and session server

2207330
restrict	shared
it definitely is not possible to do with pure php perl python or any other scripting language on a restrict shared hosting environment

2207337
inherited	properties
the inherited which say that all of his children simple-weather and simple-webapp will inherited all of his properties this concept is almost the same thing as the extends in java

2207337
maven	pom.xml
maven will compile the parent project and then install the pom.xml in the local repository

2207337
maven	pom.xml
maven will compile the simple-weather project but as it has a parent maven will look the parent pom.xml file into the local repository

2207337
maven	pom.xml
maven will do the same thing for the parent pom.xml but also for the simple-weather project

2207355
tolower	toupper
you can put constants on it or certain helper functions often used like toupper tolower or isnumber clipnumber aso

2207367
onfocus	onblur
then your text box will have the onfocus and onblur events wired up

2207406
getter	setter
i have a registrationvo with few properties and getter setter for that

2207455
width	height
however to get similar behaviour i would simply create a new usercontrol for each item in the view stack and add these to a parent form at the same location and with the same width height

2207464
client-side	server-side
javascript client-side validation server-side validation is of course also present

2207589
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for firefox safari google-chrome you can use window.stop

2207608
fadein	fadeout
you fadein and fadeout of jquery

2207624
lisp	prolog
so i encourage you with using a language designed for this kind of problem better suited to your application functional paradigm ex lisp logical paradigm ex prolog or something like that

2207684
for-loop	arrays
the naive way would be to simply search one arrays for each of the elements of the other arrays with a for-loop

2207688
caliburn	prism
if you re looking for a framework that helps you apply some best practices in wpf silverlight development similar to mvc helping you in the asp.net world you may want to have a look at caliburn and or prism aka

2207703
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in safari and google-chrome but not in firefox i ll not get started on ie s issues just yet

2207713
versioning	upgrade
once you figure out what type of features you want to offer in a lite versioning one thing you could do to offer an in-place upgrade for customers in to use the in-app purchase mechanism

2207723
nant	cruisecontrol
i am just starting to pick up nant as a replacement for msbuild in our cruisecontrol project

2207723
folder	directory
one of the things we do inside a set of projects is link in a single assemblyinfo.cs file from outside of the project tree to make versioning easier it lives in a directory above the project folder

2207764
debian	linux
platform debian linux java tm se runtime environment build 1.6.0_16-b01

isapi	iirf
i will be using the iirf isapi filter to perform the rewriting for an asp.net website

2207869
post	get
post some specific errors if you can t get it to work they ll probably all fall in one or two classes of problems and someone will quickly be able to help you

2207879
mouse	keyboard
if the computer running it is left idle no mouse or keyboard input for a sufficiently long time varies between an hour or so and a couple of days the swing display sometimes stops updating totally we ve got among other things a clock shown on-screen that stops updating until the user moves the mouse

2207941
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately it works in firefox but not in safari and google-chrome still not tested in opera and ie

2208003
128bit	64bit
i am not sure why some 32 bits program can run just fine on 64bit but for us in the future say if we have a 128bit architecture and os released in the future what can we do in term of programming if we want our program to be able to run in a different bit architecture

2208046
wsdl2java	axiom
then it appears that wsdl2java needs axiom jars when using xmlbeans bindings

2208082
post	get
there is lots of useful information returned available in either a get or post request

2208087
background-color	transparency
this works kind of as expected but background-color is transparency

2208104
post	get
you jquery can then get or post to a controller action which can return as follows

2208126
stdout	stderr
the main problem i m facing is how do i delete what i ve already sent into stdout stderr

2208136
post	get
this will enable caching more agressively but you ll have to craft those uris and will still get hit by the initial post

2208145
implements	extends
you could also create an abstract base class that implements igrid that implements the setdefaults method and let projectmodel extends the abstract class

2208145
srp	principles
single responsibility principles srp only tells that a class should only have one reason to change which is a very vague restriction since a change can be as narrow and broad as you want it to be

2208145
getter	setter
a dto from a purist sense shouldn t have logic in it other than accessors getter methods which makes it strange that projectmodel itself has references to pagerhelper and sorthelper which i assume can mutate it they re setter

2208183
typedef	struct
it just acts as a typedef to the pointer of the struct

aggregate-functions	sum
i can use the function delta as an extracontext but also id like to include the sum of all delta results in the template in this case i have to make an aggregate but again since delta is not a db field nor a model field i cant use it in an aggregate-functions

2208235
superclass	subclassing
if that is the case then probably the best form would be to instead initialize it only in the superclass constructor and then invoke that superclass constructor in each subclassing constructor like super foo

get and post seem to be sufficient with appropriate verbs

2208360
xml-rpc	json-rpc
there s some benefit to xml-rpc json-rpc in that you kinda know what you re getting back but in any case if i cant easily parse your return type with json or something like php s simplexml and essentially serialize it to a consistent hash i m going to be pissed

2208375
post	put
option 3 put to some separated sub-resource is your best bet right now and it wouldn t necessarily be wrong to just use post on the main resource itself - although you could disagree with that depending on how pedantic you want to be about it

2208400
ubuntu	debian
what are the environment variables made available to debian rules often make when spawned by apt-get during installation of a package under ubuntu

2208445
post	get
the get post etc describes the action verb so also putting it in the url makes it redundant

better way would be to have api user 7123 and use get post method to signify operations

2208497
pop-up	dialog
i have recently come to an instance where i want to pop-up a new dialog window which will host this usercontrol

2208498

2208730
stateless	stateful
there is a server-side stateful component for each user so intuitively this will limit the number of users compared to a traditional application that is stateless

2208730
stateless	stateful
stateful programming on the server for web apps is far far easier that stateless

2208744
nunit	mspec
mspec is not like nunit in that it only executes the context made up of the establish clauses from the current class and all base classes and the because clause once followed by all of the specifications it clauses

2208744
nunit	mspec
what you re actually doing here is using mspec like nunit

2208754
pecl	pear
i installed pear with go-pear then used pecl to install xdebug

2208757
hash	md5
or md5 company user articleid together and then index the hash that s created

union	distinct
my first guess is to try using union to combine multiple distinct queries with the same result structure into a single query that hits the database just once

2208786
uiview	subviews
the original uiview object that mysubview was referring to is still referred to within view s subviews property

2208963
jobs	cron
i don t want to break them out into separate scripts that i then have to schedule via cron jobs

2208963
jobs	cron
if i did that then i d have to remember to backup the scripts and if i rebuild a server i have to go and add back all the cron jobs it just seems a little bit messy for what i need

2208965
stdout	stderr
it may be output to stderr instead of stdout

2208984
google-chrome	firefox
however i tested your code here and it seems to work fine tested in firefox 3.5.3 google-chrome 4 ie8

2209008
versioning	upgrade
i was running versioning 3 the i was able to upgrade to versioning 4 and the problem went away

2209067

what you can do instead is to have the function get the current line put the time string at the appropriate place and set the current line again

2209072
maya	blender
in general what you ll want to do is use a modeling tool such as blender or maya to generate your models textures materials write out the data in some file format then write code or use existing libraries to read in your data and then display your data using opengl

post only becomes an issue when it is used in a situation for which some other method is ideally suited retrieval of information that should be a representation of some resource get complete replacement of a representation put

2209184
post	put	post	get	put	get
that means that we have to use the lowest common denominator technology - for a while we weren t able to use put because only get and post were supported across all the client technologies

2209511
worldwind	jogl
i can t believe nobody has mentioned this yet but the nasa worldwind project seems like exactly what you need you can extend it with jogl if needed or you can use some of the vast modeling objects already available to mark trajectory and location in 3d coordinates complete with zooming rotating and the like

2209514
cvs	svn
for that reason cvs created a tag to mark a root of branch for svn that should look like

2209520

put it together with a standard url decoder and you get errors

2209542
put	get
i get different errors when i try to put the field name in quotes or just leave it with a space as shown

2209569
bazaar	git
also consider using a distributed version control system mercurial bazaar git

2209603
int	double
there are several calculations involving dfreq so i didn t eliminate it entirely as it does save the cost of multiple run-time conversions from int to double

2209603
int	double
i would expect performance to increase because the int to double conversion would only occur when

2209631
jxtable	jtable
i will definitely suggest you to use jxtable for your tables instead of jtable

2209656
vraptor	spring
for java vraptor has a controller+view implementation similar to rails actionpack and uses a di container based on spring

2209748
int	chars
in the following code x represents a keyvaluepair and the aggregate is simply making a string of the chars int values

2209751
for-loop	loops
you aren t reinitializing the variable before the while loops starts like in the for-loop

2209799
svg	vml
solved - cufã³n is a font-replacement solution that relies completely on javascript and javascriptable languages svg and vml thus allowing the resulting element to be scripted like any other

2209805
wtl	atl
the ui architecture is currently implemented in wtl atl 3.0 and com

2209818
width	height
that is it should also be set as block elements or with set width height

2209827
ant	maven
just about every java project that i ve seen either uses maven or ant

2209827
ant	maven
sure you have to download make.exe if you use windows but ant and maven also don t come with the jdk

2209827
ant	maven
is it just because ant and maven are written in java

2209843
ant	maven
ant and later maven were designed to solve some headaches caused by make while creating new ones in the process it is just evolution

2209850
move	drag
when the user begins to drag the original item isn t actually move it s just hidden

2209859
ant	maven
ant and maven approach the build dependency graph and the management of it from a more modern view.

2209861
ant	maven
one of the major issues solved by maven and ivy-enabled ant setups over make is automated dependency resolution and downloading of your dependency jars

2209868
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to find this is use your browser s inspector google-chrome and safari has this built in firefox use firebug no comment on ie

2209927
ant	maven
ant and maven may be better suited to java than make or as hank gay points out they may not

2209927
ant	maven
however you asked if it matters that ant and maven are written in java

2209927
ant	maven
on rails we use rake c dudes use make and in java we use ant and maven

2209927
ant	maven
while it s true that the ant or maven developers will look after the java developer perhaps better than others there s also another question what do you write ant tasks in

2209932
ant	maven
that s why alternatives like ant and maven rose up

2209936
public	protected
well the first difference that comes to mind is that an abstract class can not be instantiated but a class with protected constructors could be instantiated throw another public method

2209950
maven	pom.xml
i want to add jpoller.jar as a maven dependency so i edited my pom.xml file to include it

2209950
maven	m2e
how can i do this from the m2e plugin on machines where the maven cli isn t available

2210127
put	get
this way they get to figure out what they want before i ve put a lot of time into the rest of the system

2210185
quicksort	mergesort
how can i implement a concurrent quicksort or mergesort algorithm for java

2210185
quicksort	mergesort
so we wrote our own i wrote it and we did indeed gain good speedups i wrote a multithreaded quicksort and due to its partitioning nature it parallelize very well but i could have written a mergesort too .

2210185
quicksort	mergesort
hence my question do you know of any correctly multithreaded quicksort or mergesort implementation in java that would be coming from a reputable source

2210195
children	parent
do icons of children have parent or do parent have children

2210195
children	parent
if you say parent have children you double up the children in the hierarchy because each of the children have to be under each of the parent

2210195
children	parent
it is often better particularly for what you are proposing to just assign attributes to each person for who their children are and who their parent are

2210206
post	put
if i can post another picture in the next post i will put the successful example

2210208
ant	maven
one big reason is that both ant and maven and most java targeted scm ci and ide tools are written in java by for java developers

2210208
ant	maven
this makes it simpler to integrate into your development environment and allows other tools such as the ide and ci servers to integrate portions of the ant maven libraries within the build deployment infrastructure

2210210
uiview	calayer
i don t think you can add a uiview subclass to a calayer object

2210269
lxml	beautifulsoup
use an html parser such as lxml or beautifulsoup to find all header elements

2210304
ant	maven
actually in your case i think that ant with maven ant tasks or ivy would be the best option

2210325

i m having problems finding the width and height of an image

2210455
sorting	filtering
i created a generic view which is imported as my_views.view which handles things like pagination sorting filtering etc.

noscript	meta
according to this page hl en the meta refresh should work inside the noscript element

2210573
administration	activation
i m writing an account module which should take care of everything about accounts registration login logout user administration password recovery account activation etc

2210592
children	parent
often i deal with aggregate or parent entities which have attributes derived from their constituent or children members

2210621
ssl	ntlm
don t forget that unlike in case of ntlm user s passwords will be transmitted in clear text unless you use ssl to publish the web site

2210633
width	height
you could create a pdf form which implicitly contains width and height constraints and is easy for typesetting

2210641
post	get
take a look a curl which is generally available in a linux unix environment and which lets you script a call to a web page including post parameters say a username and password and lets you manage the cookie store so that a subsequent call to get a different page within the site can use the same cookie so your login will persist across calls

2210645
rel	attr
alert #serving_size attr rel

2210645
rel	attr
we are now using jquery object ref and finding if that obj has attr rel

2210645
rel	attr
alert this attr rel

2210650
post	get
usually you will need to scrape the login page to get the hidden fields and then post to the login page

2210653
uninstall	upgrade
does an upgrade get counted as an uninstall followed by an install

2210667
jdom	dom4j
on the other hand - graphml is in xml format so you can easily use jdom or dom4j to create a dom add the nodes based on your data an serialize it to an xml file

2210673
hide	show
i would like to know how to programmatically hide a file but making the file or folder still hidden with show hidden files and folders enabled from the tools- folder options of explorer

2210685
folder	directory
if the desired header file doesn t exist in same folder that u create your project u should add header directory in project properties as you said

2210693
put	get
when i call put or get on the cache should i synchronize on the cache first

2210761
uiview	subviews

i think what a lot of people don t get is that your phone post back to the android market when you do an uninstall

2210795
google-chrome	firefox
check it out in firefox and google-chrome and ie8

2210832
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the not selector is only supported by modern browsers firefox safari and opera and not ie

2210840
post	get
it shows how to use the android libraries without external dependencies to perform basic get post etc

2210948
post	get
i m implementing a rest service endpoint in the app and want to be able to get and post to from the service endpoint using a shell script

2210948

i keep getting the login page back whenever i try a get or post

2210949
multiplying	add
and you don t multiplying by two you just add the two variables

2210985
ubuntu	debian
use ubuntu or debian

2210994
imagemagick	im4java
take a look at im4java a java abstraction around the commandline interfaces of various imagemagick like tools including gm that feels like a language binding

2211057
executable	upx
in some cases we are using upx --lzma on executable but these do not scale very well on terminal servers where the non-packed versions are reused across sessions

2211059
super	implements	super	abstract
if your child class forgets to initialise the final through the super constructor the compiler will give a warning an error just like when an abstract method is not implements

2211073
centos	linux
here is repo configuration i ve used to upgrade php on centos 5 look for enterprise linux 5 in the text

2211106
accessor	ivar
perhaps you meant to access the ivar directly but in that case you have created very confusing code by mixing accessor and direct ivar access and violated the cardinal rule by using direct ivar access outside an accessor

2211122
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

2211130
children	parent
the method that the source queries returns a simple graph of objects a collection of parent where each parent has a collection of children

2211130
children	parent
the result is that childrenlistbox shows all the children of the parent currently selected in parentlistbox when i change the selection the values in the childrenlistbox change

2211130
children	parent
what i want is for this second listbox to display all of the children of all of the parent all the time regardless of what is selected in parentlistbox

2211149
mouse	keyboard
and if you want to support switching between keyboard and mouse in mousedown attach blur handler that restores those to default you ll need and closure over event target

2211150
jar	manifest.mf
compile and put it in a jar file with javassist classes and the following manifest.mf

2211153
inherited	properties
but for #2 being able to return either one properties type or the other i would need an interface iproperty and have the residential and commercial classes inherited from it and then have the getproperty id and getproperties return an iproperty object or because they inherited from iproperty can i return them as is and not as the interface

2211187
google-chrome	safari
not sure why it doesn t work in safari google-chrome webkit but it could be because of this

2211207
inherited	properties
you are correct in thinking that you should create an abstract class to contain the common properties that s what inherited is for among other things

2211210
width	height
what you want is to multiply by the width height of your rows and cols like this

2211282
int	double
first no need to use double and floor call to compute int

2211301
rss	feed
set role-based permission settings for blog taxonomy aggregator and main site s rss feed

2211301
rss	feed
this module does not disable rss feed altogether rss feed created through the views module and others not listed here do not have associated permissions

2211301
rss	feed
rss permissions module lets you disable some or all rss feed based on different user roles

2211330
mouseup	mousedown
these two jquery statements will bind the mousedown and mouseup events to all of the elements within the page that have the text class

2211330
hide	show
then when mousedown happens it looks for the elements nested within that element with classes french and english and show hide them sets the css display property to display the language you want

2211386
128bit	64bit
it is a 128bit datatype as opposed to 64bit which is the size of a double

2211409
jobs	cron
you will still need to have something that kicks off rake jobs work but it is better than having lots of different cron jobs

2211465
realloc	calloc
i m struggling to use calloc and realloc for my array initializations

2211486
width	height
when running in the debugger the width and height properties of s are constantly zero and i can t change this no matter what

2211493
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
beware of sizes in malloc calloc and realloc

2211494
udp	tcp
the only option i ve seen for this would be to use luasocket and communicate via tcp or udp

2211516
coldbox	coldspring
if you work with coldspring modelglue mach-ii coldbox and other frameworks with xml configuration files cfeclipse s framework explorer is brilliant

2211596

for example i have a rectangle height 10 width 20

2211612
post	get
if anyone knows why the contenttype causes ajax post to fail in jquery i d love to get a deeper understanding

2211622
int	double
if you store the number 3600.2 in an object of type double some digits are used to represent the int part - 3600 and there is less digits representing fractions part

2211636
profiling	debugging
but not because the compiler optimizes it - rather because the code is easy to write debugging get correct parallelize profiling and decide which are the most important bottlenecks to spend time on possibly rewriting them mutably

2211693
rss	feed
what is the xpath expression to select elements with or rss and atom feed

2211693

2211711
google-chrome	firefox
my question is how does firefox handle scope in this regard differently to ie and google-chrome

2211714
verilog	vhdl	rtl	verilog	rtl	vhdl
it then synthesizes that c++ into rtl vhdl or verilog

2211714
verilog	vhdl	altera	xilinx
for hobbyists you re probably best off sticking with vhdl or verilog to describe your design and then using the free tools from xilinx or altera to synthesize that code and program the fpga

2211754
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in ie google-chrome but firefox shows me an exception at line 451 in recaptcha

2211780
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
for example while it make sense for a calculator service to expose add subtract multiplying and divide operations i would use another service to expose a getquote operation

2211815
int	chars
this whole thing has a chance of being legal for one and only one reason the 2d int array object is reinterpreted as an array of chars objects

2211820
realloc	malloc
realloc null size is equivalent to malloc size so you should replace your realloc with malloc

2211820
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you don t need to cast the return value from malloc calloc and realloc

2211820
strtol	atoi
atoi does no error checking if you have learned about strtol you should use that

2211829
post	get
i get this by simply adding the following line to any model and making a post to the corresponding action method

2211829
accessor	properties
targetinvocationexception properties accessor foo on object rolling_razor_mvc.models.contactusmodel threw the following exception bar

2211843
implements	extends
if you re invoking methods on an abstract class there must be a concrete class somewhere that extends abstractclass and implements the abstract methods

2211860
boost	stl
i am familiar with using info and man commands in emacs however boost and default stl do not come with man or info pages instead they come as html documentation

but with both ironpython and ironruby we ll fill in certain magical parameters

2211861
ironruby	ironpython
for ironpython it s codecontext and for ironruby i believe it s rubycontext

sdl	soil
i ve created a test case in c99 that uses sdl glee and soil

2211937
submit	submission
in addition after submission the question if i hit refresh it also doesn t call another form submit

2211939
debian	linux
works on at least debian linux windows solaris

2211955
rss	feed
does anyone know how i can parse an rss feed but using dashcode

2211977
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	trac	mantis
i like trac because i have already got apache serving python redmine for the features and mantis because i feel it s the most lightweight of the three however lacking in the feature department compared with the other two so what do you recommend given the situation

2211988
rss	feed
you should be able to parse an rss feed using javascript which you can write using dashcode

2211988
rss	feed
here is a stack overflow article discussing the use of jquery a javascript library to easily parse an rss feed

2211998
int	boolean
assume each field is four bytes almost certain for the reference and int and plausible for the boolean add an extra four bytes for the object header and

2212006
min	max
if so what are the min and max integer

2212025
put	get
bytebuffer works well for this just put in 64 long values and get a out using the array method

2212043
super	self
note that the above is also the reason why you should always assign the result of calling super s designated initializer to self

2212044
getter	setter
this would be like having direct access to your instance variables in a class bypassing getter setter breaking encapsulation

2212066
maven	m2e
how can i do this from the m2e plugin on machines where the maven cli isn t available

2212147
disk	ram
as long as you never have more threads using cpu time than you have cores you will have optimal performance but then as soon as you have to wait for i o there will be unused cpu cycles so you may want to profile you applications and see wait portion of the time it spends maxing out the cpu and what portion waiting for ram hard disk network and other io in general if you are waiting for i o you could have 1 more thread provided that you are primarily cpu bound

2212162
post	get
btw- i see you re using a post but for retrieval of data no updating or deleting the convention is get

2212229
alloca	longjmp
what i m currently doing is using alloca to push the stack pointer ahead by 768 kilobytes then spawning uiapplicationmain then using setjmp longjmp to bounce back and forth between my ui routine and my main routine

2212250
textinput	textfield
i set the focus to auotocompletelist at the time of adding this list as child but at the time of remove this popup i am getting whole text in textinput as selected with black background iwant to set the focus to this textfield but not to select whole typed text

2212275
modulation	pitch
i m attempting to add my own continuous pitch modulation vibrato to my openal object by assigning the sound s pitch to the path of a sine wave

2212275
getter	setter
this is my callback method which is repeating every 1 30 of a second as well as the getter and setter for the pitch

2212275
modulation	pitch
doing so would allow me to continue to control the base pitch using a uislider for example while the modulation effect can optionally and accuratelyoccur without affecting the base pitch

2212275
modulation	pitch
is there a way to compensate for the modulation to take place inside the method so that the effect can occur on a moving or movable base pitch

2212281
int	double
void initialize2d double m int m_dimension

2212281
int	double
where it comes to contradiction because you declared the variable m_dimension as an int and then you using it as a double

2212321
folder	dir
i know there s this installer available for windows but i think one needs to extract a tar file and replace the existing files in the ruby folder in the instantrails dir and some fine-tunings for it to work

2212348
int	double
in main file include macro header file twice one time with type defined to int next time with type defined as double

2212351
width	height
such as user can t upload a image which is larger than the allowed width height

2212355
webclient	httpwebrequest
right now i use either httpwebrequest or webclient to download files

2212356
domxpath	domdocument
its also posible with domdocument and domxpath

2212366
postgresql	mysql
now what is really happening is pdo is asking the database driver mysql postgresql ms sql oracle etc to prepare the statement but if the database driver cannot prepare it pdo will simulate that feature

2212430
gridview	sqldatasource
i d like all of my gridview to populate with data from my sqldatasource and all of my event handling code button clicks etc to continue to work

2212465
trie	tree
anyway the problem is every node is supposed to store a list of nodes so i can make my n-ary tree trie but i ve hit a snag.

2212532
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it worked for all browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome opera

2212532
opera	firefox
only worked for ie firefox and opera

2212532
google-chrome	safari
did not work for safari and google-chrome

2212532
google-chrome	safari
but it wasn t for safari and google-chrome

2212544
disk	ram
if the profiler overheads really are significant then you probably can t squeeze much more speed out of your code and should be thinking about looking at your hardware bottlenecks disk ram or cpu

2212544
disk	ram
so you might need more ram faster disk for virtual memory and bigger cpu caches

2212596
mvp	presenter
for winforms you can implement your own mvp model view presenter or mvc model view controller patterns

2212660
post	get
post belongsto users when you retrieve a post you will also get data about user to whom this post belongs to posts.user_id users.id

2212661
g++	gcc
some have asked about platform i m using gcc g++ on macosx

2212670
hash	md5
all of my application is written in php bar 1 script which happens to create a md5 hash which is used later via php scripts

2212675
children	parent
adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node

2212780
std	ostream
std endl is a function taking and returning a reference to std ostream

2212823
mouse	keyboard
i d like to shutdown application when there hasn t been any input keyboard mouse from user for certain period of time

2212826
toolbar	tabs
another is to hide the tabs altogether notebook.set_show_tabs false and make a toolbar with buttons above the widget with your buttons on the left plus one button for each tab in the notebook that switches to that page

2212844
yacc	bison
looks like matz of ruby fame wrote a yacc bison mode

2212854
mouse	keyboard
to track a user s idle time you could hook keyboard and mouse activity

2212854
mouse	keyboard
getlastinputinfo retrieves the time in milliseconds of the last input event when the last detected user activity has been received be it from keyboard or mouse

2212858
post	put
here are the post and put requests

2212861
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
anyways my question is how do i keep the empty div s width at 32 in firefox at least and preferably safari opera and google-chrome

2212864
prepare	execute
as a side benefit using placeholders is also more efficient if you re-use your sql statement it only needs to be prepare once and no less efficient if you don t if you don t call prepare explicitly it still gets called implicitly before the query is execute

2212905
width	height
it s not the width that is the problem it s the height

2212913
ant	maven
i do not use maven ant or something like this.

2212920
portrait	landscape
i need to enter the data into that text fields in both portrait and landscape mode

2212920
portrait	landscape
i have done in portrait mode with help of willshowkeyboard notification and working fine.but same thing i have applied to landscape mode but it doesn t working fine

2212926
cout	cin
cin and cout are not guaranteed to use basic_filebuf far as i can tell. then just add virtual overflow and sync

2212944
width	height
or simply use the minimum width and minimum height options on the node

2212950
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my app in order to understand how autoreleased objects behave i have looped 10000 times this method in the - void applicationdidfinishlaunching uiapplication application function and also 10000 times the same method in - void tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller tabbarcontroller didselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

2212957
jar	manifest.mf
the recommended solution is to use the class-path line in the manifest.mf file inside your jar to point to required libraries relative paths are allowed and then deploy all files together and invoking it with java -jar your.jar

2213024
width	height
as said earlier we can use sizewithfont to calculate the height but it needs to know which font is used for what width etc

2213024
portrait	landscape
or what happends if we swap from portrait to landscape we have much more space yet it won t be used since we hardcoded 300.0

2213065
gridview	rowdatabound
my first linq query does successfully execute and display in a gridview but when i try to use a rowdatabound event to work with the results and refine them a bit i get the error

2213065
put	get
this interesting part is if i just try to put in a anywhere else in the same file i get the same error too

2213073
rtp	rtsp
it offers streaming support over the rtp and rtsp protocol rfc 2326 real time streaming protocol

2213075
pop-up	dialog
for any of the other 100+ java files in my workspace eclipse pop-up a dialog complaining editor does not contain a main type

2213083
children	parent
instead of consuming all the resource that it requires to maintain event handlers for those 100 children you could just assign 1 click event to the parent then use event.target to determine which one was actually clicked

2213083
children	parent
another nice thing about this approach is that you don t have to use live when dynamically adding additional children to that parent

2213100
put	get
if you have questions specific to media-players you should put that in a separate question this will improve your chances to get a more specific answer

2213125
folder	directory
or you could export your plug-in into a directory and then copy the directory into the dropins folder

2213127
width	height
the overprint environment only automatically determines the height of the content not the width

2213164
hide	show	mouseleave	mouseenter
don t you want to do show on mouseenter and hide on mouseleave

2213165
mouseleave	mouseenter
pass true to toggle in the mouseenter routine and false in mouseleave

2213165
hide	show
or do as suggested by the other answer and just use show and hide

2213207
addition	multiplication
you don t have to store zero values outside the bandwidth in that case but your operations like addition and multiplication become more complex to code

2213212
mouse	keyboard
use java.awt.robot an example here on the server side to simulate mouse keyboard events and invoke them from client side

2213234
implements	extends
he is being asked to implements some methods for a class that extends another class

2213251
width	height
you can also get the height and width of the jpeg from the image class and display it in its original dimensions

2213305
width	height
regarding the cell height you can check your tableview s width and if necessary subtract the margins by uitableviewstylegrouped and the width an eventual index bar and disclosure item which you look for in the data storage for your cells data

2213319
boost	log4cpp
the project contains dylibs for curl boost and log4cpp

2213322
fgets	feof
as you are checking in a do-while loop so the condition feof fp is never reached as you exit on checking the return value of fgets

2213337
ubuntu	debian
this looks close and i ve gotten the same type of setup to work on ubuntu 8.04 with ruby 1.8.6. since this is on debian it should be the similar

2213376
keydown	keyup
now i need to find the cursor position when there is a keyup keydown click event in the div

2213390
codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	yii	kohana	yii
however if you want a php5 only framework as in written to take full advantage of php5 then i d suggest looking at kohana a php5 only fork of codeigniter yii or zend framework

2213425
kerberos	ntlm
i have configured the service correctly and ie will send a kerberos token starting yi.. but after adding the hostname to the network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris and network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris settings in about config firefox only sends an ntlm token

2213441
int	boolean
my code is simple c and sdl+gl the only complex data are basic media files png+wav+xm and the game data is mostly strings int boolean for flags and such and static-sized arrays

2213444
google-chrome	firefox
to remove the text and leave the image google-chrome and firefox works fine with this

2213444
google-chrome	firefox
finally in google-chrome the entire image is the link in ie and firefox only the text is the link so with no text the menu has no function

2213485
put	get
what i thought id do is get the file from the server put on my local machine edit the content upload to where ever an then delete the temp file

2213487
createelement	each
it almost seems a bit counter-intuitive but with most browsers building up a big string and then setting the innerhtml property of a container is usually faster than using the dom createelement function over and over to create each row and cell

2213490
int	chars
whenever you read multi-byte values like utf-16 chars or 32 bit int from a file since that file might have originated on a system with different endianness

2213515
x86	64bit
and don t forget to set your project s platform target to x86 or it will bomb on 64bit operating systems

2213568
vim	notepad++
editors vim notepad++

2213571
libjpeg	libpng
as adam suggests i would also recommend to use libpng and libjpeg

2213574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is already implemented in nightly builds of firefox google-chrome and safari on leopard and snow leopard

2213611
awt	swing
i know swing will automatically repaint as more of the image is read i m not sure how the awt canvas works

2213681
firefox	safari
the jpeg images that imageio generated view correctly on windows file explorer as well as safari webbrowser but in firefox the resampled images are clipped

2213714
allocator	stl
a nice example is the less used allocator parameter of the stl containers it tells the algorithm how to allocate memory

2213745
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
and the comparison of value seems to be case-sensitive there may be a way to make it case-insensitive but that i don t know

2213783
for-loop	loops
the problem is on the 3rd point when the execution moves back to the for-loop i need to block loops from continuing until the callback get called

2213804
free	malloc
pages are a lower-level concept than what malloc handles-- as a result the specifics of malloc free are all simply washed away as the whole thing gets cleaned up

2213820
nsmutablestring	nsstring
because nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring

2213821
folder	directory
and as driss says in the comments having a folder called resources in your project gives the iphone simulator a heartattack and crashes it from the looks of things without even copying your app bundle to the simulator directory

2213830
many-to-many	many-to-one
you should also know how to construct a many-to-one relationship using foreign keys and a many-to-many relationship using join tables

2213840
postgresql	mysql
the above concepts do not vary much between mysql sql server oracle postgresql and other relational database systems

2213864
hash	salt
the only thing that can be work is if we mention that the passwords are just hash without adding any kind of salt to prevent the replay attacks if it is so you must know the salt by the way get an dictionary attack tool the files of many words numbers etc

2213879
getter	setter
in other words the property has a setter but no getter it s write-only

2213900
getter	setter
see why getter and setter methods are evil for an interesting discussion of this

2213900
getter	setter
i typically do use setter but rarely use getter

2213961
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari a character is inserted but the cursor won t move to the right of it

2213961
google-chrome	firefox
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

2213987
mouseevent	mouseenter	mouseevent	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
strange enough for mouseevent like mouseenter or mouseleave handlers of both parent and child work

2214018
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
pip can install from subversion svn git mercurial and bazaar repositories

2214049
cdr	cons
usually the head iseq will be of type cons which stores a constant value in its first or car slot and another iseq in its rest or cdr slot

2214067
memcached	apc
you might want to look at apc or memcached to cache the results instead as it is not a per-user cache and it uses the memory instead of files

2214087
memcached	apc
however if you re attempting to cache a query that is the same for a larger number of users you might want to use something like apc or memcached that isn t tied to the individual user

2214089
filesystems	fat
it s not the filesystems which is almost universally fat or fat32 for these kinds of devices or even limitations in the windows driver although the limits are probably enforced there to avoid confusing the device but limited number of file descriptors in the device s embedded file access code

2214122
wicket	stripes
some recurrent names spring mvc stripes wicket

2214129
bluetooth	usb
if a usb device provider want to expose the device to a standard way most of them do conform to standards to save costs on develop document and educate clients about their apis their driver programmers can write drivers that make the device available to various windows apis massive storage wia directshow virtual serial port bluetooth human interface device etc

2214196
realloc	malloc
then the next time you call setname you end up calling realloc with a pointer that you didn t get from malloc

2214201
public	protected
alice removes the public key padlock with her key meaning the package is now protected only by the private key

2214275
hash	md5
the openssl library allows you to add blocks of data to a ongoing hash sha1 md5 then when you have finished adding all the data you call the final method and it will output the final hash

2214275
hash	md5
you don t calculate md5 on each individual block then add it rather you add the data to the ongoing hash method from the openssl library

2214275
hash	md5
this will then give you an md5 hash of all the individual data blocks with no limit on the input data size

2214300
hash	md5
with that in mind you don t want to combine two md5 hash

2214304
hash	md5
its worth noting that if for some reason you do want md5 hash of subsections of the file as you go along this is sometimes useful for doing interim checks on a large file being transferred over a low bandwidth connection then you can get them by cloning the digest object at any time like so

2214304
hash	md5
this does not affect the actual digest object so you can continue to work with the overall md5 hash

2214304
hash	md5
its also worth noting that md5 is an outdated hash for cryptographic purposes such as verifying file authenticity from an untrusted source and should be replaced with something better in most circumstances such as sha-1

2214345
hash-collision	key
also as sellibitze says an operator is needed to compare key in case of hash-collision

2214371
folder	directory
i have created the uiwebview but want to know the best way of capturing the files when they are linked to in the webview and then download them to a specified folder in the documents directory

2214408
prepare	execute
now i know when a query using a prepare statement is execute twice in a single php script it s faster because the query is only parsed once once for each query

2214435
calloc	malloc
we can also use a variation of the malloc function called calloc

2214441
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning on bundler

2214465
pop-up	dialog
with the normal msvc debugger it just pop-up a dialog and exits with no chance to do anything or look at anything

2214470
nsstring	nsxmlparser
void parser nsxmlparser parser foundcharacters nsstring string

2214502
folder	directory
just delete all of the .svn files folder from the project directory structure

2214529
prepare	execute
each php process thread visitor that execute that same script again will not prevent mysql from re-parsing the query to prepare the statement as its valid in a per connection basis so its very effective for queries repeated in the same script

2214529
prepare	execute
now i cant argue about prepare + execute vs simple query performance wise w o repeated queries

2214577
int	double
rectangle2d is an abstract class that doesn t care if you re using int double or float coordinates

2214589
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i ve setting in httpd.conf to restrict access to .htaccess files for all sites and it s working for most of the sites

2214621
writetofile	nsdata
you can later decide what to do with nsdata you can save it to file on the documents folder using the nsdata writetofile method

2214649
packets	multicast
you need some centralized place to send the packets back out via a multicast or else you need a decentralized approach where every client is connected to every other client and each client is hosting a multicast

2214685
realloc	malloc
edit ok with the valgrind errors we can see that a you re passing something dodgy to printf if you compile with -g you ll get the exact line number and also you re calling realloc but not on a pointer you got back from malloc

2214767
children	parent
but something to consider is that in hierarchical data structures like the uiview hierarchy it s generally good practice for children to not know too many of the details of their parent where possible

2214790
super	implements
i m guessing since firstviewcontroller is one of the standard example classes created when starting a new tab bar based application in xcode that you haven t changed its super class or implements the methods of uitabeviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource

2214809
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs is a mac-friendly version of emacs

2214809
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs has the option to rebind option command and meta in various stages between native mac keybindings and native emacs bindings

2214823
children	parent
after importing data from a spreadsheet into children i need to get a list of parent having no children and for this i m using.

2214823
children	parent
but because referential integrity is not enforced i also need a list of children having no parent and for this i m trying.

2214824
backslash	double-quotes
enclosing it in double-quotes and added a backslash at the end

2214825
accessor	properties
so the events i attached to the properties in my ex classes never fired because the set accessor was never invoked

2214833
pull	push
only the most basic mercurial commands are subrepo-aware clone push pull update commit and perhaps a couple of others

2214851
comparator	comparable
i think the easy solution is to implement your own class for storing a node and make it comparable by implementing the comparator interface

2214863
integer	unsigned
you can t specify bits and raw bytes as tokens well maybe you could but i wouldn t know how and you can t coax them into read two bytes make them into an unsigned 16bit integer call it n and then read n bytes.

2214877
command-pattern	memento
the memento pattern would be used in conjunction with command-pattern it is not a replacement to the usage of command-pattern

2214923
serializable	deserialization
frequently the transmission web service or whatever code you re using will have its own handler for this data for example objectiveresource adds a serializable and deserialization handler that works as an extension to nsobject that enables it to do a lot of this stuff transparently and you might look into that code particularly the objectivesupport part if you re trying to do this more generically

2214980
superclass	subclassing
when you subclassing nsobject and add some instance variables you are for all intents and purposes simply creating a new c structure that contains your instance variables as slots in that structure concatenated on the slots for the instance variables for all superclass

2214980
superclass	subclassing
the modern runtime works slightly differently so that a superclass can have ivars appended without requiring all subclassing to be recompiled

2214983
google-chrome	firefox
this this was working for google-chrome but not firefox

2214983
google-chrome	firefox
this was working for firefox but not google-chrome

2214991
post	get
this makes it possible to always render some action as get no matter whether containing page is a post call

2215012
g++	gcc
when you get cygwin install the c++ compiler build tools gcc g++ make autotools etc

2215017
post	get
i ve tried a number of different things including what was outlined in this post how to repeatedly merge branches in mercurial but i just can t get it working

2215021
int	chars
if you compare two strings that each only have one chars then its a simple byte-wise and operation which may be faster than comparing a 4 byte int value

2215024
rss	feed
i know that it was previously possible to display your most recent facebook statuses on your website as an rss feed but it seems they ve changed their setup and i can t figure out where to find the feed anymore..

2215028
onkeyup	onkeydown
but for some reason onkeyup and onkeydown are not getting called

2215060
pthreads	fork
learn several technologies like plain old fork forget or manual multithreading java threads or pthreads mpi openmp bsp maybe even cuda or opencl

2215064
cvs	svn
svn cvs

2215085
easyhook	detours
also consider looking at detours commercial and easyhook free

2215091
haskell	ocaml
so while r is undoubtedly the best language for statistical computing i see some value in being familiar with another language like ocaml haskell or possibly clojure incanter

2215092
public	protected
so basically defining a field is as simple as typing in the access public private protected giving it a type string int string object and giving it a name

2215096
pascal	delphi
part of its inheritance stems from pascal and brings one of the features that delphi users have always loved in their compilation environment incredible compile speeds

2215169
google-perftools	tcmalloc
consider using of tcmalloc form google-perftools

2215174
x86	64bit
the x86 libraries are for 32-bit applications and the x64 libraries are for 64bit applications

2215175
x86	64bit
well the simple answer is that the x86 libraries are for 32 bit operating systems and the x64 libraries are for 64bit operating systems

2215207
put	get
you can put all of the possible numbers into an array and get a random index for that array

2215223
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
now we want to construct addition subtraction multiplication and division for this new numeric type

2215238
bazaar	svn
i ve started to use svn but then discovered bazaar

2215259
free	malloc
will any malloc implementation return free memory back to the system

2215259
free	malloc
if i have an application whose memory consumption can be very different in daytime and nighttime can i force any of malloc s to return free memory to the system

2215260
firefox	safari
i ve tried running on both firefox and safari in development mode and get the same result on both

2215273
superclass	subclassing
i got this question for homework and all i can think of is to return a subclassing of an abstract superclass

puts	gets
here is the code that gets the values from the jscript object and puts them in divs

2215320
versioning	upgrade
change gem versioning upgrade requirements run tests fix issues and commit

2215320
versioning	upgrade
i guess it would take at least one month before having the major part of my rails app ready for rails 3 thought i won t probably start the upgrade until rails 3 stable is out or i really need the new versioning for some blocking feature ex

2215334
width	height
i would venture to say your issue is in how you are assigning the new values of x y width and height to your rectangle object

2215344
int	chars
packed data types like float or decimal will not work those would require conversion to something suitable first such as int bigint or chars

2215348
subtraction	addition	subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo
in python though you will always get a positive number which is often more useful because it means you can do modulo addition and subtraction

2215382
pentaho	olap
not sure but what you re describing looks like an olap cube so maybe consider using a star schema or a snowflake schema and have a look at something like pentaho

2215505
expression-blend	silverlight
i currently have a silverlight app designed mainly in expression-blend using a border with a drop shadow effect encircling a rounded rectangle control

2215517
superclass	subclassing
that return a subclassing of a superclass as you mentioned java.util.calendar.getinstance

2215533
min	max	datediff	difference
following on from mark byers comment in tsql something like the following query would give you the difference between the min and max timestamps in milliseconds varying the first parameter of datediff would allow you to change the unit the total amount time is reported in

2215630
pull	push
you the app_start pull the values from the config file and push them to the specific part of the system not have it pull the config values itself

2215655
inherited	subclassing
if you are inheriting from a real view customview is a subclassing of textview you should inherited all the right functionality for laying things out

2215673
implements	extends
you can create it by extends the thread class or by implements the runnable interface

2215721
postgresql	mysql
ideally i would be able to keep the webapp code and swap out the db classes for something that would talk to another database mysql or postgresql is probably preferable to something like couchdb or mongodb but those could work too

2215732
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work correctly lines up on one line in firefox and ie but on google-chrome and safari it wraps to a second line at about 710px and i can t find a reason

2215732
google-chrome	safari
wrong google-chrome safari

2215772
put	get
they get to put their seniors into the crosshairs

2215788
width	height
that demo was using an x and y offset that was defined in onsizechanged based on the height and width of the view

2215788
width	height
for a reason that doesn t make sense to me now i assumed that the width and height of the view would be limited based on the content that was being written in ondraw b c of setting the layout width and height to wrapcontent

2215788
width	height
however the width and height that was being passed in to onsizechanged was the dimensions of the entire screen

2215830
onclick	onsubmit
i don t want to rely on the user leaving the items selected so do i have to pre-select them using the onsubmit of the form or the onclick of the button

2215831
uiview	subviews
to get the effect you want you might try making your newsview a plain uiview then add the uiwebview as a subviews

2215853
wadl	wsdl
so wadl can be seen as a rest equivalent of wsdl 1.1

2215853
wadl	wsdl
wsdl 2.0 can be used to describe rest web services and thus competes with wadl

2215853
wadl	wsdl
so while wsdl 2.0 competes with wadl as rest web service description languages wdl 2.0 has more but lets forget that for now xrd is a metadata discovery format for any uri openid discovery being one of the primary use case

2215900
awt	swing
as i ve read webbrowser is an awt component while glasspane is a swing component

2215947
chown	chmod
you could change the user ownership of that folder chown and chmod it so that multiple users can access it

2215962
post	get
and the get and post actions look like this

2216012
portrait	landscape
is that how the landscape portrait transition works switching between two different images

2216018
int	boolean
in this case it will convert the int to boolean any int greater tan 0 will be true so if option has an int greater tan zero its equivalent to a true boolean value

2216104
superclass	subclassing
use super to call superclass s __init__ method then continue initialising the subclassing

2216245
getter	setter
most examples are something along the lines of write a fraction class that has getter setter and a print function which isn t very challenging coming from a c++ background

2216266
stdout	stderr
i don t want to print to stderr i want to print to stdout

2216276
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
visual studio only runs on windows so you would need virtualisation software vmware fusion or parallels or bootcamp

2216282
onresume	onpause
to return back to your application when the user hits the back button you might need to utilize onpause and onresume but i am not sure

2216287
post	get
if you don t want to move your object that is in your index.php have your ajax make a request to index.php but add some extra parameters post get that let your index.php know to process it as an ajax request and not return your normal web page html output

2216303
put	get
also you ll get transitions between different things if you put each part in its own activity

2216334
vbscript	jscript
i want to control the volume of my windows system from a jscript or vbscript script

2216341
uiview	uiwindow
i can place a uiactivityindicatorview on a uiwindow or a uiview by using interface builder like as follows

2216360
uiview	subviews
make the uitableview and the uiactivityindicatorview both subviews of a parent uiview

2216392
freebsd	opensolaris	freebsd	linux
five operating systems linux opensolaris freebsd windows mac os x

2216433
prepare	execute
assuming your code runs in a loop you can prepare the statement handler sth once outside the loop and run execute several times which should save some time if you have many inserts to do

2216470
min	max
the idea is to overide the onstatechanged event of the window cancel the min max constraints and refresh it

2216470
min	max
if the window is not maximized we simply apply back the min max constraints

2216517
stdout	stderr
this is a way of redirecting stdout and stderr away from the shell using the logging module

2216538
mouseover	mousemove
i think you should switch from mouseover to mousemove because it s a bit of a smoother effect

2216564
yacc	bison
it is also used by other programs such as bison yacc to tell you that the problem if there s a compile problem is related to your rules-file at a specific line which the compiler would otherwise be unable to do as the bison yacc generates c-files

2216613
width	height
but first time click change it to width height 100

2216613
width	height
but the second time click on the same button change them back to the width height 50

2216613
width	height
the third time change to width height 100 and so on

2216619
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine in internet explorer but not in firefox or google-chrome

2216640
mouseup	mousedown
if you want to track mouse in the whole view i think is will be easier to implement the mousedown mousemoved and mouseup methods in order to get the mouse events

2216688
getter	setter
additionally the getter and setter of attributes are often assumed from the model which may very well have been declared in an xml file somewhere rather than in code

2216725
strstr	substr
you can use strstr to get the substr starting with and remove the with substr

2216748
getter	setter
the compiler translates it to the appropriate setter getter method call

2216748
accessor	properties
other languages do of course use methods for properties accessor too however they hide this fact more consistently than objective-c

2216769
haskell	ocaml
also i wouldn t pretend this has anything to do with pattern matching in the haskell ocaml style

2216779
rss	feed
you could set up a cron job that checks the rss feed every x minutes and creates a tweet if it finds new items

2216788
implements	extends
- extends surfaceview and implements surfaceholder.callback

2216824
gif	png
then in the css you set the div s background-iamge to the png you want to use followed by a conditional comment to feed ie6 a transparent gif instead

2216929
put	get
i see there are some listing for http get put code but can t find any good parsers as well

2216952
getter	setter
in your templated implementations of the getter setter methods you d simply access m_array

2216987
mouseover	mouseout
change mouseover mouseout by

2216987
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter mouseleave

2217026
hide	show
you can set all these with a stylesheet then just use jquery to show hide the div

2217081
put	get
will it get laggy if i fetch 1 million link elements and put it in the dom

2217263
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the following shows the behaviour both google-chrome and ie are consistent i haven t checked opera in saying that domconfig is not a property of window but firefox claims it is but can t retrieve it copy paste into url field since i can t get markdown to give a link

2217281
accessor	ivar
you seem to be moving between accessor and direct ivar access which is very confusing and error-prone

2217281
touchesmoved	touchesended
that means if you get touchesended again before you get another touchesmoved you ll double-release the layer

2217285
apache	nginx
if you have a production machine set up i would recommend you to use phusion passenger with apache or nginx and set up different virtual machines or ports

2217289
int	double
if the key is the double type i cannot initialize it at all and even if i can theoretically assign an int to every possible input i have several tens of thousands possible inputs and i only actually use a handful

2217326
getter	setter
some methods called accessors we write very frequently these are methods of the form - int variable called getter and - void setvariable int newvalue called setter

2217331
getter	setter
the code will assume your abean follows the javabeans convention that is a property is defined by its getter and setter

2217331
getter	setter
the getter and setter respectively are of the form and

2217331
getter	setter
note the name of the property begins with a capital letter in the getter and setter methods while the bean property s name begins with a lower case letter

2217338
ssl	https
this uses ssl https for transport-layer security which handles the encryption aspect and passes a username password in the soap header which handles the authentication side

2217404
mvp	presenter
in the mvp case the standard is the presenter talks back to the view either through an interface databinding or through properties in the case of passive view

2217404
getter	setter
with passive view the properties are not using databinding instead the view property getter and setter are used to directly set the control value

2217404
post	get
the whole idea about this post is to get the same understanding of mvvm pattern in community

2217409
appendto	createelement
first i tried using createelement and chaining alot of those together with appendto and the like

2217418
post	get
should allow anyone to register using post but only registered members should be able to get a list of all users

2217459
free	malloc
it simply wraps malloc and free

2217477
allocator	stl
you will need to include and pass in an object as the stl object s allocator template parameter

2217480
mockups	balsamiq
that could look something like this used the web version of balsamiq mockups - what a fantastic invention

2217515
nsstring	nsdata
from there it is a matter of converting the nsstring to an nsdata and writing it

2217609
switching	screens
use levels of detail as much as you can -- low medium high versions of 3d models and switching based on distance from camera player - no point rendering a high-res version if it s only 5 pixels on screens

2217646
put	get
i am able to get all of the spacing to work by setting a topmargin but this doesn t allow me to put the username header in

2217684
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
but while some jms providers do offer such features mq weblogic jboss this is not a standard thing afaik for example glassfish openmq doesn t offer this

2217692
fgets	feof
however i have got into a conversation with someone who is saying that i am not understanding how fgets and feof work together and he s mentioning chunked encoding as a more efficient method

2217733
disk	ram
to minimize disk io and hence maximize performance i want to allocate memory to mysql so that the entire dataset including indexes can be kept in ram assume that the machine has ram in abundance

2217842
unsigned	short
unsigned short is 2 bytes

2217852
singleton	facade
if your set of c library routines is not too large you can try combining the singleton and facade patterns so that c library routines are only invoked via the facade

2217852
singleton	facade
singleton insures that there is only one instance of the facade

2217865
width	height
this is obviously a bit verbose and could be optimised a little with additional css classes allowing you to reuse the width height properties

2217894
int	double
b if compiler doesnâ t complain about implicit narrowing conversion from int literal to type byte then why doesnâ t it also allow an implicit narrowing conversion from double literal to type float i realize we could avoid this error by specifying float literal using f f suffix

2217957
hide	show
the jquery to make the submenus hide and show

2217982
implements	extends
i have written a jsp custom tag implements in a class that extends tagsupport and i d like to invoke another custom tag that was written as a .tag file

2218075
folder	directory
is there a way to set it up to ignore the contents on these folder but to still have them under git control so they appear when i clone the repo into the hoted directory

2218084
unsigned	short
unsigned short may or may not be 2 bytes

2218084
unsigned	short
if unsigned short is 2 bytes long you have space worth of len 2 unsigned short values

2218084
unsigned	short
or more generally you have space for len n unsigned short values where n is equal to sizeof unsigned short

2218084
unsigned	short
if however you want to combine sizeof unsigned short values into one unsigned short value then your best bet would be to calculate the numbers by hand

2218133
pull	push
if i push those changes to a remote repository and now wish to pull changes down onto another development system that has the original setup still what s the best way to do so

2218156
cout	cin
e.g to use cin cout defined in iostream

2218177
getter	setter
is there a way by which i can get a single test method for both the getter setter like testemployeeid testname so that in these methods i can test both my setter getter rather than using 2 diff

2218183
keyup	mouseup
in windows forms you can create an event handler for the keyup and mouseup events but there is no selectionchanged event

2218190
getter	setter
getter and setter are almost always trivial code which is not worth testing by themselves

2218190
getter	setter
- so why do you actually need to write tests for all those getter and setter in the first place

2218207
getter	setter
and although i agree with the other poster than getter setter are pretty trivial - i think it is still worth testing them - to eliminate typos test property change listeners etc

2218221
google-chrome	firefox
this is using firefox and google-chrome browsers

2218223
getter	setter
if you have 100 fields in a class with corresponding setter getter i suspect your object model is not decomposed correctly

2218236
int	double
in your example treemap the key of the treemap has type double and the value referenced by this key has the type int

2218281
post	put
and then inside the post template aw_blog post.phtml put the following where you want the bookmark-things to appear

2218296
children	parent
also i should mention that all the elements i m working with are on the same dom tree level so there is no need to worry about parent children

2218340
boost	stl
is this a reasonable design or could one do it more succinctly maybe using stl or boost stuff

2218360
stdout	stderr
the shell when it forks and then exec s these programs probably uses the dup2 system call to redirect stdin stdout and stderr to the appropriate pipes

2218360
stdout	stderr
this should cause inetd to fork dup the socket onto stdin stdout and stderr and then exec grep with foo as an argument

2218406
accessor	properties
try using an object and iterating via properties accessor for object in my objects and then use object.prop1 object.prop2 instead

2218441
width	height
your code will work if show_img has a width and height set

2218441
width	height
so at that point in time show_img has not been loaded yet so it can not get the width and height unless you explicitly set it

2218443
width	height
the images are probably not loaded when you try to take the width and height so you must bind a function to the load event of the document which will ensure that all images are loaded before executing

2218446
typedef	struct
a typedef is a type definition you re saying this name now refers to this type the name you give must be an identifier as defined by the language standard the type has to be a type specifier an already named type either base type or typedef d a struct union class or enum specifier with possible type qualifiers const or volatile

2218503
strcpy	strncpy
then you can use the standard c library function strcpy or better yet strncpy to copy the hello into it and then you want to concatenate using the standard c library strcat or better yet strncat function

2218560
udp	tcp
i would strongly suggest protocol buffers on top of tcp or udp sockets

2218582
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in ie6+ firefox google-chrome safari etc

2218586
google-chrome	firefox
as for how does firefox handle scope in this regard differently to ie and google-chrome

2218733
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
some modern browsers firefox safari and opera but not google-chrome support the special back forward cache i ll call it bfcache which is a term invented by mozilla involved when the user navigates back

2218733
firefox	safari
for pages that need to know when they re being navigated away back to firefox 1.5+ and the version of safari with the fix for bug 28758 support special events called pageshow and pagehide

2218763
portrait	landscape
i have been able to change the orientation of the top status bar but how can i change the position of the tabbar to landscape while keeping the uitableview portrait

2218766
exif	xmp
as it turns out the windows imaging component wic used by bitmapmetadata reads writes many different types of metadata blocks including tiff exif iptc and xmp

2218766
exif	xmp
as i mentioned in the question i ve now built this library which correctly converts a very high percentage of the metadata properties from the tiff exif and xmp blocks

2218773
pop-up	dialog
i am creating a sand falling game similar to the powder game and i created a class called control to create a control bar at the bottom of the screen with a slider for brush size that works fine and a button to pop-up a dialog to allow users to pick the selected element

2218855
mvvm	delegatecommand
anyway why don t you use an existing class like josh smith s relaycommand or mvvm toolkit delegatecommand

2218904
qcodo	qcubed
just set up firephp and using a framework called qcodo qcubed

2218915
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

2218915
keydown	keyup
for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

2218915
keydown	keyup
thus you really need to hook on either the keydown or keyup events

2218923
google-chrome	firefox
but if firefox and google-chrome that alert message it would not show up

2218925
mouse	keyboard
this technique was commonly used by tsr programs rewriting the interrupt vector table to hook the keyboard timer mouse or similar and then terminate while remaining in memory

2218931
min	max
also what is the max and min number of comparisons that we might need to find the indexes

2218945
equals	gethashcode
if you re overriding equals then you should also override gethashcode as this is what the dictionary will use in the first instance to determine if two keys match

2218945
equals	gethashcode
any two objects of the same type that are considered equals should return the same value from gethashcode .

2218946
implements	extends
is-a means that the class extends from a superclass or implements an interface

2218975
post	get
one go get the list the way i need and manipulate the fullname on post

2219036
floating-point	integer
an integer we would hope would be 16 or maybe 64 bits but if it were to derive from the real number a real number has two integers in it a mantissa and a characteristics the exponent and they used they implied binary points inside them to make these floating-point number

2219057
idictionary	icollection
edit hmm idictionary does not implement icollection which is a bit of a pain

2219116
ironruby	ironpython
if you re familiar with c# and the .net framework ironruby and ironpython would give you access to all the classes you already know

2219130
hex	binary
i can figure out the base 10 to binary or hex conversions really well however the 8bit floating point conversions are kicking my ass and i can t find anything online that breaks it down in a n00b level and shows the steps

2219137
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
essentially what it all boils down to is extending the tableadapter via a partial class with a begintransaction method which opens the inner sqlconnection and holds it open and hands you back a sqltransaction which you then use normally

2219149
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i have a complex set of data models that currently implement java.io.serializable and i have successfully serialized and deserialized them with objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

2219149
serializable	deserialization
however the result are binary files as expected and i was wondering if java supports serializable and deserialization in the same manner to a non-binary format such as xml

2219149
serializable	deserialization
i see that c# has this feature xml vs binary performance for serializable deserialization

2219157
cos	sin
starting from the top-center point move relative 1 2 top width x sin angle 1 2 top width x cos angle - that gets the top right corner point

2219157
cos	sin
continue around the rectangle using the sin and cos of the angles and widths as appropriate

2219169
range	minimum
this measure certainly has a maximum and a minimum so then it could be mapped to some desirable range like 0-100

2219238
post	get
map this servlet in web.xml by an url-pattern so that you can call it by a post form or maybe just by a get link replace dopost by doget then

2219252
libs	buildpath
this way the server s libs will be automagically added to the project s buildpath

2219286
multiplying	subtract
adding subtract and multiplying numbers with an absolute value 1.0 can only result in overflow

2219310
factors	matrix
the pca method is pretty close to just taking the svd and getting rid of the singular values by factors them into the u and v matrix

2219318
struts	wicket
actually since it supports multiple web frameworks spring mvc struts wicket etc one use case for your performance testing could involve testing with each one to compare different types of functionality

2219351
spaces	delimiter
okay i ve got the program working fine now as long as the delimiter is a spaces

2219402
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore the framework that has bespin and mobileme among others will also support commonjs and 280 north the makers of cappuccino employ some of the main narwhal developers

2219412
firefox	safari
of course it works fine in firefox safari

2219414
many-to-many	many-to-one
there are many examples of style filters in the many-to-many and many-to-one tests

2219424
pull	push
using merge to merge master changes to the feature branch git push pull and once mature do a single rebase in one or more commits cleanly

2219432
width	height
but i m coming unstuck when i attempt to remove the hardwired width and height settings from the first line.

2219479
children	parent
when the mouse leaves the parent element i want to hide the parent and it s children

2219479
children	parent
i really only want the event to fire when the mouse is not within the parent or any of it s children

2219484
range	max
compute the above 5 equations of the next step for all combinations of î ï 0 î max x -ï max 0 ï max only 6 combonations and 5 equations for each so shouldn t take too long and since they are run so often the rather restrictive range will be amortized in the end

2219484
backtracking	greedy
it s a greedy algorithm that by its very nature can t backtracking

2219511
outputstream	inputstream
how to convert a reader to inputstream and a writer to outputstream

2219527
firefox	safari
in firefox safari clicking view will allow you to see more details on the product on the right

2219545
integer	unsigned
more 16-bit unsigned integer values

2219547
width	height
why don t you just set .center of the subview just added to be the point created by halving the width and height of the superview

2219570
postgresql	mysql
we had previously been using mysql which has a policy on case insensative searching however postgresql seems to lack this

2219586
bimap	hashmap
google collections supports bi-directional hashmap see bimap

2219637
implements	extends
the reason why i am asking is because afaik if i need to use attributes then i should be implements or extends the asp.net membership providers

2219690
spaces	delimiter
the program only needed to work with a spaces as a delimiter character

2219690
spaces	delimiter
i just turned it in and got full credit but after turning it in i realized that this program only worked if the delimiter character was a spaces

2219694
children	parent
i have a parent program pojo with a many-to-many relationship with their children subscriber

2219694
children	parent
why is my parent returning children returning parent returning children

2219720
many-to-many	one-to-many
i think you should have either a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between operation and equipment depending on whether there is one equipment entry per piece of equipment or per equipment type

2219818
floating-point	fractions
rounds a double-precision floating-point value to the specified number of fractions digits

2219823
width	height
if you can give it hints ahead of time through the use of fixed size width height elements then the browser doesn t need to figure anything out and it can draw the elements as they are downloaded

2219840
floating-point	fractions
rounds a double-precision floating-point value to the specified number of fractions digits

2219867
public	protected
protected internal - you cant bind to a non public property

2219879
getter	setter
...via a public accessor getter setter member function

2219882
post	get
you can use an ugly type-casting hack but it s so ugly that i m afraid to even post it not to get downvoted

2219887
versioning	upgrade
if they are on versioning 1.9 they get upgrade to versioning 2.5

unsigned	short
the function print of namespace freetype has the 4th argument as const unsigned short so i typecasted it

2220083
stdout	stderr
i also need to store the stdout stderr and return code of each completed processes

2220112
post	put
if it s going inside a section then it will be applied to all pages you want to put the and its contents inside the sections there ll be the listing page and individual post pages - the sections should already exist in the aw_blog.xml file

2220118
pull	push
and to better manage the push and pull of parts of your global repo to a private one i would recommend the git subtree script tool

2220119
min	max
once you have used this to find one of the values perform two more slightly moded binary searches using the min and max you currently have to find the tips

2220119
min	max
note there is no early return using this method you just keep going until min and max are like one or something apart i suppose you could add one with another check

2220188
google-chrome	safari
how do i print an iframe from javascript in safari google-chrome

2220188
opera	google-chrome
print iframe content in opera and google-chrome

2220204
width	height
the width and height properties won t be set because you haven t explicitly set them

2220204
actualheight	actualwidth
it s actualwidth and actualheight you want which are set by wpf

2220204
actualheight	actualwidth
the controls haven t been laid out yet so actualwidth and actualheight will be zero

2220204
actualheight	actualwidth
use dispatcher.begininvoke to run the layout logic in a separate message that runs at a lower priority to layout thus ensuring the actualwidth and actualheight have been calculated and assigned

2220219
put	get
if you need to put together a report or something combining data from a mainframe system with external data sources it may be easier to get the data off the mainframe and do the integration elsewhere - perhaps some sort of data mart

2220230
g++	gcc
this piece of code works well with my g++ compiler but gcc gives a error saying lvalue required as left operand of assignment

2220234
keydown	keyup
just remember that for keydown and keyup you ll have to keep track of the case using the e.shiftkey state

2220277
google-chrome	firefox
tested the above which probably needs tuning with google-chrome and firefox

2220291
keydown	keyup
i ve tried overriding the keyup keydown events but apparently that was not the way

2220291
mouse	keyboard
isenabled is a good solution however i only wish to disable keyboard interaction and leave mouse interaction intact

2220294
cfstring	nsstring
the easier but a bit more inefficient way is to store it as an nsstring cfstring using cfuuidcreatestring and recover the uuid with cfuuidcreatefromstring

2220298
mouse	keyboard
however i think a control that responds to mouse clicks by not keyboard is buggy not everyone prefers to use the mouse

2220323
children	parent
2 you want to seek through each instance and result children inside parent trip whose values are not null

2220324
for-loop	loops
can i iterate through the tweets in a for-each loops or do i have to resort to using a standard for-loop

2220329
post	put
only two ways that are valid are either to put the whole resource with the sub data modified or post to that resource or put to a sub-resource

2220335
post	put
of course you could theoretically put them into the same post table and have a posttypeid for comments

2220397
rss	feed
i am new to iphone development.i want parse an you-tube xml page and retrieve its contents and display in a rss feed

2220493

final solution working in ie6 7 8 firefox opera google-chrome and safari

2220568
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	bindparam	bindparam	pdostatement

2220643
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox everything is fine

2220650
uiview	subviews
i thought a good approach would be to have one uiview that acts as the top visible part the gauge s window if you will and a subviews that just draws the dial with the values and markers

2220655
width	height
what would be more natural expanding the div to take 100 of available area or resizing to the given width and height

2220684
nstextview	nstextstorage
you should add your controller as the delegate of the nstextstorage object of the nstextview and then implement the delegate method â textstoragedidprocessediting

2220684
nstextview	nstextstorage
in the delegate method you need to get the current nstextstorage object from the text view using the -textstorage method of nstextview

2220714
opera	safari	webkit	gecko
you may find it preferable to check for gecko ie webkit opera explicitly and redirect everything else to your mobile site - that way you re maintaining a smaller ua regex plus you d be catering for the mobile safari iphone ipod touch by keeping them on your main website

2220716
udp	tcp
is it possible to send multiple tcp or udp packets on a single ip packet

2220716
udp	tcp
if it is allowed by the protocol but is generally not done by tcp udp implementations could you point me to the relevant portion in the linux source code that proves this

2220716
udp	tcp
are there any implementations of tcp udp on some os that do send multiple packets on a single ip packet

2220804
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
is there a way to invoke touchesbegan touchesmoved touchedended programmatically

2220814

i have used smoothdivscroll and jflow it worked perfectly on firefox google-chrome safari opera etc

2221080
tinyint	boolean
fyi boolean is an alias for tinyint 1

2221218
division	subtraction
repeated subtraction is a dangerously inefficient way of doing division

2221249
setinterval	settimeout
i think you have to use settimeout and not setinterval

2221294
getter	setter
it has ugly and inconsistent api - annualcalendar has getter and setter that takes arraylist monthlycalendar has getter and setter that takes boolean both of them just expose class internals

2221436
versioning	upgrade
is it possible to force the user to upgrade once there is a new versioning of my application available in the itunes store

2221436
versioning	upgrade
however i want to force the upgrade whenever i upload a newer versioning because the upgrade will have more features and i want to discard the previous versioning

2221438
debian	linux
i know linux distributions like debian have simply an i686 which is enough

2221476
width	height
in other words i want to flip the rows and columns but keep the same width and height of the new array

2221493
post	get
also you made a typo in method post that s why it doesn t get submitted as post data

2221504

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

2221603
children	parent
you need to check that the parent is actually the target of the mouseout event as opposed to the event bubbling up from one of the children

2221618
integer	unsigned
c99 defined a standard 64-bit integer type named int64_t and unsigned version uint64_t in stdint.h .if you want to provide portable code you should use them but not __int64

2221618
integer	unsigned
notice there is no standard 64-bit integer type in c++ programming language msvc use __int64 but in linux world you normally use int64_t or uint64_t which is type defined as long long or unsigned long long in c99 s stdint.h .here i assume your c++ compiler support the stdint.h header file

2221699
width	height
the jeditorpane cannot compute its final preferred width and height simultaneously it has to know one before it can compute the other

2221699
width	height
on the first pass the jeditorpane computes its preferred height based on the assumption that its width will be unlimited so it returns the height of a single line since the text contains no line breaks.

2221764
implements	extends
we can now create an interface for the banners table objects which implements our irepository and a concrete class extends the abstract repository class and implements the ibannerinterface

2221775
versioning	upgrade
however that is much different from designing the app from the start to force users to upgrade every time the developer releases a new versioning

2221778
width	height
they re there for your custom fields to override with whatever your custom field s preferred width height is

2221783
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome opera but not in ie8

2221787
postgresql	mysql
as the application can be configured to use either postgresql or mysql and questions were raised about comparative vulnerability i tried out both databases and tested each configuration with some sql injection attempts

2221787
postgresql	mysql
the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

2221793
rsa	aes
an aes key encrypt the data with the symmetric algorithm with k then encrypt k using the rsa keys of all the receipients

2221838
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i have written a code which works on almost all major browsers firefox opera safari but doesn t work in ie7

2221847
postgresql	mysql
but that s shouldn t be a reason to use mysql over postgresql since you can still inject by using subqueries

2221857
post	get
last.fm submissions api relays on http 1.1 get and post

2221859
g++	gcc
g++ -shared -framework opengl -framework appkit -framework cocoa -lobjc -lstlport -framework coreservices -lstlport build lib obj gcc so -l

hide	show
i want to just show a and hide b

2221995

map mouse keyboard input to the displayed texture and hand that off to webkit

2222365
mouse	keyboard
in one post it is stated the office apis all assume you are running office in an interactive session on a desktop with a monitor keyboard and mouse and most importantly a message pump. i m not sure what that is

2222383
hash	salt
i realize we ll probably not need a randomly generated 30 character salt to create our password hash or irreversible encryption in bcrypt s case for years

are there any easy to follow migration guides to go from nginx phusion passenger to unicorn

2222464

xstream	jackson	freemarker	velocity
integration with many popular technos freemarker velocity spring jackson xstream jaxb atom odata wcf data services etc.

2222471
put	get
you have to get to the guts of the plugin and find a place to put a callback function that would trigger your onchange actions

2222488
getter	setter
there should be fairly obvious parent-child relationships that you can describe by having your node classes own or somehow return an array of child node classes and the attributes as getter setter

2222491
hex	binary
zoc terminal has extensive trace features it can show hex dumps control characters and binary logs

2222506
children	parent
to my knowledge there is no css attribute to limit the width of a parent to the size of its children

2222506
width	margin
when you apply margin to body it does not affect the width of the page and you always end up with a scroll bar across the bottom

2222523
hide	show
everytime i make a new selection a table element must show or hide depending on my selection

2222569

2223118
teamcity	nant
teamcity can be configured with different build systems too nant msbuild et al

2223136
g++	gcc
gcc g++ and the other frontends use filenames to determine language

2223136
g++	gcc
for example the only major difference between gcc and g++ is one that bites new c++ programmers different link settings for the c++ stdlib

2223144
g++	gcc
g++ should be the front-end for c++ and cc for c but both point to gcc

2223153
fortran	ada
the program gcc is a driver which can dispatch to a c a c++ an ada a fortran a java and probably other compilers depending on what is installed and the extension of the file

2223159
maven	cargo
the cargo maven plugin would allow to do similar things in a container agnostic way but it might be a bit harder to setup at least for advanced use cases

2223164
range	max	range	min	min	max
you have to use string functions to determine if the tol is a percent and act accordingly to calculate the min and max range for that field

2223180
gif	png
it will allow you to load and store images that were encoded in basically any known format png and gif included and allow you to efficiently operate on the images once they ve been loaded

2223181
pascal	delphi
my preference would be to build directly from the pascal source in delphi 2007 for .net although i ll use newly-built assemblies if necessary

2223203
width	margin
exactly i don t want to put presentation information in my html but i hoped i wouldn t have to just take the css classes that make up the grid system apart and apply the relevant parts like margin 0px and width 960px since that is bad from a maintenance and reuse angle

2223208
firefox	safari
the firefox browser shows the images clipped no matter how they are accessed so i guess this is no longer a perl problem but the safari browser displays them completely

2223223
findwindow	shellexecuteex
use findwindow in your mfc application to try to locate the external application and then only run shellexecuteex if it doesn t already exist otherwise activating the existing window

a while loop can be terminated when a break goto return or throw statement transfers control outside the loop

2223381

2223405
superclass	subclassing
the point of polymorphism is that you can subclassing a class and the objects implementing those subclassing will have different behaviors for the same methods defined in the superclass and overridden in the subclassing

2223477
inherited	subclassing	public	protected
instead static members belong to the class and as a result overriding is not supported because subclassing only inherited protected and public instance members and not static members

it seems that the css -rounded corners style works on some parts of my stackexchange site s - sf answers phonehow.com and not on others - it displays correctly in google-chrome but not in safari

2224405
public	protected
class methods may be defined as public private or protected

2224412
hide	show
use javascript to remove the text you want to hide and reinsert it on show

2224412
hide	show
if you need more control of the display value used for show and hide you can use a css class

2224414
post	get
assuming you require to send the post request asynchronously you may want to check the example below to get you going in the right direction

2224427
imperative	declarative
i m reading functional programming by tomas petricek jon skeet and i understand the difference between declarative imperative programming

2224427
imperative	declarative
what i was wondering is how are the primitive operators functions implemented are declarative languages constructed from imperative operators functions

2224447
imperative	declarative
there are imperative turing-complete languages and functional declarative turing-complete languages

2224452
imperative	declarative
strangely enough most imperative languages go through a phase where all the code is transformed to be more declarative

2224460

2224532
uninstall	upgrade
does anyone know if i can upgrade from rc1 or should i uninstall it first

2224543
setinterval	settimeout
it s true you don t want to use setinterval and settimeout in the way you ve described

2224543
setinterval	settimeout
while you can use setinterval and or settimeout with calls to settimeout again in the function body to poll for a success code that approach is dramatically inferior to just handling the callback in the first place instead of polling for it

2224605
addition	multiplication
carry is a single bit for addition and element-sized for multiplication

2224627
implements	extends
it is implements as a class that extends view and is annotated with remoteview

2224680
maven	pom.xml
make sure that you ve created a new maven project in netbeans and not just a java desktop project these don t recognize the pom.xml

2224686
salt	md5
for password storage i suggest using md5 with a salt

2224698
getter	setter
since this is within my package this seemed like an ok way to do things given that those fields aren t going to be visible from outside of the package and it seemed to be unnecessary to make things private and provide getter and setter

2224698
getter	setter
should i provide getter and setter even when i know exactly what will be getting and setting my fields and i m not worried about someone else writing something that will break my code

2224734
getter	setter
most java developers will prefer to see getter and setter

2224734
getter	setter
maintaining getter and setter may take a little more time but offers a lot more safety plus

2224734
getter	setter
you can refactor your code any time as drastically as you want so long as you don t break your public api getter setter and public methods

2224747
getter	setter
i would adhere to a common style and in this case provide setter getter

2224747
getter	setter
a lot of java frameworks assume getter setter conventions and are tooled to look for these expose them interrogate them

2224747
getter	setter
if you use setter getter you can easily refactor what s behind them

2224752
webrat	cucumber
this error can also occur with webrat cucumber when filling in form data using a table

2224753
hash	salt
store a salt hash

2224762
georss	kml
if your layers are vector wfs kml georss etc. then you can reproject them with openlayers in the browser

2224774
getter	setter
even though it s painful coding up properties with getter and setter is a big win if you re ever going to use your objects in a context like jsp the expression language in particular ognl or another template language

2224799
int	double
you usually only use d for int values you have double in your matrix

2224808
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the entire browser stalls and in google-chrome just the tab

2224810
hash	md5
apply a hash function to the password such as sha1 or md5

2224810
salt	md5
then add extra salt to it by taking like the first 5 characters of md5 social or something

2224816
google-chrome	safari
on safari google-chrome the iframe is resized to 75 of its original size but the content within the iframe is not scaled at all

2224819
pop-up	dialog
the user clicks on the box and a dialog box pop-up asking them to select a category

2224831
jruby	mri
just don t use jruby for unit tests and rake tasks the thoughtworks mingle team for example uses mri for unit tests rake tasks and development and jruby for integration tests regression tests and production

2224831
jruby	mri
the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

2224831
disk	ram
just loading the entire beast from disk into ram can already take longer than running the same script in mri

2224870
photoshop	fireworks
the easiest way to do this is to create a small flat image in photoshop fireworks gimp kreta etc

2224897
bmp	tga
bmp - tga image file conversion is an appropriate start

2224915
punctuation	words
what are common approaches for translating certain words or expressions inside a given text when the text must be reconstructed with punctuation and everythin.

2224915
punctuation	words
i can t simply tokenize since i loose punctuation and words positions

2224921
getter	setter
i find getter and setter are better way to program and its not about only a matter of coding convention

2224936
pop-up	dialog
the app produces a modal pop-up and waits for the user input but when the app is tiled with other programs the dialog appears randomly in different locations on the screen

2224978
getter	setter
on the other hand also be careful about getter and setter at all--they have a lot of pitfalls

2224978
int	double	getter	setter
setter and getter expose your internal structures if you have a getter for an int it s difficult to later change that to a double--you have to touch every place it was accessed and make sure it can handle a double without overflowing causing an error if you had just asked your object to manipulate the value in the first place the only changes would be internal to your object

2224993
getter	setter
having getter and setter for all fields is also a bad idea

2224993
getter	setter
a field with getter and setter is almost the same as a public field - it exposes the implementation details of the class and increases coupling

2224993
getter	setter
code using those getter and setter easily violates oo principles and the code becomes procedural

2225045
slideup	slidedown
jquery slidedown is invoked revealing more input fields in the previously hidden div and then slideup is invoked when mousing out

2225045
slideup	slidedown
the trouble is that everything behaves in firefox but in ie7 the bottom visible portion of the div which is absolutely positioned to bottom in order to keep at the bottom during slidedown and slideup is not visible on the initial page load

2225047
post	get
what ways are there for detecting exploits in php mysql web applications checking for certain characters or pieces of codes in the get post cookie arrays using a library with a database that has all the patterns for common exploits if any exist

2225063
ant	maven
the good thing about this is that the project documentation can be re-generated through ant maven etc

2225065
getter	setter
or in more specific words is it ok to not be relying on setter and getter

2225065
getter	setter
however the code that deals with the object often sets public properties directly instead of using getter setter methods

2225075
hide	show
what do i need to do to modify the show hide history to show either hide history if it s currently displayed or show history if it s currently hidden

2225081
getattr	setattr
for example if you have a class that overloads the bracket operators with getattr and setattr but uses some funny internal scheme it would be appropriate for it to behave as a dictionary if that s what it s trying to emulate

2225102
getter	setter
although i much prefer specified getter setter for each property whether that s a proxy to a generalized or not

2225107
getter	setter
setter getter are the way to go and the very small performance penalty that you pay for it is usually either optimized away or trumped by elegance

2225174
boost	stl
if you are looking for something to expand on the stl that is supported by almost everything it would be worth taking a look at the boost libraries

2225184
width	height
first time the width and height properties are being set correctly

2225184
width	height
i then use this image s height and width properties in order to create a blown up crop preview

2225184
width	height
the browser or the dom or something automagically set the img s height and width attributes which i access via the dom after the image has loaded

2225184
width	height
this time however the img s width and height attributes accessed via javascript remain the same as the prior image

2225184
width	height
the new image displays correctly in it s own width and height it s just that the tag s properties do not change along with a new src

2225184
width	height
or even better how i could deterministically get the img s height and width upon loading a new src

2225196
getter	setter
i think most people will recommend using setter getter

2225196
getter	setter
by using setter getter you add a valuable layer of encapsulation to your classes and 99 of the time this is worth the extra typing you ll need to do

2225196
getter	setter
imagine trying to do the examples above without setter getter

2225196
getter	setter
it s an object relation mapper orm that can automatically setup setter getter for you amongst other things

2225204
accessor	properties
regarding accessor i do not see a need to use them for what you are describing retrieving class properties and internal state information aka a struct

2225207
rss	feed
we use drupal aggregator to get rss feed and present in views

2225215
content-disposition	content-type
if internet explorer knows the content-type specified and there is no content-disposition data internet explorer performs a mime sniff scanning the first 200 bytes of the file to determine if the file structure matches any known mime types

2225215
content-disposition	content-type
lastly if there is no content-type or content-disposition data and the mime sniff does not recognize a known mime type the file extension is set to the same extension as the url used to download the file

2225217
width	height
what about removing the height and width attributes

2225226
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
dragging and dropping web parts works great in internet explorer but it doesn t work at all in firefox google-chrome or safari

2225226
post	get
these post offer a possible solution but i have been unable to get it working yet on my site

2225253
getter	setter
once on that i d really love if java had implied getter and setter created using a property keyword.

2225285
youtube	vimeo
because both youtube and vimeo videos are rendered using flash it s unlikely that you ll be able to listen for the click events registered by those elements because flash has its own internal event model with its own handlers

2225294
hash	md5
i am creating a sequential file which requires a digital signature md5 hash

2225294
hash	md5
if i perform a md5 hash on both the sequential file and dynamic array can i expect the result to be the same or different

2225295
rss	feed
i d check out the feed which can import each rss item as its own node so excluding any is as easy as just unpublishing along with views to list them and sharethis to add the ability to email or share them

2225316
g++	gcc
normally - if you are on linux and gcc g++ gdb is installed - then it should work out of the box

2225320
getter	setter
i wouldn t care much about the style per se or any kind of dogma for that matter but rather the convenience in maintainability that comes with a set of getter setter methods

2225320
getter	setter
if you or someone else later needed to change the behavior associated with a change of one of those attributes log the changes make it thread-safe sanitize input etc. but have already directly modified them in lots of other places in your code you will have wished you used getter and setter methods instead

2225347
post	get
the code is not pretty but basically i am using httpclient to post and get and parse the returned xml with saxparser

2225363
width	height
the problem with it is that it cuts off part of the image when the height and width are not equal

2225363
width	height
notice the returnbitmap width original.height and it s height original.width

2225416
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it working perfect in ie and firefox but both safari and google-chrome fails to load the script on some pageloads

2225422
config	ini
if you haven t already figured it out this is an old thread what you re missing is the ini config

2225431
nunit	mstest
for unit testing you shouldn t test private methods yes but for integration tests using a unit testing framework like mstest or nunit i would very much like to run the internal api calls against a test url to make sure the current code works when the third party api vendor changes their backend

2225535
maven	pom.xml
where is the best place to specify required repositories for maven projects pom.xml or settings.xml

2225535
maven	pom.xml
portability this pom.xml will build on anyone s machine with maven installed

2225541
google-chrome	safari
i did not experience any issues in either google-chrome or safari for windows on your product page

2225573
maven	pom.xml
where is the best place to specify required repositories for maven projects pom.xml or settings.xml

2225585
width	height
i have a div that i want to specify a fixed width and height for and also a padding which can be changed without decreasing the original div width height or increasing it is there a css trick for that or an alternative using padding

2225592
google-chrome	firefox
most modern browsers i ve tested google-chrome and firefox send a referer header on link clicks and not on direct entry - that is if the user s settings say to which they usually do by default

2225597
width	margin
to achieve a consistent result cross browser you would usually add another div inside the div and give that no explicit width and a margin

2225598
zen-cart	magento
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility

2225599
actionscript	mxml
or move your xml construction to a pure actionscript file instead of mxml

2225609
punctuation	words
search for the words in the ternary tree - if a partial match is found check that the rest of the words is punctuation or at least not stuff that would make it not be a match

2225609
punctuation	words
the main problem with this approach is if there is punctuation before the words like a but that can be dealt with easily

2225630
box-sizing	border-box
you could use the css 3 property box-sizing border-box to achieve this

2225630
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is supported by ie8 but for firefox you would need to use -moz-box-sizing and for safari google-chrome use -webkit-box-sizing

2225644
crypt	salt
i have read the information provided on the php manual entry for crypt but i find myself still unsure of the format for a salt to trigger the blowfish algorithm

2225644
hash	whirlpool	hash	salt	whirlpool	salt
that hash is obviously not whirlpool and is in fact std_des with only the first two characters of the salt being used for the salt

2225651
google-chrome	safari
it appears that google-chrome can handle more values at the moment but safari can t

2225662
button	checkbox
all checked radio button and checkbox

2225662
button	checkbox
code for all checked inputs checkbox and radio button

2225664
union	distinct
also your query uses a union distinct but really you only need a union all

2225717
min	max
you could still use max category or min category and group by but leave off the having

2225720
hash	salt
when using salt strings longer than 22 characters there is no change in the hash generated truncation and when using strings shorter than 21 characters the salt will automatically be padded with characters apparently

2225720
hash	salt
however if given a salt 20 characters and a salt 21 characters where the two are identical except for the final character of the 21-length salt both hash strings will be identical

2225720
hash	salt
a salt 22 characters long which is identical to the 21 length salt except for the final character the hash will be different again

2225720
hash	salt
however it is important to note that the string generated includes the hash the salt as well as instructions to generate the salt

2225720
hash	salt
thus this is in fact not a difference in the hash produced but a difference in the salt used to store the hash which is precisely the problem at hand two salt are generating the same hash

2225735
post	get
i don t want to argue about whether get or post is the most sensible default i just want to find a way to make post the default form method across all browsers

2225740
updatepanel	scriptmanager
it has a scriptmanager an updatepanel a linkbutton within the updatepanel and a button wired up to the updatepanel via the triggers collection

2225788
codeigniter	cakephp
use a general web application framework like zend cakephp or codeigniter

2225789
subtract	add
none of the suggestiions involving add subtract works for me even if i also set the miliseconds to +

2225808

at home i do a lot of my development on a mac pro i do development for the mac iphone and windows on this machine xcode visual studio - multiple versions installed in bootcamp but generally i run it via parallels

2225848
punctuation	words
you could consider breaking the match at more convenient places such as punctuation or conjunction words instead of spaces

2225849
pull	push
i have had a lot of success using dropbox to host a bare git repository and then i clone that repository on my mac and my pc then i can create branches and push pull all i want between the local copy and the origin in the drop box folder which will then get automatically synced to my other machine

2225871
haskell	ocaml
i will use ocaml to explain pattern matching since it s my functional language of choice but the concepts are the same in f# and haskell afaik

2225919
slideup	slidedown
i use jquery slideup slidedown to animate them like this

2225919
slideup	slidedown
the problem i m encountering now is that after performing some actions in a content frame not the same frame as the navigation the slidedown and slideup functions no longer work

2225936
children	parent
the parent is responsible for making sure the same url isn t processed twice and children don t hang

2226005
superclass	subclassing
subclassing and methods m superclass

2226006
listview	gridview
note that of course i am not referring to the datagrid or the gridview of a listview .

2226109
haskell	ocaml
a great place to learn this mode of thinking is write your algorithm in the programming language haskell or something f# or ocaml which has great support for parallel multicore programming out of the box

2226144
implements	extends
class z extends y implements b

2226192
google-chrome	firefox
however windows is a required platform so firefox or google-chrome are the preferred browsers if i can only do this in one browser

2226199
hide	show
what i want to do is to hide all the links after the n th one and add a show the rest link

2226205
mousemove	mouseout
if you want it to track the mouse movement use mousemove and mouseout instead of hover

2226209
post	get
when using jquery i would use jquery.post with json as datatype to simply make the post request and get an object back

2226224
hide	show
then you can easily show or hide any foo childrens that you want easily with gt filter

2226231
getter	setter
you override the setter and getter

2226236
implements	extends
myclass extends class implements interface1 interface2

2226249
ivar	subclassing
i can then add this uiview subclassing to the main controller by instantiating it and addsubview ivar etc

2226252
allocator	stl
the stl of course does a lot of dynamic allocator

2226270
boost	allocator
i realize even that can go wrong so i try to minimize it by not allocator any memory during the final write and boost the write processes priority

2226279
int	double
using the function double f int i wrote on that topic will give you the value of pi after i terms

2226308
allocator	stl
the biggest problem with stl in embedded systems is the memory allocator issue which as you said causes a lot of problems

2226318
imperative	declarative
are declarative languages constructed from imperative operators functions

2226325
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add	addition	multiplication
then you can use methods of the numeric operations object to perform things like multiplication addition multiplying add and many others

2226336
boost	stl
a lot of problems stl and boost are designed to solve just plain don t come up if you design to avoid haphazard dynamic memory allocation.

2226354
mktime	strtotime
i ve tried using mktime strtotime and some combination of the two but still haven t been able to do it.

2226368
post	get
secondly...upon a later execution of my app when the user has authorized me accessing their account during a previous execution how do i get a reference to a session object so i can connect to their facebook account and post status etc

2226387
minimum	max
tochecklist has the capability of limiting the selection to a max value but not minimum

2226395
gridview	sqldatasource
this stored procedure returns a table with 2 column what i did is set a gridview s datasource using sqldatasource in this stored procedure

2226476
keydown	keyup
i have a control with keydown and keyup events as shown below

2226476
keydown	keyup
the problem i am having is that x is true in keydown but always false in keyup

2226501
allocator	stl
stl allocator are slow bloated

2226501
allocator	stl
stl allocator don t support explicit alignment

2226508
post	get
if i don t get an answer i ll post my results back here.

2226565
range	minimum
for something like this a minimum and maximum font-size is specified then a range is associated with the terms less important to most important

2226600
folder	directory
given a directory how do i delete all files in this folder

2226602
int	double
for instance strings to int arrays. but this won t work with string and double as equivilant values are stored differently at a byte level

2226606
int	double
in this example the method will return a method that with only one parameter which is an int float double or a superclass of number

2226666
google-chrome	firefox
the following css works fine in firefox and ie but does not in google-chrome

2226669
post	get
that way nothing will ever be able to get or post to you receiving action method

2226687
subtract	add
they just add and subtract 5 from a speed that s passed in - i don t think they re supposed to behave this way

2226687
subtract	add
note that the problem description says that they add to subtract from the speed member variable

2226688
public	protected
also members that have accessors are usually made private or protected instead of being left public

2226692
getter	setter
the getter and setter method is used to achieve data encapsulation so that only class members can only access data members of the class

2226695
button	checkbox
all it does is when user presses on button - the hiddenmenu with checkbox slides down

2226719
hide	show
so that state change needs to be communicated to the server so it can either generate the page in the correct state or generate the correct javascript to show or hide the correct content

2226782
disk	ram
i created a ram disk and placed key files such as the jdk and eclipse plugin directory on the ram disk

2226789
many-to-many	many-to-one
i m using a many-to-many association between project and employee for the team members and a many-to-one association between project and employee for the project manager

2226817
getter	setter
your member variables should be private not public as making them public breaks encapsulation and defeats the purpose of accessing them using accessor getter setter functions

2226907
wav	riff
this is part of the specs of the wav actually of its superset riff and thus not dependent on what library you re using to deal with a wav file

2226924
firefox	safari
it works flawlessly in safari while in firefox the div click is being executed first

2226978
mouse	keyboard
this shall mean that for a desktop computer object there shall be 1 cpu 1 mouse 1 keyboard 1 monitor 2 speakers

2227092
allocator	stl
and all stl container have a template for the allocator

2227092
allocator	stl
for exception stl doesn t throw many exceptions in generally the most common are out of memory in your case the system should reset so you can do reset in the allocator

2227109
getter	setter
to create getter and setter or

2227109
for-loop	loops
or for a for-loop or for each loops type in the first few

2227115
strtol	strtod
pass-by-value in c is the reason why strtol strtod etc. need parameter instead of mdash

2227149
button	checkbox
i tried to adapt it to checkbox but the problem was that you can only select one radio button but multiple checkbox

2227202
queue	fifo
have a logging thread with a lock-free you ll probably be able to get away with a mutex fifo queue of messages that is created destroyed when your library is created destroyed

2227221
titlebar	window
is there a way to not have the tasktray icon but keep the normal window titlebar

2227257
allocator	stl
one has to keep in mind that stl allocator will increase their allocator in powers of two which means sometimes it will do some reallocations until it reaches the correct size which you can prevent with reserve so it becomes as cheap as one malloc of the desired size if you know the size to allocate anyway

2227259
pthreads	fcntl
i believe fcntl is pthreads compliant so should work on windows too

2227276
unsigned	short
fortunately the author has uploaded a modified version of his tutorial in his website specified in the question and it uses wchar_t in the original version the author uses const unsigned short as an argument in the print function which allows non-english languages

2227323
folder	directory
you can add a setup dll to your cab installaer that will check the directory structure and will create a folder in case it does not exist

2227397
hide	show
it is a sync call async false and i used beforesend and complete to show and hide the busy image and the check button

2227397
google-chrome	firefox
this thing is working well on firefox but in ie 8 and google-chrome neither the busy image appear nor the check button hides rather the check button remained pressed as the whole thing has hanged

2227520
int	double
the functions you know as foo int and foo double are actually named something like int_foo and double_foo or similar i m not entirely sure of the particular semantics employed for c++

2229920
folder	directory
i created a folder in my solution called schemas to save the xml file and set the build action to content and the copy to output directory value to be copy if newer

2230024

hash	salt
if you aren t running https then any mitm can see the salt you are sending as well as the javascript used to hash the original password so you have nothing gained

2230116
hash	hmac	hash	salt
as for your concern about the possibility of hmac collisions between two salt that is probably very unlikely depending on your hash algorithm and how secure you keep your salt values

2230116
salt	md5
even with md5 that has had some collision attacks discovered and has a set of rainbow tables you will be ok if you keep your salt very very safe

2230125
int	chars
you will first read the chars 2 from the file convert it to an int and then back to a chars which will print 2 on cout

2230127

2230146
memcached	apc
we tried to use apc memcached etc

2230193

unless the salt is actually a nonce otp and not stored in the database then a man in the middle can simply look at the hash sent by the original client and pass that along to the server

if the hashing function is cheap like md5 this won t be any more difficult to crack than one salt and one hash in fact it s actually weaker since hashing is a lossy function

2230371
downcasting	upcasting
also you re upcasting and downcasting for no reason here

2230454

i have two numeric up down controls height and width input parameters

an alternative would be to use rational-numbers with 2 integer components one for the whole part and one for the number of 320ths in the fractions part

2230493
multiplying	modulo
since the modulo value is known at compile time i d expect most modern compilers to go the multiplying by reciprocal and shift approach and this is fast

2230503
getter	setter
where currentversion is not getter or setter method it is just a class method

2230541
freebsd	linux
for both linux and freebsd you can try working through the output of ldconfig 8

my suggestion is to use url.action to generate the base url since it works much the same as redirecttoaction but returns a string

2230823
vmware	virtualbox
i m not sure of any services like that but it sounds to me that you want to use a virtual machine such as vmware or virtualbox

one idea i have found was to authenticate against the active directory ldap using the kerberos ticket

2231020
installation	upgrade
i would not upgrade tangle with or otherwise modify the default installation of python if that s what you are asking

versioning	upgrade
you are much better off installing an upgrade versioning of python in an alternate location using macports

2231050

2231132
google-chrome	firefox
i was doing some logging on window.getselection and noticed that it contained different information when comparing google-chrome and firefox

2231147
post	get
edit what typically happens in the case you mention below is when a user enters a post code the current location is taken to be the geographic center of that post code you would probably have to get this info from the authority who assigns post codes in your area

2231200
dmz	was
since the web site client being situated in the dmz has no access of the local network at all meaning we are unable to impersonate any network user this is a flaw in my original question saying the impersonation works - it was actually not working

2231253
vim	emacs
that has a chance of winning over the vim emacs people

2231285
int	chars	unsigned	short
you would have to read into an unsigned int u or unsigned short hu and then check that the result is with the range of an unsigned chars

boost	allocator
if you have a class without default constructor you absolutely need to have an array and you don t want to incur into the overhead of dynamic memory allocator you can use an array of boost optionals

2231622
width	height
it appears that the height and width is not printing properly and also causes the second 48 not to print

2231622
width	height
btw the uiimage displays fine i just cannot resize the image properly if i cannot get the width and height

2231638

of course accessorizer also writes out explicit accessor as in objective-c 1.0 and allows you to override properties - all with a simple toggle of a switch

2231733
int	double
the typical implementation of a double has a 53-bit mantissa so you can represent 53-bit int with absolute precision

2231755
set	bag
my problem is i don t know how to force or suggest to the reverse engineering tools hibernate-tools.jar to use bag or list --it always uses set

2231774
int	chars
offhand i don t know if that will entirely fix the problem though -- i m not sure if the library has real overloads for wchar_t as a native type to print those out as chars instead of short int

2231776
yacc	bison
since yacc and bison are so closely related i don t find it lacking too much

2231812
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you could use sortedlist or a sorteddictionary see discussion below with a custom key

2231847
vbscript	vba
i d like to be able to script this using vba vbscript or a command line

2231906
bash	tcsh
the linux command shell bash tcsh ksh whatever will expand the into a list of files before your program even sees it

2231912
outputstream	inputstream	content-length	content-type
create a servlet which listens on an url-pattern of gets the requested css file by httpservletrequest#getpathinfo and basically gets an inputstream from it using the aforementioned servletcontext#getresourceasstream and writes it to the outputstream of the response along a correct set of response headers with at least content-type and content-length

2231919
waitpid	fork
see perldoc perlfork perldoc -f fork and perldoc -f waitpid

2231935
pascal	delphi
i recommend you see the project kol kol - key objects library is a set of objects to develop power but small 32 bit windows gui applications using delphi but without vcl or free pascal

2231980
uilabel	uitextview
the controller here will be your existing uiviewcontroller objects or subclasses thereof -- in the first tab responding to changes in the data model and updating the say uilabel accordingly in the second tab changing the numbers in the data model when the user for example modifies the value on a uislider or in a uitextview

2231981
mouse	keyboard
i am developing a program which sends images from one computer to another similar to remote assistance without mouse keyboard input

2231996
swt	swing
i would start with swing and swt because the first decision you will need to make will be to pick one of them and it probably won t be feasible to switch later

2232036
swt	swing
apart from swing swt and the netbeans platform there are a few other words you should google

2232042
cos	exp
b. i have verified that the code is not using any run time math library function like log pow exp cos etc...but still my code has some operations like a+b+c 3.could this be an issue

2232075
getter	setter
a model should be a representation of the object in the database and generally only contains your crud methods create retrieve update delete getter and setter methods and maybe some static helper methods related to the model

2232103
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome but ie fails to recognize it as a csv file thinking it is a html fle and when i click save i get the error unable to download name of file from name of site

2232150
prepare	execute
it uses a pdo prepare statement that execute in a loop

2232191
children	parent
i tweaked it to first walk up to the oldest parent and then walk down through all children

2232211
hide	show
b needs to be hide show columns based on user s location

2232216
post	get
another minor problem with your snippet you re mixing get query parameters in with a post form

2232216
post	get
it s best to not mix get and post variables especially if you use _request elsewhere

2232244
hide	show
although you can hide show columns in your code to manipulate the columns before exporting that s not a big deal just the formatting of the look and feel will be difficult

2232262
onchange	onkeyup
used onkeyup and onchange

2232268
tomahawk	trinidad
tomahawk trinidad and or tobago all from apache

2232291
exponent	modulo
we now just need to compute the coefficients of its sixth power take the exponent modulo 20 and add them up

2232306
imagemagick.net	magick++
it should use the issimilarimage magick method from the imagemagick.net project but iâ m confused as to whether i have to route this method through the magick++ as any functionality available to the .net side originates in the magick++

2232386
uiview	subviews
for a custom uiview i ve implemented i want to display some graphics in multiple calayers that are added as subviews of my uiview layer

2232431
mouse	keyboard
while typing this i see that there may be a solution for both keyboard pasting and mouse pasting using ranges

2232439
mouse	keyboard
for instance sending mouse events to mouse listeners keyboard events to keyboard listeners etc

2232475
packets	pcap
if you need to capture packets on the local machine loopback device you should use the excellent rawcap tool to capture a pcap file then use wireshark on the captured file as usual

2232494
websphere	ibm
if possible see if you can use open ssl on ibm websphere everyplace micro environment jvm as well

2232499
poe	anyevent
unfortunately this typically entails the poe framework but there is also a growing alternative which i would want to try first called anyevent

2232499
poe	anyevent
for your specific question you would use anyevent s aio or poe s read write wheel

2232529
hide	show
for other scenarios where you need to hide show find windows and send keystrokes i would recommend autohotkey .

2232572
super	extends
super wheels - extends class

2232618
hash	md5
i m making a md5 hash of a response and then signing it with a shared secret

2232618
hash	md5
for most calls this works but strangely fails generates a md5 hash different from the client on the only two calls that bring a lot of content in the body

2232684
maven	pom.xml
now project can be build with maven and you can manage dependencies in generated pom.xml

2232720
button	checkbox
i m getting some strange behavior in firefox whenever i put checkbox inside a list ol ul dl and then dynamically insert button above the list

2232720
button	checkbox
but i need both button and the checkbox have to be in a list for what i m trying to build

2232725
hash	md5
anyway here s the correct way to create an md5 hash in java

2232725
hash	md5
keeping in mind that you will need to unencode it later before using it as an md5 hash

2232727
directx	gdi
from greg schechter s redirecting gdi directx and wpf applications

2232763
hash	md5
it is actually the md5 hash that are being damaged

2232800
textarea	textbox
if you apply a style that sets the font-family to be the same for both the textbox and the textarea then your pasted text will match

2232823
nsview	nsoutlineview
the data source pattern is often used by nsview sub-classes in cocoa that have complex state data such as nsbrowser nstableview nsoutlineview etc

2232838
opera	safari
it allows multiple decimal points in safari and opera and you can t type backspace arrow keys or several other control characters in opera

2232866
getter	setter
i have used synthesize to create getter setter and can use kvc to change properties

2232896
button	checkbox
but that s obviously a guess since really the button would be two elements before the checkbox anyway

2232903
post	get
if you want to get started making your own apps for free i wrote a quick blog post here works on any os that can ssh red pill

2232919
put	get
keywordextension will let you put a keyword in a file whose results you can tear apart in order to get the hash

2232935
width	height
naturally when the contents of that treeview exceed the maximum height or width a scroll appears

2232962
unsigned	short
b utf16 in unsigned short arrays

2232983
int	double
it may seem simple at first but as the code evolves and grows readability suffers was that a list of int then double or vice versa

2232990
multiplying	subtraction
also you might say that as a shortcut a 1.5 discount is the same as saying that we charge 98.5 of regular price so we should just be able to multiplying the original price by 98.5 and not have to do an extra subtraction

2233006
stdout	stderr
where do stdout and stderr go when curses is active

2233036
getdate	dateadd
edit if you want to go by days use dateadd d -740 getdate

2233076
width	height
details i wish to resize it to a specified width keep the proportions and if the height is bigger than a specified value to crop it to the specified height

2233097
google-chrome	firefox
clicking the move button changes the parent of the iframe and reloads its contents in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2233114
put	get
in that method put the stuff that happens when you d get the notification

2233149
put	get
and i read here that i should put definition of inline function in header file because it won t work if i ll put them in cpp file and want to call them from other cpp file when i do it i get undefined reference during linking

2233154
mouse	keyboard
i want to be able to record mouse movements clicks and keyboard input from a user

2233163
mouseleave	mouseenter
a mouseenter handler and a mouseleave handler

2233200
restrict	shared
i wonder if it s possible to programmaticaly shared folders in windows 7 while running in restrict logon session

2233203
post	get
i have a static website and i like to take some + or - 15 post from my 200 post wordpress and get it in a static website with design and thing really different from the blog

2233203
post	get
but how to tell the address of the blog and how to get the database texte from post 1828

2233245
maven	pom.xml
the same libraries are referenced in the pom.xml as well it s a bit messy to keep both eclipse rcp and maven happy

2233249
post	get
the value portion of the name value pair from any of the fields coming in through get post

2233265
setinterval	settimeout
it looks like settimeout and setinterval are a bit broken when used between frames in firefox 3.0.10+

2233282
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to the latest versioning and to os 3.1.2 and you ll be fine

2233294
width	height
before writing your img tag to the output buffer save the image to the resulting proposed file name and let identify extract the width and height of this image for you

2233302
maven	pom.xml
so i created a simple web app using maven the pom.xml is setup in eclipse just fine

2233311
opera	firefox	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
well firefox and opera do not support non-free codecs such as mp3 as with the opera 10.5 alpha firefox 3.5 and later supports only pcm wav and ogg vorbis for audio

2233311
google-chrome	safari
i believe google-chrome and safari do support mp3 however

2233337
width	height
i have an inline div with a fixed width and height and another div leaderboard-loader further down the page with the actual content for that div

2233348
maven	m2e
if you have m2e installed and if your project is recognized as a maven project then you should have more entries in the run as.

2233365
width	height
just put leaderboard-loader in front of the leaderboard-slot tag give it position absolute and identical width and height

2233369
implements	extends
the extends clause has to come before the implements clause

2233384
actualheight	actualwidth
you can calculate the size on-screen of the text rendered via a textblock using the actualwidth and actualheight properties

2233384
width	height
the user can then adjust the width and height of the various text areas until satisfied at which point you can take a snapshot using the render method i liked to above

2233395
accessor	properties
at the design level it might be appropriate to use a protected properties but for implementation i see no advantage in mapping this to a protected member variable rather than accessor mutator methods

2233402
viewdidload	dealloc
and suppose this view controller has a nsoperationqueue which is created in viewdidload and released in dealloc

2233402
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
now suppose at some point while this view controller is alive it adds an nsinvocationoperation to the nsoperationqueue and the operation queue starts executing it in the background

2233486
mouse	keyboard
system wide hooks especially journal add a lot of overhead to keyboard and mouse input you want to minized your impact as much as possible

2233486
put	get
you could also maybe get this working by installing both wh_keyboard_ll and wh_mouse_ll but your two hook procedures would be called separately and you would have to write your own code to put the events in order

2233498
strftime	strtotime
easiest way would be to simply transform it to unix time first with strtotime then run strftime on it afterwards.

2233522
postgresql	mysql
edit i need to do a single query mixing tables from 2 databases one db is postgresql and other db is mysql

2233527
gif	png
it uses the gd library to create thumbnails from images jpeg png gif etc

2233529
mouse	keyboard
i ve written a java app that allows users to script mouse keyboard input jmacro link not important only for the curious

2233586
maven	pom.xml
so i googled a bit and found this post that shows another approach based on os commands using the maven exec plugin and has a complete pom.xml doing some other things

2233682
inline	inlining
to answer some of your specific questions inline is an f#-specific construct that interacts with both the type system static member constraints and code generation inlining code for optimization purposes

2233682
inline	inlining
the f# compiler deals with these things and the information regarding inlining is stored in f#-specific metadata in the assembly which enables functions to be inline across f# assembly boundaries

2233711
dictionary	map
you basically have a dictionary where multiple keys map to the same value

2233763
maven	pom.xml
you should also set a proper source version in pom.xml because maven can make builds without eclipse so it can t use eclipse preferences

2233788
width	height
first my image is resized to desired width keeping the proportions and then giving a fixed height to containing div and setting overflow to hidden makes the script to display just the desired portion of the image

2233871
scheme	prolog	lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog	ocaml	scheme	ocaml	prolog
regarding specific langauges lisp was created as an afterthought for doing ai research while prolog with it s roots in formal logic is especially aimed at natural language processing and many courses will use prolog scheme matlab r or another functional language ocaml is used for this course at cornell as they are very suited to this kind of analysis

2233896
datamapper	activerecord
the datamapper pattern is not very popular in the php world in favour of activerecord and certainly much of that favour is attributed to the fawning of ruby on rails in the php framework community although there exists one notable project -- and it looks promising

2233900
webkit	gecko
it works fine in gecko based browsers and webkit

2233912
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
how would i go about doing a detect to see if the browser is either firefox ie but not ie6 opera google-chrome or safari by using feature detection

2233930
dlsym	dlopen
dynamically loading the library and attaching the symbols via dlopen and dlsym would work

2233932
ubuntu	linux
in the code it will work when i compile it on linux ubuntu but it won t work on mac osx 10.6.2

2234013
subtract	add
adding or removing elements to or from anywhere other than the end of a list will be slow because when you remove something it needs to go through every item that comes after it and subtract one from its index and same thing for adding something except it ll need to add to the index

2234102
vmware	virtualbox
something similar to that of what virtualbox vmware himachi creates when you install their software

2234103
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following appears to work in safari 4.0.4 webkit nightly 6531.21.10 r54538 mac os x 10.6.2 but not google-chrome or firefox

2234103
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here are the bug trackers for firefox gecko mozilla google-chrome chromium and safari if it happens not to work on windows or something like that

2234109
trie	tree
similar to a trie is a ternary search tree but a ternary search tree has the advantage of using less memory

2234123
getter	setter
however jitter also inlines some simple calls such as calls to property getter and setter

2234129
maven	m2e
assuming you have the wtp web tools project installed which is part of the eclipse ide for java ee developers distro and you have the maven integration for wtp installed which is an optional module of m2e you have to intall it explicitly then your spring project should be recognized as a dynamic web project and runnable on a server

2234182
ready	each
when the form and webservice is ready to deploy to a test qa production server i have to go into the form and modify the data connections each and every time i have to point it to the relevant webservices depending on the environment dev test qa prod

2234183
mouseover	mouseout
- mouseover mouseout events automatically managed

2234183
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
internet explorer 6+ firefox opera 9+ safari

2234253
daemons	systemd
my app had a daemons attached to it so i had to copy that daemons to systemd library launchdaemons to make that daemons work

2234253
daemons	systemd
i made cydia to copy the daemons file into systemd library launchdaemon folder

2234253
daemons	systemd
for example if you have a daemons and you want cydia to paste it to systemd library launchdaemons make the file structure like this before making a .deb

2234344
children	parent
the children of the parent is a set of records that are related by having the same name or same code or both

2234347
post	get
if there s some other state you need to track like post data or you have an extraordinarily long url that you can t fit in as a query parameter or you need to have the destination_url tampered with by the user you store that information server-side send the key as a query parameter instead of a url and look it up when they get back

2234387
mouseleave	mouseenter
my problem is that the mouseenter and mouseleave functions are being called inconsistently when a user moves the mouse quickly through the list over the child elements which are input fields

2234387
mouseleave	mouseenter
here are the mouseenter and mouseleave functions

2234387
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have attempted to assign the mouseenter and mouseleave functions without using live when i call the function that adds the li elements dynamically into the page

2234410
stdout	stderr
you ll note the wrap stderr on the screen for a second during the sleep -- it s overwritten the stdout part -- then it disappears and you see the four before and after lines on the now-quiescent screen you can add other sleeps to follow what s happening in even more details if you care

2234427
disk	ram
assuming you have enough ram i d buy a ram disk app i use this one with good results

2234429
put	get
no if you really must have the create table in there you could put it in an execute immediate wrapped in a pl sql block with an exception handler that only swallows the exceptions you expect to get - so your scripts should handle all expected errors gracefully

2234430
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
setvolume takes a floating-point fractions and you re treating it as an integer

2234440
mouseout	mouseenter
anyway maybe you can make it so that when mouseenter fires on one thingy it runs the code that corresponds to mouseout on all the other ones

2234468
sorting	filtering	int	double
i m optimizing a sorting function for a numerics statistics library based on the assumption that after filtering out any nans and doing a little bit twiddling floats can be compared as 32-bit int without changing the result and double can be compared as 64-bit int

2234477
implements	extends
i don t have abstract classes implements cloneable nor do i have interfaces extends it because i won t place the burden of implements cloneable on all the classes that extends or implements the abstract class or interface

2234509
children	parent
so say i have 3 children 10 and 1 child 10 if my where clause says child 10 it returns the parent object with a set of children containing only that one child

2234519
put	get
if u get the out put

2234527
nhibernate	queryover
i also want to use new nhibernate 3.0 features such as the improved linq provider and the queryover functionality which are only available in nhibernate s source control trunk

2234528
decoder	encoder
i found a deflate encoder and decoder implementation at and they both work perfectly

2234529
post	get
if you need to reconstruct the get or post request you may be able to use firebug to inspect the page provided by your vendor

2234557
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x10000a720 pointer being free was not allocated

2234562
folder	directory
hi...can any one provide me the code for how to copy the folder from one directory to another...i am able to copy the files by this code but i cannot copy the entir folder at a time.

2234586
folder	dir
i am not really familiar with c++ but maybe you can create the to-be-copied folder in your destination dir and copy to that folder all the files.

2234590
put	get
and obviously the most important reason to use compliant css is that without doing so you don t get that nifty w3c css compliant icon to put on your site

2234616
decimal	ieee
they ve added ieee binary and decimal support but from what i ve heard they re rarely used because the hexadecimal fp is quite a bit faster ibm s been optimizing it for about 45 years now...

2234626
put	get
when i put this onto my development server php 5.2.9 i get this error message

2234696
django-registration	pinax
i m using the third-party apps like james bennett s django-registration and django-messages from the pinax project

2234733
stdout	stderr
even if you take command-line use for granted it should still almost certainly be written to stderr not stdout

2234749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was having this problem in safari and google-chrome mac and discovered that .scrolltop would work on but not firefox and ie however works the other way round

2234749
google-chrome	safari
the jquery browser value for google-chrome is safari so you only need to do a detect on that

2234751
accessor	properties
an accessor should not use kvc to get the value of the properties being accessed

2234758
opera	firefox
fire a keydown event programmatically compatible under different browsers like ie firefox opera chrome.

2234818
nsscanner	nsstring
if you want to read those as numbers and then output the ascii characters they represent you should read the file using nsstring s initwithcontentsoffile then use nsscanner to convert those character sequences into numbers

2234837
hide	show
note you could also use remove instead of hide as show above

2234841
getter	setter
i have a bean class with setter and getter methods for fname and lname property

2234847
post	get
i m guessing an html get or post

2234988
png	ico
this works great but i have not figured out how i should load an icon from an ico file in order to keep all available sizes 16x16 32x32 48x48 and full size png icon

2235008
sharepoint	spsite
sharepoint controls require spcontext.current.site web to work but i am opening many sites using site new spsite siteid

2235022
folder	directory
i published my vs2008 asp.net mvc 1.0 project to a local folder then ftped it to a virtual directory on my host

2235024
width	height
setting the path s width and height does not solve the problem because setting the height for example causes the image to be cut but the white space still stays there

2235080
folder	directory
so i moved the key files and folder from the shell app into my own app directory

2235081
width	height
pil font s do have a getsize method which you can use to get width and height of font did you try that

2235085
implements	extends
you can resort to plugin-based architecture where all or most features are implements as plugins that extends core app functionality

2235087
width	height
setting the size height and width of it will show you the background color

2235101
textview	imageview
i have 2 textview and one imageview and i want to bind them into a single control so that i can implement horizontalscrollview on them.

2235114
gdal	ogr
gdal ogr for accessing different raster vector formats

2235119
qtableview	qtablewidget
take a look at qtableview or qtablewidget

2235165
folder	directory
if you examine the system.management.instrumentation code in reflector or some other disassembler you ll see that wen the assembly that is about to publish hasn t been registered then the code will try to register the assembly and save the assembly info in a specially named sub directory under the wbem installation folder

2235189
versioning	upgrade
if you re using an older versioning of php you really should upgrade but until you do you can use password_compat to expose this api

2235210
width	height
the rect i am creating is propotional to the image i take a ratio from the width height depending on aspect and multiple that be target width height

2235219
ostringstream	std	std	ostream	ostream	ostringstream
i could also overload for std ostream and use a std ostringstream but that also is not the cleanest solution

2235231
hash	salt
as per any hashing technology be sure to salt the hash for added security

2235231
hash	salt
as an added note frkt please show me where someone can easily crack a salt sha256 hash

2235248
int	boolean
each transaction has a name a command that should be called boolean controlling repetition int controlling pause between repetitions in seconds data file reference schedule to use and increments

2235332
int	double
of course the second println fails since f requires list double and not list int

2235332
int	double
which is the best way less code to get the function work on both double and int

2235337
perforce	svn
an alternative - consider getting a free source control system like svn git or mercurial or perforce or other commercial systems offer free licenses for limited use and then do anything you like to your project

2235407
versioning	upgrade
silverlight cons browser must have silverlight plugin installed this plugin should be upgrade time-to-time when new silverlight versioning is released and used in your software sometimes there is a problem upgrading this plugin

2235420
put	get
otherwise the string parser will try to put the ascii code 007 bell in the string and you won t get a match

2235426
hide	show
i m trying to use jquery to show and hide a div onclick and although i m not getting any errors it s not showing or hiding anything either

2235442
hide	show
the above grabs the class from the clicked link and then selects the child of div.v1 with that class and toggles it show it if hidden hide it if not

2235470
salt	md5
while the chance of a collision is neglible keep in mind that hashing your salt with md5 or other collision-prone algorithms will reduce the chance that your salt is unique for no reason

2235479
mouse	keyboard
i m using a jquery ui plugin that captures mouse keyboard clicks ui.selectable.js and doesn t seem to propagate it further

2235510
memcpy	memmove
when is it necessary to use objc_memmove_collectable instead of memmove or memcpy

2235510
memcpy	memmove
edit since memcpy and memmove don t interact with the gc at all i was wondering why i haven t seen any crashes from the memory being collected from underneath me

2235517
maven	pom.xml
i have not mentioned any dependencies in pom.xml but the war created by maven has quite a few unwanted jars

2235530
implements	extends
i would suggest having all your actions implements the same interface though maybe extends servlet so that you don t have to compile in all different classes

2235532
touchesmoved	touchesended
simply add a bool that you check in touchesmoved and reset in touchesended

2235652
super	self
i believe you don t need self in add_view since you use super

2235666
hash	md5

crypt is a one-way function and returns a string that already contains the salt

2235781
crypt	salt
when comparing the user input with the crypt result the function automatically extracts the salt from the string

2235790

n-gram	words
use a huge corpus and generate statistics about quadruplets n-gram how often a tuple of n words appears

2237009
crypt	salt
now the crypt function appears to be capable of taking a salt of any length less than or equal to its maximum and silently handling any inconsistencies in the base64 by discarding any data that doesn t make up another full byte

2237009
crypt	salt
the crypt function will fail completely if you pass it characters in the salt that are not part of its base64 alphabet which just confirms this theory of its operation

2237009
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
the actual salt used by crypt to calculate the hash will in fact be identical

2237009
hash	whirlpool	hash	salt	whirlpool	salt
the salt constantly rotates in a semi non-random way based on a randomish segment of the whirlpool hash of the current time to the microsecond and the data to be hash herein called is simply the current unix-epoch time

getter	setter
note that my solution doesn t need a setter and a getter as long as you always use path_finder and

2237070
getter	setter
xmlserialization only serializes public properties that have a getter and a setter

2237073
libs	buildpath
you should rather have integrated the server in the same ide and configured the ide project to reference associate the server in question so that the ide will automagically take its libs in the project s buildpath

2237110
width	height
another setting such as this is to do something like defining a grid column width or row height like this

what you can do from maven is what you are currently doing starting and stoping cargo during the pre-integration-test and post-integration-test phases respectively

2237530
getter	setter
i de use getter setter to change the values

2237556

getter	setter
i m omitted the getter and setter for ref1 and ref2

2237745
crypt	salt	crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
in your own answer you note that crypt is using the freebsd md5 which also does some interesting transformations on the salt before running the hash so the result of what i m about to give you will never quite match up with the results of a call to md5

2237745
hash	md5
first you need something to convert the base64 with custom alphabet into a raw 16-byte md5 hash

2237831
post	put
i always use it on post delete put actions

2237836
maven	m2e
... i then found that my command-line maven 2.2.1 does things differently to my m2e embedded maven embedder v

maven	m2e
note that you can configure m2e to use an external maven instead of the embedded maven

2237879
lisp	scheme
i learned all of them to a diffeent degree and would advise starting with scheme a lisp dialect - simply because it is easiest to learn

2237879
haskell	scheme
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

2237896
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

if i need to enter a password through an on screen keyboard via touch or mouse the password can be gleaned by watching the key presses or where the mouse hovers if key press is disabled

2237955
quicksort	mergesort
if so algorithms like mergesort and quicksort can be parallelized because they use the divide-and-conquer paradigm but since the same kinds of operations are performed on each half you should be aware that parallelizing will only benefit you if you are working on a system with multiple cores

2237969
width	height
the overall dimensions of a range are in its width and height properties

2237980
int	chars
i need to convert a chars to an int

2237990

the range object has both width and height properties which are measured in points

2237993
fgets	getline	fgets	getchar	getchar	getline
to read the data in use either fgets with stdin or getchar in a loop - or see if your library has a getline

2237993
getchar	strtok
you can then split the resulting string with strtok or if that seems too complicated it is at first sight you coudl split the input yourself as you read it with getchar - just detect the spaces and copy the values yourself

2237995
inherited	subclassing
it must be possible to convert the a b and c to a footype typically through simple inherited though i won t get into the differences between subclassing vs subtyping

nant	xmlpoke
nant has an xmlpoke

2238288
integer	unsigned
you let sprintf u interpret the bit bye sequence of a signed integer as an unsigned integer

accessor	properties
i did some changes to code which was suggested such as used properties and synthesize in place of declaring and defining accessor methods

2238642
superclass	subclassing
in the majority of cases however the implementation details of a superclass subtly conflict with the requirements of a subclassing

2238642
inherited	subclassing
in these cases the implementation re-use offered by inherited is purchased with the added effort of verifying state changes and execution paths across cascading levels of code the complete flattened implementation details of the subclassing are spread between multiple classes which usually means multiple files of which only portions apply to the subclassing in question

2238684
hide	show
nb you can show hide views in a region by calling the activate deactivate method on the iregion like so

2238705

setting default values to height and width would solve my problem

2238930
google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie8 firefox and google-chrome

2238942
width	height
if that s the case you could just use larger images and set the width and height and let the browser do the scaling for you

2238975
folder	directory
this scenario works for me my plugin directly is totally separate to my application directory its a web app and dynamically loaded dlls find their referenced dlls in the same folder

2239009
debian	linux
on linux certainly on debian you can see this by doing

2239012
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
what i ve done in the past is wrap the code for the nsurlconnection s delegate in a concurrent nsoperation class

2239012
superclass	subclassing

the parent div would be of width height 200 or if you want to get fancy you could simply have the height width be 100 and use some fancy math in js to dynamically size the divs as the port moves

2239519
int	chars
is there a way to specify how many chars of a string to print out similar to decimal places in int s

2239587
srp	principles

haskell	scheme
i have used haskell scheme and xslt though i learned them in the opposite order -- scheme then haskell and then using xslt for basic stuff

2239682
haskell	scheme
i found that the thinking processes i learned using scheme and later haskell definitely helped me understand the high level concepts of xslt programming

2239685
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
i have played around a little with xslt and have delved deeper into the functional languages lisp scheme and haskell

2239685

full sgml that xslt performs for xml

2239685
haskell	scheme
but there s no easily-mapped line from learning xslt to scheme or haskell

2239685
lisp	scheme
lisp and scheme are both so loosely typed as to feel essentially typeless

since every fake keyup event is followed by an immediate keydown event you simply remove the keyup event from the keyremovelist if you receive a keydown event this looks like the following

2241257
keydown	keyup
since the real keyup event isn t followed by an immediate keydown event it s processed normally

2241257

assuming the bst is setup as they suggest then simply deleting the root node should automatically delete all the allocated memory as each parent down the tree will delete its children

2241473
many-to-many	many-to-one
it does not usually make sense to enable cascade on a many-to-one or many-to-many association

2241473
children	parent
but if you think that you will often be working with the parent and children together in the same transaction and you want to save yourself some typing consider using cascade persist merge save-update

2241473
children	parent
mapping an association either a single valued association or a collection with cascade all marks the association as a parent child style relationship where save update delete of the parent results in save update delete of the child or children

2241473

2242203
awt	swing
there are no displayable awt or swing components

2242206

2242239
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have seen this in opera google-chrome and safari as well but not firefox yet so if i am loading more than one script i hold running any commands until i know the resources are available- usually by testing the typeof a function from the required file and a timer callback if not found

2242265
postgresql	mysql
i want to use ruby with postgresql or mysql postgresql being the first choice

2242287
post	get
the normal pagination tag won t work inside a portlet you ll need to copy the tag code and modify it to post to the actionurl of your portlet call the jsp tag provided by the portal to get this url from your gsp tag code instead of the default url for the controller

2242292
disk	ram
there are other devices such as fusionio cards and other pure ram harddisks that also solve this issue such as hypersystem s ram disk

2242555
post	put	post	get	put	get
get is intended for retrieval of a resource without making any modifications or incurring any side effects and post is intended for adding information to a resource but not creating a new resource that would be a put

2242555
post	get
you can use a post request to retrieve a resource and get requests can have side effects

2242555
post	put
so you could put the mode information into the body of a post request

2242559
filesystems	hfs+
according to this site the only forbidden character on hfs+ volumes which as michael greene stated is the underlying filesystems on the iphone is the colon character

2242574

late answer but in addition to what you ve already accepted there is another open source project along the lines of awesomium being developed for use in the ogre engine which may or may not be useful relevant berkelium - t 54484

2242618
int	double
using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time

2242634
post	get
so for example if you re doing a get after post then it s assumed that you shouldn t really have querystring variables that you need to get rid of

2242636
versioning	upgrade
my problem is i am trying to upgrade the rails versioning from 1.2.3 to 2.3.4

2242654
for-loop	loops
if you re going to write a while loops that is equivalent to a for-loop as above i strongly encourage you to write it as a for-loop

2242654
for-loop	loops
further as a for-loop it is easier to read as everything initialization loops condition expression to be executed after each iteration are all on one line

2242654
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will print 0--9 skipping 5 on the console whereas the while loops will print 0--4 on the console and then enter an infinite loops

2242655
for-loop	loops
the for-loop tells you it is most probably a fixed count loops

2242734
disk	ram
some caches also allow you to cache on disk instead besides of caching in ram

2242759
width	height
using the height ... and width ... methods

2242764
width	height
jquery has two methods width and height to do this very thing

2242819
accessor	properties
you can either implement the kvc accessor yourself or declare a properties and use the synthesize keyword in your implementation to have the compiler create compliant accessor for you

2242855
vmware	esx
eucalyptus right now supports xen kvm and even to an extent vmware esx as a hypervisor

2242918

mouseup	mousedown
basically the idea is to remove the label on right-click mousedown so that the desired field is hit by the mouseup event and therefore fires up the context menu on the relevant field

2243134
implements	extends
this won t work out of the box with all validators - you may need to extends your validation framework of choice to implements a similar approach

2243274
des	aes
you can use an symmetric key algorithm aes des triple-des to perform an encryption on your code and store it a hex in your database in a nvarchar field

2243274
rsa	aes
but irrespective of which algorithm you use you would need to make sure your keys are as secure as possible your symmetric key for aes and your private key for rsa etc

2243276
opera	firefox
why should an opera user have to download code specific to firefox when there is no chance at all that she will ever need it

2243276
opera	firefox
for example it generates a different version of the application file for firefox than it does for opera

2243286
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2243288
rss	feed
a good website to track is smashing magazine i keep the rss feed on my igoogle page as the regularly have articles along the lines of 50 beautiful free icon sets for your next design

2243296
width	height
this gives you some flexability in terms of setting dynamic height and width at runtime

2243334
post	get
this i assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data

2243345
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code works great on safari and on google-chrome mac but when i tried it on firefox 3.5.7 i got a weird 406 not acceptable error

2243411
sctp	tcp
i had already rewrote and tested the original tcp client in perl so i switched it to sctp and was able to connect although piping a file on stdin didn t completely work hung about 2 3 s of the way through receiving the echo s back

2243411
sctp	tcp
it seems like unp is implying that porting tcp applications to sctp to take advantage of multi-homing is trivial yet based this simple attempt that doesn t really seem to be the case

2243411
sctp	tcp
can anyone point me to a good tutorial or give good advice on any gotcha s to watch out for when porting tcp apps to one-to-one-style sctp to take advantage of multi-homing

2243444
int	chars
i remember reading somewhere that it is better to use int as loop counter variables rather than chars or short

2243465
rtp	rtcp
however if i remember rtp timestamps have a different baseline in each stream so you need to use the rtcp packets to convert rtp timestamps to absolute ntp time and then convert ntp to directshow using your initial baseline baseline ntp dshow stream time now + 300ms

2243493
filewriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	printwriter	printwriter	bufferedwriter

2243505
superclass	subclassing
i.e i mean static variable of superclass can we access in subclassing without creating object n without using classname

2243527
int	chars
you re much more likely to have an off-by-one error in your loop bounds than a measurable difference in speed or code size by changing the type of the loop counter between int chars or short

2243586
datediff	difference
or you can use datediff in mysql to get the difference

2243607
min	max

for-loop	while-loop
i want to substitute the for-loop with a while-loop so that i can check if the row is null or not

2243696
post	get
the post does mean the values are posted but you should add them as post variables while now you are only adding them to the url so you can only get them with _request and _get

2243717
implements	extends
note that the invoker extends splobjectstorage so it implements countable iterator traversable serializable and arrayaccess

2243722
maven	m2e
i m having maven project on eclipse with m2e plugin

2243726
post	get
even if it is a post request php can still access any get variables added on as a query string

2243726
post	get
but since looks for request variables in get and post and any cookies passed in the request you see the variable as it was passed via the query string

2243734
post	get
since they already have some sort of web infrastructure going this should be easy - describe the interface as a set of urls that you can post to and get from

2246633
accessor	properties
the only time you should access properties directly is when you are writing an accessor

it s certainly possible to build a workaround by building own getter and setter functions and keeping a table of which property is private public protected but it s hardly worth the effort anymore is it

2250157
printf	strncpy
you can retrieve the string in using printf or strncpy

2250191
put	get
for other problems that i want to solve with a concurrenthashmap with garbage collection i would use a strong reference in the hashmap as the key to get equals equality and a softreference as the value so the jvm can garbage collect something but in this case the value doesn t matter and i don t have a value to wrap in a softreference to put there

width	height
if there are 10 images it loops through and uses getimagesize to find width and height

2250825
width	height
if there are 10 images it loops through and uses fread and imagecreatefromstring to find width and height for speed

2250825
width	height
once all width and height are worked out it loops through and only adds the images to a new array that have a minimum width and height so only larger images are shown smaller images are less likely to be descriptive of the url

2250825
width	height	gif	png
one solution i have found is being able to retrieve the image width and height from the header of the image without having to download the whole image though i have only found some code to do this for jpg s it would need to support gif png

you can always cast a enumeration value to another type as long as you truncate the value by casting to a smaller type nsuinteger to unsigned short

2251067
for-loop	loops
you can actually do the trick by enclosing an already obtained iterator in an iterable object so the for-loop got what it needs and you can get a hasnext method inside loops

you have to indicate their presence through getter and setter just like you did

2251613
nsfilewrapper	nsdocument
you can create a file wrapper containing all the files for your document bundle using the various methods of nsfilewrapper and then you would implement the -filewrapperoftype error method of nsdocument in order to handle saving

if you place an alias to the directory in your domain folder and apache is configured to follow aliases you should be fine

2252060
int	chars
according to the ansi c standards a chars gets promoted to an int in the context where int are used you used a int format specifier in the printf hence the different values

2252087
int	chars
th c standard says that a chars literal like a is of type int not type chars

win64	windows
i m sure you ll get the concept from there this totally avoids the vb-runtime atl issues and uses the windows scripting host which is available on every major win32 win64 platform

2252452
getter	setter
both getter and setter functions are guarded with locks

2252497
getter	setter
but if it is just an int and you are sure that int is an atomic type the processor will not have to do two separate memory reads to load the int into a register and you have benchmarked the performance and determined you need better performance then you may consider dropping the lock from both the getter and the setter

2252497
getter	setter
if you need to do something like that the mutex protection has to be outside the setter getter functions

2252549
super	self
the code that i assume throws the ioerror is being run after you call the super picture self .save method

2252558
google-chrome	safari

why use getter and setter

2252573
getter	setter
why use getter and setter

2252585
direct3d	direct2d
if your going for graphics eg for a game rather than a fully functional gui thing you might also look at things like direct2d direct3d opengl sdl etc

2252604
getter	setter
a classic example is one of coordinates - if you have a coordinate represented via cartesian coordinates and switch the internal representation to polar if you used getter and setter your program would still work even though the x and y fields are gone

2252614
getter	setter
if your class has a getter setter

2252617
getter	setter
if you make a field private and set up a getter and a setter to access it then all other code has to go through those methods to get at that data

2252617
getter	setter
you get these same benefits within the class too if you strictly use the getter and setter to access the field

2252617
getter	setter
getter and setter initially don t look so great because they seem like a lot of extra typing

2252617
getter	setter
but ides like eclipse can automatically make getter and setter for you if you like

2252617
getter	setter
c# can wrap getter and setter in properties which are used in code just like fields but under the hood it calls the getter and setter that you write

2252617
getter	setter
so there are a lot of reasons to use getter and setter and many facilities to make it less painful

2252656
postgresql	mysql
oracle postgresql and mysql have it

2252670

use the intersection s height or width as the amount to revert

2252693
width	height
i m trying to read the width and height of a locally loaded image

2252782
uiview	subviews
if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews

2252787
cout	cin
the one i would use is switch to using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout

2252808

2252894
accessor	properties
all answers below were helpfull and on the right path to finding the problem in multi-threaded apps however the first answer definitly emphasized recursion as the problem which is what it turned out to be although it wasn t one of the properties accessor as seemed obvious

2252902
rss	feed
if you are consuming content like an rss feed you will have to hold the records from last check and compare those with new entries if they have been reviewd

2253157
uiview	calayer
use hittest to dispatch touches you receive on you uiview to the calayer instance that needs to receive it

2253157
uiview	subviews
if you need more of the uiresponder behavior touchesbegan etc. you might want to go with subviews instead of sublayers as that would allow you to handle the events directly in the objects rather than having to dispatch them from a central responder your main uiview

2253157
uiview	subviews
if it makes more sense to put the behavior into the buttons themselves they shoudl be uiresponders and as such subclass uiview and be added as subviews of your main view

2253158

put the jlabel and jtextfield in that vertically

2253488
put	get
you put key value or get key that gives a value

2253506
post	get
secondly get requests should be safe simply cause data to be displayed with no changes made and post should be used for all data altering requests

2253522
onbeforeunload	onload
in ie i get notified in flash with the onload message but not onbeforeunload

folder	directory
now create a group in xcode for every of those folder and drag each of the new settings.bundle directory to the corresponding group

2253636
onreadystatechange	onload
when onload is triggered the anonymous onload function is called - which appears to be very similar to the onreadystatechange handler

2253645
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature

2253664
put	get
using a hash would just make you put the addresses in buckets in my opinion and then you d get to the right bucket quickly and then have to search through the bucket

2253676
rss	feed
instead of minidom i have used celementtree to parse the rss feed

2253682
folder	directory
i already included the aspnet_client folder in my virtual directory in iis

where as if i launch twitterthread cron jobs are not running

2253725
children	parent
instead the parent of mychildwindow is myrootwindow2 - but to make this complete enumerating the children of myrootwindow2 does not yield mychildwindow

2253725
children	parent
now i used getparent and enumchildwindows to get the parent or children for a given hwnd and i assumed that this relationship is symmetrical

2253751
goto	break
popular statements for terminating a language loop are break continue goto return throw and exit

you d better use strcpy or strncpy if you are not absolutely sure what are you doing by using shared memory

2254071
put	get
i am not sure about iis6 but i created a new website in iis7 i could not get things to work under a virtual directory but that is probably my lack of iis knowledge i put my .svc file in the root directory and in services

2254143
folder	directory
any way to click on something that adds whole project to scm subersion and also makes it a working directory by adding .svn folder

2254158
rsa	dsa
rsa or dsa keys so it returns either

2254217
entities	entitymanager
as ruggs said if you are managing the entitymanager lifecycle yourself as opposed to having cmp container managed persistence done by a j2ee then you need to close the entitymanager yourself or at least call entitymanager.clear to detach entities

2254217
entities	entitymanager
all the entities that load persist through an entitymanager stay in memory until you explicitly detach the entities from it via entitymanager.detach or entitymanager.clear or entitymanager.close

2254217
entities	entitymanager
if you persist 1000000 entities via the same entitymanager without detaching them after you will get a oome doesn t matter if you persist each entity in it s own entitytransaction

2254220
hash	md5
what is the best way to generate an md5 or any other hash of a multi-dimensional array

2254251

i use a prepare statement and then execute it with parameters

2254303
boost	stl
most implementations of the stl and most of boost of course takes advantage of this to the fullest

2254409
getter	setter
if these are member variables and you still want to access them individually but pack them into a struct don t forget you can make the struct private and write simple getter setter functions for accessing the individual values

2254419
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
ruby people are using a language that s already pretty functional and they re using it on a number of underlying runtimes jruby ironruby mri macruby rubinius etc...

2254451
getter	setter
second if you want to add any custom logic to your getter and setter you have no choice

2254462
getter	setter
c# 2.0 does not support this and requires the private variable with the explicit getter and setter

2254462
getter	setter
therefore a lot of older code or backwards compatible code will use the explicit getter and setter

2254549
int	chars
chars aren t numbers in clojure though it s easy to cast them into chars with the int function

2254590
udp	tcp
there are downsides - udp transmission is not reliable or guaranteed in the same way as tcp

2254607
versioning	upgrade
due to complicated office policy reasons i must not upgrade or modify my versioning of ajaxcontroltoolkit but for anyone else who has this error it was apparently fixed as of last june

2254627
folder	directory
is there a program that i can use to compare two folder and have it mark which files are modified and export those files to a new directory

2254685
ggplot2	lattice
now you can use lattice or ggplot2 to make plots

2254689
button	checkbox
for some reason it took two clicks to bind the form with the checkbox values so the onchange simulated the first click and the regular button is the second

2254697
width	height
lets say for example that these are my rectangles constructor takes the arguments x y width height

2254721
int	boolean
it converts the boolean to an int and it works .

2254734
javassist	cglib
another similar example is hibernate that lets you choose between cglib and javassist in hibernate-core in the same way

2254763
folder	directory
applicationwillterminate method of your app delegate simply store content of that dictionary to plist somewhere under you app directory structure documents folder is a good choice

2254766
button	checkbox
i m at a bit of a loss on how to proceed without massive rework of the vb6 content to change the options button to checkbox

2254809
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t make any sense because i can login with firefox and google-chrome successfully

2254839
google-chrome	firefox
it is odd that firefox and google-chrome are not throwing the yellow screen of death

2254849
isapi	httpmodule
i inherited a very antiquated c++ isapi filter that secures a classic asp website and was tasked with the job of creating an httpmodule to directly replace it

2254955
mouse	keyboard
how can i determine idle time in python on linux meaning no keyboard or mouse activity for the past few seconds or minutes

2254966
glut	glfw	glut	fltk	glfw	fltk
a couple of alternatives to glut both apparently in active development are glfw and fltk

2254966
glut	glfw
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle

2254966
glut	fltk
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself

2254966
ati	nvidia
edit2 when if you decide you want to play around with shaders both amd ati and nvidia have developer web pages

2254978
hex	binary
try looking at the text file in a binary hex editor - i suspect you ll find that every other byte is 0

2255009
hmac	md5
you could append the secret to timestamp instead of pre-pending but in general you are better off using hmac with sha1 digest hmac is just construction and can use md5 or sha as digest algorithms

2255038
restrict	shared
all accounts would shared the single database but each one would need to be able to restrict access to their data

2255064
maven	pom.xml
you can do this fairly easily from within maven using the surefire plugin i usually clean compile install my projects from the command line before comparing them for eclipse usage mvn eclipse clean eclipse eclipse and you can define a test suite in your pom.xml which lists all the tests you want to run en masse every time you run mvn install

2255073
post	get
verbs limit to get post

2255081
put	get
put the keywords together to get

2255081
put	get
put the keywords together to get

2255130
children	parent
also as a side question is there a better way to navigate to the .menuitem part instead of going parent - children - children

2255163
actionscript	mxml
i always thought that separating the ui from the logic is the way to go like the use of class files in flash cs3 cs4 or mvc in web frameworks but recently there are plenty of examples and posts using actionscript embedded in mxml

2255166
uiswitch	uibutton
or as an alternative the other way round an uibutton with uiswitch functionality

2255169
button	checkbox
i m having a problem with getting my radio button laid out and checkbox correctly in ie8

2255169
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera all working however

2255192
entities	entitymanager
best so far add the base project s entities package in the persistence.xml using the class tag as explained in hibernate entitymanager s setup documentation

2255222
actionscript	mxml
in my experience there s not much of a difference whether you write a component in actionscript + mxml or solely in actionscript

2255232
int	chars
however to use flood fill i would use a matrix of int because you might have more areas than the max value of a chars

2255240
int	double
works only for basic types like int double ulong etc

2255241
min	max
min max

2255249
width	height
also to make it as efficient as possible don t resize your images using style tags or inline width height but instead use something like php gd or imagemagick to actually make thumbnails in the sizes you need to display

2255263
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
and again clojure is much more pragmatic than both other functional languages like haskell and other lisp like scheme and much simpler and more modern than commonlisp so it is a natural fit for rubyists

2255269
gridview	objectdatasource
i m using an ods objectdatasource backed-up with a linq-to-sql class to populate gridview on my page

2255321
filesystems	fat
to install mingw on fat filesystems

2255330
actionscript	mxml
whatever you do though remember that if you are merely calling a separate script file for an mxml component foo.mxml calls foo.as for its actionscript you are losing the code highlighting feature that helps you work between the mxml and the actionscript

2255346
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
to debug use firebug in firefox or webinspector that build-in in safari and google-chrome

2255380
hide	show
just show the image before you start the ajax call and then in your ajax success or complete handler hide it

2255422
getter	setter
or should dtos be pure data containers with no additional methods other than getter setter

2255433
getter	setter
dtos should not have behaviour they are mere containers for transporting data across process boundries and should consist of setter getter only

2255442
hide	show
in beforesend callback you have to show the spinner and in complete you have to hide it

2255459
put	get
go get jstl 1.2 here and drop it in web-inf lib after removing any old jstl libraries jstl.jar and standard.jar and the eventual extracted contents some poor tutorials namely suggests that you need to extract the .tld files and put it in classpath this is wrong

2255483
folder	directory
apart from the vs2010 ide you may also run your tests with echo a powerful console application located in the bin folder of the gallio installation directory icarus winform application with a nice ui

2255483
teamcity	nant
you can also invoke the test runner from one of the numerous extensions of gallio for msbuild nant teamcity etc

2255509
ubuntu	linux
edit i m using linux ubuntu 9.10 and python 2.6.2

2255515
maven	pom.xml
assuming you re using maven add this dependency to your pom.xml

2255553
put	get
the queue itself has a limit of 10 entries and once that limit is reached no more packets will get put onto the queue

2255553
packets	multicast
as an alternative you could route these multicast packets in userspace using by receiving them on a raw socket and then forwarding them out whatever interface you like

2255572
for-loop	arrays
first of all i wouldn t use for-in i d use a simple for-loop to iterate over the arrays

2255586
button	checkbox
i m trying my best to figure out a succinct straightforward widget using standard ui widgets available in any toolkit checkbox radio button or listboxes that could model a true false null value

2255592
geocoding	geocode
according to the google maps docs the google maps api provides a client geocode for geocoding addresses

2255630
ssl	https
a have a perl cron job that recently started having its https connections start failing with an error of 500 ssl read timeout

2255650
rss	feed
ie i have a rss reader widget that passes the rss feed i m reading from

2255650
width	height
i have a chart that gets the width and height and the sproc from the custom data passed in

2255716
innodb	myisam
ok so i had to use various table types like black hole merge innodb and myisam in just the right laces

2255723
equals	compareto
if this were my code i d start with comparing the equals compareto and hashcode implementations with the database definitions - if these methods compare more fields than the database requires for uniqueness hibernate might consider two objects to be different even if they end up using the same key in the database

2255751
try-catch	exception-handling
apparently chrome won t pause on the exception-handling if it s inside a try-catch block though

2255778
directx	gdi
on windows you can use the gdi or directx apis to load images to memory

2255778
tiff	png
boost.gil which apparently has support for jpeg png and tiff files.

2255797
range	min
in any case to answer your question on fminbnd and quad you could set a c t a b xmin and xmax the last two are the range you want to look for the min over and use

2255822
folder	directory
to see if a path is a folder directory use nsfilemanager s -fileexistsatpath isdirectory

2255842
intersect	contains
one result point contains the intersection location if they do intersect or if they are coincident at one point

2255898
width	height
if i wasn t clear before i need for the width to be fixed and the cell height that contains the long text to be enlarged and display the text in 2 lines

2255935
inherited	properties
note that it is almost always a bad idea to actually use this in 99 of cases the data template should take care of hooking up related controls by setting their properties or it is better handled with attached inherited properties

2255938
implements	extends
you can optionally also let your servlet both extends httpservlet and implements servletcontextlistener like follows

2255954
kde	gnome
you can look at how nautilus gnome or konqueror kde generate previews for various file types

2256037
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
second in straight javascript you can call getelementbyid to verify it exists or getelementsbytagname to loop through all the divs and count the number that match your criteria

2256045
post	get
so in order for this to work out we are having to post data to that script since using a get the max size of the url is exceeded at times

2256055
put	get
well i don t really get the point just don t put anything in the session if you don t want to use it

2256077
expander	grid
there is a way to make it appear that a single expander has separate layout for its header and content so they can be in separate grid cells or even totally separate parts of the window

2256114
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this works perfectly however in ie and google-chrome the button jumps to the top of the page and then animates to position instead of animating from where it started from

2256165
width	height
if the document you are transcoding doesn t have have a attribute then the and attributes will be used so the aoi will be 0 0 width height

2256200
vmware	virtualbox
i suppose you could run your jvm within a virtualized environment virtualbox vmware instance with one processor allocated but i m not sure that that gets you what you want

2256220
calloc	malloc
what is the advantage of zeroing out memory calloc over malloc

2256230
16-bit	64bit
i don t recall if we ever found a runaway program but the values corresponding to 0xcc in various values 52 428 unsigned 16 bit -19 660 signed 16-bit -107374176 32-bit float and -9.25596313493e+61 64bit float popped up in a lot of unexpected places

2256232
width	height
will not let me scale my .swf to 100 width and 100 height

2256232
width	height
width is fine but the height is not

2256245
content-length	content-type
even when the content-type and content-length is wrong safari just downloads the file

2256282
calloc	malloc
without telling you my personal preference 1 if you belong to the first camp you would want to calloc instead of malloc

2256282
calloc	malloc
if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc

2256282
calloc	malloc
if you belong to the initialize everything camp you don t calloc but malloc because you are initializing floating-point numbers or pointers and you know that all bits zero doesn t necessarily mean 0 for them

2256290
rss	feed
should i maybe read from a rss feed

2256320
config	ini
keep the config details in a separate protected ini file or even the php.ini file and you can pretty much ignore the server-side scripting after that

2256324
accessor	properties
also notice that properties class is slightly modified to include a get accessor to return the object in question.

2256326
width	height
the new browser appears the correct height and width but the left and top attributes are ignored so the window appears top-left

2256329
for-loop	loops
gcc not only figured out we were doing a for-loop but also realized it was to be run a constant number of times did loops for us at compile time chucked out i and sum and hard coded the answer - 55

2256334
width	height
in my css i set the width and height of the image to 100 so that each image would proportionally fill the canvas

2256338
mouse	keyboard
it s important to think about workflow how commonly used the control would be whether you can replace it with direct manipulation whether a visible indication of its state is necessary whether it s operable from the keyboard and mouse where appropriate and so forth

2256346
nsurl	nsstring
use the -stringbyaddingpercentescapesusingencoding method on nsstring before passing it to nsurl

2256350
gridview	sqldatasource
that way your sqldatasource control will execute the select when databinding the existing gridview not the copy

2256377
put	get	stdout	fflush
when you put it at the beginning of the line you end up with stdout not being fflush so you get multiple printouts when the parent and child processes both fflush their output buffers

2256400
fadein	fadeout
the normal behavior when using fadein and fadeout is to use the display property

2256400
fadein	fadeout
how can i make fadein and fadeout not modify the layout of the page

2256403
int	chars
in c you have data types chars short int long that can all be used to store int of various sizes

2256403
16-bit	64bit
i ll ignore long long for this discussion. let s say for sake of generality that on a given 32-bit platform the sizes are 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit respectively

2256403
integer	unsigned
now how could you store a larger integer that cannot be stored in an unsigned 64-bit long

2256423
hash	md5
i want to truncate an md5 hash to about half size

2256430
width	height
by taking half of the height and width 100 and 75 respectively you can pinpoint the center of the window

2256435
put	get
when i put the array value in front of the time variable i get the incorrect time

2256454
hash	md5
following the table posted on the above link assuming your digests are 64 bits each since a single md5 hash is 128 bits and that md5 have a uniform distribution there is a very low chance that two hash will collide

2256460
folder	directory
in this case the working folder would actually be the lower directory

2256479
tolower	uppercase
further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters

2256548
addition	multiplication
if you work through this sequence of questions you should be able to write a function for each step and re-use those functions to answer the later questions and end up with a very simple and unoptimized long well up to maxdigit digits integer package for addition and multiplication of positive numbers

2256578
width	height
if your layout is fixed which means you have defined width height then the min- max- rules will be ignored as the width height have precedence over those

2256579
post	get
if i post the form with nothing entered in any of the fields i consistently get a value of true for modelstate.isvalid

2256581
inherited	properties
the concept of cascading style sheets is that there are rules that dictate other rules up and down the chain hence the inclusion of inherited as a properties

2256581
min	max
for example if you use a container div and you specify an max and min then you would need to recalculate every time you adjust a div underneath it for example if you wanted the header to be wider

2256590
post	get
the possible methods are get in the url or post not

2256592
sharepoint	splist
versioning information is a property of the splist class even though only document libraries can use versioning in sharepoint

2256611
rss	feed
once you have all these elements just verify that your call to the youtube api returns an rss feed because with the standard atom feed it doesn t work at all and give a try to the following code

2256616
int	double
for example they use different units of measure pixels versus fixed 96dpi different coordinate types int vs double different rules for line drawing different rotations different brushesm immediate vs retained mode etc

2256622
nsstring	nsdata
those can then contain nsstring objects and other objects like nsdate and nsdata etc but what you re asking for is not possible

2256625
nsstring	nsdata
touch json parses nsdata instead of nsstring

2256684
post	get
a page has a modal popup which uses a javascript to post or get and receive html back mdash

2256818
fadein	fadeout
effetcs like slidedown fadein fadeout dont work with ie but works good with google chrome

2256842

folder	directory
i ve placed the file in a directory outside my public_html folder

2258018
folder	directory
what you need to do is define it as an application folder adding a virtual directory does this by default so that s why it works

2258018
folder	directory
as to why application folder are necessary i believe it s a way of forcing you to choose which application pool you want the application running in rather than having every sub directory application running off the same pool by default

2258054

each key must be an int the codepoint of a unicode chars

2258321
post	get
i know you need to override to_param and have map.resources post with requirements option set but i cannot get it all to work

2258329
translation	transliteration
if you use the translation method of unicode objects as i recommended in answer to another question of yours everything s done automatically for you exactly as you desire each unicode character c whose codepoints ord c is not in the transliteration dictionary is simply passed unchanged from input to output just as you want

2258346

2258620
postorder	inorder
if you have an inorder traversal and a postorder traversal for a general binary tree they don t even define the tree uniquely if you can have duplicated values the sequence 1 1 1 for both postorder and inorder can be one of the following trees

2258620
postorder	inorder
suppose you have a postorder traversal list x1 x2 ... xn and inorder traversal list y1 ... yk ... yn so that xn yk

2258620
postorder	inorder
the inorder traversal is 9 3 2 5 6 4 1 and the postorder 9 2 3 4 1 6 5

2258620
postorder	inorder
in the inorder 6 4 1 the left-subtree is empty and the right is 4 1 so from the postorder list 4 1 6 you take as the left-subtree and 4 1 as the right subtree

2258657
width	height
is flexible layout means only to give width height and font in em or

2258657
width	height
and if we make flexible layout then should be give images width and height in em or also to images scale along with layout div and font size

width	height
you may want to create your own width height constants if you need specific base numbers for scaling etc

2258701

you can use the setter and getter of class a

2258913
public	protected
you have make it protected or have protected public method that has access to them

2258956
public	protected
i would have listed them public private protected package private with an explanation of each

2258956
getter	setter
then gone on to say that class a would need to be modified to allow access to those members from class b either by adding setter and getter or by changing the access modifiers of the members

2258961
waitpid	posix
you need to pick up the process number hopefully from system my c posix api knowledge is rusty and then check up on it probably with a call to something like wait or waitpid with non-blocking turned on

2259000
put	get	hide	show
just put it in your sources or if you want to hide it a little further get the array with an ajax call and make the call show nothing when it s not called with ajax the array can still be revealed with developper browser plugins or with being hacked adding extra headers

2259020
getter	setter
by using public accessors getter setter of a s privates members .

elementfrompoint x y works fine with firefox but seems to fail with opera returning always the whole svg and not the particular element

2259615
int	chars
32-bit int are at least wide enough to solve the code point problem but they still don t handle corner cases upcasing something can change the number of chars

2259641
int	double
i thought this would take out the double occurrence of this but it returns a list of each word int he phrase

2259649
equals	gethashcode
note that if you decide to implement your own version of equals you also need to correctly implement gethashcode

2259680
agile	sprint
in other words scrum like all agile methods requires active customer involvement and if your customer isn t there for the demo of the product you re developing for him if he s not there for the sprint planning meeting if he isn t available to answer questions in other words if he s not involved your implementation of scrum will very likely be suboptimal i m extrapolating about the other points but i wonder how you will handle them with a remote customer

global mouse and keyboard library

2259728

i ve searched for examples for this but the ones i ve ran across seem to focus on simpler stuff like setting the inkcanvas defaultdrawingattributes such as width height color etc

2259803
textview	imageview
in the adapter for the listview i return a linearlayout in which i add a checkbox a imageview and a textview

2259803

kde	gnome
the user experience will be determined by gnome or kde not the distro

2259852
kde	gnome
there are two desktops gnome and kde

2259852
kde	gnome
in general you can choose gnome or kde with any distro and you can even install both

2259852
kde	gnome
now if you went and installed say netbsd then you might notice some real differences although you would still have your choice of gnome or kde

2259882
openbsd	freebsd
give openbsd or perhaps freebsd a chance

2259889
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

2259896
yacc	sablecc	yacc	bison	bison	sablecc
if you absolutely must have an ll 1 grammar then you obviously will need to press on if you get into a situation like this but if you re allowed to use parser generators like yacc bison or sablecc then you will in the long run most likely find it a lot easier to go down that route

2259907
ddms	adb
i don t know how to trigger the debugger but did you look at the stack trace when the error occurred either in eclipse ddms if it was already running or using the adb logcat command

2260107
int	chars
kind of like yylineno except that it returns the chars position as an int

2260117
punctuation	words
using the split method of strings as another answer suggests would not identify words but space-separated chunks that may include punctuation

2260117
punctuation	words
this re -based solution does identify words letters and digits net of punctuation

2260130
rar	zip
a password-protected rar or zip file would be as good a method as any

2260133
mouseleave	mouseenter
here is a possible solution but you can t use hoverintent with it because it needs the events to bubble and mouseenter and mouseleave events don t bubble

2260142
width	height
this code should draw the test rectangles only when the height is less than the width and otherwise the window should remain clear

2260144
centos	linux
i decided that i greatly preferred using os x or centos linux for ruby development

2260205
width	height
why are the height and width attributes for the img element permitted

2260217
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you change ienumerable to iqueryable then source.where would also return an iqueryable when called and seeing as source itself would be an iqueryable the whole return statement would succeed in either case

2260229
for-loop	arrays
.findall should be faster it takes advantage of already knowing the list s size and looping through the internal arrays with a simple for-loop

2260239
width	height
if you are doing a catalogue type pdf it will be best to ensure your images are manually sized in the cfml to a certain height and width

tortoisegit	svn
some research turned up the git svn command and that tortoisegit claims to have some level of git-svn support

2260283
tortoisegit	svn
so i m hoping someone out there can provide a reasonably detailed set of instructions on how to correctly use tortoisegit with an existing svn repository with the repository on either the local filesystem or on a remote server

2260283
tortoisegit	svn
if you feel tortoisegit s svn support isn t mature enough to make this work that would also be useful information

2260292
hide	show
this will properly show hide each element regardless of the number of times the user changes the selection

2260292
hide	show
if the server returns 1 it ll show #one and hide #two

2260292
hide	show
vice-versa if the server returns 2 it ll show #two and hide #one

versioning	upgrade
i champion versioning the database metadata and having scripts to upgrade from versioning n to versioning n+1

2260300
versioning	upgrade
at deployment the application can check the current deployed versioning and it then runs all the upgrade scripts that bring the versioning to current

2260300
versioning	upgrade
there is no script to deploy straight the current versioning a new deployment deploys first v0 of the database it then goes through all versioning upgrade including dropping object that are no longer used

2260300
versioning	upgrade
as simple text scripts all the database upgrade scripts are stored in versioning control just like any other sources with tracking of changes diff-ing and check-in reviews

but i noticed that it only displays textbox and textarea field names and it doesnt include checkbox and radio field names through this submission

2260422
width	height
using the width and height attribute on an tag representing an icon at size 16x16 makes semantic sense as it is important to understand the meaning of the tag an icon can have different representations depending on the size it is displayed at

2260425
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button work a little differently than your standard inputs

form elements have traditionally had a width height that includes their padding border because they were originally implemented by browsers as os-native ui widgets where css had no influence over the decorations

2260872
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
to reproduce this behaviour firefox and others render some form fields select button input-type-button with the css3 box-sizing style set to border-box so that the width property reflects the entire rendered area width including the border and padding

2260872
width	border-box
or which is more common for liquid form layouts where you want to use â 100 â width you can set the others to border-box .

2263991
keydown	keyup
it turns out that on keyup keydown the ascii uppercase non-shifted version of a key is always returned

2263991
keydown	keyup
pressing shift+a counts as two keydown events when the keys are pressed down and two keyup event when the keys are released

2263991
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup return the value of a single key while ignoring any key combinations

2263991
keydown	keyup
so somewhere along the line the browser is taking the lowercase a ascii code 97 transforming it to uppercase a then passing it keydown keyup as the non-shifted character

the categories can be expanded contracted to show or hide the bookmarks for that category

2264140
hide	show
for each category there s a div with an image of a folder in it that will show or hide the next element in the dom which would be the collection of bookmarks usually a ul

2264140
hide	show
i select the element to close using where the div around the image the user clicks on has a class of categoryline and the thing to show hide is the element following that div

2264144

in .net winforms i want to display message in a status bar and suspend the program execution until user moves mouse or presses keyboard

2264231
client-side	server-side
dataannotations are a useful feature of asp.net mvc 2 it really does provide a nice cheap way to get both server-side and client-side validation

2264320
post	get
on release post will send to each element release which will decrement ref count to 1 so elements does not get deallocated and you end up with memory leak

2264388
getter	setter
i have formbean class with customername date amount rate etc with setter and getter for the field members

2264399
folder	directory
if you are using applescript would it be possible to attach a folder action to the volumes directory or maybe the specific subdirectory on which the kindle mounts to back up the files

2264413
folder	directory
you could either use applescript and attach a folder action to the volumes directory or you could write a launch agent that watches that path

2264571
rss	feed
i have one table with users and another table with rss feed urls

2264584
textarea	input-field
i now create a new div in which i place the new input-field so each textarea which has a tinymce editor is in his own div

2264647
waitpid	fork
when invoking fork 2 or waitpid 2

2264664
put	get
you would need to put in appropriate constants to for various terms to try to get the acceptance rate around 50

2264679

2264801
ncover	nant
we had a similar problem with attribute exclusion when we triggered ncover 1.5.8 from nant

2264994
freemarker	velocity
i suggest using a template engine such as freemarker for this or velocity but freemarker is better imo

2265109
width	height
firstly the width and height attributes of an input should be integers rather than length values

2265109
width	height
secondly and this is what s causing the problem as you can prove by changing the input type to image width and height attributes are only appropriate and only affect rendering in the browser for inputs of type image

2265116
getter	setter
methods can be virtual so when you declare a virtual property you are declaring virtual getter and setter methods

2265124
awt	swing
i d avoid reusing any names declared in at least java.lang java.io java.util and java.net along with the common classes used in awt swing jdbc and a few other subsystems

second for...in iterates over all enumerable properties of an object including those inherited from its prototype

2265234
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am developing a web api with 10 tables or so in the backend with several one-to-many and many-to-many associations

2265234
getter	setter
since the queries are tied directly to the api and its business logic they are hard to generalize like getter and setter

2265293
portrait	landscape
ideally i would like to eventually develop an ipad version of the app where the grid would be 3 items wide in portrait and 4 in landscape however for the time being i would like 2 items wide in portrait and 3 wide in landscape

2265378
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as such this sounds like a perfect use-case for a uinavigationcontroller with two uiviewcontroller if you would like to use proper and standard iphone mvc design

2265413
width	height
note prior to iphone os 3.0 uiview instances may have a maximum height and width of 1024 x 1024

2265434
button	checkbox
i m confused on how i should treat this with js off - should i just enable radio button or checkbox and have the user select with radio button per room

2265443
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
and the documentation for listadapter lists simplecursoradapter as one of its own indirect subclasses

2265478
strstr	substr
the key is to use string manipulatin functions such as strstr strpos and substr

2265491
rss	feed
i would recommend using rss feed to extract content

2265534
ant	maven
an alternative to maven if you just want to use ant is ivy

2265608
next	except
button next to the property value - nothing happens except this button disappears

2265608
ubuntu	linux
new discoveries i found out that it might not even be an android problem but a general eclipse problem that i can see with all version ganymede galileo helios on my linux ubuntu system

2265633
int	chars
you want it seems to pass a data structure consisting of 1 int and 1 string which you pass by passing the location of the first chars in the string from one process to another

2265635
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you move through 3 uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller

2265748
public	protected
remember that a protected member is essentially just a slightly more restricted public member since it can be accessed by client code as long as it s in a descendant class

2265768
public	protected
1st one is fine in your 2nd sample using public protected you just break that.

2265770
getter	setter
second example is an automatic property and is generally used when you don t have any logic in getter and setter

2265774
getter	setter
for the most part in applications i ve written if the getter and setter aren t more complicated than your examples you probably want to minimize the code as much as possible for readability so the shorthand approach is very useful

2265774
getter	setter
on the other hand if you implement more complicated logic in the getter and setter for example validation or parsing of some sort you want to make sure that no user class bypasses your logic

2265774
public	protected
you know the difference between private protected and public and thus you also know what you can and cannot do with your class depending on which one you choose

2265776
prepare	execute
but before the business logic was execute those controls was either blank or contained dummy-text prepare for translation

2265780
post	put
without the line breaks of course i put them in this post only to

2265820
getter	setter
write automatic properties nâº 2 as the default unless your getter setter has some kind of logic in it otherwise the property or the field is there for nothing - you have to agree that a public property that direct accesses its private field is the same as a public field or auto-propeprty

2265847
inherited	subclassing	tax	shipping
for example if the discount and the tax and the shipping method all varied depending on the type of item then it s definitely time to consider inherited and subclassing where you d say this subtype of item has this tax and this discount and this shipping

2265852
objectdatasource	formview
currently i have a dropdownlist inside a formview databound to an objectdatasource

2265867

you must configure the uilabel inside the uibutton to support multiple line

2266121
mockups	balsamiq
for mockups the simplest and easiest to use is balsamiq

2266181
mediarecorder	audiorecord
this is why i use the class audiorecord and not the mediarecorder records only to file

2266213
listview	gridview
the listview s view is based on the gridview one of the column contains a checkbox

2266218

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my app i have an uitabbarcontroller with uinavigationcontroller initialized like this

2266300
hide	show
the navigation item is not null because i can call and it hide the backbutton every time but the title isn t show

2266304
int	double
but as long as the warnings are about things that are handled identically by both compilers such as int double conversions it can be ignored

2266437
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
i have a listactivity binding to a database with a custom simplecursoradapter

2266442
wcf	openrasta
this is purely my ho but i strongly recommend you to try out openrasta instead of added-as-an-afterthought-to-a-rpc-based-framework rest support in wcf

2266548
sharepoint	splist
i have an splist item in sharepoint and i want to find out the size on disk of the list

2266554
post	get
in other words it seems that i lose the post data as soon as i pass the get request for another page back to my views

2266555
hide	show
simply handle the event and resize hide show your controls

2266642
realloc	malloc
after freeing it can i initialize it to null and make it point to some new location using malloc or realloc

2266642
realloc	malloc
the reason i used realloc in place of malloc is because all my realloc calls are in a loop so instead of sizeof node in the second argument it is actually n sizeof node where n keeps on incrementing.

2266649
folder	directory
i need to create a file directory in the common application data folder that will be shared across all accounts

2266649
folder	directory
if i create the file directory as admin i have no problem but if i create the file directory as a user the file directory goes into the virtualized folder for the user s account

2266653
realloc	malloc
and since realloc acts like malloc when it s passed a null pointer it should work just fine

2266663
powermockito	jmockit
you could use powermockito or jmockit

2266677
stdout	stderr
here is the stdout and stderr

2266716
post	put
btw i wouldn t put too much faith in that blog post you ve linked to claiming that typed groovy is much faster than untyped groovy

2266756
pop-up	dialog
i am fiddling around with a dialog that pop-up and displays an alarm information

2266784
powermockito	jmockit
if you are testing the dependant item then you can mock the singleton using powermockito and jmockit

2266796
bionic	libc
libc is bionic and malloc is doug lea version named dlmalloc with use_locks enabled for thread-safety

2266816
folder	directory
if you set the rights of everything including directory to 644 744 nobody except the owner will be able to browse the directory structure of particular folder

2266827
comparator	comparable
now looking back at this i am wondering if i should have instead have the my class implement comparable instead of creating a new class that implements comparator

2266827
comparator	comparable
is the right approach first have the class implement comparable for the natural ordering and if an alternative field comparison is required then create a new class that implements comparator

2266827
comparator	comparable
if 2 above is true then does it mean that one should implement comparator only after they have the class implement comparable

2266861
comparator	comparable
there had been a similar question here when should a class be comparable and or comparator

2266865
subclass	accessor
i would like my instance classes to be able to use an accessor named cgi to get the cgi object associated with the current instance of my cgi application subclass

2266865
inherited	subclassing
this is working as i think it should and i cannot see any problems say if i wanted to inherited from my merhaba subclassing need not know anything about merhaba

2266868
comparator	comparable
if it is the latter odds are every future sorting use case would require a comparator at which point the implementation of comparable may slow down users of the class not speed them up

2266921
superclass	subclassing
but if the class is extended i assumed this would return the name of the subclassing but it still returns the name of the superclass which i find kind of odd

2266929
implements	extends
using a jtable the traditional way to create such a table would be to have a class implements tablemodel or extends abstracttablemodel or defaulttablemodel

2266934
post	get
basically i want to hit the page with a get or post and have it run and check and or update the permissions on a folder

2266950
post	get
4 create links which contain the query instead of using post you can also use get

2266967
post	get
you might get some mileage from this post

2266974
typedef	struct
try adding typedef struct request_queue request_queue_t

2266978
gendarme	fxcop
gendarme is a bit like fxcop and has a avoidcodeduplicatedinsameclassrule rule this looks very promising as it avoids the problem of working at the text level

2267016
super	self
the problem was as i found out the usage of super extendedrequest self since urllib2.request is i m on python 2.5 still an old style class where the use of super is not possible

2267096
button	checkbox
function only be called when the checkbox is checked on off by a click or keypress what i want or if i progromatically check uncheck a lot of checkbox with a select unselect alll button will it then call the onchange function for all of the checkbox what i don t want

folder	directory
stat.h is available under the sys folder try to #include it from there or add it to the list of include directory

2267272
128bit	64bit
i would definitely go for the easiest solution and just store them as integers of a suitable size be it 32-bit 64bit or 128bit depending on needs

2267280
postgresql	mysql
most sql databases mysql postgresql etc. operate via a client-server architecture so you re not embedding or linking to the database code in your program and thus you don t have to use a license compatible with those database systems

2267285
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and opera the onchange handler occurs immediately after the user changes the checked state

2267299
public	protected
to get all properties public + private protected internal static + instance of a given type sometype maybe using gettype to get sometype

2267363
free	malloc
that said it sounds like your teacher may have been talking about dynamic memory allocators the code behind malloc and free

2267364
post	put
i am actually in a hurry and could not put a detailed code on post but any help in this regard is appreciated

2267366

2267381
exponent	modulo
for every y1 y2 ... y t+1 just calculated you generate a vector v yi e1 e2 ... et where ei is calculated by reducing over modulo 2 the exponent pi in yi

2267534
width	height
the thing is i want to have the image width height stored into that collection

2267559
getter	setter
i m pretty sure that the annotation needs to be on the getter or the property itself and not the setter

2267583
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
i have a navigation app which drills between table views by calling pushviewcontroller on the navigationcontroller object

2267629
post	put
well if you have used the functionality in your post the content will be cut off on the home page where you put the tag

2267654
post	get
i ve also noted other post admittedly from a long time ago where people have failed to get this setting to work simply by setting it in the tomcat config files

2267673
activemodel	mongomapper
there is a rails3 branch of mongomapper using activemodel

2267675
width	height	gif	bmp
it s been a long time since i did raw processing of image files but i would think that with the most common formats gif bmp jpg etc... you can probably find the height width within the first few hundred bytes or less of the file

2267683
width	height
it appears that one browser is stretching the height width to fill the div without keeping the image s height width ratio whereas the other is using the image s dimensions to scale it properly

2267686
interpreted-language	compiled-language
unfortunately with compiled-language such as c c++ java or c# you won t be able to just run new code at runtime like you can do in interpreted-language like php perl and ecmascript

2267698
ubuntu	linux
i have now moved the sources to my ubuntu box and want to build the libs for use on my linux box

2267732
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that example page should work in firefox and google-chrome and i think safari and it half-works in ie8 only half because of course we couldn t have expected microsoft to get -ms-border-box to work properly

2267787
sip	sdp
so my sip works but it doesn t like the sdp data

2267799
min	max
minimax enumerates all of the possibilities to a specified depth d then assigns a score to the nodes game states at d and moving back up the tree returns the max or min node at each depth based on whether i m the maximizing player or the minimizing player

2267811
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
or gm4ie for ie or greasemetal for google-chrome personalizedweb also works in a much simpler way for google-chrome greasekit for safari or user.js for opera

2267822
post	get
when do you use post and when do you use get

2267822
post	get
am i right to say that we can do without get but we can t do without post

2267836
manual	jmp
volume 2a page 3-549 in my copy of the manual has a huge pile of information about jmp

2267841
post	get
the first important thing is the meaning of get versus post

2267843
post	get
another difference is that post generally requires two http operations whereas get only requires one

2267844
post	get
post can move large data while get cannot

2267847
post	get
use get if you want to read data without changing state and use post if you want to update state on the server

2267861
post	get
http post data doesn t have a specified limit on the amount of data where as different browsers have different limits for get s

2267864
width	height
find the width and height of dialog b and create an overlay on that dialog alone with a message telling the user the action they must take to clear that overlay

1.3 quick checklist for choosing http get or post

2267879
post	get
however before the final decision to use http get or post please also consider considerations for sensitive data and practical considerations

2267879
post	get
you specify either post or get for the form action

2267881
vim	textmate
if you use a decent editor such as textmate or vim this is an easy task

2267939
accessor	properties
i believe the error you re receiving is from the invalid properties accessor

2267980
accessor	properties
this is why you should use properties or explicit accessor

2268027
width	height
you ll need to provide it with the factors by which you want to scale the width and height as a fixed32

2268027
width	height
here s some sample code which determines the scale factor for the width and height by dividing the original image size by the desired size using rim s fixed32 class

2268041
post	get
as answered by others there s a limit on url size with get and files can be submitted with post only

2268041
post	get
i d like to add that one can add things to a database with a get and perform actions with a post

2268041
post	get
when a script receives a post or a get it can do whatever the author wants it to do

2268041
post	get
a script author should use post to change the database and use get only for retrieval of information

2268041
post	get
for example php allows the use of to retrieve either a post or a get

2268041
post	get
you should use post to change data and you should use get to retrieve information

2268118
folder	directory
your app will be folder inside is your home directory

2268125
cvs	rcs
or you could take advantage of the fact that cvs and rcs store the latest version of the file on head near the top of the file and any other revisions are created by applying diffs internally

2268127
cvs	rcs
cvs was just a front end to rcs and the .v files are really rcs files

2268175
min	max
i want to find the fastest way to get the min and max of a column in a table with a single linq to sql roundtrip

2268204
width	height
i have a favicon with the dimensions of height 26px width 20px named favicon.png

2268211

i m attempting to parse media rss feed that contain media elements but it seems as though all of the standard rss parsing libraries for ruby only support enclosures not mrss elements

2268233
n-gram	words
for example an n-gram of two would probably make it very hard to create words over 6 but an n-gram of 4 would be very easy

using iis configuration i can block direct access to all folder in the web directory

2268330
width	height
i would like the form to come up at the size of 450px by 700px but no matter what i set the height and width at i get scrollbars

2268385

int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
the primitive java types boolean byte chars short int long float and double and the keyword void are also represented as class objects

2268493
public	protected
edit fields can be private protected or public

2268603
try-catch	exception-handling
a common pattern is to have an autocommit false the default scopedsession in a module and wrap any business logic execution in a try-catch clause that rolls back in case of exception-handling and commits if the method succeeded then finally calls session.remove

2268609
executable	upx
technically it is possible to embed some other executable files in your exe some packers like upx do it

2268665
expander	grid
you could also implement the row expander ux on the grid which behaves like a tree sort of for each row

2268668
superclass	subclassing
and when i need it pull up that is make a method on a subclassing be a method on the superclass instead is really nice to have

2268670
getter	setter
rename it can also rename getter setter and references in comments literals and even non java files like hibernate mapping files

2268672
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
i have created a model called user which contains e-mail strong md5 hash with salt of password etc

does anyone know of a good tutorial for this kind of analysis or a code example in either haskell or ocaml

2268900
post	get
for get endpoints it s not problem to check for 404s but i d like to check post endpoints without triggering whatever action resides on the remote url

2268913
min	max
i could find only this one which produces somewhat clean sql still not really effective comparing to select min val max val from table

2268913
min	max
still there is another option to use single connection for both min and max queries see multiple active result sets mars

2268914
postgresql	mysql
assuming that the queries are as simple as you have indicated a simple sql db postgresql mysql possibly h2 would be perfect for this

2268961
tinyint	boolean
it will return boolean datatype which in mysql is just a synonym for tinyint 1

2268980
fflush	gets
you should try using them as shown in the spring nhibernate sample and activate logging to really see if the session gets fflush

2269094
post	put	post	get	put	get
with put post or get it works great

nunit	mstest
in most cases using some kind of unit testing framework mstest nunit etc as others have mentioned will give you better return on your time investment

2269119
innodb	myisam
converting table from myisam to innodb

2269120
getter	setter
the user table is tied through hibernate to a domain object in my application class user which has the following attributes and corresponding getter and setter which correspond to columns in the user table except for the collection which is explained later

2269128
post	get
i can t find anything in the rfc but it stands to reason that there is no way to pass parameters using the delete methods - only in get and post so either jquery or the browser correctly filter out the parameters

2269137
plupload	swfupload
though it s only a single file upload some other projects like swfupload and plupload aim to provide multiple file uploading but are much larger projects and i feel too bulky and take too long to setup on top of the fact that they really aren t that seamless you ll be jumping through hoops on the backend

2269155
innodb	myisam
andrew there are lots of differences between myisam and innodb the least of which is the fact that they are controlled by different configuration options in the mysql conf

2269155
innodb	myisam
there is also the fact that innodb is acid compliant unlike myisam

2269158
width	height
it won t really allow the end user to select the size but you can pass a max width and max height constraint

2269175
inherited	properties
declare basemodel inherited and add another properties

2269185
hibernate	gilead
my web app is using gwt 2.0.2 gxt 2.1.1 hibernate 3.5-cr1 javassist 3.11.0 and gilead 1.3.1 latest from svn

2269229
addition	multiplication
i usually use a combination of addition of a small fixed amount and multiplication by 1.5 because it is efficent to implement and leads to reasonable step widths which are bigger at first and more memory sensible when the buffer grows

2269230
vim	textmate
what i m looking for are some suggestions of vim resources and plugins if that s the right terminology to closely emulate the features i am unwilling to give up in textmate

2269264
vim	textmate
i m currently in a similar position to you moving from textmate to vim

2269289
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i am using an updatepanel scriptmanager and a timer all ajax to refresh mydatalist

2269313
haskell	ocaml
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

2269380
post	get
only allow the methods get post here

2269401
getter	setter
finally i could create data-only container objects with private member data and only getter setter

2269410
user-controls	elementhost
curious if there are any disadvantages to using an elementhost to host a wpf user-controls in a winform application

2269410
user-controls	elementhost
i m more concerned about performance impacts and or feature limitations that would be introduced by hosting the wpf user-controls in an elementhost

2269416
feedback	review
this post invited the community to join in the review and provide its thoughtful feedback on the design flaws and identify a fix

2269417
post	get
most likely it will be a post with some hidden fields or a url to do a get

2269438
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i want every new versioning of the installer to be a major upgrade full uninstall then new install as we don t want different upgrade and clean install versioning

2269449
children	parent
if the parent doesn t have any sizing percent or explicit it will need to be sized based on it s children s sizes

2269449
width	height
so if you build a custom coverflowcontainer component and measuredwidth measuredheight aren t set because measure was not overriden then if you don t specify any sizing on coverflowcontainer it would be 0 width 0 height

2269490
post	get
what i need to find out is how to code in php for the script to first get php the_date yyyymmdd and then have wordpress filter events dynamically only displaying post that have a value greater than or equal to the numeric value printed which would be the yyyymmdd format of today which is pulled in via php the_date

2269505
rss	feed
i have a wpf listbox control which displays items of an rss feed

2269505
rss	feed
i occasionally check the source of the rss feed for new items

2269513
getter	setter
if i have property aprop in bean and getter setter for it i create recorddef then record then recrod.set aprop bean.getaprop and so on

2269520
min	max
within that site the most useful tidbit is that you can do sum count min max avg average stdev statistical standard deviation and var

2269531
getter	setter
one can then use in the .m file to automatically create the setter getter

2269535
serializable	deserialization
alternatively you could use something like xstream if you control both serializable and deserialization

2269557
hash	md5
after i d met the performance troubles i tried to add index on argument column but found that i must to specify length so to avoid this limitation i added a new integer column containing hash values md5 or else of argument column values

2269570
put	get
right now you would have to make a much more specific regular expression to get the value of each key value pairs and put them into the replace

2269579
pull	push
the emulator is working perfectly adb can see it i can even logcat from it but it can t push or pull anything from it

2269591
struts	wicket
i d suggest looking at a java web framework such as spring mvc wicket or struts as they simplify development after you learn them and make web apps more testable and maintainable

2269616
folder	directory
also if i try to delete the folder i used to upload to windows tells me cannot remove foldoer the directory is not empty

2269714
for-loop	arrays
a previous for-loop using the i variable to populate the arrays was written the same way and executed as expected

2269725
for-loop	arrays
a different for-loop to populate the arrays was written the same way and executed as expected

2269823
client-side	server-side
i have to do it server-side or client-side app

2269824
put	get
the 3 depend on the order that i put the items in while in this order item1 item3 item5 get left which leads me to believe that its the remove that is messed up

2269853
children	parent
parent elements are never to expand to contain floated children

2269853
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure google-chrome is doing anything wrong though firefox is different but i don t have time to look at it further right now

2269869
int	chars
if you port the code to an environment where all the basic types chars short int long long long are exactly the same size as what the original developers used and tested with the code will probably work as tested although watch out for those possibly uninitialized variables but

2269918
libjpeg	cimg	libjpeg	libpng	cimg	libpng
i also don t want to use a library except if it is very very lightweight i used cimg for a while but i wasn t very happy with its speed so i ended up writing the important functions myself and just using libjpeg and libpng directly

2269919
put	get
it will print 3.432 just like i want but if i try to put that same value dec into a json object what i get in the json is decimal 3.432

2269923
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome 0.1 + 0.2 is 0.30000000000000004 which is not equal to 0.3

apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
i can use apache lighttpd or nginx servers

2269941
rss	feed
i have created a gae app that parses rss feed using celementtree

2269941
rss	feed
these lines correspond to the following lines in the rss feed i am reading

2269954
stretchblt	bitblt
bitblt or stretchblt from your dc to the target dc

2269979
stretchblt	bitblt
if you have an hbitmap then you would use bitblt or stretchblt to draw it but if you don t already have the image as an hbitmap then stretchdibits is probably a better choice since you can use it if you only have a pointer to the bitmap data

2269991
redmine	trac
take a look at redmine very good project management application built in ror you ve also got trac which is built in python

2269993
haskell	ocaml
ocaml will be easier to learn if you coming from almost any other language this is because haskell is as function as functional languages get and working with mutable random access structures can be a little clunky in haskell

2269993
haskell	ocaml
you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy evaluation

2269995
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox google-chrome etc you need npapi

2270011
try-catch	exception-handling
there is no exception-handling as this part is within try-catch

2270032
rss	feed
i m trying to select nodes from an rss feed

for-loop	loops
in the if statement inside the while loops to display the information from page2.php that require from one to three prices and variety will have a foreach loops or maybe a for-loop don t know to count how many variety the user choose in page2.php to display it inside the while loops in cart with the help of an if statment that will detect weather it was choosen from page1.php or page2.php

2270078
sqldatasource	formview
while trying to update a formview control bound to an sqldatasource by using a parameterized stored procedure i constantly get an error screen saying too many arguments specified

2270084
imap	nntp
if the email server is imap pop3 or nntp and you want to use php to query for received mail you could do the polling using the imap extension for php

2270166
folder	directory
now if double click the exe the folder tempfolder is created in the same directory as the exe which i expect

2270166
folder	directory	folder	dir
seeing my app hasnt changed and the dir being printed out hasnt changed and my app is currently ignoring passed strings why is the folder now being created in a new directory

2270253
gridview	formview
when i was getting started with formview and gridview i manually added the primary key value using a hidden field and had the datakeynames attribute sent and i think that caused the value to be sent to the stored procedure twice instead of once

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
the problem occurs within the setinterval settimeout javascript functions

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
after sending the email or tapping cancel the timer is left paused and the settimeout setinterval functions will not fire

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
this will break any thing that relies on settimeout setinterval such as jquery animations and any async ajax calls since jquery uses setinterval to poll until the request returns i ve hit this problem myself

2270314
put	get
i understand that if you put a response.redirect inside a try-catch that you re going to get this error unless you specify the 2nd param of the redirect as false

2270337
kde	gnome
for linux you have to deal with different window managers gnome kde all with different ways of managing the clipboard

2270366
kde	gnome
you may also be able to do this independantly of either gnome kde by using dbus although i cannot say 100 confidently on that either.

2270366
kde	gnome
just be aware that for a truly cross-platform job you have to take into account of the different gui s such as under linux x is the main window manager interface and either gnome kde sits on top of it..i am not singling out other gui s such as fluxbox windowmaker to name but a few and that there will be a lot of platform dependant code and also in conjunction you will be dealing with windows clipboard as well..all in all a big integrated code.

2270366
kde	gnome
maybe that might be better as i would imagine gnome kde etc are using the x s api to do the clipboard work...if that is confirmed then the work would be cut out and be independant of the major gui interfaces... i hope that would be the case as it would make life easier for your project

2270366
kde	gnome
perhaps using compile-time switches for each platform...win kde gnome mac or use the one that is already pre-defined

2270370
button	checkbox
the pagination script below seems to generally work but the problem is that on each page of 20 records when i select some rows via checkbox and click the submit button the display of 20 records jumps back to page 1

2270392
button	checkbox
the form that includes the submit button and the checkbox needs to include a hidden input that gives the current value of the ncurrentpage variable

2270406
int	chars
then you can use java.awt.font.candisplay int to check whether a unicode chars can be displayed in that font where the int is the int representation of the multibyte chars

2270416
inherited	subclassing
i would probably add another tree of inherited so a library is an abstract subclassing of hashset

2270416
inherited	subclassing
but i hope you get the picture - subclassing to inherited the functions you need instead of creating them again

2270461
submit	submission
if it involve submission a form use jquery form plugins to submit the form via ajax and then run your close function on a successful form submit

2270500
hide	show
if you truly want a valid way to do it make your main page the nojs.htm page and use js to hide all content before it s show to the user and immediately redirect to the real main page using javascript

2270517
hide	show
i ve tried changing the opacity to all sorts of levels using show and hide setvisiblecore bool on the window but nothing lowers the flicker to an acceptable level

2270552
udp	tcp
like udp tcp packets

2270566
ienumerable	iqueryable
tolist converts your iqueryable into an ienumerable via and stops it from going to the database again via linq to sql

2270566
ienumerable	iqueryable
this is generally a good design pattern to follow - the last thing you want is consumers of your business layer being able to unwittingly execute arbitrary queries against your database simply because you returned iqueryable where you should have returned ienumerable

2270574
width	height
pass the image.content into imagesnapshot.capturebitmapdata then make sure the width height of the ldr_target is set equal to the src

2270584
udp	tcp
a good starting point for tcp ip is here and for udp here

2270625
tortoisegit	svn
using tortoise svn or tortoisegit

how to determine dynamic width and height occupied by div tag using jquery

2270809
gdi	directdraw
right now it works correctly by drawing the text in the onpaint method using gdi and the video on a directdraw overlay

2270833
folder	directory
so if you move your website from a windows to a unix-server when you change web host for instance you risk getting a certain amount of page not found -errors 404 errors because directory and other websites linking to yours sometimes get the cases wrong typically writing the first letter of folder names in upper-case etc.

2270836
free	malloc
if your c code malloc s and free s every other line of code you re thrashing the heap

2270836

2271115
implements	extends
and yes both docor and customer patient are likely to implements or extends person

2271118
inherited	properties
finally the real pom.xml will inherited from the pom2 and will define its own properties

2271118
maven	pom.xml
note that maven 3 talked about introducing the mixin concept which will allow you to fragment your pom.xml into several files but it looks like that is not happening now until maven 4

2271126
inherited	subclassing
class inherited will give relation between two common subclassing

2271128
width	height
you can call gtk_widget_set_size_request to cause a widget to request a fixed height and width

2271158
children	parent
you could have children send a sigusr1 to the parent when they start then a sigusr2 before they exit

2271167
width	height
i see that to make a circle button a ellipse has to be defined with the same height and width

2271167
width	height
i d like for the circle to take on the shorter of the height width values so that it can dynamically scale according to the button sizing

2271203
min	max
i want to perform a normalization on each column separately that is modifying the values from each colum to actual_value - min this_column max this_column - min this_column

2271203
min	max
the min and max values from a column might differ from those of another column

2271209
winpcap	wireshark
i see the data in wireshark but i am not getting the data through winpcap

2271224
getter	setter
shadowing can be useful in simple code such as constructors getter setter and anything of the sort

2271234
width	height
for cocoa utilizing the technique for calculating string height should get you going if you use an arbitrary large value for the containers width instead of height

2271291
yslow	pagespeed
if you are technically minded install yslow or pagespeed and look at the score

2271309
jdk1.6	jvisualvm
i d recommend using something like jconsole jdk 1.5+ or jvisualvm jdk1.6

2271311
vim	notepad++
my personal picks are vim eclipse or notepad++ if you re using windows

2271369
margin	font-size
so if the current font-size is set to 12px then setting margin 1em on a child element would create a 12px margin around it

2271369
margin	font-size
if you were then to change the font-size of the parent element to 16px the margin would also increase to 16px

2271443
put	get
one method not the most elegant and simple method i thought of is to put all the codes into one set of header source files but that s a lot of work and can get quite tricky.

2271464
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried adding a hidden submit button which gives me the desired behavior in safari firefox and google-chrome but the form is still not submitted in ie

lisp	scheme
there are no destructive updates to data structures like setcar in lisp and most scheme

2271621
int	chars
such as by accessing the bytes in a chars array as an int by casting a to an

2271622
profiling	debugging
if this is not something you want to leave in permanently it s just for debugging performance analysis purposes then your best bet is to use sql profiling and monitor the sp stmtcompleted event which will record the stats for each statement within a sproc

2271632
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my site is loading up perfectly in firefox google-chrome and other browsers like safari albeit a bit slow

2271645
integer	fractions
in the gaussian integers if the real or imaginary parts of the quotient are fractions they get rounded to the nearest integer

2271760
vim	textmate
my background is with textmate but i ve been using vim fulltime for a while now

2271761
implements	extends
tell your ordernodelist class to extends then you ll get this enumerator in for you and probably much of the logic you ve created manually to manage the collection will now be implements for you.

2272144
folder	directory
subversion basically treats everything like a directory structure - a tag is simply another folder in the structure that happens to be within a tags directory

2272144
folder	directory
thus technically you could check out the tags directory copy one tag folder to a new folder svn add that new folder and commit it - which would essentially create a new tag based off of the old files

2272190
boost	stl
i use stl algorithms cogweels with boost lambda expressions the glue as much i can

2272256
daemons	systemd
well you can not sending a signal is just setting up some operating systemd primitives it has nothing to do with setting up a communication path between your daemons on one hand and the tool used to generate the signal on the other hand

2272590
post	get
in your specific case i think it s the postconstruct if the namefilterpattern is to be obtained from a get request parameter or just the bean action method if namefilterpattern is to be obtained from a post form input field is suitable

2272669
post	get
i m having a very similar problem except that my form uses get request not a post request

2272669
google-chrome	firefox
both in google-chrome and firefox

when the user enters the site he can choose in a dropdown which grouping he wants to see so the complete site filtering content related to that grouping

2272747
folder	directory
xml or php driven for those that don t like to use xml you could even generate the structure based off the folder structure in your directory using php

2272778
post	get
there is a proper way to do this as well using your own theme function if i get a chance i ll post a how to for that too

2272849

post	get
all is working right for get requests but all post requests return http 400 - malformed header

2272931
post	get
so instead of the correctly formed request containing get post request line followed by http headers for post requests my application receives from nginx

2272945
getter	setter
lack of properties getter and setter are separate which violates dry and makes things such as frp nearly impossible

2272948

the problem is that when a server post its request i get in the console

2273040
folder	directory
i made a java application.and bundled all classes in jar file..wen i run the project from netbeans my app is running successfully..but wen i place my .jar file at another place and run from there..i am not getting the icons used by my application..in the code i get my icons from images directory present in project folder

2273074
profiler	shark
much more useful for performance analysis is a sampling profiler and for this apple s shark tool part of chud is one of the best

2273170
getter	setter
i often find myself with a dilemma when writing javadoc for properties members of a simple pojo class holding only properties and getter and setter dto-style ..

2273176
getter	setter
alternatively if you do not want to generate the javadoc for all private members you can have a convention to document all getter and use link on setter

2273180
onchange	keyup
which is the best event trigger keypress keyup or onchange which i should use to achieve this seamlessly without any time lags or sync issues

2273187
free	malloc
however i made a small test program with the code above just malloc free in the new delete operators and print statement in delete and compiled it using g++

2273196
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
most linux system have some kind of packet management software like aptitude in debian and ubuntu

2273197
google-chrome	safari
i m currently having a problem with css styles in webkit browswers google-chrome 4.0.249.89 safari 4.0.4 in which i have a modal window that has a list of labels radio buttons and some more text describing the what each radio button does

2273261
filtering	grouping
and now my list thislist as it were has a new view that has all the same properties as the default view except now it grouping by a column dlcategory and filtering out anything whose dlpriority is not 2

2273266
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you can instantiate a trivial not-subclassed uinavigationcontroller and give it your original uiviewcontroller as its root controller like

2273270
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller has an is-a relationship with uiviewcontroller so you should be able to change its class type in interface builder with no additional changes

2273281
hex	binary
the number itself is not stored in hex it s binary like everything else in your computer

2273308
pop-up	dialog
so in case of ajax calls if an already existing dialog is initiated you will get the pop-up more than once as many times it was reinitialized

2273320
public	protected
it makes the public or protected facilities of the base class available directly in the derived class so it simply isn t want you want

2273332
submit	submission
an improvement on this especially if you don t want to do this right at submit time might be to clean the contents of each such div any other time you like onblur whatever and assign the contents of each cediv to its own invisible form element for later submission

2273343
postgresql	mysql
we are working on our implementation of linq to oracle mysql postgresql sqlite and this implementation is actively developed

2273379
int	double
for example i want to be able to use both int double and my own defined types complex

2273393
for-loop	loops
in the if statement inside the while loops to display the information from page2.php that require from one to three prices and variety will have a foreach loops or maybe a for-loop don t know to count how many variety the user choose in page2.php to display it inside the while loops in cart with the help of an if statment that will detect weather it was choosen from page1.php or page2.php

2273428
filesystems	ntfs
it turns out there is support for filesystems transactions - though i could only find it for ntfs enhance your apps with filesystems transactions

2273438
getter	setter
in my opinion this templating makes it a lot easier in the long run to not only remind yourself what the property means through repetition but also it makes it easier to add additional comments to the getter and setter if you want to add side effects such as not allowing null properties turning strings to uppercase etc

2273449
children	parent
its parentid is 3 but at that point i have no idea where this parent 3 is located in the array and how to add children to that parent

2273466
post	get
mark one as get and the other as post

2273496
hash	salt
principalcontext needs a plain-text password so i can not do a salt hash as everyone recommends for password storing

2273508
required	placeholder
this worked but another problem arose if the form client-side validation failed because of the required or pattern attributes then the fields aren t re-given their placeholder value

2273508
required	placeholder
test case open this with a browser that supports required pattern but not placeholder only opera at this time

2273536
hash	salt
for the salt i d do a transformation on the username hash it rather than share the same salt for everyone

2273551
children	parent
as you re figuring out the parent you simply append to the parent s children array

2273551
children	parent
the only real downside to the second approach is that if you want to add or remove an item you have to remember to go back and update the children array for the parent

2273564
gendarme	fxcop
what definable static code checking rule do you wish to see added to fxcop and or gendarme

2273609
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
does it make a difference whether i use sqlcommand sqlconnection instead of oledbcommand oledbconnection

2273654
superclass	subclassing
that means the signature for your subclassing exactly matches the superclass signature which is also what someone else using your subclassing would probably expect

2273694
public	protected
in those spi-s in bc sources made required methods public instead of protected

2273721
getter	setter
then create a property currentcustomer in the bean with getter and setter

2273724
tabs	tabpanel
internally the tabcontrol uses a tabpanel to layout the tabs

2273770
post	get
jsf favors post requests but you can still use get if you want -- it depends on your need and if the page needs to be bookmarkable

2273774
width	height
this will create an image object from argb pixels in the pix array with the given width and height

2273793
folder	directory
obviously write permissions on the directory the file is unzipped to write on the folder your web-service saves the zip file to when it s uploaded and read on the zip file that s been saved to unzip it

2273834
return-value-optimization	nrvo
read about return-value-optimization and nrvo in a word these two stands for return-value-optimization and named return-value-optimization and are optimization techniques used by the compiler to do what you re trying to achieve

2273836
dpkg	aptitude
is there a way of getting dpkg apt-get or aptitude to produce a list of the packages which need to be installed on a second machine to duplicate the packages installed on a first

2273850
getter	setter
my business rules must be implemented only within services with anemic domain classes only with getter and setter or must exist a consensus putting domain business rules in domain classes and services

2273860
post	get
generally speaking for this kind of operation a post back which is really not what it is you are simply navigating back to the same page and i assume that the items are part of a get operation so there is no post is what you don t want

2273886
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
even though uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller it s task is the management of other view controllers not the management of views themselves

2273927
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this comes in two forms name return-value-optimization nrvo and anonymous return-value-optimization usually just return-value-optimization

2273927
return-value-optimization	nrvo
from what you re saying your compiler implements return-value-optimization but not nrvo -- which means it s probably a somewhat older compiler

2273937
innodb	myisam
after several weeks development i wanted to make it available to the public and found out the database server provided by my web host does not support innodb only myisam

2273937
innodb	myisam
what are my chances of making my innodb schema design work with myisam

2273957
haskell	ocaml
both haskell and ocaml provide the lovely benefits of using an ml-family language but for most programmers ocaml is likely to offer a gentler learning curve and better immediate results

2273982
integer	unsigned
for an unsigned integer as you asked for in your question you would use uint_max

2273991
integer	unsigned
by far the simplest method to get the largest value for an unsigned integer type is to cast -1 to that type

2274002
pop-up	dialog
i ve just tested bluetoothauthenticatedevice pin null len 0 on a windows 7 box and the dialog box pop-up there as expected

2274002
pop-up	dialog
presumably w7 vista+kb942567 sp2 connects first to the device to see what authentication methods it supports whereas xp2 vista gold just pop-up the dialog immediately and only on completion attempt to connect to authenticate

2274009
min	max
with 2 thumbs min and max values that would stay in the middle of each box

2274017
versioning	upgrade
i understand that an upgrade to the iphone os upgrade the opengl es versioning support from 1.1 to 2.0

2274023
int	chars
note however that this solution only works if the data representation of int and chars is the same on the sending and receiving systems

2274028
tunnel	vpn
you could then ask your application to open the ssh tunnel just before it authenticates and close it when it s done similar to vpn

2274071
fiddler	charles
i have inspected the response xml in fiddler charles and the data is there but in not in the result in the flex variable inspector

2274084
put	get
you don t have to use page.ispostback most ajax requests are just get s so if you put in your page_load

2274149
implements	extends
i am implements my first gwt application currently i just have a quick question about the differences between extends composite and extends a specified widget when creating complex custom widgets and the advantages of using extends composite

2274155
client-side	server-side
one of the features in asp.net is the ability to call server-side code from client-side code without postback using something called a client callback

2274159
onmousedown	onmouseup
also it s rather tricky you d have to detect both onmousedown and onmouseup for the entire document and record the state of the mouse buttons

2274159
mouseup	mousedown
likewise any mouseup or mousedown events on other elements that stop propagation up to the documentelement s event handler would cause it to break

2274170
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i would also keep the major browsers opera google-chrome firefox safari and ie7 8 opened in parallel to one-another for constant testing

2274171
int	chars
the real problem here is that you are combining chars and int semantics in the same query

2274171
isnull	nullif
use a case or isnull nullif ... construct in the where statement

2274207
width	height
i am given a floating number such as 1.77720212936401 and i want to be able to calculate roughly what the aspect ratio is as a width height string with width and height being small natural numbers

2274211
innodb	myisam
there are many web hosting providers that support innodb these days so it would be waste of your time to recode much of your application to work with myisam

2274215
integer	unsigned
java has only a signed integer not unsigned but this should work

2274236
integer	unsigned
based upon your comments you want an unsigned int although you say unsigned integer so maybe you want an integral value not necessarily an unsigned int

2274284
post	get
when i post to android marketplace as an upgrade to my existing 1.0 app i get the aforementioned ambiguous message

2274295
postgresql	mysql
not sure if postgresql or mysql support this you d have to ask someone more familiar with those databases

2274321
pivot-table	crosstab
i ve read about pivot-table and crosstab queries but this is not what i am looking for as they do not simply rotate the matrix

2274322
matplotlib	scipy
python + numpy + scipy + matplotlib

2274327
google-chrome	firefox
you can test drive this new syntax in recent versions of firefox google-chrome and microsoft edge

2274350
nstabview	nsimageview
i all dragged them to a window in ib but the problem is that the nsimageview action buttons suggest send poke etc... information nsbox and friends nstabview can all vary in height

2274356
int	chars
would vs6 have simply put the return types for both as int or would it have been smart enough to figure out that operator should return a chars and operator should return a bool and not convert both results to int all the time

2274359
gina	winlogon
you can try call wlxloggedonsas function from gina or wlxsasnotify from winlogon

2274361
pop-up	dialog
in such scenarios it will pop-up a dialog asking you to select the appropriate class

2274375
entity-relationship	diagram
anybody can recommend a free database design tool i can use with sql server to create entity-relationship diagram for our existing database

2274400
gridview	calendarextender
is it possible to update a gridview when you change a date in a textbox using calendarextender without having a button

2274437
getter	setter
cake will read your db schema and automagically provide model- field and some auto getter setter like findallbyid or findbyname

2274492
inherited	subclassing
all subclassing of textwriter and therefore streamwriter and stringwriter and their subclassing will inherited the write method that supports this

2274506
solaris	bsd
will the above line of code also work correctly under linux solaris bsd or other os

2274510
folder	directory
in which directory do i need to copy-paste the files and folder from gwt project to java web app project

2274634
perl	tcl
this is especially true for folks who have worked with unix shell scripting perl tcl python ruby etc

2274654
int	chars
whenever i try to print the chars arrays to the console i m getting the result in int format but whenever i try to print int arrays to the console i m getting the result in hashcode format

2274666
client-side	server-side
ah but in client-side or server-side code

2274673
getter	setter
you need to use the correct properties for admin and you need to create getter and setter for those properties like any other java bean

2274693
google-chrome	safari
we are using django and django-socialauth for auth with google fb twitter but there is a problem with the facebook connect button only in google-chrome neither safari dont shows the button

2274707
yacc	bison
if the user makes an error yacc bison will go on until the next semi-colon end of a statement and then go on with the next statement

2274724
folder	directory
i ve noticed if you change the security settings for a particular directory you can make that folder no longer browsable in windows

2274752
post	get
if you are doing a search you are trying to get data from the server and not send data to it -- which means you probably should use get and not post

2274760
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
in this approach you do not use wsdl.exe svcutil.exe at all since you are essentially bypassing the wsdl

2274760
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
edit following this approach the client can still try to generate proxy objects via wsdl.exe svcutil.exe but they won t get the correct information from the wsdl

2274794
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari but surprise surprise ie has a problem with it

2274794
firefox	safari
firefox safari ie8 alert one and alert two appear three times as expected and colour picker appears

2274799
voip	sip
services should not be starting activities except in very unusual circumstances the socket is a sip connection and you are creating a voip client

2274806
packets	multicast
if i run wireshark it shows that the packets are being delivered to the machine they look correct and they have the right multicast ip and port but the application layer doesn t receive anyting it blocks forever in .receive

2274912
typedef	struct
personally i tend to add the underscore at the end like this typedef struct node_ node

2274918
post	get
the problem i ve got is it seems that my post are very slow for some reason and consequently they appear to get a little clogged up and keep running after i ve completed my work

2274925
integer	unsigned
converts the specified string which encodes binary data as base-64 digits to an equivalent 8-bit unsigned integer array

2274938
getter	setter
because the same situation is there in front of me where i need to extend a third party class and the properties in this class which are private but are needed in the extending class and there are no setter and getter for the private members

2274985
x86	64bit
depending on the kernel involved it can will use the x86 rdtsc function which is a 64bit counter of instruction cycles

2275034
superclass	subclassing
if the private members are truly needed in the subclassing then your problem indicates poor design of the superclass

2275038
getter	setter
may be the third party class didn t provide any getter setter by design

2275096
pull	push
this way you could load the types pass them through the rules engine and then push the allowed types to a query on the database end that pull the list of books in the allowed types

2275121
min	max
note this example also demonstrates that it is not safe to use select max id +1 or select min id -1 as the next available unique value if we do it under concurrency

2275180
post	get
it is possible to use both get and post in form just add appropriate attribute method to form tag

2275199
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
with c-language background i could write some for-loop and inside loops count to ten do stuff and set my bookkeeping variable to zero and continue main arrays handling..

2275221
put	get
my reading of the source code is that get obtains a read lock which is independent of of the lock called _notempty acquired by put

2275221
put	get	puts	gets
if i understand correctly concurrent get s can block each other and concurrent put s can block each other modulo your use of the block parameter but that gets and puts do not mutually block

2275236
post	put
if that s the case it d probably be helpful to put the post s into a queue and have a timer that empties the queue periodically

2275259
width	height
i need my component to be sized exactly to the summed width and height of my rendered strings

2275259
min	max
for anyone interested i ve posted results of using the gridlayout boxlayout and flowlayout using a simple frame that receives 5 fixed size components of 200 wide by 50 in height by setting min max and preferred

2275259
width	height
the gridlayout is always resized along the width and height as mentioned in comments

2275259
width	height
the page_axis and y_axis shrank the width of the components to about half their size 104 but did not shrink the height

2275259
width	height
the line_axis and x_axis shrank the height of the components to what seemed zero but did not touch the width

2275357
post	get
i m going to begin researching this topic right now but i thought d i post this question in the meantime and get anyone s thoughts just to give me a boost

2275361
folder	directory
i want the most recent version of my help file to stay in a folder that is not my visual studio project directory

2275391
portrait	landscape
i am currently trying to implement a grid view in the iphone sdk whereby in portrait mode there are 2 items wide and in landscape mode there are 3

2275410
vbscript	vb6
presently it has vbscript and vb6 as dialects of visual basic

2275627
width	height
create a div of the same width and height as your image and set the image as the background for the div using css

2275657
bazaar	fossil	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce	perforce	cvs	gitorious	fossil	darcs	launchpad	darcs	fossil
so you can have something exactly like github or gitorious codaset for mercurial bitbucket darcs patch-tag bazaar launchpad codeville arch arx monotone fossil but not for subversion or cvs perforce visual sourcesafe team foundation server vault because centralized version control systems simply are not capable of supporting the required features

2275658
uitableview	reloaddata
when you do get the additional row data then call reloaddata to get the uitableview to ask for the number of rows and then call cellforrowatindex

2275665
temp	tmp
oh yeah and make sure the tmp folder is on the same partition as where your build is written to as vc++ makes temp files and moves them later

2275666
folder	directory
in either the system-wide library pdf services or a user s library pdf services directory you can put applescripts automator workflows or symlinks aliases to applications or folder

2275666
pop-up	dialog
those items will appear in the pdf pop-up menu in the print dialog and if the user selects the item a pdf of the file will be placed in the folder or be passed to the application script or workflow

2275697
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview databound to an objectdatasource

2275754
post	get
i found a tutorial showing me how to get my timeline or last 20 post in xml format but can t figure out how to print out just the latest post and just the text of it not the time date etc that come with the xml rss etc

2275770
int	double
the compiler and i say it s a forward declaration for a function taking a double argument and returning an int

2275775
int	chars
as for grays how you ll declare it depends on if you re using your array of unsigned chars as chars a string or as single-byte int

2275775
integer	unsigned
if they re integers you can declare an unsigned single-byte integer as byte and declare an array either static or dynamic of them using the syntax described above

2275794
pull	push
have you tried a push approach versus your current pull polling approach

2275795
hash	md5
while some of its info recommendation to use md5 hash for one is somewhat out of date simply because of what-we-know-now versus what-we-knew-then the overall principles are very strong and should be considered

2275803
titlebar	window	min	max
i have created a borderless window style wherein i draw the chrome borders titlebar min max close systemmenu etc and i would like to check it against an existing example

2275824
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
edit october 2010 vb6 vbscript and vb.net added as languages supported by clonedr

2275833
children	parent
i have transaction id s stored in a database and the requirement is to display all of the children of the parent and then the subsequent children of the parent s children

2275833
children	parent
in reality this list of parent and their children will never be more than 4 or 5 levels deep but i need to take into account that it can go more layers than that

2275847
post	get
the concept is not bad help avoid injection attacks but escaping all get post and cookie values make your code so much complex for example have to unescape everytime when displaying and data

2275859
cagradientlayer	calayer
in the awakefromnib method it creates and sets all the calayers into their appropriate positions cagradientlayer several catextlayers and a few custom calayer subclasses

2275904
sorting	filtering
tim s answer is a great way to handle things if you have the ability to run the initial query in a second thread and the logic paging sorting filtering to be applied to the results requires action on the server ...

2275958
chunked	transfer-encoding
http could work quite well for long-running connections if you use transfer-encoding chunked

2275965
awt	swing
so i suggest like swing do all the gui manipulation on the awt event dispatch thread edt

2276003
put	get
this approach is ethical can get you better and more relevant data you can put voluntary forms together and allows you to make a value exchange

2276018
pylons	bottle
as an aside i tend to think frameworks are useful and personally use django like the way pylons works and have used bottle in the past for prototyping mdash

2276031
ubuntu	linux
it has been now over one year i have trashed windows and moved to linux ubuntu to be more precise and i am using the ide zend studio combined with aptana studio for developing oo php5.3 websites

2276031
libs	buildpath
code completion for php5.3 not just php5 and not just the php functions but any libs that are added to the buildpath such as zend framework and my own libs

2276041
post	get
anything less is going to be a huge amount of work parsing http requests to find headers and uri s and methods and parsing the get or post query data association handling file uploads cookies etc

2276077
inherited	properties
firefox for example generates anonymous button and input elements inside the file upload element which only inherited some of the properties that you set on the upload element itself

2276101
button	checkbox
if i have this straight you want a control that has something arbitrary displayed along with a drop-down button that displays a list of items with checkbox next to them

2276109
maven	pom.xml
this is assuming you have the proper references to the maven distribution repository in your pom.xml or settings.xml

2276135
listadapter	listactivity	implements	extends
you will need to extends listactivity and listadapter to implements your design

2276136
directions	infowindow
options like driving directions can be achieved by adding links to the infowindow that call the part of your code that does gdirections calls

2276218
hide	show
for flex components listen to show and hide events

2276221
ant	maven
you need to properly set your classpath whether you re using ant or maven to perform your build

2276221
ant	maven
using ivy with ant or switching your build to maven will allow the build to automatically lookup dependencies and properly set the classpath

2276235
gdal	arcgis
im just starting off with gdal + python to support operations that cannot be done with arcgis python geoprocessing scripting

2276240
versioning	upgrade
users who are still using 2.0 os probably a small minority even including jailbreakers as 3.1 has been jailbroken for quite a while don t have to upgrade to the new versioning

2276277
uilabel	uibutton
in the corresponding nib customtblcell.xib drag and drop uilabel and uibutton elements side-by-side

2276304
ant	maven
so if you want to use a custom strategy you ll have to use ant or maven

2276313
folder	directory
the issue i am having is that my build server seems to be putting both assemblies in the same output directory the binaries folder on the build server and using that directory for resolving project references but it is getting the wrong file the silverlight one instead of the .net one

2276327
setinterval	clearinterval
if it s to animate the value couldn t you use javascript setinterval and clearinterval method

2276327
setinterval	clearinterval
in the above example the setinterval function fires every 100 milliseconds and just increases the value by 1 each time when it hits 100 the clearinterval function stops it animating

2276328
min	max
the regular expression also needs to support a min and max length

2276334
pop-up	dialog
so could someone give an example of using a link to pop-up a dialog with a form in it and handling the submission of that form in the controller

2276374

i ve used both db systems before and while postgresql is great for it s licensing terms and standards compliance mysql is definitely easier to get up and running quickly

2278301

accessor	properties
the key difference is that the properties is actually calling the accessor method while the instance variable is being accessed directly

2278435
accessor	properties
thus for setting a retain properties using self and the accessor will release the old object and retain the new one

2278435

this gave me enough space to convert 4 chars chunks into int and run the above function on them

2278470

2278902
inherited	properties
when you inherited a properties the caller really shouldn t care whether firstname was first implemented in person or customer or object

2278905
int	chars
so you have to over-allocate a buffer to the maximum size as a string of an int even if you require fewer chars since you have the possibility of an overflow

joptionpane is a class that will pop-up a very basic modal dialog with some text maybe an icon or input field

2278973
joptionpane	jdialog
as joptionpane is a very basic construct for creating a basic message dialog it might be easier to use a jdialog which can also be made modal

in the installation directory of an air application there is a meta-inf folder or in share using linux

2279263
accessor	properties
awkward accessor names like that are why â œmnameâ is a poor name for a properties

2279263
accessor	superclass
and it doesn t matter whether you synthesize the accessor hand-wave them to a superclass with dynamic or define them yourself

2279263
accessor	properties
that s how the object will respond to the accessor message but the accessor message the compiler generates will be no different since a properties access could just as easily come from outside the class as from inside it

2279263
accessor	properties
i said mname is bad as a properties name because of the accessor names that follow from it

2279263
accessor	properties
when somemethod isn t the accessor or init or dealloc using the properties is just fine and generally preferable

2279263
accessor	properties
when it is the accessor i name the local variable newx having named the instance variable the same as the properties x

2279321

rss feed incorporate feed onto my site

2279388
postgresql	mysql
but postgresql isn t much harder to install than mysql if harder at all

2279388
postgresql	mysql
as a developer i prefer postgresql over mysql as the latter behaves different from version to version they re still playing catchup to the sql standard and probably always will

2279388
postgresql	mysql
if you actually prefer mysql over postgresql i d lay out a migration plan just to be ready if need arises as a kind of lazy proactiveness .

2279389
runtimeexception	invocationtargetexception
as far as i can tell the invocationtargetexception means there was a runtimeexception and i can treat it like that

2279405
inherited	subclassing
and now on each of your subclassing you override the getequation by specifying the constraint and as transient is not inherited by subclassing the overriden getequation will be use for the equation field mapping

2279416
int	chars
just assign the int to a chars variable

2279435
int	chars
here is a small example to show converting int to chars string

2279438
mvp	presenter
in mvp pattern a presenter has an interface of view so the presenter can call iview.dosomething

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer 8 and later versions and all other versions of popular browsers - google-chrome firefox opera 4+ - support the css property border-spacing

usually with a fixed width container margin 0 auto should be enough

2279593
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox google-chrome and opera

2279613
config	ini
is any config needed on php ini file or i may use imap

2279662
public	protected
what is better practise and why accessing base class variables through a protected field or a public getter on the private field

2279665
getter	setter
why use getter and setter

2279665
getter	setter
but when we use getter setter these attributes can be easily accessed modified from outside

2279665
getter	setter
if we are going to use setter getter later on to modify

2279673
put	get
for example you can get a list of all tables columns and foreign key references which is enough to put together a schema diagram

2279685
getter	setter
you can add some logic into setter getter in future

2279685
getter	setter
sometimes getter setter can operate with abstract things.

2279689
getter	setter	public	protected
use public or protected setter and getter

2279689
public	protected
the getter need not be public - if you wan to hide the data from outsiders but give the data to subclasses use protected

2279692
superclass	subclassing
i regard the relationship between a superclass and a subclassing as similar to that of a caller and callee - changes to the underlying implementation shouldn t break subclassing any more than they should break callers

2279701
getter	setter
if you use setter getter you can allways add validation checking etc later on

2279722
width	margin
i recommend using three column div s with float left and a fixed width 30 and a 3 margin to make the gap

2279732
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
is there a way in wpf to specify a width height as a resource so that it can be reused in several styles for margin padding

2279739
profiling	benchmarking
ultimately i wouldn t start mimicking optimisations from the bcl without benchmarking profiling what difference they make in your specific application

2279802
getter	setter
you can limit access to attributes if you will write getter without setter attribute will be read-only

2279805
installation	upgrade
so if you have upgrade your sql server 2005 client tool installation to 2008 there is no way afaik to create ssis 2005 projects

2279815
width	height
the location in pixels is calculated this works as it should by the width and height of the application

2279834
hide	show
debugging is also fine - the visual studio debugger hide the implementation of the standard containers and instead show a logical view of what they contain

2279845
inherited	subclassing
accessing protected fields from a subclassing is one of the ways that inherited violates encapsulation

2279846
getter	setter
you should never supply getter setter by default only if the use case of the class requires them

2279846
getter	setter
this will almost never be true for setter and only occasionally for getter

2279846
getter	setter
no only one of them is exposed the current length via the size getter and none via setter

2279904
width	height
make the body height 100 because div width or height will apply only if the parent been set to a certain value

2279938
width	height
calc the width and height difference

2279962
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
boxlayout panel boxlayout.y_axis gridlayout 0 1 and if really needed gridbaglayout

2279969
put	get
in your case myhashmap is overloading the standard map methods of put get and remove but not overriding any of them

2279971
put	get
and adjust the put and get the same

2279984
post	get
here is a blog post about it that i think will help you get started

2279999
yslow	pagespeed
2 make the loading in a page the user have to open it in the beginning like login page and put the scripts at the end of the page to let all the content render first and this recommended by most of the performance tools like yslow and pagespeed

promotion is the process by which values of integer type smaller that int unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int

2280810
integer	unsigned
it begins by promoting the operand to either int or unsigned if they are of a type smaller than int and then choosing a target type by the following process for integer types 6.3.1.8 1

2280810
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

2280810
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

swt	swing
swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately

2281077
swt	swing
i cannot add comment yet because i m new here please mod me up so i can comment but choosing swing or swt depends on the ide you re using

i have show all and hide all buttons and i d like for them to have the slidetoggle animation as well instead of just showing and hiding all

2281169
hide	show
if i remove th slidetoggle and replace it with just a show hide on the show all hide all it performs fine

2281169
hide	show
and my show all and hide all functions.

2281169
hide	show
and replacing the slidetoggle in the showall and hideall functions with show and hide works well too

yes i ve have this particularly when building large projects in nant build scripts under the cruisecontrol .net continuous integration server

2281199
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

i have previously considered and passed over git due to worse documentation and cross-platform support compared to bazaar and mercurial but since then they have improved massively in both areas and it seems it s now a really good option whatever your circumstances

2281460
hide	show
this should then hide and show the icon everytime the timer ticks at least then you can see if it s working

2281460
hide	show
maybe only run the timer 10 times and then it ends that way the script should hide and show the icon 10 times by which time the system should be ready

2281472

strdup	strtok
you could also use strtok and strdup

2281589
strdup	strtok
see example of using strtok and strdup

2281589

boost	stl
you cannot store polymorphic types in stl containers use boost ptr_map instead if it is your wish

2281678

2281775
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in c# a superclass s static members are inherited into the subclassing scope

2281775
inherited	subclassing
now you can t inherited static classes and the only place i can imagine that static inherited might matter ignores it entirely although you can make a generic constraint that requires a type parameter t to be a subclassing of a you still cannot call t.m which probably simplifies things for the vm let alone write a different m implementation in a subclassing and use that

2281780
post	get
is there a good reason why i shouldn t be mixing post and get

2281784
google-chrome	firefox

implements	extends
you could also use as delimiters and implements of minimalist html parser suiting your needs but this will probably lead to bugs headaches and more bugs once your minimal needs extends

2281914
superclass	subclassing
an example of use would be say a counter value that would keep a live count of all instances of a superclass s subclassing each subclassing increments the static count value on construction

2281937
jtextfield	jlabel
i would really want it to look like a jlabel - but i still need it to be a jtextfield because i want people to be able highlight it

ubuntu	linux
the machines this program runs on are typically ubuntu linux boxes

2282276

nettcpbinding	net.tcp
when i run the webservice i have this exception could not find a base address that matches scheme net.tcp for the endpoint with binding nettcpbinding

2282477

i ve successfully done this before using a geospatial image of the world and then mapped scaled longitude and latitude values from the max lat lng range -90 90 -180 180 to the max width and height of the image 0 width 0 height which worked perfectly

2282478
client-side	server-side
you still need a server-side check because the client-side may turn off javascript etc

2282606
post	get
the jquery - rather than use get post we must use ajax to set the contenttype i had assumed the json datatype on the .post method sorted this but that s for the return value

2282606
post	get
what it shows is that post get will attempt to convert the data in the request into the object type without any filters useful even

2282612
versioning	upgrade
i do it very similarly but use database extended properties instead of a table to track metadata versioning and the upgrade steps are defined in application rather than a single script

2282626
children	parent
this works only when there is only one child record if there are more than one child records the children get deleted but the parent doesn t

2282629
width	height
when i query the frame of tmpview the width is still as desired and the height is often correct .

2282634
width	height
the default value of both is stretch and when an explicit width height is set it behaves like center

2282634
width	height
...and the button using it with a non-square width height

2282667
hide	show
however if the choice when to show each text can be conditioned you can have two controls with different license texts that is both texts are built into a single msi and show hide them based on the condition

2282720
doc	rtf
cocoa reads and writes rtf rtfd and word doc formats natively

2282735
directx	directdraw
would it be different using directdraw rather than directx and the sprite render method

2282735
directx	directdraw
since i ve no idea the differences between directdraw and directx i m not 100 what i should be thinking about that

2282741
disk	ram
by default linux will use free ram almost all of it to cache disk accesses and will delay writes

many-to-many	one-to-many
but then how do you handle one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

2282778

it has nothing to do a leading character except that it seems to split the json at a certain size and then ends up with a random leading character because the next json string starts with a random character

2282810
datalist	repeater
pay attention to selected indexes and bind your child repeater or datalist in the itemdatabound event

the font renders in firefox and safari fine hover nothing is displayed in the explorers

2283042
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreewidget	qtreeview	qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel
if you didn t it sounds like you want a custom sorting algorithm which would require creating a derived qtreewidget if you are doing that you might as well just use qtreeview and a custom qabstractitemmodel

2283044
public	protected
we are talking public vs private and i am not including protected for a reason

2283044
inherited	properties
inherited extending to an extended class does not allow you to inherited private variables properties are the answer

2283106
punctuation	words
python tries to avoid using punctuation when english words will do especially when the special characters don t have widely-known meaning

we have had these things pop up a few times in my current project involving a cms where things like internationalization had to be addressed early but this wasn t necessarily a wise move as there were changes later such as bringing in another company s software to handle some of the translation which may impact some of our code

2283316
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome can pull that xml and manipulate it in jquery just fine

2283331

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you can use objectinputstream objectoutputstream to store and recover your object

2283347
ironruby	ironpython

2283530
put	get
not familiar with getty but if you put your images in directories on your sever you can use php to get a directory listing and then loop through that listing to display the images

2283530
put	get
if you want to get fancy with it you could even write an xml file with image information and put it on the server then parse the xml when you load the images to supply meta data such as file names who uploaded the file etc

2283532
postgresql	mysql
even if you don t have a database mysql postgresql ... server available you should be able to use an sqlite database the engine is incorported into php via an extension that s generally enabled and the whole database is stored as a file

2283538

2283670
floating-point	fractions
it returns a string because 0.1 and powers thereof which are used to display decimal fractions are not representable at least not with full accuracy in binary floating-point systems

2283675

i am porting a project to the iphone and it uses realloc and memcpy which are not found

2283732
for-loop	arrays
while still not clean and concise the code in the for-loop is quite redundant and we could have used std vector instead of c arrays this code now is guaranteed to assign correct data to

2283743
getter	setter
it also means you can t do things like validate when it s set add logging around getter setter etc

2283747
16-bit	64bit
how can i split the 64bit input into 16-bit

2283805

2284111
children	parent
again it changes color while its children don t and important its parent reverts to its original color

2284129
accessor	properties
using this pattern current always contains the current values of the object irrespective of its editing state which makes the properties accessor easy to implement

2284148
google-chrome	firefox
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

2284163
away3d	papervision3d
displaying 3d objects in flash is easy using one of papervision3d or away3d

2284213

b two mediawiki + mysql postgresql installs replicating data from a master to a slave but the mw slave would have to point back at the mysql master for writes

2284262
stdout	stderr
s stdin stdout stderr are utf-8

2284265
inherited	properties
then if you want to make changes per-machine instead of per-project like it used to be you just set a properties sheet up the way you want and make all your projects inherited from it

2284335
put	get
put the assembly if any in the gac or in the website bin but i d suggest using the gac until you get the basics up and running

2284370

union by default will select only distinct values

2284484
width	height
using the tile based example you d know the height and width of the panel draw your square and increment in the x and y coordinates as appropriate

2284498
nswindow	nspanel
i cannot find a simple tutorial online that explains the basics of nspanel windowing as different from nswindow

2284509
listview	gridview
if you re not dead-set on using a listview you could instead use a gridview setting the autogeneratecolumns property to true

2284514
profiling	debugging
they add complexity to the source file they make it bigger they re ugly to deal with in terms of debugging and profiling etc

2284528
activemq	rabbitmq
should i consider setting up some sort of message queueing service to help with this such as jms rabbitmq activemq etc

2284549
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar

2284690
apache	nginx
we have a project deployed with nginx apache django and postgres

2284690
apache	nginx
given performance requirement i need some way which uses nginx and doesn t really bring apache into picture and accepts the file

2284705
post	get
you have mixed get vs post

2284725
x86	64bit
but i think it returns the program files x86 folder on a 64bit windows machine

2284759
x86	64bit
system.environment.getfolderpath system.environment.specialfolder.programfiles returns c program files on a 64bit machine unless the code is build to target x86 in which case it returns c program files x86 so i guess that would work for you

2284777
hide	show
i was thinking i could hide it by adding a beginrequest call to hide and a show on end request but it doesn t work

2284829
accessor	properties
typed accessor properties to access

2284851
portrait	landscape
so if i take a picture of a building the roof will be on the topside whether i hold the phone in landscape position or portrait

2284868
range	minimum
since you know that the range is 0 1000 just add the appropriate minimum and maximum properties to the linearaxis

2284894
tcplistener	tcpclient
you need one tcpclient and one tcplistener

2284952
x86	64bit
intel-like cpu of the x86 family have a hardware implementation of the sin function but it is part of the x87 fpu and not used anymore in 64bit mode where sse2 registers are used instead

2284971
html5lib	beautifulsoup
also the beautifulsoup tree builder is going to be deprecated in html5lib 1.0 . this solution was thanks to amarghosh s tip

2284978
pull	push
then in an other windows you can hg clone hg pull hg push etc

2284987
hash	md5
generate unique username for auth.user.username - md5 hash of email should be fine here

2285001
width	height
the one that i use has about a 7.5 1 width to height ratio

2285110
put	get
is there a way to get a shell identifier which could then be put into the mutex name

2285146
google-chrome	firefox
i am creating a website and the font looks different in ie it s larger than it is in firefox and google-chrome

2285156
config	ini
my ideal case would be that this config is the default but applying some config file a properpies file xml ini cfg ..... i could overwrite the default web.xml values

2285176
post	get
issue number one with this is the request requires a verb in the web.config enabling get post easy added

2285223
16-bit	64bit
also remember that there is no ntvdm on 64bit windowsâ you can t run 16-bit programs

2285232
metaphone	soundex
other possibly useful functions could be soundex similar_text or metaphone

2285238
metaphone	soundex
but functions like soundex or metaphone that calculate some kind of digest can help to reduce the number of actual comparisons

2285238
metaphone	soundex
if you store the soundex or metaphone value for each known word in your database you can reduce the number of possible matches very quickly

2285241
width	height
since flowlayoutpanel lays out the controls without particularly thinking about the number of rows columns but rather on cumulative width height you may need to keep track of how many controls you ve already added

2285241
width	height
the idea is to set the width and height of the panel in such a way that you ll get your desired number of columns there

2285241
width	height
tablelayout gives you a good mechanism for rows and columns managing width and height is easier but you d need more code to change the placement of all controls if you want to remove one from the form dynamically

2285259
getter	setter
note the relevant getter and setter i m using within my entity is as follows

2285264
switching	screens
sometime the reconnect also fails to fire so when i switching to quartz screens i get a que of a half dozen disconnect dialogs i have to click on

2285314
tcpdf	fpdf
i currently use fpdf to create some fairly complicated reports and am trying to upgrade to tcpdf but i ve found that my same code running through tcpdf is about twice as slow

2285314
tcpdf	fpdf
if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf

2285341
listview	gridview
listview or gridview this should be pretty easy

2285343
pow	sin	cos	sin	cos	sine
in the c language the standard c library includes common math functions not included in the language itself pow sin and cos for power sine and cosine respectively

2285343
cpu	processors
now the compiler may optimize the standard c library function sin provided by libm.so to be replaced with an call to a native instruction to your cpu fpu s built-in sin function which exists as an fpu instruction fsin for x86 x87 on newer processors like the core 2 series this is correct pretty much as far back as the i486dx

2285363
launch4j	jsmooth
you could use a java executable wrapper - like jsmooth or launch4j

2285383
post	put
i m not going to put all my questions in one long post it just makes everything more confusing and i need to understand this once and for all

2285393
verilog	hdl
see resources for learning verilog for some info on the differences between hdl programming and computer programming

2285423
width	height
i gave the image width height properties and that seemed to fix it

2285454
ada	pascal
similarly if you ve only ever seen c or c++ or maybe even pascal ada modula clu nothing can really prepare you for the power and expressiveness of first-class functions

2285454
ocaml	sml
or change between languages in the ocaml f# sml family

2285482
hash	md5
iâ ve just made an application that sends an etag whose value is the md5 hash of the response body

2285482
hash	md5
is using md5 hash of the response body as etag wrong

2285482
hash	md5
this last question is hard to answer unless you are the author so iâ m trying to find the weak points of using an md5 hash as an etag

2285492
expander	itemscontrol
i want to make an itemscontrol that provides some of its own children and then when used can add additional children similarly to the built in expander class

2285493
firefox	safari
i have a small issue with jquery on safari mac osx 10.6 - the page loads fine under firefox mac and internet explorer win but has to be refreshed to work properly in safari.

2285540
hash	md5
generating an md5 hash of a web page costs processing power and time on the server

2285566
expander	itemscontrol
expander derives from headeredcontentcontrol and this adds in the itemscontrol behavior to that

2285577
shadowbox	lightbox
this is to wire up shadowbox lightbox clone for this actionlink

2285584
hash	md5
if you are using md5 and you can cache store the association between the resource and the md5 hash then that s a fine solution

2285591
textview	imageview
using a framelayout containing both the imageview and textview

2285603
put	get
but what i get is everytime i run a page the instance is null so the object restarts as you can see i put an echo empty

2285652
post	get
i come from the world of web programming and usually the server sets a superglobal variable through the specified method get post etc that makes available the data a user inputs into a field

2285735
post	put	post	get	put	get
the set of operations supported by the web service using http methods post get put or delete

2285743
post	put	post	get	put	get
they use the http verbs get post put and delete and others sometimes

2285750
unix	solaris
is size of _posix_path_max is same for all unix flovors linux solaris

2285756
paredit	slime
you ll need to put together a few pieces emacs slime which works perfectly well with clojure -- see swank-clojure swank-clojure the clojure implementation of slime s server counterpart clojure-mode paredit and of course the clojure jar for a start then perhaps some extras among which leiningen would perhaps be the most notable

2285756
paredit	slime
setting up clojure incanter emacs slime swank and paredit post on the blog of the incanter project

2285778
post	put	post	get	put	get
the http verbs get post put and delete are typical actions that you can apply against any resource

2285784
versioning	upgrade
heroku made all its apps upgrade to the latest versioning of bundler 0.9.4

2285802
hash	md5
should work a bit better since md5 hash usually are expressed as hexadecimal numbers

2285864
g++	gcc
i ran the code in gcc using gettimeofday i ll paste code below and used g++ -o2 file.cpp and got slightly faster results then c#

2285936
width	height
i m using rectangles defined in terms of their x y coordinates and their width and height

2285936
width	height
i figured out how to rotate them in terms of coordinates but i m stuck on the height and width

2285936
width	height
my intention is to get the width and height either reversed or negated due to whatever the angle is

2285945
width	height
edit why don t you try apply formula you have written to width height pair

2285965
idictionary	ilist
system.web.mvc.controlleractioninvoker.invokeactionmethodwithfilters controllercontext controllercontext ilist 1 filters actiondescriptor actiondescriptor idictionary 2 parameters +193

2285980
width	height
rotation should not change width and height

2285980
cos	sin
your equation is correct if you want to rotate x y about 0 0 by deg but note that often cos and sin functions expect arguments in radians rather than degrees so you may need to multiply deg by pi 180 radians per degree

2285980
cos	sin
if you need to find the locations of other rectangle vertices besides x y after rotating then you should either store and rotate them along with x y or keep some information about the rectangle s orientation such as deg so you can recompute them as x+width cos deg y+height sin deg

2285995
hide	show
effectively when the text value is emptytext hide the password field and show a normal text field

2286035
dictionary	map
i m not sure a switch is the best idea but i m also not sure how to correctly employ a dictionary to map the data retrieval and object creation to a specific type

2286069
int	double
first when casting you need a type double int

2286075
width	height
from the way you describe only rotating by 90 degrees and the way you seem to be defining width and height perhaps you are looking for something like

2286075
width	height
not sure why you want to have negative values for width and height though

2286075
width	height
because otherwise each 90 degree rotation effectively just swaps width and height regardless which way you rotate

2286145
perl	tcl
with the first already being familiar from its use in sh bash tcl perl awk .

2286177
many-to-many	one-to-many
from your description i m not entirely sure if you actually need to use that many-to-many relationship or if a one-to-many path is all you need

2286178
calloc	malloc
new delete are keywords in the c++ language like for and while whereas malloc calloc are function calls in the standard c library like printf and sleep

2286218
inherited	properties
then you can inherited from the media class in your cd dvd and book classes and add specific properties to those media types

2286238
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
doing such things in modern browsers is trivial but in ie you need to call msxml through javascript and .net stuff in order to do the same transformations native to other far more modern browsers firefox safari google-chrome opera k-meleon konqueror epiphany flock....you get the idea

2286256
pull	push
this sort of thing is great for fixing up a mistake in your local repository but since you re changing history make sure you didn t push to someone else or they didn t pull from you the original version before you fixed it

2286277
post	get
it should be able to do either get or post

2286298
128bit	64bit
the plan here is to use the 16 64bit general purpose registers and the 128bit sse registers to do really really long integer math

2286304
int	double
note if you 15 is the cd price then you should consider using bigdecimal instead of int double or whatever you are using

2286304
int	double
if it was something else then change the bigdecimal for and int double and its corresponding parameter name

2286340
put	get
i get the impression that it was removed entirely for a version or two and then put back but with warnings and tut-tuts about overriding the default value 0 which really means 17 which the manual promises is enough to represent any ieee 754 double

2286353
initializer	class-method
class-method identified by the static keyword operate on the base class in a way that s shared by all initializer objects of that class

2286353
superclass	subclassing
note that you don t need to cast subclassing to their superclass as the jvm already knows the class heirarchy just like the compiler knows in c++

2286387
width	height
maybe the width and height of the pyramid are set during the constructor so getwidth and getheight default to 0.0 when called there

2286408
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
you define onmousedown onmouseout onmousemove and onmouseup

2286410
post	put	post	get	put	get
making an application restful usually means among other things to actually use the concept of reacting differently to get post put or delete requests on the same url

2286411
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i don t know for ie and safari but it works on firefox google-chrome and opera

my flex application is successfully calling functions in a javascript file through the externalinterface class when these are in the bin-debug folder and the js file is located in the same directory as the flex app

2286422
implements	extends
if i need a extends b but i also need to have a function that accepts a c and i want to pass a to that function then i must make either b or c an interface rather than a parent class and make it a extends b implements c or vice versa

2286476
postgresql	mysql
with shared hosting you may be allowed to open up a port to a server database my website s hosting server provides both mysql and postgresql and but allows remote access only to mysql and only via host name ip address

2286542
stdout	fflush
once you fix the previous error and get the process to close that will fflush stdout

2286542
stdout	fflush	puts	fflush
you can also consider adding fflush stdout after your puts line

post	put
have a look at this post it explains how the denormalizer works and may put you in the right direction concerning your question

2286618
pull	push
if you want someone to see your merge then you need to push pull between branches not drop back diff patch

2286658
mouseleave	mouseenter
using mouseenter and mouseleave events i set a boolean to refer to on blur event

2286668
mouseover	mouseout
then do whatever you want to in jquery with mouseover mouseout events

2286670

elementtree	beautifulsoup
in the past i ve done everything from write my own parser use regular expressions and used various parsing libraries like python s elementtree and beautifulsoup

2286844
gridview	rowdatabound
i am usin rowdatabound event of gridview to do some formating in gridview column

2286890
put	get
how can i get input from the user if they are to separate their inputs by whitespace 1 2 3 4 5 and i want to put it in an array

2286940
put	get
a simple implementation might be an instance of hashtable in a class with public static methods to get and set variables by calling the hashtable put and get methods

2286966

2287026
extjs	gxt
i m building an application using extjs for gwt gxt

2287030
width	height
if the whole matrix has a mostly constant width and height you may as well use a single vector and address cells with

2287038
width	height
if your matrix has a width of w and a height of h then mapping x y to the index in the vector is simply x w+y

2287062
uploadify	swfupload
yeah swfupload and uploadify both have ways to get them to work with rails

2287116
hide	show
- conditional questions show hide further questions when a certain option is chosen

2287155
mouse	keyboard
for the broad masses i would most likely go for solution #2 as it should suit both keyboard and mouse centric users

2287167
implements	extends
my guess is you need to override and implements this method in the widget you create the richtextarea widget in and set the custom styles in the onload method of that widget or you can extends the richtextarea and implements the onload in this extended richtextarea widget

2287182
nsimage	nsscrollview
assume i load an nsimage of dimensions 2000x2000 and display only a portion of the picture inside an nsscrollview with frame size 500x300

2287221
tabcontrol	tabitem
in my tabcontrol using wpf c#.i entering text to listbox in one tabitem from the click event in tabcontrol

2287235
folder	directory
then i would rather try to add a linked folder referencing the root directory of those classes and select that folder when exporting the project to a jar

2287262
int	double
first you need to determine whether it s a whole number or not by comparing it cast as both an int and a double

2287266
folder	directory
the folder that represent the path to the package must not be included in the directory included in the classpath only the top directory for the class folder should be there

2287318
fastcgi	scgi
idea 2 using a normal web server and adding a fastcgi cgi scgi backend to my application

2287318
fastcgi	scgi
the next thing that came to my head was using a mature but compact web server for instance lighttpd and simple provide a fastcgi scgi cgi backend to it

2287333
getter	setter
implement your own getter and setter

2287333
getter	setter
have the compiler implement getter and setter by property synchronized

2287346
ati	nvidia
but use perfhud from nvidia or gpuperfstudio from ati or gpa from intel

2287373
int	double
this is because the compiler assumed that f returned an int and the assignment converted that int to a double

2287431
actionscript	mxml
i want to convert the following code to actionscript mxml works fine

2287460
put	get
we don t know what it can handle besides a -- it could be any superclass of a all the way up to object . in this particular case it s probably safe enough but if you consider something like a list we could be in a lot of trouble you can safely put an a into a but if you assume you re only going to get a s out of it you re going to get classcastexceptions .

2287468
hide	show
1 to hide show you are better just using the hide and show mothods available on a jquery object

2287508
equals	gethashcode
as you can see i have a base class implementing a generic identifier equals gethashcode and

2287508
equals	gethashcode
providing the field with a guid value for id before adding it to the set will take me to the evil assigned ids and if you were to answer to not rely on id for equals gethashcode and to find a natural model-related key...well i don t believe i ve ever found in these properties which provide the immutabilty uniqueness a key deserves

2287532
folder	directory
how to make eclipse treat a directory containing class files as a resource directory and make it copied to the output folder bin

gridview	repeater
bind only works in the context of a databount control such a gridview repeater etc. and is used in datatemplates of those controls

2287575
postgresql	mysql
i do understand that things like postgresql arrays make it impossible to simply attach the mysql interface to any postgresql database but the database was created only through the mysql interface then there would be a guarantee that it did not contain arrays

2287624
getter	setter
i thought this was a good idea until when i encounter frameworks that require setter and getter methods

the annotation framework would then instantiate transport machine and guzzler as hidden members of car and expand to break-out the protected public characteristics in the precedence dictated by the project annotation sequence into actual source code or into byte-code

2287624
int	boolean
it would be wonderful too if the annotation plugin framework lets me specify that boolean int or whatever else needs to be converted from string and does the conversion parsing for me too

i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

valgrind	callgrind
in my comment above that sample class was originally using select but after seeing the cpu cost valgrind w callgrind i switched to epoll

haskell	ocaml

2290354
haskell	ocaml
keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful type system but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module system than haskell

2290354
haskell	ocaml
as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s

2290354
haskell	ocaml
that said learning ocaml is a great stepping-stone towards learning haskell because many of the underlying concepts are very similar so you could always migrate to haskell later and find a lot of things familiar there

udp	tcp
is that possible to find one protocol or use tcp udp to send receive 1kb data below this 300ms latency

2290921
udp	tcp
with a good broadband connection tcp should be fine and will make life easier since you have guarantees about delivery that are otherwise missing from udp

2290931
udp	tcp
a tcp header is 32 bytes while a udp header is only 16 bytes

2290931
icmp	udp
an icmp packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

2290935

if you want 4 hour increments divide the hour by 4 using integer division and then multiplying by 4 when creating the new datetime element

2291383
nunit	mstest
generally a unit testing framework such as nunit or mstest for .net stuff would be used

2291383
nunit	moq
a loose example is an mvc type test using nunit and moq

2291403
hash	salt
you also might consider a different approach one simple method would be to hash the primary key with a salt if you wish and store the hash and pk in your database

2291433
postgresql	mysql
we cannot deny the power that can be had by using a rdbms mysql postgresql ms sql server etc they have been in development for more than 30 years and many issues have been thought through and addressed

2291437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in the versions of firefox safari and google-chrome that i ve tested but i get some duplication of text in ie8

2291450
hide	show
what i am going to do is show and hide the content1 div element

2291450
hide	show
inside that div that is being show and hidden there is another text link that will hide the div

2291450
put	get
just put it all together to get it how you want it

2291490
public	protected
i think your point is since everything derives from java.lang.object and consequently accesses its protected members it wouldn t make any difference for it or any method in java.lang.object for that matter to be public as opposed to protected

2291535
getter	setter
what are getter and setter in php5

2291552
hide	show
then instead of using hide and show use toggle

2291554
getter	setter
the methods that read and return an attribute value are called getter and those that write attributes are called setter

2291559
getter	setter
for example if you want to have a certain property in your class let s say amount and give the client of you class the option to change or extract its value you should make your variable amount private not visible for those who use your class and generate two methods a getter and a setter that manipulates your value that are public

2291560
int	chars
int fortable or chars 3 fortable

2291565
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
sorting filtering grouping is really will be easy with using ria services datafilter control for silverlight

2291584
hide	show
as far as i know the accordion hide the elements that are not show and this might interfere with the loading of the page into the iframe

2291589
int	chars
i also think performance wise the int should beat the chars 3

2291641
innodb	myisam
i have a database called av2web which contains 130 myisam tables and 20 innodb tables

2291641
innodb	myisam
i wanna take mysqldump of these 20 innodb tables and export it to another database as myisam tables

2291649
outputstream	inputstream
also make sure you override parent class urlconnection.getoutputstream outputstream and urlconnection.html#getinputstream inputstream methods to return decorated outputstream and inputstream objects as well

2291668
int	double
this generally assumes that your fpu operates with the same endianness as the int part of your cpu and that â less guaranteed for double and indeed the trick is harder to make portable for 32-bit machines with 64-bit fpus

2291673
hide	show
if so then you can create a sprite and show or hide it based on an event

2291776
put	get
then i would go through each itinerary and if the destination wans t in the map i would create an entry with put destination 1 otherwise i would increment the count that was there with put destination get destination +1

2291807
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work just fine with jquery 1.4.2 firefox ie google-chrome

2291830
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit the headers appear to be fine but that bug might be the culprit...what can i use in ie google-chrome safari to test for the http requests to see if it is only firefox

2291840
istream	getline
the standard library does not provide iterators to do this although you can implement something like that on your own but you can simply use the getline function not the istream method to read a whole line from an input stream to a c++ string

2291869
hash	salt
this is why a better solution is to store a salt password hash

2291882
mouse	keyboard
if you re looking to perform user interface automation uia to simulate mouse clicks keyboard presses etc

2291908
folder	directory
and then an directory was created with properties folder and assemblyinfo.cs file only

2292016
opera	safari
however safari and opera skip all hyperlinks in a web page when tabbing

2292016
opera	safari
is there a workaround hack to make safari and or opera navigate through these links

2292063
packets	multicast
i need to determine the ip of a machine that has sent me a multicast packets so that i can respond to it via unicast

2292063
packets	multicast
i m using the following csharp .net 3.5 code to receive the packets over a multicast connection code has been edited for brevity with error checking and irrelevant options removed

2292117
post	get	subtract	add
part of the need for this is to allow calculation of times post typing for example subtract two time values to get a timespan or add several timespans to get a total

2292160
post	put
i would like to be able to use put requests instead of post

2292161
implements	extends
however from looking at tutorials objects must extends implements threads runnable however if the object is in a thread making a method call to that object seems to happen sequentially anyway

2292219
inherited	properties
this will return all my custom fields in addition to the properties inherited from

2292233
width	height
get width and height of picture and make an empty picture with the dimensions

2292243
width	height
if you want to do it yourself then from my experience you have to add multiple uiimageview with the correct position x y width height to the uiscrollview

2292267
pop-up	dialog
thats a modal dialog pop-up

2292292
width	height
before drawing the path i have scaled the canvas such that the origin is the lower left corner up is y+ right is x+ and the height and width are both 1

tested in firefox 3.5 opera 10.10 ie 6 ie 8 working everywhere

2292403
pull	push
in git he ll find out when he tries to pull changes into his local repository or push his changes to the master

2292457
put	get
if you can t get rid of the horizontal scrollbar you should at least try to put the more important columns first so that your users don t have to scroll to the right very often

2292484
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
1 assuming there is a central repository which is the case of svn and cvs but not necessarily git bazaar mercurial etc. and person a commits and then push the commit which just transfers the diffs and commit messages to the central repository person b should update it s copy manually

2292487
postgresql	mysql
or you can make the most of the fact that some very clever people worked out database theory read up normalization for the skinny and then and this is real important all the other clever folks who ve gone ahead and built relational databases like mysql postgresql sql server access oracle etc etc based everything they ve done on all that database theory

2292535
integer	unsigned
but things like cmyclass for class and uicount for unsigned integer named count does not help programmers and just leads to extra wasteful typing

2292560
expression-blend	silverlight
if you want to do better gui prototyping use silverlight and expression-blend

2292624
setinterval	clearinterval
using plain old javascript these are the setinterval and clearinterval methods

2292628
vbscript	jscript
in that thread chris nielsen has a creative idea of using a javascript library on the server side as asp supports jscript as well as vbscript

2292643
versioning	upgrade
i used an older grails versioning latest that was out in november 2009 and upgrade to 1.2.1 now

2292651
pull	push
mercurial repositories are also much easier to backup and restore you can always simply copy them but you can use push and pull to make incremental transfers to your backup location

2292701
g++	gcc
i have a c++ codebase and i am porting from visual studio to g++ which should i set in visual studio so that build errors in gcc are reduced

2292743
haskell	scheme
haskell is a little different with its lazy evaluation model effectively automatically producing the effect of closures in many cases but in scheme you end up using lambdas for control flow a lot

2292763
post	get
you will have to somehow remember this from the time you the server are handling the post until you are handling the get

2292797
cassini	iis
quoting from what are the dis advantages of using cassini instead of iis

2292826
versioning	upgrade
sometimes you re upgrading and need to test on both versioning during the upgrade

2292826
versioning	upgrade
sometimes you want to upgrade your internal apps but you re using a software package that is only certified on an older versioning

2292831
min	max
but that s just a min certainly not a max

2292832
ienumerable	idictionary
you can add your extensions to idictionary or ienumerable if you want

2292837
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
though urls are case-sensitive if you want to make your routes case-insensitive there is a dirty hack you can do

2292872
getter	setter
now i see inside the class that contains 10-12 members some with getter setter methods

2292881
google-chrome	safari
in light of the cookie-handling bugs affecting safari and google-chrome see this thread and pylons implementation of redirect_to as an exception is it possible to reliably set a tracking cookie and redirect at the same time

2292919
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in both .htaccess and httpd.conf but that doesn t work

2292929
comparator	comparable
i want the children to be in a particular order based on comparable a custom comparator like a search tree even if i insert them out of order like this

2292949
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works fine for me in safari google-chrome and firefox 3.5

2292949
firefox	safari
inspecting the element in safari or web developer firefox plugin does not reveal anything unusual either

2292967
opera	firefox
a quick comparison between opera 10.10 ie 6 and firefox 3.6 all on winxp sp3 - opera and ie show slightly larger fonts

2292967
gentoo	linux	opera	firefox
update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

2293011
stdout	stderr
with this you will be redirecting the stderr which is descriptor 2 to the file descriptor 1 which is the the stdout

2293011
stdout	stderr
combining the two commands will result in redirecting both stderr and stdout to sample.s

2293042
puts	gets
third postrunnable does not take effect immediately but rather puts things on a message queue for the main application thread to process when it gets a chance

2293090
haskell	ocaml
as an examples of haskell and ocaml in machine learning see stuff at hal daume and lloyd allison homepages

2293090
haskell	ocaml
imo it s is much more straightforward to achieve c++-like performance in ocaml than in haskell

2293147
integer	unsigned
each uiview can have a unique tag associated with it which is just an unsigned integer

2293177
doc	rtf
itâ s a webservice that supports various formats of input docx doc rtf txt and output docx doc html pdf jpg gif...

2293183
expression-blend	silverlight
i had a very talented and smart graphic designer working for me at one stage and convinced her to use expression-blend so she could stylise my silverlight apps

2293203
inherited	properties
when you make a control that is inherited from control you have to make use of a couple of properties such as isdesignmode you can then construct event handlers especially for within design mode

2293255
exponent	modulo
then i can get modulo and exponent of the rsa public key in byte

2293255
exponent	modulo
but it seems like rsapublic.modulus and rsapublic.exponent are not in this format there are many not-digits in the byte of the modulo and exponent

2293281
getter	setter
a semantic can be a setter getter other property or addon removeon or fire event p317

2293282
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine in google-chrome and safari but not the latest version of firefox 3.6 on the pc

2293316
exponent	modulo
it looks like you can get the byte arrays by getting an rsaparameters object via rsacryptoserviceprovider.exportparameters and then extracting from this the exponent and modulo fields

2293333
postgresql	mysql
edit i created an empty django project - default django configuration plus django.contrib.admin and fresh empty database tried both with mysql and postgresql

2293359
setinterval	settimeout
i ve looked at settimeout and setinterval and these appear to just delay the execution of a script whereas i want to literally timeout a long running process

2293378
google-chrome	safari
except for webkit the rendering engine in safari and google-chrome which has a totally custom made-up-by-dave-hyatt not-even-in-css-3 property value -webkit-background-clip text

2293378
google-chrome	safari
no other browser other than safari and google-chrome supports it

2293395
dlsym	dlopen
dlfcn.h dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose

2293396
opensolaris	bsd
if you want to know and understand this technology just create a virtual single machine install bsd linux opensolaris etc

2293422
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	jboss	resin	glassfish	weblogic	glassfish	resin	weblogic	resin
you can pay for a java ee app server weblogic websphere or use an open source one jboss glassfish and openejb and activemq or you can stick to spring and deploy on tomcat jetty resin or any other servlet jsp engine

2293476
rss	feed
sun have an rss utilities library that was built for creating feed

2293518
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to upgrade to the latest versioning of the .net provider for firebird

2293541
yacc	bison
you should never access yylval directly in the yacc bison file as its not reliable

2293541
yacc	bison
to make this work for non-terminals you need to use type declarations for them in the yacc bison file and the rules for those non terminals need to set eg

2293560
hash	md5
interoperability as has already been mentioned is very much in ldap s favour with some types of server software although much of the software that integrate with ldap require a specific schema so it s not necessarily as simple as just installing and configuring an ldap service and off you go - you might need to add new elements in the schema for each app you want to interact with and each application might have different limitations with regard to authentication for example plain text password fields password fields as md5 or sha hash etc

2293571
extjs	smartgwt
not as good looking as smartgwt or extjs but a lot quicker

2293580
hive	hdfs
if you know sql you could take a look at using hive ql to query the hdfs

2293581
cpu	processors
a prof once told us in class that windows linux os x and unix scale on threads and not processes so threads would likely benefit your application even on a single processors because your application would be getting more time on the cpu

2293587
for-loop	loops
however when i proceed to claim a hash map outside the for-loop and expect the hash map is updated after loops it turns out that the hash map stays empty

2293592
implements	extends
i am trying to implements a method for finding the boudning box of rectangle circle location and the group which all extends shape

2293602
cpu	processors
a prof once told us in class that windows linux os x and unix scale on threads and not processes so threads would likely benefit your application even on a single processors because your application would be getting more time on the cpu

2293687
haskell	agda
as in languages like agda clean coq and haskell

2293695
post	get
i ll be sure to post my results once i get everything sorted out and working for my project

2293703
int	double
it has a int double and string constructors so you can simply have

2293708
qtextedit	qvboxlayout
also i have a qtextedit visible by default which is in a qvboxlayout with the qhboxlayout that hold the buttons

2293708
hide	show
so the problem is this when i hide the qtextedit and show the other buttons the window won t resize

2293708
min	max
is there a way to resize the window and while taking care of the min and max size of a widget

2293748
apache	nginx
unfortunately apache doesn t have a reliable push service like nginx

2293768
free	malloc
if the pointer is getting changed a lot you may have to write some code around malloc and free to keep track of which values are good and bad

2293781
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to a newer versioning of ruby easily it should give you that method on the range

2293782
int	chars
provided that you know the size of the data structure you can represent that size in some number of chars s or int s

2293782
int	chars
there are a few caveats...both the sender and receiver need to agree on the interpretation of the message contents and the buffer that you provide on the sending and receiving side needs to fit into some definable number of chars s or int s

2293821
client-side	server-side
another good example is webform validations the client-side validation scripts are all generated dynamically at the server-side

2293902
hash	salt
also is using a salt frivolous since security in regards of rainbow table attack mean nothing to this and the hash could later be used as a checksum

2293904
ceil	floor
in how to ceil floor and round bcmath numbers

2293947
x86	64bit
so if you app was working in 32-bit you should try setting the compiler options in the project properties to explicitly produce an x86 32-bit app which should run on both 32-bit and 64bit

2293948
hash	md5
sha1 is a safer hash function than md5 which also means it s slower which probably means you should use md5

2293961
getter	setter
for a getter and setter for an attribute

2293968
dictionary	map
i have some global dictionary keyed by the unique numeric id s for lecturers and projects that map to objects

2293972
wan	lan
in a lan wan situation you need to make sure nothing is connecting them to the outside world except through the proxy

2294037
folder	directory
if the third-party app ignores the current directory you could make a symlink to it in a different folder

2294044
hide	show
this is a great tutorial on getting started with jquery which covers show hide effects which is what you want to look at to achieve the functionality you ve described.

2294097
put	get
if someone wants to steal software and willing to put in the time and effort to do so they will be able to get it - no matter how good it is

2294102
strstr	substr
don t use substr â use strstr strnstr

2294146
daemon	cron
you just need some communication between a privileged daemon or frequent cron and the cgi script

2294146
daemon	cron
have the cgi script create a file if the daemon or cron finds it have it restart the service and unlink the file

2294167
i2c	spi
you basically have to read the datasheet for the device you are wanting to interface with and read and write to its memory over whatever interface it might use spi i2c uart etc.

2294219
client-side	server-side
important client-side validation is not a substitution for server-side validation

2294221
min	max
an easy way to get the max and min value in an array is as follows

2294221
min	max
this has been explained at get max min values in array

2294232
klocwork	coverity
i suspect they cost more than youâ re willing to pay but both coverity and klocwork do serious checking for memory leaks along with lots of other things

2294238
geocoding	geocode
assuming you are asking whether you should do your geocoding with javascript or a server side language like php best practice is to cache whatever geocoding you can into some sort of persistance layaer xml db whatever and minimise the number of client side geocode requests because of the delay it will introduce

2294270
client-side	server-side
however google offers its geocoding services through a client-side api in javascript and though a server-side web service

2294270
client-side	server-side
server-side geocoding is limited to 15k requests per day per server while client-side geocoding is limited to 15k requests per day per client

2294272
hide	show
the way i ve built it and have done this before on a smaller scale with no problem is to imagemap the main image of the usa give each area an id then use jquery to show hide an absolutely positioned div overtop of the map

2294272
mouseover	mouseenter
as you can see i ve experimented with various functions including mouseover mouseenter and hover

2294314
memcached	apc
if the boost is not so significant i m going to replace apc with memcached

2294331
spaces	linefeed
first create regexp that replaces all comments with equally number of spaces and linefeed so that row and col positions won t change

2294334
quicksort	mergesort
you could present the questions through the algorithms of quicksort or mergesort

2294347
memcached	apc
apc and memcached are not the same things

2294347
memcached	apc
you can use either apc or memcached or both as a data-cache that s what we are doing on the project i m currently working on some data are cached in apc and some others using memcached

2294421
haskell	scheme	erlang	scheme
if you re a java c++ c# kind of guy learn something that will really torque your brain like haskell erlang or scheme

2294473
kohana	yii
almost all php frameworks use the long form symphony yii kohana

2294494
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
jquery tabs is not working on ie8 - working fine on firefox safari google-chrome ie7

2294519
implements	extends
why hashmap extends abstractmap and implements map

2294519
implements	extends
is extends abstractmap not sufficient because abstractmap implements map

2294664
mouseover	mouseenter
to make it work you need to change mouseenter to use mouseover

2294684
jboss	glassfish
these modules can be used to load balance across servlet containers such as tomcat jetty or ejb containers such as jboss glassfish

2294745
put	get
i could not get your question fully but i assume you want the vehicle facility to be selected after form is submitted you put javascript to use for that

2294822
put	get
to ensure all widgets get this new style you need to put your css file in the .gwt.xml file in the following way the order of lines is important

2294832
opera	google-chrome
also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons

2294840
pellet	jess
both pellet and jess can primarily be used as semantic reasoners

2294840
pellet	jess
i have not use sweetrules reasoner before but it seems that it supports both swrl and jess rules therefore this reasoner can be helpfull in crossing between jess and pellet

2294858
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed this behaviour in both google-chrome and firefox so i m assuming there s a specific reason for it

2294903
pull	push
the proposal is to change the default to upstream push only the current branch and push it to the branch git pull would pull from

2294905
google-chrome	firefox
well this works for me tested on google-chrome 4 firefox 3.6 ie8

2294914
pull	push
so i have nothing to do with push or pull

2294984
tabcontrol	tabitem
while clicking a button i want to add a new tabitem s to the tabcontrol

2295011
int	double
i would like to prevent this automatic conversion from double to int or at least get warnings at compile time

2295061
firefox	safari
the portion causes jquery to throw an exception in safari 4 and firefox 3.5

2295070
versioning	upgrade
i don t see anything wrong with your config so try to upgrade log4j to a newer not necessarily the latest versioning

2295079
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a checkbox a dropdownlistfor and a text box

2295126
hide	show
as long as you maintain a reference to any node you can affect its style property via hide show etc

2295133
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you can hook up jquery to asynchronously call a controller action when for example a checkbox is checked or a dropdownlistfor changes

2295143
pull	push
the difference is that you don t construct them push based collection but rather you get next element from them pull based collection

2295146
maven	m2e
using generated sources is well supported by m2e use maven update project configuration once sources have been generated and if i remember well by the maven eclipse plugin as well the folder will be added to the java build path

2295189
sorting	filtering
i use imodelbinder for grid s settings binding expression trees for sorting and filtering data

2295190
hide	show
what i want to do is to have a storyboard animation to show hide the menu on the left-hand side

2295203
folder	directory
- it tries to access format file right in working directory root while this file supposed to be in .svn folder

2295237
width	height
i m trying to make a textblock control with a fixed size height and width in a window

2295292
post	get
you should not use post and get variables directly in your array

2295311
width	height
for some reason it does not display the width and height of the li

2295320
width	height
declare the a element as display inline-block and drop the width and height from the li element

2295320
width	text-align
the first method allows you to have a dynamically centered list if you give the ul element a width of 100 so that it spans from left to right edge and then apply text-align center

2295322
width	height
using width height on inline elements is not always a good idea

16-bit	64bit
as said in the comment please drop turbo c and if you use it turbo c++ nowadays they are both pieces of history and have many incompatibilities with the current c and c++ standards and if i remember well they both generate 16-bit executables that won t even run on 64bit oses on x86_64

2295340
g++	gcc
there are a lot of free working and standard-compliant alternatives vc++ express mingw pelles c cygwin on windows and gcc g++ is the de-facto standard on linux rivaled by clang you just have to pick one

2295405
cgpoint	cgrect
as i also need to store nspoints cgpoint nsrect cgrect nscolor uicolor and nsimage uiimage structs objects in my model i m not sure what the best way to handle them would be

2295463

freebsd	debian
when i m happy with my changes i push them to a test server freebsd apache for the client s feedback and then when they re happy push the changes to the production server debian apache

2295497
pull	push
you are basically right if you only have one repository you will never need to use push or pull

2295593

the answer depends a lot if you re working alone or on team and the method used to share and transfer files subversion git smb ftp ...

2295735
folder	directory
when extensions are installed via the joomla admin panel joomla will create folder that i want to add to svn but these folder are created by the apache user and i do not have write permission or root access which prevents svn from adding .svn directory within

2295790
post	get
sql injections rights management illegal data access via post get data tempering

2295800
client-side	server-side
you d better use json or any other format if you want to treat data client-side before submiting them but please leave sql for server-side processing

2295817
firefox	safari
i have tested your code seems fine in firefox safari on the mac and ie7 on the pc

2295817
width	height
have you tried declaring the width height of the surrounding div tag as well

2295847
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome

2295847
width	margin
i want the padding margin and width of the first 5 columns to be maintained but pushed to the left yet the table should expand as wide as its parent

2295847
google-chrome	firefox
how can i get this to work in firefox google-chrome and ie

2295901

2295963
ubuntu	linux
there is a package called chm2pdf under ubuntu linux

2296016
inherited	subclassing	public	protected
in my code i create a subclassing for example if i have a datalayer class which has all the public methods to access the data layer then i might subclassing it with a test_datalayer subclassing which inherited methods from datalayer and which furthermore implements any additional methods that you might want like delete and whose implementation can access internal or protected methods of the base class

2296040
qprogressbar	qwidget
this will draw the qprogressbar into the qwidget

2296111
nunit	mstest
i am not sure how to run unit tests without visual studio but i had moved to nunit from mstests and its reasonably easy - as long as you don t use the test context from mstest can t remember the real name all you have to do is to rename the tags testclass - testfixture etc there is always 1-1 mapping and change the usings

2296136
webclient	webrequest
it s certainly doable with either the webclient classes or ftp webrequest webresponse series of classes - and i can give you some sample code if required - but unless you have some specific business case for rolling your own something like rsync may be the better choice

2296153
children	parent
every time you change a parent you will create a copy of the children if the parent data changes a lot then you will eat up your storage quite quickly

2296153
children	parent
also storing all the child changes within a single parent record will tend to bloat the parent as having lots of children tends to which might have implications for the performance of data retrieval

2296211
margin	height
when the last cell is displayed the imageview textlabel and accessoryview are all maintaining the same margin from the bottom of the cell rather than maintaining their position in the center of the cell like they do on the other rows of smaller height

2296233
width	margin
give the inner a negative margin to negate the padding and fill the width example

2296252
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
linux executables do not have version information like windows have...the only way i can think of doing it is to create a static character string which would be expanded by a version control tracking system such as rcs cvs svn git in which a certain identifier is expanded based on the person who checked-in the code here s the example of rcs identifiers that is used.

2296303
folder	directory
furthermore this project folder should be what goes into your trunk branches and tags directory

the host that i use has auto installs for oscommerce zen cart and nopcommerce

2296395
post	get
lately i ve been using a wrapper php class that fetches get and post data and lets me access it using a single getter function

2296395
post	get
after years of developing web applications i ve never had a single good reason to care whether an incoming var was coming from post or get

2296395
post	get
today i noticed that codeigniter has one getter function for post data and one for get

2296395
post	get
a couple of clarifications i m not asking about the differences between post or get or which one i should use to send data to a page

2296395
post	get
i m asking about whether i should care if data is arriving to my page via get or post

2296413
post	get
you could care about the difference whether you want your data coming from a form post or it being submitted through url-parameters get

2296416
int	double
from a geocoder object you can call the getfromlocation double double int method

2296420
post	get
but when security is at stake you might well care about the difference if somebody s putting a normally hidden input in a get variable and you treat just as if it came from a post it s a potential attack vector

2296420
post	put	post	get	put	get
in restful apis you definitely care about the difference post means a completely different thing than get in this case along with its much-neglected cousins put and delete

2296430
cldc	midp
i am trying to develop a tcp client that runs on mobile devices using midp 2.0 and cldc 1.1

2296440
tcplistener	tcpclient
i setup the tcplistener in a server in japan and the tcpclient in uk

2296440
tcplistener	tcpclient
i kept sending 500 bytes to the tcplistener and when tcplistener sends 10kb back to the tcpclient

2296440
tcplistener	tcpclient
for all loops i only have one tcpclient and it keeps the connection with tcplistener and do the send receive for 500 times

2296440
tcplistener	tcpclient
how can they be faster than raw tcpclient tcplistener in my experiments

2296471
hash	salt
from your description of the problem you are not trying to create a secure hash - merely hide the file in a large namespace - in which case use of a salt rainbow tables are irrelevant - the only consideration is the likelihood of a false collision where 2 different files give the same hash

2296476
post	get
if you care about security why would you accept data sent by your forms via get if you know your form method was post

2296482
post	get
if you feel hacky use both and differentiate say allow to preserve semi-persistent config by encoding it in get and encouraging to bookmark the page while filling post with strictly volatile stuff

2296514
qtcore	qtgui
the problem is that when i build library b and run ldd on the executable it is being linked to qtcore and qtgui both of which are pulling in lots of unrequired files resulting in an executable that is taking long to load and has unwanted dependencies

2296525
rss	feed
use case is i am getting data from arbitrary sources and making a rss feed for that data

2296525

note canvas is a new feature and is only supported in recent browser releases latest safari firefox or google-chrome for example

2296648
gif	png

i ve only tested that with explorer and firefox but i d be happy to help you get it running with safari if you want

2296780
google-chrome	firefox
when i navigate directly to the svg it renders fine in firefox 3.5 3.6 and google-chrome but when i inline it verifying i have the right doctype and xml namespaces both firefox and google-chrome just display a pile of text from within the svg

2296780
google-chrome	firefox
i then attempted to change my content type served up to force it to be application xhtml+xml but when forced into a xhtml valid mode both firefox and google-chrome refuse to give dojo access to everything in the dom that is required for it to work

2296780
google-chrome	firefox
i have also attempted to display the svg stand alone through an tag which seems to work fine in google-chrome but firefox 3.5 3.6 refuses to display the svg in a dijit.contentpane though again navigating directly to the document displays the picture

is it possible to fade out the text inside a textbox and textarea and leave the actual element in place

2297126
ubuntu	debian
if you re on debian ubuntu it s fairly easy to set up an apache environment

2297154
versioning	upgrade
sadly the older versioning of this export is too far removed and unoptimized to be able to upgrade it to work with some of the more modern browsers

2297170
trie	tree
you could store your information in a trie of some sort perhaps a ternary search tree

2297193
getter	setter
also make sure to use immutable objects where appropriate instead of always using some stupid java bean class with all public getter and setter

2297238
profiler	gprof
even if you get gprof to work or a similar profiler you re likely to be disappointed

2297269
google-chrome	firefox
well your code worked for me running google-chrome 5.0.307.9 and firefox 3.5.8 on ubuntu 9.10 though i switched

2297294
children	parent
in other words if you have a class parent with multiple children would parent have an instance of a collection of children or would these be separately requested

2297306
srp	principles
now that the class is huge and that getdescription also sets a description are not a direct violation of the srp but of different principles

2297311
udp	tcp
what is the nature of the communication over the multicast sockets and how sensitive are you to data loss udp does not garuntee arrival like tcp ip

2297317
exponent	modulo
there is a rsa modulo n and the two usual rsa exponent d and e such that ed 1 modulo p-1 and q-1 where n pq

2297317
exponent	modulo
this means that trusted web servers will need to compute things with a big modulo and a big exponent and without knowing the modulo factors

2297317
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

2297317
ecdsa	rsa
from the central authority point of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signatures per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signatures per second with a 1024-bit key

2297317
ecdsa	rsa
the ecdsa signatures consist in two 192-bit integers 384 bits to encode while the rsa signatures are 1024-bit long

gridview	linqdatasource
the users of my web app need to filter a long list of items in a gridview accessed via a linqdatasource

2297552
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout 2 1 redirects stderr to the same place as stdout

2297557
post	get
the next or probably first step you should take would be to change your form from get to post as it is in most cases a bad idea to send form data via get

2297563
stdout	stderr
the compiler warnings happen on stderr not stdout which is why you don t see them when you just redirect make somewhere else

2297563
stdout	stderr
the means redirect stdout and stderr to this location

the c# type aliases bool byte chars decimal double float int long object sbyte short string uint ulong ushort aren t part of the bcl system namespace they re actually part of the c# language

2297638
width	height
all you need to do is modify the line cgcontextdrawimage and alter the width and height parameters

2297638
width	height
cgcontextdrawimage context cgrectmake 0 0 width 2 height 2 image.cgimage

2297638
width	height
will draw 1 4 of the image as its height and width are being doubled past the textures size

2297639
folder	directory
if it s really just one folder and you re running on windows you can set up security to prevent everyone from creating folder in that directory

2297659
config	ini
you could switch to a xml ini config file that s stored in the user s application data folder or possibly even the my documents folder

2297676
gif	png
you can load any supported image file type jpg gif png etc using image.fromfile image.fromstream etc

2297825
qsort	bsearch
that sort and compare using the qsort function how do i use bsearch to find subsets of my list

2297833
webkit	gecko
though it would be awkward to ensure cross-browser compatibility given the differences between trident gecko webkit and presto

2297833
width	height
i d recommend using css-sprites for the background colouring of each cell if they re going to be a predictable height width just to conserve some bandwidth

2297833
width	height
to have one div generate the colour for three areas assuming a fixed height width of each div of 100px

2297839

2297965
google-chrome	firefox
also since it s javascript it should now also work on firefox google-chrome etc

2297975
vb.net	vb6
works with vb6 and vb.net

2297994
client-side	server-side
another candidate might be javascript or some kind of dsl to javascript bridge as that would allow the strategy to run either client-side or server-side

you re doing a post so put it in the form

2298056
post	get
post action should return same result for post an get by fallowing code

2298107
hash	salt
i would hash my user id and the salt

2298107
hash	salt
the validating application knows the salt so it hash the same values

2298130
jar	war
rather than have that base class as a class in each war file i want to move it to its own jar that each of the other projects can reference

2298177
superclass	subclassing
superclass receive this message before their subclassing

2298255
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
in place of the comment -- if this was the fault of the caller of your class throw illegalargumentexception or illegalstateexception as appropriate

2298264
stdout	stderr
in this case to pipe stderr you d want to do something like this which merges stderr with stdout before piping

2298324
converter	multibinding
i ve seen similar behavior when dealing with multibinding with multiple converter but not on a simple binding

2298329
free	strdup
i used strdup free since it was the easiest way to copy the string

2298329
free	malloc
in the question you were leaking memory since you d malloc with no matching free

all major databases including sql server mysql and postgresql support this keyword

2298580
switching	screens
my app has 5 different relative layouts that it can switching between by using a set of buttons that is at the bottom of the screens

2298580
textview	imageview
3 of the layouts contain only textview and imageview

2298609
webclient	httpwebrequest
then in your code you would create an httpwebrequest httpwebresponse or webclient and then fetch the url and get the contents

2298612
firefox	safari
tested in firefox linux firefox winxp ie winxp safari winxp

2298612

if any part of your app needs explanatory text you should incorporate it into the ui directly either alongside the relevant ui elements or in pop-up dialog that appear the first time you visit that section of your app

2298799
post	get
notice that the form uses the post method not get

2298810
spweb	splist
if your title is full of special characters or something else is demanding you to be able to have a simpler name to grab the list i recommend doing it by the id of the spweb or splist their collections generally accept a guid as parameters and if they don t there s a method for that

2298817
put	get
i have everything set up perfectly when i tell the service to toast when it is started and destroyed but as soon as i put the media play-in in there instead it starts fine and starts playing the music but as soon as a click a button to stop the service i get an error and a force close

textview	imageview
the listview widgets are resizable and textview imageview widgets are not

2298981
ant	maven
i ve been a maven user victim for over 5 years now and i have to say that it will save you far more time to just check your dependencies into your source repository and write nice and simple ant tasks

2299011
src	attr
attr src imghref

2299023
width	height
things should get a higher height and width value so that more information can be displayed

2299087
srp	principles
it s better to have 2 different controllers for displaying a widget and for editing settings i cast srp principles here

2299117

2299117
post	get
how do i get the post data on the init function

2299176

2299188
debian	linux
as far as i am concerned i use debian linux for all my parallel stuff

2299250
debian	linux	uptime	reboot
this is happening on a workstation that regularly reaches months of uptime i only reboot it when critical security patches affecting my trimmed down and hardened debian linux are issued which really doesn t happen often and on which applications never crash making it very unlikely that it s an hardware issue on that machine more below

2299250
debian	linux
note that the exact same application on exactly the same hardware with exactly the same jvm but another version of linux i had debian etch previously did not trigger that sigsegv once

2299293
debian	linux
version of linux i had debian etch

2299294
post	get
i don t think it s possible to get the post data but others might have a way

2299300
rowdatabound	onclientclick
in my rowdatabound event i call the javascript function showmodal from button s onclientclick event

2299306
int	double
formatted input for anything but the basic types int double etc. doesn t make a lot of sense and arguably only from them when taken from a non-interactive stream such as an istringstream

2299350
dictionary	map
when the som has stabilized dictionary words near to each other in your metric are near to each other in the topology of the map from which you get the encoding trivially as binary words

2299352
post	get
also consider some security testing of an application - sql injections rights management illegal data access via post get data tampering xss etc

2299358
cassini	iis
we finally figured out that using cassini the built in visual studio iis to host the listenerservice backend was causing the problem

2299369
width	height
i wouldn t recommend programmatically forcing an arbitrary height and width

2299369
width	height
the best thing to do is use the form s onclose event to save the form s height and width and then set the height and width with oncreate

2299370
put	get
so you are going to need to put some thought into which edges of which components get anchored and which don t

2299417
sudoers	passwd
currently the linux boxes are all standalone and use the usual etc passwd authentications etc group groups etc sudoers sudoers and so forth

free	malloc
however and this is a common case if the memory was allocated by the new operator in c++ or a call to malloc in c then you have to expose a function in unmanaged code through interop which will free the memory appropriately

2299535
free	malloc
in the case of malloc you would create a function that takes a pointer and calls free on that pointer

2299575
vim	emacs
emacs or vim would allow you to do this for most languages

2299619
google-chrome	firefox
this should work tested in firefox and google-chrome

2299643
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
this gives you the way to create simple dropdowns that degrade properly work across all major browsers ie opera safari firefox and its very lightweight 12 lines of javascript

int	double
trying to display a double as an int type d or vice versa can give you strange output

2299781
cvs	svn
well there is a migrator tool for migrating from cvs to svn but i don t think it allows you to merge the projects while importing

2299781
cvs	svn
you could try import the cvs repository as a branch into svn and then merge it with the trunk

2299784
hide	show
once the slideshow starts over the images don t show up yet when it goes to load the following image it plays the tween from the hide previous function which show the image briefly before fading out

2299789
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox but when using google-chrome when the facebook login window opens it starts gradually resizing itself until it becomes a narrow column - when manually resizing the window it gradually reverts back to the narrow column

2299795
opera	firefox
some browsers at least firefox opera and ie support this

2299805
cvs	svn
you can try to use cvs to svn bridge but i strongly recommend to switch to svn

2299808
cvs	svn
besides cvs is deprecated so if you have a choice between the two use svn

2299813
disk	ram
the other interesting metric here is privatedirty which is basically the amount of ram inside the process that can not be paged to disk it is not backed by the same data on disk and is not shared with any other processes

2299813
dumpsys	adb
a common one is the command adb shell dumpsys meminfo which will spit out a bunch of information about the memory use of each java process containing the above info as well as a variety of other things

2299813
dumpsys	adb
you can also tack on the name or pid of a single process to see for example adb shell dumpsys meminfo system give me the system process

2299842
cvs	svn
in order to use both tools you need a replication system so you can have a cvs and svn repository both represent the same source code

2299864
osql	powershell
sql server 2008 provides an osql powershell cmdlet called invoke-sqlcmd that does that same type of thing as osql from powershell

2299927
libpcap	wireshark
i would fire up wireshark to make sure you are actually getting incoming packets if this is the case then i would use libpcap to track in icmp replies

2299945
google-chrome	safari
i m working on a site where these bugs randomly appear in safari and google-chrome

2299962
outputstream	inputstream
if the socket s outputstream has not been flushed the inputstream on the other end of the connection may block waiting for input while the outputstream blocks waiting to fill its buffer

2299968
udp	tcp
tcp and udp handle that queue differently though
