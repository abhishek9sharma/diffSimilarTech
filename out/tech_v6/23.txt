you ll need to show it client-side rather than using mpestep1.show otherwise it s not going to get around to displaying until the server-side stuff is finished anyway

1300438
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
however this mapping is an implementation decision for example an entity-relationship diagram may contain three entities triangle square and circle and these could potentially be modelled as a single table shape

1300470
children	parent
let your server s domain logic handle the bit about keeping the parent record consistent with that of its children

1300526
stdout	stderr
it will redirect stderr to stdout so hopefully you should see why it s not working

1300528

it runs under current google-chrome filefox opera ie8

1300748
google-chrome	firefox
it s not an issue in neither firefox or google-chrome

1300771
children	parent
the parent nodes represent parent parts and the children represent parts that make up the parent

1300771
children	parent
in some cases the user will check the checkbox at the parent level to indicate they are replacing the entire part with all its children

1300771
children	parent
what i need help with is hiding the children when the parent checkbox is checked

1300816
cobertura	emma
i d also spend some time setting up something like emma or cobertura big fan of cobertura so you have some hard metrics by which to assess people s tests

1300859

1301149
division	addition
basically a very fast vector addition and division

1301160
post	get
you re really asking how to perform one of two actions with a single form which kind of breaks the form model a form is designed to perform an action get or post on a single url

1301203
cvs	svn	folder	directory
i recently converted my cvs repository to svn using cvs2svn and i recently noticed that every directory has a hidden folder called .svn

1301209

there is a javascript property on the dom object that will tell you the height of the tag if you have the width set

1301225
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	g++	gcc
although having a little experience i am still confused with the question of whether it is necessary to install an application and or build a c++ program or c++ library under network file system shared by machines which have different linux version centos release 4.7 ubuntu 8.10 possibly different bit 32-bit 64-bit and different versions of compiler gcc g++ 3.4.6 20060404 red hat 3.4.6-10 gcc g++ ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu12 4.3.2. so that the executable or library files can be used under those different machines

1301225
g++	gcc
for example on a network file system i have an executable built from my c++ program under a machine with centos release 4.7 x86_64 ad gcc g++ 3.4.6 20060404 red hat 3.4.6-10

1301225
g++	gcc
i surprisedly find that the executable can be used under another machine with ubuntu 8.10 x86_64 and gcc g++ ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu12 4.3.2

1301258
apache	nginx
this is if you are ready to place nginx in the front as the revproxy and place apache and couchdb both as backends

1301375
division	multiplication
obviously after the multiplication has overflowed the division isn t going to undo that overflow

1301385
switching	screens
another option would be screens which lets you have multiple textual sessions open and switching between them

1301412
addition	multiplication
if you ve studied different algebraic structures as part of your math curriculum then you know that square matrices form an algebra with 3 operations addition multiplication and multiplication by scalar

1301426
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code below is tested and working in ie 6 7 8 firefox 2 3 3.5 opera 9 10 safari 3 4 and google-chrome

1301432
int	double
byte an int type and double a floating point type not an int type are not bitwise compatible you can t just bitshift to values of a bunch of bytes into a floating point type and expect an equivalent result.

1301432
int	double
1 assuming the byte array is a memory buffer referencing an int value you should be able to convert your byte array into a 128-bit int via bit-shifting and then convert that resulting int into a double

1301502
pbx	ivr
some of the vectors that are coded into the pbx are super important in that if they re changed in the wrong way pretty much all of our telephony arena applications and features go haywire ivr cti crm and acd

queue	fifo
fifo queue style processing

1301550
emacs	gedit	gedit	bbedit
emacs has tramp mode gedit on linux and bbedit on the mac support remote editing too

1301557
queue	fifo
for example to make a thread-safe queue with a different queueing discipline than fifo one imports queue subclasses queue.queue and overrides such methods as _get and _put

1301557
put	get
client code never calls those hook methods but rather the organizing public methods such as put and get this is known as the template method design pattern -- see here for an interesting presentation based on a video of a talk of mine on the subject with the addition of synopses of the transcript

1301583
pop-up	dialog
it has 2 dialog boxes that pop-up during the search

1301588

is there an expandable array class in the java api equivalent to the vector or arraylist class that can be used with primitives int chars double etc

1301594
versioning	upgrade
the biggest problem i have had with grails is every time i upgrade to a new versioning it seems to break things that were previously working

1301696
mouseover	mousemove
edit it appears as thought the mousemove event isn t binding for earlier elements than the one currently being dragged should be bound upon their mouseover

1301719
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
theres a section where i have a tab bar not using uitabbarcontroller which is manageed by the same uinavigationcontroller i simply add the uitabbar to the navigation controllers view by using addsubview

managed	loaderlock
to disable go to debug - exceptions - managed debugging assistants and uncheck loaderlock

1301777
children	parent
the problem i m having is that this image disappears when you hover over a parent menu item s children

1301785
goto	break
in my solution i wanted to map nearly to what you are doing an infinite goto unless break

1301805
put	get
the only way to get similar behavior loosely similar is to put a label within an update panel that is getting updated on that partial postback and set its value to something which would only take the one line of code to set it .

1301815
webrat	cucumber
i am working on rails with rspec rspec-rails cucumber and webrat

1301841
vbscript	jscript
what i do know is that an arraylist in c# turns into a standard collection in com usable by vbscript vb jscript 5.x etc

1301863

the 4 http methods commonly used are get post put and delete

1301900
post	get
in general and not limited to get and post but also to any data that comes from outside the system including cookies in the case of web applications

1301902
post	get
if you take any get or post variable and effectively execute it without passing it through a filter of some sorts you are opening yourself up to injection attacks

1301920
int	double
in this particular case almost nothing was done except define gam vec normv etc and create an implicit definition from symbol to int or double reading from a table where you ll store such definitions later on such as with a loadm equivalent

1301921
post	get
it extends to a bit more than just get or post

1301930
children	parent
you need to wrap the children inside the parent and then .hover on the parent only

1301930
children	parent
since children is inside the parent so when you hover the children you are still hovering the parent

1301944
post	get
you can t do that with javascript to solve your problem or use method post instead of get or use nocache random parameter trick

1301972
post	get
get and post data is data directly sent from the user

1302086
width	height
width and height represent the width height of the viewport area in tiles

upgrade to the trunk versioning of redmine

1302145
bazaar	git
all three of the modern dvcses git mercurial and bazaar can tell when you last merged and won t try to remerge changesets that have already been merged

1302159
put	get
the reason why its so long is the sareplacement hrmsadminreplacement hrmanagerreplacement and payrolladminreplacement can all be null so i put in a check to ensure they are not null so the rest of the clause does not get executed

1302166
public	protected
there√¢ s public private and protected to enforce access instead of python√¢ s _voluntary_ underscore __convention__

1302188
multiplying	add
however if you use or multiplying the points by 1.3333334 or maybe even just add 0.0001 to the pixel measurement it offsets things just enough that you actually get fs22 or fs28 rather than fs21 or fs27 respectively

1302212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it behaves as expected in firefox google-chrome and safari

1302231

with respect to versioning especially semantic versioning patching will upgrade a software s patch versioning number and updates upgrade their minor versioning number

1302322
innodb	myisam
if your index is small enough to fit in memory make sure your my.cnf allocates enough memory to key_buffer myisam or innodb_buffer_pool_size innodb you should be able to preload it using

1302347
children	parent
hit parent first then the children then the next nodes

1302359
innodb	myisam
are these myisam or innodb tables

1302365

i ve found that if i have a working application and i put an app_offline.htm file in the root and then rename the bin folder my app_offline.htm file does not get displayed

1302592
phpmyadmin	heidisql
since you re on windows i can highly recommend heidisql over phpmyadmin for working with mysql

1302601
versioning	upgrade
the biggest reason for that is if you have multiple applications that use the same libraries and want to upgrade to a new versioning for one app you can do that without affecting the rest of them

1302602
x86	64bit
alright it appears that it s an endian issue which still doesn t quite explain it since a little-endian x86 64bit signed integer should fit in a big-endian 64bit integer and vice versa they d just be corrupted

1302629
firefox	safari
it works in firefox just not safari

1302761
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

1302778
udp	tcp
effectively it looks like what you are trying to do is wrap some raw data you already have in a file in udp or tcp and ip headers and then get the wrapped data output

1302778
udp	tcp
one quick and dirty way to accomplish this would be to transmit the data to a remote host could be nonexistant for udp though you d need a listening socket on the remote for tcp

1302778
udp	tcp
this pcap would have your raw data packetized data inside udp tcp ip and ethernet headers

1302865
mouseup	mousedown
after the initial on mousedown and on mouse move i can t seem to release the panning with an on mouseup and the user can pan the image without clicking

1302899

this will make exceptions more apparent that otherwise seem to be swept under the rug because of the use of update panels that wrap around the detailsview formviews and gridview on the list edit insert details listdetails page templates

1302926
hash	md5
but when i try pasting anything other than iso-8859-1 into it it returns the same md5 hash

1303037
width	height
width 400 height 400 closeafteredit true

1303063
hash	md5
md5 is always 32 hex digits but an arbitrary substring of it or any other hash has the proper qualities of a hash equal values produce equal hash and the values are spread around a bunch

1303069
post	get
then for the ones you want to have confirmation screens you can use the the post redirect get prg pattern

1303094
merb	ruby-on-rails
he is proposing for our rewrite that we use straight ruby w no framework rather than ruby-on-rails or merb sinatra etc. i believe in my heart that this is a bad idea but i m having trouble putting my case into words

1303114
sudo	passwd
we configured sudo to allow those commands for that user without needing a passwd typed

1303126

1303395
google-chrome	firefox
this was wrong i believe when i tried the live event and it began to work in google-chrome and firefox

1303406
multiplying	add
to transform a standard normal distribution you multiplying your random number by x to get standard deviation x and you add y to obtain mean y if memory serves me correctly

1303406
multiplying	add
so whatever values you get out of your box-muller algorithm multiplying by 16.667 to stretch the distribution out then add 50 to center it

1303406
min	max
it always uses a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of halfway between your min and max

1303467
put	get
formatter goes crazy when i try to put underscores infront of get with a link

1303475
postgresql	mysql
i don t need the entire database and have been looking at migrating postgresql to mysql which it seems lots of people have difficulty with

1303475
postgresql	mysql
wouldn t it be simplest to just dump the postgresql data into a comma-delimited text file and then import that into mysql

1303615
width	height
you might want to put 5px instead of 5 for the width and window height + px for the height and window .width - 5 + px for the left

1303619
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you want to make a filename - is that on a case-sensitive filesystem as typical on unix or do you have to cater for case-insensitive systems too

edit now that i think of it just create a single cagradientlayer that is the width height of the line you desire

1303953
post	get
third start with the first entry in the uac in msi blog post and you should be able to get a better grip on things

1303981

free	malloc
your approach not only has the disadvantage using more memory but also the disadvantage of being slower the callee needs to malloc the caller needs to free

1304437
mvp	presenter
in pedantic mvp the view has no knowledge of the model so the presenter must be the go-between

1304461

versioning	upgrade
as vonc said this is a jvm error and is reported fixed in the current versioning so you should by all means upgrade

1304673
versioning	upgrade
i don t understand that because ie6 has still got security flaws that makes it safer to upgrade to a newer versioning

1304701
mouse	keyboard
my only beef with 2008 r2 was the lack of bluetooth support which meant no keyboard and mouse for me...so i went for 7

1304737
free	malloc
there a few questions on so about malloc free versus new delete but all of them focus on the differences in how they are used

1304737
free	malloc
i often hear c programmers say that malloc and free are costly operations but i ve never heard a c++ programmer say this about new and delete

1304737
free	malloc
so my question is how do the algorithms used by malloc and free differ from those used by new and delete

1304752
free	malloc
there s no real difference under the hood - usually the default new and delete operators will simply call through to malloc and free

1304788
free	malloc
often new and delete use malloc and free for memory allocation deallocation

1304788
free	malloc
anyway they must use some primitives for memory allocation deallocation - with overloading new and delete operators that could be something faster that malloc and free say it can be functions working on a memory pool for fixed-size objects

1304804
realloc	malloc
if you have n bytes of malloc ated memory you can realloc m bytes where m n and thus throw away the last n-m bytes

1304804
free	malloc	free	memcpy	memcpy	malloc
to throw away from the beginning you can malloc a new smaller buffer and memcpy the bytes you want and then free the original

1304829
free	realloc
your entire 4k may be free and realloc may move your memory elsewhere thus invalidating any pointers to it that you may hold

1304830
ienumerable	iqueryable
the first issue was that it only applies to iqueryable this however can be overcome by using the .asqueryable extension method on any ienumerable

1304840
realloc	malloc
if your block was allocated with malloc realloc will allow you to reduce or increase the size of the block

1304840
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is a limitation of the malloc calloc realloc free api -- and implementations may rely on these limitations for example keeping bookkeeping information about the allocation immediately before the start address which would make moving the start address difficult.

1304860
post	get
you ll want to use post here as you re probably modifying said schedule and the amount of data might also exceed the maximum url limit if you d use get

1304953
post	get
you can get the √¢ untranslated√¢ with s still in value by looking at the input stream for post or environ query_string for get and decoding it manually but it would be better to fix django s incorrect string-to-unicode decoding really

1304959
client-side	server-side
in less metaphorical terms implement both solutions so that there is a server-side url for every client-side url that outputs relevant content

1304960

qobject	qpointer
qt helps alot with appropriate helper classes qpointer ... and library magic qobject freeing children ... in the background

1305791

onfocus onblur events on elements that trigger javascript to alter the dom

1305984
nsstring	uifont
well the font property pointsize corresponds directly to the height in pixels of a nsstring drawn in that uifont so your formula would be something like this

1306062
jboss	weblogic
this will limit you in scalability terms because with jboss you can keep adding hardware without occurring extra cost while with weblogic your licenses will need upgrading too

1306082
erd	diagram
no need to put that on the diagram unless it has attributes on top of the join attributes much like you would generally omit a join entity from an erd unless it had attributes that weren t foreign keys in the related entities

public	protected
you can unambiguously find all references call hierarhy usages of classes or public and protected members - it is very valuable when you studying the code of the project or going to change something

1306358
gridview	formview
item #1 and #3 are fairly close in my opinion as formview gridview are just controls and entity classes linq data sources could be used together in conjunction with each other also

1306365
getter	setter
like chaining many setter not getter which the methods you want to use essentially is

1306492

1306783
bazaar	git
i for one have switched from bazaar to git and i ve been pleased

1306789
subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
it is not sufficient if we just check for overflow during the addition or subtraction because someone might add 1 to -5 and assign the result to an unsigned int

1306800
outputstream	inputstream
because then you think about it an outputstream -writer is the other side of the coin of an inputstream -reader

1306801
integer	unsigned
when you assign a negative integer to an unsigned int the actual bits of the number do not change but they are merely represented differently

1306804
firefox	safari
i have a page which works fine in firefox and safari on os x and

1306813

getter	setter
is there maybe a way to let the synthesize directive create other names for getter and setter methods which i then call easily

1306928
getter	setter
if you provide an implemnetation for the setter or getter it will use that instead of the generated implementation

1306928
getter	setter
its not hard to implement the retaining aspect of the getter and setter that are generated for you by the compiler when u synthesize so you can just write your own getter and setter i would say and go with that

1306951
button	checkbox
i have two radio button rbndolimit and rbndontlimit and three checkbox months12 months24 months36 - if i click on rbndolimit i d like to enable all three of them if i click on rbndontlimit i like to clear and disable the three checkbox

try-catch	exception-handling
you really don t need want the try-catch exception-handling block since iselementpresent is not supposed to throw exception-handling

1307485
move	drag
so uicontroleventtouchdragoutside would be used when resizing a control an edge tap then drag whereas uicontroleventtouchdragexit would be used to move the control around tap inside and drag

when interpreted as an unsigned integer this bit pattern represents the number 2 32-4 or 18446744073709551612

1307603
integer	unsigned
i m not sure i would call this phenomenon overflow but it is a common mistake to assign a small negative integer to a variable of unsigned type and wind up with a really big positive integer

1307635
multiplying	add
unfortunately table lookup adds a multiplying and add each time you use it so it s not necessarily good

1307756
multiplying	add
an array of arrays sometimes called a jagged array provides better performance than a two dimensional array because the two-dimensional address translation requires a multiplying and an add whereas the jagged array only requires two adds

1307796
getter	setter
many people know this article more on getter and setter

1307796
getter	setter
i think it does a convincing job of portraying the evil side of getter setter

1307796
getter	setter
i ve also tested it by trying to convert an existing project unfinished to code without getter setter

1307796
getter	setter
code readability improved greatly less code and i ve even managed to get rid of getter setter where i initially thought they really were necessary

1307796
put	get
but getters don t get out of the model something very different from what was put in there

1307796
getter	setter
are getter and setter evil for transporting model-data to the view layer

1307796
getter	setter
there are a lot of people who think getter setter are not evil at all

1307800
webclient	webrequest
viewing the initial page using a webrequest or webclient object works ok but if the page makes extensive use of javascript to alter the dom on page load then these don t provide an accurate picture of the page

1307811
post	get
i mean i personal could allow someone to get my id and name and maybe allow a page to post something in my feed if i accept just that and not that the application should have access to all my other somewhat private data

1307827
subtraction	addition
when dealing with money it is often faster and far more efficient to use integers if you are performing comparisons or simple addition and subtraction and don t need to worry about rounding errors

1307853
webclient	httpwebrequest
use httpwebrequest or the simplified webclient class

1307864
pull	push
i am able to have it pull code from a private repo github but i can t seem to get it to push the tags back after a build

1307877
webkit	gecko
they should look roughly the same i suppose but i have no problem with using webkit and gecko rounded borders knowing they ll fall back to square corners in trident and presto

1307894
post	get
it involves url s get and post to interact with the model

1307921
stateless	stateful
you will have to make some good analysis to determine how you will refactor it to separate all stateless beans from the stateful ones maybe encapsulate state in some value objects etc

1307931
vim	emacs
i would dig in and learn vim or emacs if you really want to

button	checkbox
right now clicking on the do not limit button will properly disable the checkbox thanks gw for all your help on this one

1308127
pull	push
given that the event mechanism allows the model to push its state to the view the view doesn t need getters to pull the state and if the model is also a listener you don t need builders

category has id name parent and children

1308158
children	parent
parent and children are of category too

1308158

or to put it another way stderr to both the logfile and the email and stdout only to the logfile

1308484
stdout	stderr
i saw this which is intended to send the stdout and stderr from a command to one file and then just stderr to another file posted by zazzybob on unix.com which seems close to what i want to do and i was wondering if it would inspire someone more clever than i

so my advice is to create a managed automation add-in as per eric carter s article and drop the vsto requirement

1308519
versioning	upgrade
this is the first time that i m upgrading the iphone sdk and am wondering if there is anything else needed to use the upgrade versioning with xcode besides just installing it

1308616
range	max	range	min	min	max
that it is out of the range of max and min ticks

1308620
puts	gets
when i run vscandemonstarter it puts entries into its different log file the vscandemon log file gets created but no entries

1308715
integer	unsigned
so you can assign a value of -4 to an unsigned integer and this will place a series of bits into that memory location

1308715
integer	unsigned
so when you do your addition store the result in an unsigned integer memory location and then call printf on the result it doesn t bother looking for the sign because by definition it is always positive

1308727
folder	directory
instead i see a directory view of folder files such as meta-inf web-inf etc

1308730
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
well aside from using jpasswordfield which is just a subclass of jtextfield you could replace every character with on each key press and store the actual text in a string or an array of chars

1308762
stdout	stderr
a bit tricky if you want stdout and stderr combined in one file with stderr yet tee d into its own stream

1308762
stdout	stderr
stderr is sent to a named pipe picked up by tee 1 where it is appended to the logfile wherein is also appended your command s stdout and tee d back to regular stderr

1308810
stdout	stderr
for some reason it outputs everything to stderr instead of stdout and i d like to check on its progress so i find myself needing to redirect stderr output within a start command

1308822
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
imho the best way to solve the problem is to look how jpasswordfield overrides jtextfield and to make your own derivation of jtextarea

1308837
stdout	stderr
claft runs all the defined tests supplying arguments and inputs to each checking return codes and matching output stdout and error messages stderr against regular expression patterns

1308892
put	get
if you can put the javascript right in your .aspx markup then you can get around the changing id s as well by doing this

1308960
datamapper	activerecord
it s obviously a datamapper instead of an activerecord

1309003
int	chars
the binary file is a mixture of int and chars

1309003
int	chars
the int are 1 bytes each and each chars is written to the file as 2 bytes

1309003
int	chars
please note each int is associated with the string of chars following it

1309003
int	chars
does nothing but prints the int value and not the actual chars i want

1309003
int	chars
it is ok for int in the file but then how do i read out chars

1309058
sorting	filtering
a dailyreport has many different options for creating a view such as sorting ice cream types alphabetically by dollar value - or including an hourly breakdown - or optionally including the temperature for that day - or filtering out certain ice cream types as a list

1309058
post	get
rather than using query parameters with a get i d rather post a dailyreport representation with the appropriate options using a well-defined custom media type to document each option

1309100
mouse	keyboard
via user input through the keyboard or mouse

1309111
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
when i want to display another view using the pushviewcontroller function of the navigationcontroller i loop through the textfields and call resignfirstresponder on them

1309119
hide	show
i need to show both spans and hide the drop down after a user makes a selection

1309135
division	modulo
any good ideas for converting the coefficient lookup in numbertopoint into rock solid math without using modulo integer division and sign a thousand times

1309170
width	height
where width and height are those of the ellipse

1309306
firefox	safari
enhance your site progressively so you can have a great design in ie√¢ and make it even better for those safari firefox users with things like css3 multicolumn or multiple background images

1309320
firefox	safari
wouldn t work in safari but worked just fine in firefox

1309343
rtf	mhtml
i d like to generate the mhtml document by converting the rtf snippets into images in memory and then just embedding the base64-encoded data directly into the mhtml object

1309348
filtering	grouping
membership is an intermediary model connecting artist and grouping with some extra data date joined etc. i was asked to see if one could filtering artists by what grouping they re in but i can t figure out how to do that

1309357
vb6	vba
vb6 vba - 190 chars

1309401
vsto	add-in
in the case of a vsto or com add-in check that word powerpoint other excel instance is also closed as there is still a gc root back to the launching process

1309433
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

1309433
websphere	ibm
websphere is a typical ibm project twice the cost half the functionality poor documentation and you have to buy all their nonsense eclipse based ides to use it

1309436
hide	show
i d like to do just this but still show and hide the message at completion

1309441
stdout	stderr
for some reason it outputs everything to stderr instead of stdout and i d like to check on its progress so i find myself needing to redirect stderr output within a start command

1309498
webkit	gecko
i d be very happy if it worked with at least webkit and gecko and bonus if trident too

1309512
post	get
instead of using redirect just send a new header with post instead of get

1309547
entity-relationship	diagram
the easiest method of visualizing a database design is to use entity relationship diagram entity-relationship diagram and it also allows us to easily see what your design looks like without sifting through code

1309557
bazaar	git
any of git mercurial and bazaar are fine choices in general

1309557
bazaar	git
this so question is about git mercurial bazaar on windows

1309573
migrate	upgrade
do you need to migrate or upgrade data

1309580
filtering	grouping
is there a way in a report to filtering data by ad grouping

1309608
bazaar	svn
you can not have multiple physical branches under one repository with mercurial like svn or bazaar but the good thing about mercurial imho is the easy user interface that is really straightforward and the performance that is faster than bazaar although bazaar is getting faster and faster in their recent release

1309616
sorting	filtering
so i can store all kind of object in the system and it is still possible to do filtering and sorting according to the data of the attributes

1309624
postgresql	mysql
just trying out postgresql for the first time coming from mysql

1309677
firefox	safari
the styles are exactly the same for firefox and safari

1309680
integer	unsigned
size_t is an unsigned pointer-sized integer and that s exactly what uintptr means

1309700
int	chars
the field is numeric int always have four chars and is included in the range of 0..1331

1309760
uicontrol	uibutton
should i cast the argument to a uicontrol which is as far as i need to be able to use setenabled without a warning or should i cast it all the way down to uibutton

1309797
postgresql	mysql
this ought to give you a mysql field -alike function under postgresql 8.4

1309816
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the code works just as expected in firefox google-chrome opera but low and behold it doesn t work in ie 7 - i m not even going to bother with ie6

1309826
fcntl	fork
with this information you can either call fcntl fd f_setfd fd_cloexec on each open file descriptor or alternatively you could call close fd on each file descriptor after fork

1309860
accessor	ivar
only exception is if self ivar is a lazy-loading accessor and i already used it in the method and i know it has been initialised and i don t want to check if it is nil the 10 more times i use it in the method

1309865
aggregate-functions	sum
the problem i see here is that sum is an aggregate-functions

1309879
versioning	upgrade
i can t upgrade to a newer versioning of jsw because they went gpl

1309881
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you generally do not want to generate proxies from the code of the service itself...the point of web services is to decouple you from implementation and allow you to bind to contract which is what wsdl is...a contract. you can generate client proxies in a few ways...either with wsdl.exe svcutil.exe or via visual studio s add web reference or add service reference options

1309937
qlist	qsharedpointer
if you are using 4.5 you can use qt s qlist and qsharedpointer classes like this

1309939
datamapper	activerecord
just read and understood stuff like datamapper activerecord identity map domain model yesterday via fowler s peaa book

1310031
put	get
finally we will execute that nvarchar string and get out put

1310034
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working well in google-chrome and opera but in firefox i get strange rendering artifacts

1310036
button	checkbox
users see radio button and checkbox as checked but when they submit the form the browser simply fails to send the post data

1310114
erlang	ocaml
hi i d like to pick up one fp language it s always a pain when you work in a position that does not require you learn much and after doing some research i felt erlang and ocaml are the two that i d really like to get my feet wet for the following reasons

1310160
direct3d	directdraw
this would allow you to make use of the accelerated direct3d or directdraw libraries and get fully accelerated performance for your application

1310216
spweb	spsite
my timer job would create the object of spsite then spweb and then spdocumentlibrary or possibly picture library using their guids stored in any xml or database.after that it would take the back up of documents in the document library in some third party application and then delete those documents

1310239
accessor	properties
properties accessor

1310328
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox safari google-chrome and konqueror all support their own form of the css3 style border-radius so put this in your css and be done with it

1310329
inherited	subclassing
now since the vtable is a part of the class it is inherited by its subclassing and thus the virtual methods are inherited as well

1310344
int	boolean
what can be a reason for converting an int to a boolean in this way

1310437
hide	show
when you pick an option you need to relocate the panels and show hide them

1310437
hide	show
if tabcontrol is used most of the time how to hide and show the tab parts of the tabcontrol and how to set the margin and border size of the tabcontrol so no big gap exists

1310467
gridview	detailsview
but since your detailsview sits inside a gridview edit template i suggest you wire the events manually

1310467
gridview	detailsview
...and the update you click is on the detailsview and not the gridview

1310473
qstring	qregexp
i am using c++ with the qt toolkit and wanted to use qstring split qregexp

1310473
qstring	qregexp
qstring is very similar to std string and qregexp are basically posix regex encapsulated in a class

1310522
int	chars
you can use _getcwd chars buf int len to get the current working directory

1310562
magento	oscommerce
this being said if you decide to miss on the extras coming from using an integrated cms ecommerce solution like drupal+ecommerce or drupal+√£≈ìbercart you should probably not be using oscommerce anyway but rather look at something with a different code base like magento or zencart which derived from oscommerce originally

1310597
gridview	rowdatabound
a possible solution maybe is to manage the rowdatabound event of the gridview and set the values like

1310630
int	chars
properties can have a any value of type decimal int datetime and varchar length varying from 5 chars to large chunks of text

1310678
mouse	keyboard
one major reason is that i find my hands need to leave the keyboard too much in ides as they require the mouse too often.

1310687
draggable	droppable
unbinding all bubbles first then re apply the droppable object by simply recalling the init function for bubbles won t do any good because it looses the draggable tag

1310687
draggable	droppable
edit the actual question is if i define a new droppable on an element that already is droppable will it only change the options or will it apply a whole new draggable and double bind it

1310736
git-svn	svn2git
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn

1310737
mouse	keyboard	move	drag
you happen to move your hands out of the keyboard less to hold the mouse drag it here and there and click

1310746
rank	percentile
then to get the real percentile rank you will need to first get the number of values in a variable or distinct values depending on the convention you want to take and compute the percentile rank using the real rank given above

1310755
interbase	firebird
interbase or firebird with fibplus anydac ibo or ibx

1310781
range	max	range	min	min	max
anymore since this functionality is on min max and range constraints

1310796
rss	feed
i am trying to create an rss feed which gets info from a separate xml file

1310799
int	chars
you could try adding a property type int chars etc to the materialsproperty table and partition the table on the type

1310921
folder	directory
after creating addin project vs creates addins folder in visual studio 2008 directory of your s projects directory

1310977
getter	setter
unfortunately this approach doesn t work with property getter setter as there is no such concept in javascript at least not in every major browser yet the only way to get property getter setter to work is to let the silverlight runtime be the one creating the wrapper for my class

1311111
width	height
use jquery to get the view ports width and height as well as the divs current dimensions

1311111
width	height
eg width height

1311111
width	height
you need a bit of logic to determine whether to set the width or height first then use the initial ratio to calculate the other side

1311115
ienumerable	iqueryable
the top one will not compile saying it returns ienumerable rather than iqueryable

1311159
lxml	libxml2
my favorite xml processing library for python is lxml which because it is a wrapper around libxml2 also supports full xpath

1311168
mouseover	mouseout
when the height of the goes beyond max-height and the vertical scrollbar appears hovering over the elements triggers mouseover but if i move to the right to the scrollbar and start scrolling with the mouse the mouseout event never fires

1311237
free	malloc
in xcode run- start with performance tool- shark. however in this case i feel reasonably certain that the primary problems are the per-pixel malloc free the floating-point arithmetic and the two method calls in the inner processing loop

1311237
free	malloc
to avoid the malloc free you want to be doing something like this instead

1311242
ostringstream	std
and i ve tried std ostringstream which seems to work for most values if i do stream.precision 16

1311249
filtering	grouping
a reason to put it in a table as opposed to writing it to a log file is that you can use sql syntax to filtering out grouping calculate average times etc

1311295
post	get
the version there also contains an error which turns the get request into a post request with internet explorer

1311341
move	drag
how can i do a grid control in which i can move the items the content inside by mouse drag drop

1311362
init.d	pid
start will start your service and record the process id in a known location stop will kill the process with the pid from the file you created and then place it in etc init.d

1311366
children	parent
a lookup is a bit like a - so basically you work out which children belong to which parent then add them all in

1311374
put	get
in the module s code you will put the statements that will get the image and return a link to it

1311386
filesystems	fat
while linux can work from fat you could just create another partition on the usb stick which will be ext2 or any other non-journaling filesystems and let linux work on it

1311399
superclass	subclassing
you could create a default callback superclass which takes a loadingmessage object argument in its constructor and provides hook methods for subclassing onsuccess0 and onfailure0

1311416
vim	emacs
actually a good text editor like vim and emacs i personally use vim is fairly enough for php development i think

1311450
int	chars
i want to sort this column in descending order but i can t because the column is not defined as int and it has a chars in front of all the values

1311494
rss	feed
for example do you first think about all the sections on your page header nav bar content rss feed and then add appropriate divs to your style sheet

1311516
udp	tcp-ip
network cards and routers have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip packages above udp

1311530
getter	setter
this is also often used for accessor methods on an instance setter and getter especially with setter methods if they implement extra functionality rather than just setting the value of an instance variable so that you do not have to repeat that code over and over when you want to set the value of that variable for example

1311580
lxml	elementtree
elementtree supports xpath queries just like lxml

1311580
lxml	elementtree
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster

1311584
int	chars
here line is a chars array containing a line from the modem and entry is an int in which the id is stored

1311588
profiling	debugging
in the dim dark ages of software engineering one often used a profiling tool to achieve that since profiling injected extra code at entry and exit of all functions although i must say that this is a pretty dismal approach to debugging and when i used it it was a desperation move not front line

1311622
postgresql	mysql
out of the box it supports sql server oracle mysql firebird postgresql and a few other databases

1311650
disk	ram
writeallbytes loads the entire file into ram before writing it to disk

1311660
coalesce	isnull
aside from isnull on sql server i m a big fan of coalesce since that takes any number of arguments

1311738
coalesce	isnull
here s some differences and other explanations about isnull and coalesce

1311740
16-bit	64bit
for example for a 8-bit cpu the stack size is expected to be 8-bit wide and 16-bit cpu vs 16-bit stack width and 32-bit 64bit cpu and so on

1311750
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a solid database and so is postgresql

1311750
postgresql	mysql
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

1311767
folder	directory
here is an example configuration that will generate the standalone application in the target appassembler folder and generate the jsw wrapper files in the target appassembler jsw myapp directory

1311780
post	get
then in you php page change the post to a get

1311780
post	get
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

1311780
post	get
there s nothing wrong with using post except that you don t seem to be able to get it to work easily

1311843
rss	feed
the problem that we were having minor performance issues and when we looked into it we found that firefox 3 was loading the rss feed on every page load

1311843
rss	feed
it just seems quite unnecessary to load up the rss feed on every page load like it is right now

1311849
perforce	svn
has anyone tried using the tofu-scale descriped in practical perforce by laura wingerd together with svn

1311850
width	height
this is my text --- works fine as in td width is fixed only height increases

1311970
google-chrome	firefox
my asp.net web application works fine in internet explorer but in firefox and google-chrome i have a problem where httpcontext.current is defined but httpcontext.current.session is null

1311973
firefox	safari
if i m not using the css grid system i use a css reset the one provided by eric meyer as it gives you the best possible starting point and the least trouble when trying to develop for ie7 ie8 safari firefox

1311980
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
a framework like pylons django turbogears etc. separates the presentation html templates from programming from database access

1311980
put	get
beyond that it starts to get murky how much power should be put into the tag language

1311987
try-catch	exception-handling
so it appears that the jvm needs all exception-handling classes to be defined when the program starts running and not when they re needed when that particular try-catch block is reached

1312013
maven	m2e	folder	directory
the reason for this is that some maven plugins can t cope with a directory that is outside of target so the m2e devs force the folder for compiled classes to be target classes and target test-classes no matter what you configure in eclipse

1312026
folder	directory
when you packaged your code into dynamictestjar.jar star wars fan you are you didn t get the path right because you didn t zip up the directory containing the folder dynamictestjar so the path that the class loader sees is incorrect

1312043
expander	grid
i would like the grid to stretch to accommodate the expander and i would like the listbox only to fill the grid

1312078
integer	unsigned
you can represent your matrix as a nonnegative integer with each cell in the matrix corresponding to exactly one bit in the integer on a system that supports 64-bit long long unsigned ints this lets you play with anything up to 8x8

1312087
post	put	post	get	put	get
using http get post put and delete we can operate on these resources

1312109
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i added a clientaccesspolicy.xml and a crossdomain.xml to the webroot c inetpub wwwroot

1312137
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1312158
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

1312167
cvs	svn
a few of the version controls out there are cvs svn git sourcesafe clearcase

1312208
uiview	calayer
because such a view has its content drawn by the opengl layer you can t do the same sort of quartz drawing within it that you would in a uiview backed with a standard calayer

1312208
uiview	subviews
my recommendation is to move your custom quartz drawing to another uiview subclass and place that uiview as a subviews of your caeagllayer-hosting view

1312211
zoo	xts
for irregular data such as business- daily use the zoo or xts packages which can also deal very well

1312217
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i removed the clientaccesspolicy.xml from the webroot leaving only crossdomain.xml there

1312240
serializable	deserialization
in short you need to create a class that handles the serializable and deserialization of the rss 0.91 standard

1312240
rss	feed
syndicating and consuming rss 1.0 rdf feed in asp.net 3.5

1312244
hex	binary
if you ve got opaque binary data you re trying to persist then you could either use hex or use web safe base64

1312247
filtering	grouping
i switched the code so that it filtering columns that are zero inthe filtering tab of the grouping and that resolved the issue

1312296
client-side	server-side
a server-side method that can respond to a request for data and a client-side javascript function that can make an ajax request to that method and consume the data updating the web page

1312364
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you may need to implement the inotifypropertychanged on your objects and inotifycollectionchanged on your collections

1312396
put	get
you could possibly create your own subclass of properties which overrode setproperty and possibly put but it would probably get very implementation-specific.

1312418
google-chrome	firefox
i have successfully created a few single accordion drop-downs but when i go to nest an accordion with an accordion internet explorer goes nuts but firefox google-chrome etc work just fine for both the single and nested accordion

1312430
rss	feed
henk the reason you can t read the feed from slashdot is because it uses rss 1.0

1312430
rss	feed
the .net framework only includes built-in support for rss 2.0 and atom 1.0 feed

1312430
rss	feed
however it is possible to create your own class that extends the syndicationfeedformatter class and parses rss 1.0 feed

1312430
rss	feed
check out my article on this topic for a description of the process along with c# code for such a class syndicating and consuming rss 1.0 rdf feed in asp.net 3.5

1312433
vb.net	vb6
we are using vb6 and vb.net 2005 and vss2005

1312481
dateadd	datepart
where nameday. date dateadd year - datepart yyyy birth_date -1900 birth_date

1312491
post	get
you re going to have to dig through the source of the external form to determine the html name s of the relevant fields and whether the form is submitted using get or post

1312564
serializable	deserialization
an instance of the mylistsurrogate class can then be passed to the datacontractserializer constructor and it will be called during serializable and deserialization to substitute types as needed on the fly

1312604
actionscript	mxml
i ve an empty grid made in mxml then in actionscript i add in this order

1312622
google-chrome	safari
for safari google-chrome it s

1312691
maven	pom.xml
i think the problem with idea arises because you are using the root pom.xml in your source structure to do two things that are usually mutually exclusive in maven

1312691
maven	pom.xml
you are first using the pom.xml as a location to store common configuration information for unrelated from a build perspective maven projects

1312704
versioning	upgrade
other half-baked approaches such as hoping that operations that look atomic are indeed atomic may happen to work for specific cases in a given versioning and release of python but could easily get broken by upgrade or ports

1312802
button	checkbox
i don t care about fancy html formatting attachments colors radio button checkbox etc.

1312817
rss	feed
i m trying to get up to speed on html css php development and was wondering how i should validate my code when it contains content i can t control like an rss feed

1312817
rss	feed
i use the php to create a simple rss reader using simplexml to grab some feed from another blog and display them on my web page

1312817
rss	feed
when i do that i get all sorts of validation errors like cannot generate system identifier for general entity and general entity blogid not defined and no default entity coming from the rss feed

1312817
rss	feed
should i just ignore all the errors that are flagged in the rss feed

1312822
for-loop	arrays
using and not in the for-loop you are using to access arrays elements and not

1312826
for-loop	loops
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once

1312841
rss	feed
use something like striptags to take all of the formatting out of the rss feed content

1312841
rss	feed
consider this code which will only fetch and format the rss feed every 5 minutes.

1312846
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome but on ie8 the map is gray

1312847
tortoisegit	svn
i am trying to run git-svn using tortoisegit and am having problems 405 method not allowed and am wondering if the problem is that the svn server is too old svn 1.3

1312850
versioning	upgrade
i strongly agree with cutrisk - stage the whole thing somewhere else first install released versioning upgrade to beta open it for internal testing etc. then carefully roll it out to customers

1312855
cassini	iis
this will happen more often when you are debugging locally with cassini in my experience since cassini allows all requests to route through asp.net while in iis a lot of requests are handled by iis for you

1312871

1312982
post	put
then if the post returns a notification you put it into the table and flip the display from none to block and here you can add any fade-in fade-out stuff you want anything like that

1313003
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to hg versioning 1.3.1 and everything works now

1313041

you can use the string constructor that takes a chars and an int

1313055
int	chars
as bdukes mentions there s constructor that takes a chars and an int

1313065
google-chrome	safari
single image per page variable heights and widths has to be vertically and horizontally centered has to be fluid shrinks for smaller browser windows and i m merely looking for recent browser support ie8 google-chrome ff3 safari

1313065
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in ie8 google-chrome and safari but not firefox

1313175
postgresql	mysql
working heavily with drupal recently i can say that it is well suited for stuff like this except a certain lack concerning database abstraction since it currently only supports mysql and postgresql

1313211
tortoisegit	svn
a svn server 1.3 should be able to be accessed by any client including a tortoisegit even recent

1313292
folder	directory
my directory structure in war folder looks like

1313311
postgresql	mysql
to further elaborate on this point say most of my development is done with mysql as the underlying storage mechanism for my data if i avoided vendor specific functions -- unix_timestamp -- in the construction of my sql statements and used a abstract db object that has a common interface moving between mysql and maybe postgresql or mysql and sqlite should be a simple process

1313334
single-quotes	double-quotes	ord	chr
another point of view i ve come across but i m not sure i subscribe to is to use single-quotes for characters which are strings but ord chr are quick picky and to use double-quotes for strings

1313341
width	height
in the following example the leftmost column s width does not increase to accommodate the listbox s scrollbar that appears when the usercontrol s height is decreased

1313389
mouseleave	mouseenter
would like to add to iftrue s answer that you can grab and remove the title attribute in the mouseenter event and place it back in the mouseleave

1313425
int	chars
conversion of chars to int

1313425
int	chars
why does int value of chars

1313454
post	get
on a side note ideally you would not use get for deleting entries but rather post but that s another story

1313491
children	parent
i have four parent pages and six children pages tied to each parent page in wordpress cms

1313504
int	chars
when a int on a system is larger than one byte the signed flat is not affected when you convert chars to int other wise it is

1313508
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

1313515
int	chars
usually in c chars to int conversion and vice versa is an issue because the stanard apis for reading chars input writing chars output use int s for the chars arguments and return values

1313515
getc	putchar
see getchar getc and putchar for example

1313547
int	chars
however if the chars was intended to be unsigned +255 then the signed int may end up being -1

1313547
int	chars
some machines regard chars as signed int while others interpret them as unsigned

1313584
disk	ram
the only thing you need to know is that you can not trust the first try because most of the time it will read data from disk while second try will use cached data from ram

1313596
versioning	upgrade
bug in the jvm upgrade to the latest versioning and hope it doesn t happen again - or some buggy 3

1313598
hide	show
now the feature creep is asking if i can hide or show tabs and other controls based on the user s database permissions

1313607
min	max
can i calculate that based on taking all of the zips that belong to that city getting the min max points for each direction and taking the center point of the resulting rectangle

1313608
folder	directory
if copying to a folder nested in the current folder called example in the case below you need to omit that directory also

1313641
min	max
instead of using just the min max points of the zip code areas you could get the average of all positions that would give you a more weighted position

1313691
ant	maven
there you can uncheck compile on save option if you use ant or select disable if you use maven

1313716
versioning	upgrade
tracking conflicts was introduced in mercurial 1.1 which is a newer versioning that you are using you should really upgrade mercurial 1.1

1313722
fortran	ada
it compiles a truly staggering number of languages c c++ ada java fortran objective-c and supplies an intermediate language for haskell

1313734
ubuntu	debian
and for what it is worth my choice would be debian or ubuntu

1313744
onfocus	onblur
i have simple html textbox with couple of events like onfocus change backgroud color onkeypress making sure only accepting numerals onblur formatting and validating the numerals to us-phone format onmouseover showing the tooltip onmouseout hiding the tooltip etc

1313751
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in firefox google-chrome and safari but ie is a different story

1313755
move	drag
the avatar is positioned offset so the move events are not trapped by the node representing the drag

1313755
mousemove	mouseup
then we register temporary mousemove and mouseup event listeners

1313755
mousemove	mouseup
when mouseup is fired we disconnect both mouseup and mousemove events this._listeners

1313822
wordpress	phpbb
i have looked at wordpress as well as phpbb but i feel there is too much going on at once for me to comprehend

1313836
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have a nsstring and i want to write its value to a nsmutablestring

1313842
int	boolean
ps don t try this on other brands of database that uphold the sql standard behavior a boolean expression yields a boolean not a 0 or 1 int

1313937
filtering	grouping
if you define a m2m between artist and grouping using through membership you can set up a filtering directly on grouping without going through membership

1313945
gentoo	linux
this works surprisingly well the build agent running my unit tests runs on windows xp in a vmware virtual machine with gentoo linux x64 as the host os

1313945
width	height
did a call to createtexture occur with a width of 234 and a height 456

1313954
ggplot2	lattice
i ve been experimenting with both ggplot2 and lattice to graph panels of data

1313989
.htaccess	httpd.conf
add some directives on httpd.conf file or use .htaccess

1314022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the second example allows the compiler to potentially use something called named return-value-optimization nrvo

1314022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the more sophisticated ones also apply return-value-optimization when there s a named result that the function returns the so-called named return-value-optimization or nrvo

1314022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
hopefully the phase of the moon is less important to when the compiler might use return-value-optimization nrvo maybe it s down to day-of-the-week

1314039
postgresql	mysql
i can recommend webfaction - they provide an easy-to-use control panel which offers various combinations of django versions python versions mod_python mod_wsgi mysql postgresql etc

1314041
getter	setter
i have a class like this with getter and setter all mapped to hibernate each with a sequence to oracle db

1314060
int	double	int	chars
in absence of a function prototype chars and short become int and float becomes double

1314060
int	double
by reading the text i am getting an impression that unless you explicitly specify the argument type by either using cast or function prototype function arguments will always be passed as either passed as int or double

1314060
int	double	int	chars
my guess is c and number were both converted to int and double on the function call and were then converted back to chars and float

1314077
cpu	processors
when we ran some heavy load i could see the cpu on one reaching almost 100 and the other processors is completely idle

1314086
int	double	int	chars
based on the promotion rule you quoted earlier it promoted chars to int and float to double and decided that the signature is

1314094
int	double	int	chars
as for chars and short becoming int and float becoming double that refers to the default types for implicit function prototypes

1314094
int	double
it defaults to int for int values and double for floating-point values

1314110
for-loop	arrays
this construct is a different kind of for-loop that runs over items in an objective-c collection rather than a c arrays

1314173
getter	setter
there aren t a whole lot of occasions when we ever even should access our instance variables without using an accessor for encapsulation but sometimes we need to such as in dealloc or in custom getter and setter

1314270
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i m aware of some of the build tools out there cruisecontrol teamcity and so on and also that vs projects .csproj etc are just msbuild files

1314287
pull	push
now the developers push and pull from their own local git repos to the central subversion repository but still get all the cool power of git

1314326
wadl	wsdl
wadl appeals to people coming from the soap world where it is common to use a code generator to create client side code based on the wsdl

1314336
firefox	safari
as far as i know both firefox and safari can not work with kerberos in a sharepoint context for the time being but why is that and should we expect that both firefox and safari will play ball in the sharepoint 2010 timeframe

1314410
hash	md5
a non-optimal solution would be to have a database of md5 hash of all or select important files and verify it again at start-up

1314426
bazaar	git
at some point when i can figure out a good mirroring scheme i ll switch to mercurial git or bazaar but for now this works pretty well

1314439
equals	gethashcode
note when overriding equals you also have to override gethashcode

1314441
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
mercurial with hgsubversion git with git-svn and bazaar bzr-svn all have an option to synchronize with an upstream svn repository

1314499
rss	feed
i m working on some code to determine the character encoding of an xml document being returned by a web server an rss feed in this particular case

1314501
post	put
you may want to post it asynchronously and put up the ol uiactivityindicatorview or some other hud

1314533
width	height
the row or column star sizing only works if you give the grid a width and height

1314545
keydown	keyup
if i add a handler for keyup and keydown to the button itself and set the event to handled it will swallow the event if i hold down the space and let go but not if i just tap it

1314549
prepare	execute
the way query parameters work is that the query is sent to the database server when you called prepare and parameter values are sent later when you called execute

1314555
ienumerable	ilist
the only way i ve found to do this which is a bit of a hack is to create a valueconverter that converts from ilist to ienumerable

1314569
min	max
set a min max font size and scale between those

1314569
min	max
set the min max and adjust between as necessary

1314574
post	get
you must sanitize all requests not only post as get

1314586
fileinputstream	filechannel
if you want to fiddle with the bytes yourself get a filechannel from the fileinputstream and then allocate a bytebuffer and then read all the content into it

1314635
post	get
if you have enabled you should either disable it whenever you can or stripslashes get post and cookie values

1314643
post	get
since the post has been closed i m sure this solution will get buried out there but i created a pretty cool class that solves the problem above using the advice i was given

1314649
hex	binary
the input file is read in binary and the output file is written as ascii hex

1314661
formview	detailsview
when a user is using a detailsview or formview in edit mode and tries to leave the current page i want to trap this and force any changes to be saved just as if the user had clicked on the update linkbutton

1314662
width	height
i m assuming that the onclick event should change the height and width properties defined in the and tags but since the object is flash i assume the flash player captures the clicks rather than reporting them to the browser

1314760
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
clojure is a dialect of the lisp programming language so lisp scheme or haskell developers may feel at home while developing with this language

1314796
hid	keyboard
the scanner is configured as hid human interface device and emulating keyboard

1314832
prepare	execute
i store the question of the user and use the following functions to sanitize the user data prepare it and execute the sql command respectively

1314834
put	get
edit you can get the binding of any of the methods as follows but even with it i m not able to eval successfully be sure to put this at the top

1314842
hide	show
you do not lose much by doing this as most things that do not support icommand cannot leverage the hide show enable disable anyway

1314862
post	put
the agavi framework uses the put request for create and post for updating information

1314862
post	put
usually in rest this is used the other way around often referring to post adding information while put replacing the whole data record

1314862
post	put
if i understand it correctly the important issue is that put must be idempotent while post does not have this requirement

1314874
int	boolean
any difference in size between and int and a native boolean type is really going to make little or no difference to your application s performance or the kb size of your database

1314931
set	bag
one alternate approach i would suggest is that once the validation is successful set a flag in the session property bag of the list with the document guid as the key and in the final landing page deploy a custom web part that will check for the this guid and if there is a value then it will display the message

1314936
mouse	keyboard
most of the keyboard mouse or basic user input events are awtevents

1314952
awt	swing
more to the point awtevent is as the name implies the superclass of all the built-in awt event classes while event classess in other parts of the standard libraries including swing descend from eventobject directly

1314953
integer	unsigned
in 32-bit cpus the memory address of each byte is stored in a 32-bit unsigned integer which as a maximum value of 4 gb

1314953
cpu	processors
you should really be focusing more on learning how to program than about the internal workings of your processors and why you can t access more than 4 gb of ram on your 32 bit cpu

1314978
wordpress	joomla
i m using wordpress and joomla in some projects of my clients and i always try to create some kind of additional security

1315004
awt	swing
the two official java gui apis are swing and awt

if http 1.1 403 then web browser firefox ie google-chrome ... will ignore whatever

1315081
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
for this i placed all the releases in dealloc and didreceivememorywarning with a nil check to avoid releasing nil

1315128
disk	ram
ideally you should have enough ram so that sql can load the entire database s into memory including tempdb and only touch the disk for log writes and when it has to checkpoint the database s

1315134
opera	firefox
looks and works perfect in opera but as for internet explorer it looks terrible and it looks fairly good in firefox

1315147
ubuntu	debian
for debian and ubuntu systems you would similarly edit etc apache2 envvars

1315157
jobs	cron
the format for the cron jobs is

1315178
apache	nginx
for example nginx is much faster than apache

1315179
mvp	presenter
using the mvp pattern in winforms is predicated on the presenter knowing about which controls to access as defined by the iviewinterface

1315231
jboss	weblogic
personally i would choose jboss community version over weblogic server because it s free you know like in freedom

1315251
portrait	landscape
i have a uiimage that is uiimageorientationup portrait that i would like to rotate counter-clockwise by 90 degrees to landscape

1315319
perforce	svn
i currently have a set of scripts that copy from the perforce area in my home directory to the svn area sync it diff it and commit it

1315328
background-image	background-color
you should be able to supply both a css background-image and background-color

1315337
post	put
when the user causes a post back you ll put the addeditgame.ascx control in the holder again and wire up the event so the control that caused the event addeditgame.ascx will be in the control tree for the event cycle

1315337
post	put
when the user causes a post back you ll put crudquestions.ascx in the place holder during init etc..

1315346
folder	directory
also suppose you want the folder c dev to be your source code directory on each of the windows installations

1315355
background-image	background-color	background-color	transparency
as i remember if you set background-color and background-image that would not work with transparency pngs over the transparency you will see background-color

1315361
udp	tcp
technically udp can be fragmented into multiple ip packets - but lose one of those and the entire udp is lost as opposed to tcp which will re-try

1315367
post	get
you ll also need to determine the type of request get post etc. - you can do this by inspecting the characters transmitted before the first space

1315448
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme was what we were tasked with using back in uni

1315487
ada	vhdl
ada and its cousin vhdl directly support the concept of units

1315576
width	height
the left and top divs have as suggested above height width and overflow-auto in their css

1315586
pow	sqrt
on the type of math used i d say parenthesis and add sub mul div pow sqrt

1315613
debugdiag	debugging
but to debugging iis problems now you should use debugdiag

1315618
hash	salt
if no i would suggest to store the passwords hash sha-2 or something like that with a salt

1315631
firefox	safari
for the client side that s entirely dependent on the development priorities in the firefox and safari teams

1315636
base	fractions
i can give a hint - repeating decimals in base ten are all fractions with the denominator having at least one prime factors other than two and five

1315645
accessor	properties
is required in the properties accessor

1315760
.htaccess	httpd.conf
mod_rewrite .htaccess in your document root directory or somewhere in your httpd.conf

1315784
folder	directory
when i run the file inputfile is null - this suggests that the directory containing the test folder is not in the classpath

1315789
width	height
so i calculate a hash value of every image and append this with the width height and file size of the image

1315807
swfmill	swc
1 you can include one swf library instead of a swc while compiling using the -swf-lib compiler argument and if you need more than one lib you can merge multiple using the swfmill tool

1315836
sequence	permutation
creating sequence getting the next permutation you have a permutation p and call rank p then unrank rank+1

1315907
.htaccess	httpd.conf
just add an include directive in your httpd.conf file or use .htaccess to your project s apache configuration

1315921
distance	polygons
my first thought was to get the bounding box of the polygons then measure the distance of each vertex from the corners of the bounding box

1315954
rss	feed
when creating an rss feed that shows a subset of a larger html doc first x characters i ve run into an issue where some tags begin in the first x characters but the ending tag is outside that range

1315954
rss	feed
i m assuming this is a common problem that rss feed writers and readers solved long ago but i cannot seem to figure out how to achieve it short of trying to parse the html in the feed and add missing end tags which could get messy

1316005
executable	upx
it would be at a size where upx would actually result in bigger executable

1316060
put	get
step 2 get the height and put in

1316114
disk	ram
i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device √¢ √¢ therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk

1316139
mouse	keyboard
there is a little more to it a buttonclick is originated by the button itself when it handles and processes mouse and or keyboard events

1316193
mbunit	nunit
nunit is good mbunit is good

1316206
jruby	mri
i personally use 5 mri yarv jruby ironruby and rubinius.

the ffi api was first developed by evan phoenix as the native extension api for rubinius it was then adopted by charles oliver nutter and implemented by wayne meissner for jruby

1316251
move	drag
the drag mechanism is already implemented but when the list is too long and i want to move an item to a position not visible i can t

1316253
hide	show
all the data are already on the page so the search simply show or hide relevant results without needing to retrieve any new information from the server

1316308
opml	feed	opml	rss	rss	feed
i am writing some code to generate an opml file from a list of rss feed parsed on my site

the datagrid will have a checkbox and pressing the button below this grid the code above will execute i have also got the code for the xml declarations etc

1316363
tinyint	boolean
here is a bug report for mysql mysql tinyint 1 boolean conversion fails and relevant commit fixed situation where treattinyasboolean had no effect with default database character set

1316398
hash	md5
a fast hash function like md5 or sha1 is great for this application

1316464
postgresql	mysql
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license

1316473
inherited	properties
it shows lines for inherited not each individual field properties

1316481
ubuntu	linux
if you are working in ubuntu or any other linux platform provide

1316484
width	margin
given that the style seems to get applied correctly in the first place this is likely just an effect of your particular window composition width margin and placement of the related controls

1316484
width	margin
according to this assumptions i ve indeed been able to reproduce the issue presumably it is easily overlooked because width and or margin of a textbox are often provided explicitly and visible either way due to the default textbox border while this is less common for a radiobutton and its border is invisible by default

1316555
inherited	properties
inherited your viewmodel classes from a master viewmodel with a user properties

1316580
centos	linux	redhat	fedora
besides i find it much more convenient to manage than redhat based distributions such as scientific linux fedora or centos

1316580
ubuntu	debian
edit ubuntu which another poster has suggested is essentially an advanced debian customization towards desktop use

1316580
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian

1316582
centos	linux
centos - a free version of redhat enterprise linux which is the most common server linux distribution

1316592
redhat	fedora
i might consider fedora for a home server as there appears to be lots of support on the web for redhat fedora

1316607
free	malloc
but ld has --wrap which you can use for anything like malloc or free or anything else i do this

1316623
integer	fractions
so you can see that altough they are both stored on 8 bytes at least the float 25...53 the internal representation of datetime is not a float with integer part being day and fractions part being time as is often assumed

1316679
dxcore	coderush
i am also happy to answer questions on the topic of dxcore and coderush refactorpro via or alternatively via email rory becker at g mail dot com

1316716
debian	linux
also i ve seen projects like alt linux hasher fedora mock debian pbuilder sbuild but never used any of them

1316731
versioning	upgrade
however the very latest oo 3.1 i believe comes on all platforms with the very latest python 2.6.2 i believe so if you can upgrade your openoffice to the very latest released versioning on all platforms you should be just fine

1316736
free	malloc
these features include such trivia as malloc and free dlopen some string processing and a whole bucketload of stuff that appears to have to do with locales and internationalization although i can t find any relevant man pages

1316777
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
what you ll need to do is provided on an onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup event to the form itself or some control in the form that updates the position of the control when the user clicks and drags

1316903
min	max
test simply everything with values min max average usecases and do negativ tests - tests that have to fail if the software works correct

1316904
hash	salt
i guess if i hash and salt the extcss it could be more secure

1316917
disk	ram
it will probably not be as fast as memcached as data is not store in ram but on disk though.

installation	downgrade
in this case installing simbl can t really hurt -- the author doesn t update simbl often at all these days so it s very unlikely that you ll accidentally downgrade a user s simbl installation

1316950
prepare	execute
this is done as an potential optimization - if you know in advance that you will need to execute the statement many times in a row preparing it upfront can save some work on the database server since it does not have to re- prepare the statement for each call

1316950
prepare	execute
pg_query_params as well as its simpler version pg_query just execute the statement query directly forcing the database server to re prepare the statement each time the function gets called

1316950
prepare	execute
the only difference is that in the second case you still have the prepare statement ready to reuse for more calls to pg_execute - which is why you can give it a name since that way you can have different prepare statements on the same connection that you can execute as you please many times in arbitrary order

1316954
merb	ruby-on-rails
when you re talking about ruby and web apps chances are you re talking about ruby-on-rails or merb which is the same thing from v3.0 onwards

1316956
post	get
this will get the created_at and updated_at columns for the post and the name for the associated user

1316961
int	chars
the bignumber problem in most computer science classes is designed to make you have to do the arithmetic by hand precisely as you describe convert each chars to an int subtract and borrow where appropriate

1316962
wifstream	wofstream
i have a program that i built on darwin that reads and writes to files using wifstream and wofstream

1316962
wifstream	wofstream
when i move the code over to windows and try to build in using the mingw tool chain and eclipse i get a compile error on wifstream wofstream and wcout

1316989
verilog	vhdl
it understands c c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a number of other languages

1316996

cdr	cons
car and cdr return the two children which can be nil atoms or other cons cells

1317055
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i can get my tests to work in firefox safari opera ie 8 but not google-chrome

1317055
google-chrome	firefox
this always loads up firefox though and not good google-chrome

1317068
cdr	cons
if the cons cell is in the variable c then car c returns the first value and cdr c returns the second

1317068
cdr	cons
by convention a list consists of cons cells where the car of the cell contains the node value and the cdr contains the reference to the next node or nil the empty list to indicate the end of the list

1317068
cdr	cons
therefore for the list l car l gives the first element the value in the first cons cell and cdr l returns the tail of the list the next cons cell in the list

1317096
versioning	upgrade
we use a visible versioning number so that our admin sales team and customers can tell that the upgrade worked

1317117
vim	emacs
i strictly use vim but i was playing with emacs and really like ido-mode when opening files

1317131
google-chrome	firefox
so the fact that it s firefox that is launched and not google-chrome is normal

1317140
for-loop	arrays
to fix it keep track of the size of your arrays pass it to the function and then use a for-loop to iterate up to it rather than using pointers

1317149
g++	gcc
in recent mingw gcc g++ versions 4.40 you can link against a shared dll rather than the default static library by using the flag -shared-libstdc++

1317193
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu the packages bundled by ubuntu are ok too

1317193
bazaar	git
if you want something a distributed revision control software you can take a look at tools like bazaar mercurial and or git

1317193
bazaar	git
each one of those is used by some big projects well at least for bazaar mysql uses it i think and git linux kernel uses it

1317235
width	height
i want to find out the total width and height of the virtual desktop of which each monitor is showing only a part

1317254
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can tell apache and php to issue the correct charset headers setting adddefaultcharset utf-8 in httpd.conf .htaccess and in php.ini respectively

1317254
post	get
if you re worried about somebody posting incorrectly encoded stuff on purpose i believe you shoud consider html purifie r to filter get post data before processing

1317262
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview which binds to an objectdatasource objstudentdetails

1317286
post	get
the only real difference is that you are using post to search whereas i am using get

1317286
google-chrome	firefox
the one on my site definitely works in ie8 google-chrome 3.0 and firefox 2.0+

1317297
width	height
naturally the table is 100 width and height and my 3 colspanned content cell is 100 width

1317297
width	height
the problem lies in getting my swf to occupy the full height width of the cell

1317301
submit	submission
the way to ensure a user-agent submit in utf-8 format is to serve the page containing the form it s submission in utf-8 encoding

1317327
gedit	aptana
scratch be as close to just a text-editor as possible i use gedit for everything and i d recommend aptana in a heart-beat

1317365
maya	blender
or else you ll want to create it in a modeling animation package like maya houdini max sketchup blender etc

1317380
mef	prism
we ve got frameworks in place today ie prism mef that will help you here but we are working hard to bring the two technologies back to parity for you all

1317403
id3v2	id3-tag
you should also remove any id3-tag from the files both versions id3v1 from the end and id3v2 from the start as these are not valid mp3 data and ensure that the files do start and end on a frame boundary

1317435
stdio	fflush
you can also use stdio fflush fd

1317435
stdout	stderr
where fd is one of stdout stderr stdin

1317465
google-chrome	firefox
i ve written a firefox extension to rig the window title with this information but it became outdated and i need this for google-chrome now anyway

1317467
post	get
this might mean a large http get url or a post

1317467
post	get
dotnetopenid dotnetopenauth is careful with the sizes of requests and jumping between get and post as needed

1317499
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
that works perfectly on firefox but doesn t quite work well on ie7 ie8 or google-chrome i didn t test with opera or safari yet..

1317510
yacc	bison
yacc or bison may be what you are after

1317522
put	get
or at least imagine you are going to and get the project finished in such a way that you would not be shamed to put it out into the open

1317532
submit	submission
the ajax submit means that instead of submission the form back to the server in the traditional sense you create an ajax request back to the server with the form data

1317597
post	get
but forms can be submitted in two different ways get or post depending on the method attribute of the form tag

1317597
pop-up	dialog
as i said these are only conventions and there is not much technical difference between them but a very important difference is that browsers will warn the user if they try to repeat a post -- clicking refresh will pop-up a dialog box warning the user that this may cause an operation to be repeated and confirming that they really want to resubmit

1317597
post	get
this splits the database update post and the view get into two operations

1317629
kermit	xmodem
you need to use some protocol like xmodem kermit etc

1317638
postgresql	mysql
conceptual object that represents a block of data as steven said there s a difference in the benefits you get from being database agnostic so you can switch between mysql and postgresql if need be and being schema agnostic so you have an object full of data that fits together well even if it came from different relational tables

1317645
width	height
i don t need the array to grow i ll know the size i want when my grid manager is created but the grid will be constructing with a runtime height and width

1317686
datalist	repeater
maybe a datalist maybe a repeater

1317701
addclass	removeclass
addclass and removeclass exist to save you from doing all that work yourself

1317702
gif	png
as for library assets the optimal speed is achieved by setting jpegs to use imported jpeg data and pngs gifs as loosless png gif

1317710
mvp	presenter
to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui

1317733
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

1317736
punctuation	words
again this doesn t take into account punctuation or anything and just assumes all words are separated by spaces

1317856
pull	push
the data model given above is represented in memory but a database is then used to push or pull data as monolitic entities

1317879
opensolaris	netbsd
it s not linux but you can check out the opensolaris source for ls or the netbsd ls.c online

1317923
uicontrol	uibaritem
uibaritem is not derived from uicontrol so casting to uicontrol really isn t the correct thing to do

1317940
libevent	epoll
currently libevent supports dev poll kqueue event ports select poll and epoll

1317961
ant	maven
or use a tool like maven ivy ant or even an ide like eclipse to ensure the required jars are packaged into your war

1317971
min	max
another approach just for functional fun since i wouldn t recommend it for performance could be to separate the x and y values to two arrays using array.map and then call the min and max functions with apply

1317971
min	max
the min and max functions can take an arbitrary number of input arguments math.max val1 val2 ... valn

1318023
postgresql	mysql
how about other db s like mysql ms sql db2 and postgresql

1318082
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onfocus	onmousedown	onfocus
i tried returning false from onmousedown and onclick i tried calling this.blur in onfocus i tried setting the readonly attribute none of this seems to work in firefox

1318145
tetris	pacman
what if you d implement tetris pacman or doom using canvas

pylons	turbogears
this isnt really specific to a certain framework but it is fully implemented in pylons and turbogears 2.0

1318262
datalist	repeater
---if you are getting product randomly from db then repeater or datalist could be the best choice

1318266
keydown	keyup
handle the keydown keyup keypress event and set the e.handled in the eventhandler to true for the keys you want to be ignored

1318268
postgresql	mysql
my requirements for the server are quite standard latest versions of apache mysql php probably python and postgresql

1318287
postgresql	mysql
use prefork-worker apache mysql 5 php 5 postgresql 8.4

1318291
google-chrome	firefox
it seems fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome sometimes nothing shows up

1318301
copying	overwrite
note that this is implemented by executing a subshell using popen and copying the standard output to the current file specified in the bufferfile setting and then reading that file so be careful you don t overwrite something you don t intend to

1318324
innodb	myisam
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

1318328
fseek	fgetc
to iterate backwards one line use fseek combined with fgetc

1318346
button	checkbox
you should turn your checkbox to radio button so that a user can only select one country

1318380
peer	p2p
it s a p2p peer 2 peer routing algorithm

1318445
children	parent
how can i tell jquery to only look at the s that are in the parent table and don t search any further in possible children tables

1318470
srt	subtitle
i want to format srt subtitle text files to avoid wrapping problems on my media player

1318488
google-chrome	firefox
i would suggest modifying your selector slightly to ensure that it works on browsers that append a to tables like firefox and google-chrome

1318510
cos	sin
from my experience sin and cos are pretty expensive operations

1318550
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works great in firefox 3 + 3.5 ie 6 + 7 safari 4 google-chrome 2 + 3 and opera 9 + 10

1318594
postgresql	mysql
it uses mysqldump to backup mysql and pg_dump to backup postgresql

1318615
innodb	myisam
use -r to backup stored procedures but also keep in mind that if you want a consistent dump of your database while its being modified you need to use --single-transaction if you only backup innodb or --lock-all-tables if you also need myisam tables

1318638
postgresql	mysql
check out astrails-safe for mysql postgresql plain_files subversion backup with encryption and upload to s3 sftp

1318646
many-to-many	one-to-many
whenever you have situations like this you need to determine whether the relationship is one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many

1318675
rss	feed
how would i make an nstableview display an rss feed just one

1318680
min	max
this may be just a typo but the sql query you have entered actually has min cmt_id not max cmt_id in it

1318687
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions min max count sum ...

1318711
treemap	treeset
if performance is important you can use a treeset or treemap to hold the country names and do the following can be used to identify countries that start with a given string

1318714
draggable	droppable
jquery ui s droppable lets you define a function to run whenever an acceptable draggable is dropped onto that droppable

1318719
post	get
thus you get to do a post without all the work that this guy went through

1318726
rss	feed
this datasource needs to be capable of either itself attaching to an rss feed reading it parsing it and turning it into something sensible for display

1318726
rss	feed
specifically you will need an nsurlconnection object to get the rss feed either synchronously or async

1318726
rss	feed
you will also need to implement the nsxmlparserdelegate category on a handler object and run an nsxmlparser on your rss feed

1318729
lisp	scheme
primarily i m a bit more interested in learning about some of the lisp that have been around a while like scheme or common lisp

1318729
lisp	scheme
and do you think it s a good idea to say implement scheme in common lisp or vice versa

1318751
lisp	scheme
both scheme and common lisp are fine for your task

1318756
voip	sip
the voip support isn t through a standard like sip instead it is done through rtmfp a new protocol developed by adobe

1318762
codeigniter	cakephp
there are quite a few for php though codeigniter zend framework symfony or cakephp to name a few

1318765
perforce	svn
i don t see why not if you can make perforce ignore the .svn directories then a svn wc is just an ordinary directory of files

1318816
xval	fluentvalidation
validation framework for model binding validations xval or fluentvalidation

1318821
organization	naming
people have enough issues around poor solution code organization and file naming conventions to have one extra issue

1318856
jar	war
in the web-inf lib of each application war file there is a common jar that is shared by all applications

1318881
jar	manifest.mf	jar	war	war	manifest.mf
nest common.jar in each war bundle then modify the bundle class path in manifest.mf to include the nested jar bundle-classpath . common.jar

1318888
free	strcpy
you should store the pointer of makedna before passing it to strcpy so you will be able to free it once you re done

1318900
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
web server for php apache iis lighttpd nginx ...

1318912
free	malloc
however had you been storing malloc d memory inside your structure the key point is that you can t just free the structure and expect the other memory allocations to be free

1318918
free	malloc
this avoids at least one set of messing about with malloc and free

1318923
free	malloc
it is better to do the malloc and free at the same place

1318928
hpricot	libxml-ruby
alright switching from working hpricot to libxml-ruby due to speed and well the disappearance of _why looked at nokogiri for a second but decided to look at libxml-ruby for speed and longevity

1318928
hpricot	libxml-ruby
i just want to loop through the 150 entries and then grab out content and attributes but i m having a hell of a time with libxml-ruby had it working fine with hpricot

1318989
children	parent
note only children of parent which are also on the display list will obtain a valid reference to the stage

1319027
wordpress	joomla
the solutions available through their current webhost are php asp asp.net 2.0 drupal joomla and wordpress

1319028
tostring	string.format
another note you can use string.format and it will automatically call tostring on items

1319029
folder	directory
when you uncompress the directory you get from the download you will see a folder bin

1319051
doc	rtf
if you were to print your rtf doc the printer should go to the next page

1319065
wordpress	joomla
drupal joomla wordpress or anyother open source cms is probably going to give you the features you want and more without having to learn a programming language

1319066
agile	sprint
we are adopting agile practices such as scrum and we execute sprint to build new features for our product

1319089
mouse	keyboard
second keyboard second mouse of course

1319136
put	get
i need to get the current xls filename so that i can put that at the end of my static path

1319179
rss	feed
feed is like an rss feed and story is like a single story from that feed

1319245
chown	chmod
what i ended up doing was creating an objective c method i was planning on using this in a cocoa app anyways that finds out the permissions of a file using a perl script then uses chmod chown to apply those permissions

1319252
mouse	keyboard
polling mouse or keyboard states works in a game where you have direct access to update methods that are the heartbeat of the application

1319259
rss	feed
i am writing some c# code to parse rss feed and highlight specific whole words in the content however i need to only highlight words that are outside html

1319264
put	get
put them all into my java lib ext directory made sure they re on my eclipse build path removed the mac com.apple.quarantine extended attribute did a chmod a+x on the .jar files and i still get the following error trying to import javax.xml.stream.xmlinputfactory

1319293
elf	coff
it supports a range of object file formats including linux and bsd a.out elf coff mach-o microsoft 16-bit obj win32 and win64

1319300
16-bit	64bit
the standard only requires that int be larger than 16-bit and no larger than a long so it s not 64bit safe

1319314
stdout	stderr
additionally you must consume stdout and stderr concurrently to prevent blocking

1319321
keydown	keyup
once you application window is closed it will not raise keyup keydown

1319383
hash	salt
the usual way is to store a salt hash of the password in a database

1319388
folder	directory
apparently the silverlight application is calling the web service in my development folder not the service in the iis virtual directory c webs silverlighttest he call to the web service did not work when i opened the page from a different computer in the workgroup

1319406
teamcity	nant
teamcity supports nant

1319406
teamcity	nant
we also have one-click deployment builds set up in teamcity using nant

1319424
vbscript	jscript
i m wondering if it s possible to send a simple message from a html form using maybe jscript or javascript or dhtml or vbscript or something else

1319433
post	get
this method is called by the webapp infrastructure if any of your get post etc methods return an unhandled exception

1319436
hash	salt
you should instead be storing a hash version of the password and salt using a cryptographic hash function like sha-2

1319436
hash	salt
always use a randomly generated salt to make it infeasible for attackers to use rainbow tables to crack passwords in the event your stored list of password hash is compromised

1319454
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop check to get the size of the arrays will not work

1319454
free	malloc
if you use malloc free or new delete then you ll have to specify the size of the array you want beforehand

1319465
width	height
notice that i created the constants width height

1319465
width	height
you should use these to get the width height of your elements

1319481
width	height
the font is 9x5 a value that i divide by 2 to obtain width height and render the object from the center

1319481
width	height
so with 4.5x2.5 pixels i use floats for x y width and height of simple rectangles the texture is messed up if rendered somewhere other than x.5 or so

1319481
width	height
can i find out which width height are divisible by two and those that aren t handle them differently

1319674
postgresql	mysql
queries are written in sql not specific to any rdbms but your code remains compatible with any of the supported dbs sqlite mysql postgresql and others

1319716
actionscript	haxe
you will need haxe for that either using swc output or actionscript 3 generation .

1319726
google-chrome	safari
i have a web page that links to another web application which unfortunately only completely functions in ie so when viewing the original page with another browser like google-chrome or safari i display a warning that the application won t operate fully operate unless opened in ie

1319728
folder	directory
if d svn some directory is within your solution folder then you can add somedll.dll to your visual studio solution and set copy to output directory to copy always in the file properties

1319780
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
if you are considering either mstest or nunit then i recommend you look at mbunit

1319780
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
the only difference is it doesn t care if you wrote your tests in nunit mstest xunit or mbunit

1319780
mbunit	nunit
all features in nunit are supported by mbunit

1319785
entity-relationship	diagram
you can then take this information and begin drafting an entity relationship entity-relationship diagram to depict these objects and relationships

1319791
width	height
4 change the height and width with a storyboard set the duration on the storyboard

1319804
webrat	cucumber
i ve been having trouble using cucumber and webrat to test authlogic-openid authentication in a rails app

1319804
webrat	cucumber
openid works when i login using the browser but so far i ve been unable to test the app using cucumber and webrat

1319804
post	get
again this works when i try it in the browser but webrat won t doesn t correctly follow the get post redirects required to authentic with the dummy open id server

1319834
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
first in accordance with darren s suggestion i m wrapping my modal view controller in a generic uinavigationcontroller which contains it s own uitoolbar uinavigationbar that comes with a title

1319852
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
you can use ejb3 with glassfish or jboss or weblogic

1319872
titlebar	window
decorations titlebar system menu minimize etc depend on window flags passed into constructor

1319900
strtol	atoi
to convert a string to an integer meaningfully you ll need to use atoi strtol stringstream etc

1319917
post	put
i put forward that this would be a wordpress job due to the designed features tag cloud dated categorized post ability to be updated rss etc

1319923
x86	64bit
i downloaded the wrapper 3.2.3 source and compiled a macosx x86 64bit version which got rid of the native library warning

1319939
x86	64bit
one alternative option is to have both the 32- and 64bit versions of the unmanaged dll have the same name but have them live in separate folders in your build output say x86 and x64

1319944
qsqlquery	qsqldatabase
it insulates you completely from the database driver qsqldatabase qsqlquery and qsqlresult at the forefront there are some abstractions that also insulate you from actual sql qsqltablemodel and qsqlrelationaltablemodel but those are geared for use in any of the qt views

1319962
hash	salt
with hashing you need to be very careful that you have included a salt otherwise it can be trivial to determine a matching hash

1319963
g++	gcc
what is the difference between g++ and gcc

1319963
g++	gcc
what -i includes or -l libraries do i need to add to the gcc command line that the g++ command line is including by default

1319983
profiler	vtune	profiler	xperf	vtune	xperf
i d suggest looking at this under a profiler like xperf the f1 profiler in visual studio 2010 beta 1 it has 2 new concurrency modes which help see contention or intel s vtune

1320008
g++	gcc
why not compile the c objects with gcc and the c++ with g++ and then when you link link using the g++

1320022
hash	hmac
hmac essentially rolls a secret key known only by your server into the hash so even someone who knows the algorithm can t generate a hmac that will be recognized as valid without knowing the key

1320022
hash	salt
just using a plain old hash is trivially bypassable because the attacker can generate valid hash of their own data and all the salt in the ocean won t fix that

1320022
hash	hmac
so in summary don t just hash it use an hmac

1320036
fgets	getline
if your implementation supports it you should use the safer getline instead on scanf or fgets

1320083
filtering	grouping
how can i add a filtering to show only max logs.date before 2009 08 03 because line 3 where max logs.date 2009 08 03 causes an error invalid grouping by function

1320096
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
create a sqlconnection open it create a sqlcommand execute it to get a sqldatareader voila

1320103
post	get
for your flash app there s no difference if the backend is python php or anything so you can follow a normal php + flash contact form guide and then build the backend using django or any other python web framework receive the information from the http request get or post probably the last one and do whatever you wanted to do with them

1320128
inject	interceptor
and yes i know about event listeners and will be using them on another project - but i wanted to see if i could get around having to inject the interceptor in code - thank you

put	get
if i get a chance in the next few days i ll try to put something together for you but give it a try don t wait for me

1320332
integer	unsigned
edit thus for reading a foreign processes memory which is a form of interop i would definitely be using an unsigned integer

1320338
vmware	virtualbox
create a windows xp virtual machine with your favorite virtualisation solution vmware virtualbox virtualpc etc

1320372
move	drag
as soon as i begin to drag the highlight goes away and the cell stays put - literally it never move at all

1320386
qcombobox	qvector	qcombobox	qpushbutton
how do i make a qvector or some other container class of a dynamic number of widgets such as qpushbutton or qcombobox in qt 4

1320386
qcombobox	qpushbutton
i would really appreciate an example of declaring initializing and populating any data structure of any qwidgets qcombobox qpushbutton etc.

1320394
daemon	cron
the bottom line is that if you leave some echo statements in a php script and set it as a cron job then you will start getting emails from the cron daemon

1320401
ubuntu	linux
returns the string linux not ubuntu 9.04

1320446
cfstring	nsstring
you ll find a few options that are directly relevant to literal nsstring s and their toll-free-bridged counterparts cfstring s

1320478
textview	imageview
i hava a complex listview two textview one imageview so i used newview bindview to display data

1320526
google-chrome	firefox
i was doing the browser recognition tutorial on w3schools and i found that when using firefox and google-chrome i received netscape 5 as my result

1320527
for-loop	arrays
store the email addresses as an arrays and using for-loop just keep adding each email address as a string to the mail- addaddress field

1320667
merb	ruby-on-rails
i had heard about ruby-on-rails and merb for web development in ruby

1320677
post	get
you could also detect http post get variables and that would tell you if it is a command line vs web request

1320679
merb	ruby-on-rails
also merb is merging with ruby-on-rails

1320814
implements	extends
moreover when other classes extends note not implements and therefore you can also have just one abstract class per child class your abstract class they are not forced to implements all of your methods of your abstract class unless you specified an abstract method in such case it works like for interfaces you cannot define the method body

1320835
implements	extends
another frequent pattern is to implements the main functionality in the abstract class and define part of the algorithm in an abstract method to be implements by an extends class

1320844
put	get
poor ejemplow i want to get a reference to a configured instance of ilog from a logmanger.getlogger method and put it into the fluent flow early enough to inject it into properties of my downstream objects

1320844
factors	matrix
and whether the log4net ilog object is static seems to be the deciding factors as to whether it is serializable and can be mashalled between assemblies without the dramatic the runtime will become unstable warnings which are truly meaningful only to matrix fans

1320851
webkit	gecko
is would guess that there is already a webkit gecko based command line app maybe even working as a server speed up to rending of multiple pages which is already doing this

1320887
subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class is used by creating an inheriting subclass that can be instantiated

1320887
subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class does a few things for the inheriting subclass

1320924
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you move from underscore-separated to camel case you ll be ok since jpa implementations are designed to work with case-sensitive as well as case-insensitive databases

1320938
ssl	https
for 1 you can use ssl and https

1320938
ubuntu	linux
plus tools for running an entire linux system on a encrypted hard drive are pretty matures on ubuntu lvm let you do that almost transparently

1320950
children	parent
i want the bind the parent to the first band of my ultrawebgrid and the children to the second band

1320966
children	parent
a child has a reference to its parent and a parent has a list of children

1320966
children	parent
this means that when i remove a child i get holes in the children list after saving to the database and fetching the parent again

1320966
children	parent
if i remove the bidirectionality by not having a many-to-one from the children to the parent and no inverse true the listorder is updated correctly

1320978
erlang	ocaml
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distributed systems although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects

1321025
memcpy	memset
the means you could get rid of unused library functions like memset memcpy and reduce crt0 size

1321043
maven	pom.xml
when you want to open the project in eclipse you have to check out the sources setup maven repository path for eclipse with mvn eclispse add-maven-repo build them with mvn install and then run target mvn eclipse eclipse which creates the eclipse project setup from the maven s pom.xml configuration

1321082
post	get
i ve implemented a partial solution code below using this post but 1 i can t get the generic view function to recognize the type of strong view pages unless i create a code behind for the strongly typed view and 2 intellisense and refactoring don t work properly with this method which makes me doubt the reliability of the method i m using

1321144
post	get
i want to programatically download the contents of a web page but that page is generated as the result of a post and i cant seem to get it working

1321146

i need to have an application simply record mouse gestures and keyboard strokes that will then be able to play this recording back

1321155
width	height
is there an easy way to implement this can you bind the x and the y coordinates of a javafx node to its own height and width

1321190
button	checkbox
goal on button press of an unrelated button disable the checkbox and the textbox

1321275
width	height
the scrollbar template reaches out for system parameters to determine its width height depending on orientation

1321289
titlebar	window
you can remove the titlebar from a window using the getwindowlong and setwindowlong gwl_ style function to remove the ws_caption style bit

1321308
awt	swing
is there any standard way say with awt swing to do do this

1321312
inherited	subclassing
1 thing to expect with multiple inherited is that your pointer can change when casting to a typically not first subclassing

1321326
width	height
all you have to do is make sure the progress bar has a fixed width a height and an overflow hidden

1321355
folder	directory
i want to copy a file example a.jpg to all folder in a directory

1321387
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

1321435
put	get
if i make any changes in code of the structure of those objects and i put a new version live any logged user will get an error as their session objects the old version ones do not match the structure that the new version expects while deserializing

1321466
folder	directory
however assuming you have a base directory you want to keep within such as the root of an ftp folder how do you best ensure that a given user input keeps us within that folder

1321506
filesystems	ntfs
the windows filesystems fat32 and ntfs only recognizes the pe file name so two assemblies with the same pe file name but different culture version or public key token cannot exist in the same windows folder

1321579
width	height
essentially the area height width that you specify is what we try to deliver in the content area of the dialog barring window restrictions on scriptable minimum sizes 250px wide x 150px high

1321610
inherited	properties
the first thing to do is to add the following attributes to each properties of the reporttype class that needs to be serialised and inherited the class from applicationsettingsbase

1321627
cos	sin
it is easy to move robot in angle direction by multiplying movement step on sin angle and cos angle

1321686
folder	directory
i suspect that this could have something to do with the current user id that the app is running under for example if you are running the app in a user session debugging in vs then this may return your current directory but if you were running it under iis then this could be why it is defaulting to the system folder

1321711
ant	maven
the build-jsps.xml ant script runs the org.apache.jasper.jspc task to precompile jsp in the a webapp that maven is building

1321726
post	get
my understanding is that the get and post methods are distinct from the basic authentication method but that basic authentication is not often used on the open net

1321775
subtraction	addition
here s a slightly nicer but longer solution that uses mapaccum to do a sliding subtraction and addition

1321777
hide	show
note my version does not remove the row from the dom because i just want to hide show it but it should be fairly easy to adapt

1321798
hide	show
i use the following code to find a particular table hide it then show it on click

1321806
ant	pom.xml
can you post a minimal pom.xml and ant configuration that shows the error

1321832
int	chars
you can also use the string.indexof chars value int startindex method which has as its parameter says a start index from which the scan is started

1321913
client-side	server-side
use an orm that works for client-side and use another on server-side be it php ruby whatever write your synchronization logic twice in two different languages write your business logic twice in two different languages

1321920
r-tree	quadtree
i recommend to use some smart data structure such as an r-tree or a quadtree

1321925
instances	transient
the deleted instances gets transient in memory

1321925
instances	transient
references to the transient instances from other will cause an exception

1322000
mp3	wav
i want to play in my web site 3gp amr mid mp3 wav files

1322003
post	get
other ways are cookies post and get parameters

1322011
client-side	server-side
there are two forms of javascript client-side and server-side

1322011
client-side	server-side
in client-side javascript it is not possible while in server-side javascript it is possible

1322011
client-side	server-side
so it depends on whether you are using client-side or server-side javascript

1322011
client-side	server-side
that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

1322057
ready	each
if you can make use of each result without having to rely on all of the results being ready simultaneously the single

1322128
getter	setter
i think the best solution is a container handler and all access getter setter to the container through the handler

1322198
hide	show
when a button is clicked i want to show the corresponding div with the show method and to hide the other divs

1322215
button	checkbox
hidden fields radio button checkbox text inputs etc

1322248
onchange	onblur
however if you ever encounter a situation where you do need to fire an ajax request based on the user editing data in a form field you can accomplish this by listening for javascript events like onchange and onblur and fire the ajax request from that event listener

1322284
udp	tcp
if it was udp it would maybe work but you also can not rely on packets to represent whole message either udp or tcp

1322328
pow	math.h
you can now call the pow function found in math.h using this friend function.your power function can now be defined as

1322331
uploadify	swfupload
one thing to keep in mind if you use session variables in your upload action being hit by swfupload uploadify is that flash gets its own sessionid and anything placed in the session after a flash upload request is placed in the flash session

1322335
post	get
what is the best java library to use for http post get etc

1322339
sharepoint	spsite
a better approach for elevating permissions within sharepoint is to use spsite impersonation

1322354
post	put	post	get	put	get
full implementation of all http methods get post put delete

1322354
ssl	https
supports encryption with https http over ssl protocol

1322359
boost	stl
the stl boost and maybe for productivity and ease in the beginning qt

1322371
webkit	gecko
read up on trident gecko and webkit - three very popular layout engines

1322393
folder	directory
which creates a default project with compass for the blueprint css framework currently there s a bug in compass with the creation of the grid.png file in the images directory for compass so you need to copy the original grid.png from the source folder

1322393
folder	directory
the sass cache creates a bunch of temporary folder in your project directory which probably would have poor outcomes if they ended under source control

1322426
boost	stl
my question is if i am unable to use boost shared_ptr and its little brothers what is the alternative when using stl containers with pointers

1322493
temp	tmp
the path specified by the temp environment variable if tmp is not defined

1322493
temp	tmp
the current directory if both tmp and temp are not defined

1322520
hide	show
the overlay grid hide everything else the normal content and is only show under special circumstances if the network connection goes down

1322553
jndi	jta
the problem i am faced with is the following hibernate seems to require jndi to work correctly with jbossts jboss s jta implementation

1322569
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to the latest 0.10 versioning

1322655
puts	gets
once the user has uploaded and scaled the images they are directed to an album viewer which gets the photos out of the db and puts them into heads

1322664
put	get
either you re trying to put the headers in the body or one of your headers preceding content-type has a spurious newline in the value ending the header lines early and making your content-type line not get counted as a header

1322675
put	get
i understand that i can add in a .contains or similar and put in keywords from a keyword box split into individual items and that should get the list of results

1322694
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works in internet explorer firefox safari opera google-chrome others a plus

1322720
pop-up	dialog
the dialog window which can pop-up does not have to be modal

1322771
momentjs	datejs
nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j

1322833
google-chrome	firefox
update as of june 2015 page speed plugins for firefox and google-chrome is no longer maintained and available instead google suggests the web version

1322839
hide	show
i need to use the title attribute because of slimbox but i want to hide the title-text that show up when hovering the mouse over the link

1322877
children	parent
in pl sql getting a list of all of the children of a parent is simple enough

1322884
put	get
i ask because if i put a free stringvar at the end of method1 i get a warning that stringvar is unitialized inside method1 which is true

1322936
put	get
if i declare the header file and don t put anything in the cpp i get the following error

1322973
free	malloc
specifically see when i call malloc to allocate memory for a pointer which is local to a function do i have to explicitly free it

1322982
folder	directory
alternatively if you re trying to create a new repository you can just copy the folder delete all of the .svn folder and check in the entire directory to the new repository

1322996
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you can have a look at sharpdevelop and or monodevelop two spen source .net managed ide

1323030
jar	war
for one artifact i need to build is a war file which excludes certain aspectj files from the build and the other is a jar file which needs those aspects to be weaved during the build

1323042
g++	gcc
gcc c++ linker g++

1323043
ready	each
one approach is to keep each feature on its own branch and only merge it back to the main branch when the new feature is ready

1323043
ready	each
this is easiest when the feature branches don t sit around collecting dust√¢ perhaps each programmer could work on only 1 or 2 features at a time and merge them as soon as they re ready

1323044
switching	accessory
i spent ages fiddling around with custom uitableviewcells with a simple label and switching on it before i discovered i could just add a uiswitch as an accessory view

1323046
hash	md5
assuming uniform spread in the range of md5 and sha-1 hash for random strings which isn t the case and assuming we re only talking about two strings and not talking about a pool of strings so we avoid birthday-paradox-type complexities

1323046
hash	md5
an md5 hash is 128 bits wide and sha-1 s is 160

1323130
post	put
i d like to be able to change the value of the post item and then put it back on the post

1323143
int	boolean
ie before version 8 confuses attribute access with js object property access resulting in confusing errors when the attribute is named differently class vs classname or the type of the property is different boolean or int properties where an attribute is always string

1323174
google-chrome	firefox
but the function vad does not get called in firefox nor in google-chrome

1323270
jar	war
make the war project have a dependency on the jar project and the jar project have a dependency on aspectjrt

1323270
jar	war
if you need to build both projects at once define an aggregator pom and specify both the jar and war projects as modules

1323278
firefox	safari
ie 8 behaves correctly and looks very close to firefox and safari which was a pleasant surprise.

1323281
width	height
by default the img element and other replaced elements flash etc are inline-block - this means they flow inline like text but have a width and height

1323292
folder	dir
you can of course create a specific folder on the same mount point not accessible to the application suited for this task simulating this way a tempfile on the same mountpoint if you don t want to see any spurious file in the destination dir

1323305
width	height
if you want a something that would constrict the size of a loaded image to a maximum width and height mantaining the ratio you could use something like this

1323309
srp	principles
this would allow you to properly isolate your concerns across multiple classes and not violate srp single responsibility principles

1323355
unsigned	short
unsigned short shortvalues

1323390
hide	show
the script and html below creates a nice hide show menu when you click the navheader the navitem becomes visible

1323404
postgresql	mysql
i can comment on how mysql and postgresql compare in a few areas that might be important but without information it s hard to say which of these actually matter to you

1323404
postgresql	mysql
i ve written up a bunch more background information on this topic at why postgresql instead of mysql comparing reliability and speed

1323404
postgresql	mysql
mysql can do a good job with a small number of clients at higher client counts the locking mechanism in postgresql might do a better job

1323404
postgresql	mysql
if not it s easier to turn more of those features off in mysql which gives it a significant speed advantage compared to postgresql

1323463
gridview	sqldatasource
i made sure the gridview has the correct sqldatasource control as its source

1323476
post	get
did you try doing a get instead of a post just to make sure it is something wrong with the web request itself

1323514
width	height
the rectangle has a specified size lets say width 150 and height 30

1323556
tinyurl	bit.ly
the site i am working on wants to generate its own shortened urls rather than rely on a third party like tinyurl or bit.ly

1323576
short	base
so in short all of the higher-level classes you use that are installed when you install the .net framework are part of the framework class library but not necessarily part of the base class library

1323586
uilabel	uifont
set the font property of the uilabel with a uifont that matches that size

1323586
uilabel	uifont
you can get more information from the uilabel and uifont documentation

1323587
x86	64bit
note that this approach requires that you build your application for the x86 platform since the flash player is currently 32-bit only and you cannot interact with its activex object from 64bit code

1323591
getter	setter
also if you create a property on the object to handle this make sure to only implement a public getter in the property and not a public setter

1323601
versioning	upgrade
.net versioning is 2.0 i can upgrade if its necessary but i dont think its the issue

1323622
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
dave hyatt who used to work on gecko used by firefox and others at mozilla and now works on webkit used by safari google-chrome and others has an old blog post explaining some of the complexities of this process

1323647
post	get
with register_globals set to on any variable in is automatically injected as a vartiable in your application -- well actually this depends on the variables_order configuration option but this one almost always includes get post and cookie at least

1323782
xlib	xcb
xcb which replaces xlib at the moment

1323782
clutter	cairo
xrender cairo clutter that may do what you want already

1323829
uilabel	uifont
what you want is the textcolor property that belongs to uilabel -- uifont depends on other classes like uilabel to provide other gui-related properties like the color of the text

1323831
uilabel	uifont
instead of setting the color in a uifont you set the uilabel s textcolor property which is a uicolor

1323889
children	parent
it looks like you only want the children back so you need to change your criteria to get the type of the child objects then use the parent id as the selection

1323936
gridview	sqldatasource
if i bind gridview via datasourceid attribute to sqldatasource and set selectcommand and updatecommand attributes then everything works perfectly

1323937
hash	md5
there are multiple implementations of md5 and sha1 available in javascript that turn any string into a hash string and that can easily be used with jquery

1323999
stdout	stderr
if i wanted to use the same file for stdout and stderr or if i wanted to replace a file handle with some other number then i would need to call the dup2 system call to achieve that result

1324030
thickbox	simplemodal
simplemodal looks great but i found it so much harder to implement than facebox or thickbox

1324090
apache	nginx
you can read the file from s3 and write it locally to a non-public directory then use x-sendfile apache or x-accel-redirect nginx to serve the content

1324120
getdate	dateadd
i m sure it s with a dateadd and getdate

1324138
intersect	contains
this will completely constrain the polygonization with no twisting and should be much easier to solve than the general case - simply find the point on the plane contains the second circle that is closest to that selected in the first and intersect the line passing through that point and the second circle s center with the second circle s perimeter

1324140
getter	setter
the setter in myspecificclass shouldn t be a problem but the getter definitely is - internally a call to an instance of myspecificclass s status will be making a call to itself to see which value to return which will make a call to itself to see.

1324161
getdate	dateadd
select dateadd yy datediff yy -1 getdate 0

1324165
mouse	keyboard
via the api i would look into hooking the keyboard and mouse messages so that your app can pre-process every mouse click on other applications - start with setwindowshookex and read everything you can about hooking messages

1324223
uilabel	uifont	uilabel	nsstring	nsstring	uifont
i searched the documentation on this but it appears that shadows don t draw blurry and there s no method in nsstring uifont or uilabel that could help to do it

1324268
getter	setter
the abstract property declaration in the base class just states derived classes must implement a property called status with a getter and setter

1324276
photoshop	coreldraw
suppose if i am using coreldraw or photoshop there is always an option for align distribute

1324278
content-length	content-type
keep in mind that you also need to add proper headers like content-type content-length etc the readfile manual page has some examples

1324412
put	get
i personally do not put the .text property on my commands simply because i get no reuse out of these commands

1324466
getter	setter
in ruby they are used for some meta-programming tasks like generating getter and setter for member variables for example attr_reader name to generate a getter for name

1324513
children	parent
for instance i need the links to the children pages to only show up when a parent page is showing

1324588
cpu	affinity
you will not be able to do anything smarter than sql already does in regard to partition the data access per cpu it simply has access to information you don t buffer pool fill state page lifetime expectancy cpu numa affinity etc

1324619
hash	md5
i have some mysql tables that are currently using an md5 hash as a primary key

1324624
children	parent
as for your i need the links to the children pages to only show up when a parent page is showing problem you can organize wordpress pages hierarchically then make use of that hierarchy in the theme php

1324629
public	protected
how can i use public private protected internal

1324650
hash	md5
furthermore though very unlikely there is a chance that md5 hash of different strings could collide i seem to recall the probability as being 1 in 36 to the power of 32

1324674
hash	md5
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys

1324674
hash	md5
another question is what are the upsides of using an md5 hash

1324680
subtraction	addition
dear professor subtraction should be defined in terms of addition

1324688
hash	md5
calculating an md5 hash and using it as a key for something that s already unique is redundant

1324688
hash	md5
on the other hand if name is not unique then the md5 hash won t be unique either and so it s pointless that way too

1324688
hash	md5
generally you use an md5 hash when you don t want to store the actual value of the column

1324688
hash	md5
for instance if you re storing passwords you generally only store the md5 hash of the password not the password itself so that you can t see people s passwords just by looking at the table contents

1324702
mef	prism
to what extent if any is mef a replacement for prism

1324705
post	get
however when you make the request via jquery you need to pick either get or post

1324707
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

1324720
firefox	safari
moving the stylesheet below all js indeed shows that the js including the ready function runs much earlier but even then the jquery-applied class --which is yet unknown when the js runs-- is used correctly in my quick tests in safari and firefox

1324742
mef	prism
take a look at this sparkling client podcast on mef and prism

post	get
the working project is using an httpservice to connect to an application running on localhost using post and get to retrieve values

1329087
for-loop	loops
then for loops you need a plain for-loop rather than a for each

1329110
textblock	itemscontrol
the strings are displayed in textblock i ve declared in the itemscontrol template

1329134
subtraction	addition
i don t get my date addition and subtraction very easily but it was much easier to get the data in there in the format i wanted

1329143
public	protected
the class itself is public but some of its properties are protected internal abstract like

1329163
unsigned	short
how can i write 23 so that it is clear it is an unsigned short int

1329178
unsigned	short
numeric literals cannot have short or unsigned short type

1329178
unsigned	short
of course in order to assign to bar the value of the literal is implicitly converted to unsigned short

1329178
unsigned	short
casting is potentially worse since with some compilers it will quell any warnings that would be issued if the literal value is outside the range of an unsigned short

1329178
unsigned	short
if nothing else this only works if the unsigned short version actually exists whereas a call with the cast performs the usual overload resolution to find the most compatible version available

1329207
put	get
both projects have had allot of effort put into them by different people to get a good sepperation of concerns in the context of asp.net mvc and domain driven design

1329263
outputstream	inputstream
try invoking the getresponsecode method before opening the inputstream or outputstream

1329354
dsn	paradox

width	height
because we know the width of the page and the height of the image and we were able to approximate the pixel height of the text

1329501
inherited	properties
my first thought was to create my own class that inherited it then decorate all the properties with xml and then serialize it

1329521
temp	tmp
windows defines environment variables temp and tmp both giving the current user s temporary folder

1329527
mousemove	mouseup
it then attaches a mousemove event to the menu so that when the users moves their mouseup and down the menu scrolls allowing them to see the hidden items

1329543
getter	setter
if you need to use databinding because your application design prevents you from accessing the service directly i d recommend binding to a property with getter and setter functions that you control

1329554
uilabel	nsstring
i have an nsstring that then sets a uilabel

1329587
int	chars
the convert class has methods that can convert between chars and int

pop-up	dialog
the nicest pop-up dialog i have seen for jquery yet

1329619
integer	fractions
nsdecimalnumber is a fixed precision and scale integer scaled to a certain size to represent fractions numbers

1329624
stdout	stderr
2 sending the stdout to null nul will only keep the stderr output set into e

1329624
stdout	stderr
with those being said you have to test the script and see if the exception is actually sent to stderr or like some other softwares to stdout even if an error occured

1329641
range	minimum
if you don t have a sequential id you end up using a minimum id and rowcount to select a range

1329646
actionscript	mxml
unfortunately the latest stable releases of flashdevelop does not support code completion in mxml although the feature is fully implemented in as you can browse packages in libraries with code completion in actionscript

1329664
cvs	svn
i ve seen this happening once in a while usually with a user b who does not really understand svn s or cvs ftm workflow

1329724
post	get
they probably mean using a soap api this format uses usually a username password + function call to get post data from the service

1329732
sorting	filtering
and it can also handle row selection inserting deleting sorting filtering etc

1329732
sorting	filtering
it handles row selection inserting deleting sorting filtering etc

1329746
fgets	fread
fread fgets fclose etc

1329760
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i place the following files from the silverlight.web release build in the web root crossdomain.xml clientaccesspolicy.xml service1.svc service1.svc.cs web.config

1329769
move	drag
but what i did a long time ago was only start the drag if the user is holding down the mouse and has held it down for a period of time or move it a certian distance

1329802
hide	show
a colleague suggested that on page load i append all possible tooltips with visibility none and show hide them on demand

1329816
kerberos	ntlm
it supports a wide variety of publishing and authentication mechanisms and it plays quite nicely with sharepoint leveraging both ntlm and kerberos authentication

1329846
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
also you could use different methods to show hide the tips like fadein fadeout slidedown slideup on the hidden element

1329860
oodbms	db4o
i ve considered using the db4o oodbms with a recent silverlight ria services project but there s one point that i could use some advice on - how to make associations work

1329860
oodbms	db4o
the problem that i see with using db4o or any oodbms is that foreign keys and primary keys do not and need not exist - and the result is that i wouldn t need the racer.carid and car.id properties

1329860
getter	setter
doing that by hand would be prone to error so i d want a lot of that handled in the property getter and setter but i m not sure of the best way to implement that

1329882
redmine	trac
try bitnami packages for redmine or trac they are easy to use installers that you can run on your server there are also virtual machines available as well

1329891
hide	show
the biggest reason i could think to use show and hide instead of append and remove is that when you use .remove it will destroy all event handlers and cached on the dom objects you are removing

1329894
min	max
the first is an info table that has a search id identity column and has the min and max row numbers

1329894
min	max
i insert into the second table and get the min and max rows and store them in the first table

1329965
facebook	fbconnect
fbconnect lets you call all of the facebook apis so you d want to look at or

1330061
mbunit	nunit
when i stub out a test with coderush it is automatically inserting a using statement for nunit when i already have a using statement for mbunit

1330067
war	manifest.mf
i have tried some other things including manually adding core.jar to the war s manifest.mf file changing usejbosswebloader to true in the jboss-service.xml file under the jboss-web.deployer and various combinations of the above to no success

1330067
jar	war	folder	directory
i either lose the classes directory from the classpath lib folder and none of my properties files get picked up or the war can t access the proper class from the jar

1330067
jboss	weblogic
the problems might stem from the setup of the project as well as this is a large established project that is to an extent being migrated from a weblogic deployment to jboss

1330110
firefox	safari
please run your project and look at the name of the textbox generated by viewing the source in the broswer ie firefox safari whatever

1330111
vim	emacs
i could use emacs diff mode but i m a vim user and i don t want to learn emacs

1330132
ksort	asort
pretty much all of the core sorting functions with all the sort ksort asort variations depending on whether you want to maintain key association and so on

1330144
for-loop	arrays
the most prevalent one that comes to mind is that an indexed arrays can be looped over using a traditional for-loop whereas an associative one cannot because it does not have the numeric indexes

1330162
datalist	repeater
i first tried using a datalist with repeatlayout in table mode and repeatcolumns to a set value of 10 with a repeater within containing a label control

1330188
unsigned	short
there are no modifiers for unsigned short

1330191
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

1330197
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
to elaborate iirc ie5+ all firefox most netscape opera safari google-chrome

1330203
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
according to wiki ie7 firefox 1.0 safari 1.0 opera 7 and google-chrome fully support

1330214
getter	setter
each option on the slider has a setter as well as a getter so you can set the value with that as in the example above

1330259
factors	mean
by fine-grained i mean the case where there are a lot of potential discriminating factors in any authorazation decision and for each discriminating factors say amount of credit applied for by the customer there is a potentially large range of values say there are 25 distinct ranges of credit-amount-applied-for

1330294

1330394
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie firefox and google-chrome

1330410
inherited	properties
have you tried changing the contentinset contentoffset contentsize properties inherited from uiscrollview

1330543
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerator	idisposable
given the above the compiler will generate a class that implements and idisposable actually it will also implement the non-generic versions of ienumerable and ienumerator

1330595
hide	show
i ve constructed a simple test with jquery to see if i can get an element to show hide upon the clicking of a button

1330607
hide	show
regardless you can simply call .toggle to show or hide the element

1330657
implements	sealed
in doing so the jit can resolve the sealed overload of dispose implements by the struct and call it directly without boxing the object

1330682
folder	directory
then to ls the directory in a folder

1330686
des	aes
blowfish and triple des use 64 bits blocks but remember that those algorithms didn t receive the same scrutiny as aes

1330728
ienumerable	iqueryable
any collection object that implements ienumerable iqueryable or other interfaces like these can be queried using linq from i in entityset.

1330771
inherited	subclassing
a class that doesn√¢ t need to inherited any special behavior from another class should nevertheless be made a subclassing of the nsobject class

1330793
superclass	subclassing
subclassing of nsobject may have their own specialized init routines and at the beginning of such they should call their superclass init routine something like so

1330845
inherited	subclassing
since it is possible to inherited from different root base classes yes you must explicitly declare you inherited from nsobject when you make any new class unless of course you are subclassing something else already which itself in turn probably subclassing nsobject

1330886
queue	fifo
they are queue but the order is not guaranteed to be fifo

1330894
post	get
but when i drill into the formcollection values all i can get is the value not the text of the selected option this makes sense given the design goals but how can i also post over the text value

1330935
validationsummary	customvalidator
if you use a customvalidator control and a validationsummary control within an aspx page for server side validation you can set the errormessage of the validator and its text value will appear in place and the errormessage value will be displayed within the validationsummary control

1330935
validationsummary	customvalidator
so that the validationsummary would display its usual headertext along with your additional errormessage and the customvalidator would display its text value

1330958
rss	feed
is info about drupal rss feed signups available

1330975
rss	feed
i m trying to make a webcomic rss feed with django but i can t put an image in the description field because the html code gets escaped even if it s in an autoescape off block

1330982
opera	firefox
it s very easy in firefox and opera as far as i see

1330994
put	get
if so you can also get rid of the beforefind and put the between condition array in with your other conditions

1331024
wordpress	joomla
well generally a plugin requires an architecture to plug in to such as a cms system like wordpress or joomla

1331064
nfa	dfa
it needs to read nfa from a text file and then convert from nfa to dfa

1331092
hash	hmac
hash the string sha or use hmac as suggested by remus

1331101
post	get	getter	setter
typically you create instance variables on your action beans expose w getter setter and they are populated automagically via form post params or get params

1331119
button	checkbox
when i click the checkbox with the mouse left button the declared event is not fired

1331131
getter	setter
basically all i care is that it has a getter it does not matter if the property has a setter

1331139
nfa	dfa
oh and just to give a little hint when you describe the nfa dfa in paragraph form try describing it as if you were going to draw a picture you can replace the draw work with something later in the actual application but it can be a nice placeholder for now

1331146
nfa	dfa
you could have an nfa input stream and a dfa output stream

1331150
inherited	subclassing
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

1331150
superclass	subclassing
if ireadwrite is a subclassing of ireadonly then the inverse is true-- ireadonly is a superclass of ireadwrite

1331186
validationsummary	customvalidator
the rest of the customvalidator control s behavior will tie in with the validationsummary just like any other validator including putting the errormessage up in the header etc

1331266
button	checkbox
the checkbox inherits from buttonbase which add a class handler for the left button down event onmouseleftbuttondown

1331270
put	get
rather than teleporting the unit to get it where it s supposed to be i can start its movement late and then mess with physics to speed it up slightly so that it can catch up to where it s supposed to be and then slow it back down to put it in the correct place

1331270
interpolation	splines
if i don t get a movement update by the time i re-transmit that update its value will be so old that it s no longer relevant so it s better to just send another move and use a local perception filter to catch up or use a cubic splines to interpolation the movement so that it looks more correct or something of that nature

1331295
post	get
i m not sure exactly and i ll update this post once i get chance to try it out on a clean machine i m still mid-project so it s not a very good time to be faffing about

1331295
put	get
the way i fixed it was to get the dlls from c program files episerver cms version bin and put them in the bin folder for the application

1331308
qlineedit	qlabel
i m trying to create a standard two-column form where the first column is a text label qlabel and the second column is an interactive widget typically a text field qlineedit

1331308
qlineedit	qlabel
how can i use group boxes and layouts in a way such that the qlabel s and qlineedit s both inside and outside group boxes are horizontally aligned with each other

1331392
int	boolean
in cases where you re using int as boolean as with old c code i think you should also use the implicit conversion to bool

1331396
gitx	repo
i would open up gitx or gitk that comes with git and check out what the repo looks like.

1331474
vmware	esx
in order to automate vmware esx with scvmm you have to use the virtual center addon

1331500
daemons	launchd
i have a launchd daemons that every so often uploads some data via a web service using nsoperationqueue

1331503
many-to-many	one-to-many
note that if the one-to-many many-to-many relationship ends up being the case you can extract the existing column into a table of its own and fill in the new entries at that time

1331548
rss	feed
look carefully at any other rss feed xkcd.com rss.xml

1331556
rss	feed
rss feed framework

1331563
objectdatasource	formview
now i m trying to bind the object to a formview with the objectdatasource

1331601
codeigniter	cakephp
if you decide to use kohona cakephp codeigniter which are all php frameworks you can achieve very fine grained control over your websites behavior and control every aspect as needed but it will take you much longer to deploy a fully fledged standard site than using a standard cms

1331646
post	get
subsequently if they say clicked on a category name to get a list of all post with that category they d probably get an error unless you were handling that sort of thing

1331670
git-svn	svn2git
caveat i haven t tried this but as far as i know svn2git just converts those into the -t|t|b options for git-svn .

1331673
post	get
when you add a post and get the response from your php script through ajax the response contains a p tag with class editme

1331704
free	realloc
also don t forget that realloc frees the old buffer for you so you only need to free the last buffer.

1331730
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
you should consider options pointed out by branden or some software that ll convert joystick input to keyboard mouse input .

1331784
implements	extends
more complicated examples can be implements in cython using easy extends

1331824
charindex	substr
the first parameter of charindex or patindex must be a substr of the second parameter

1331862
merb	ruby-on-rails
even though it s not merb my first stop would be scaling ruby-on-rails from railscasts

1331882
hide	show
since i can t reliably control the location of the menu i decided to listen for hide and show notifications and toggle user interaction for my ad view

1331913
realloc	malloc
unless you can be absolutely sure at compile time of the amount of data you re going to read in and you can t or at least shouldn t you re going to have to use pointers to arrays allocated with malloc and realloc

1331913
atoi	atof	atoi	strtod	atof	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	atoi	strtol	strtod
my personal favorite functions are strtol and strtod but there are also atoi and atof functions that may be avaliable

1331925
int	chars
if it had an asterisk before the x such as int x 10 int chars void it would be an array of function pointers and would be used like a normal array

1331955
button	checkbox
i have a form with a select all button and a bunch of checkbox

1331955
button	checkbox
i want to have it select all checkbox when the user clicks the select all button

1331961
stdout	stderr
also make your asp .net page echo the process s stdout and stderr and check for error messages

1331962
filesystems	ntfs
then you need to edit the permissions on the ntfs filesystems for the other files

1331980
waitpid	fork
you may have to manage sub-processes yourself via fork exec and waitpid if you must know these things

1331997
button	checkbox
having your button call this when clicked will select all checkbox on the page

1331999
button	checkbox
just give all the checkbox a class and attach this jquery to the button

1331999
button	checkbox
assuming your button has the id mybutton and your checkbox have the class checkbox

1332008
client-side	server-side
php is server-side while javascript the language jquery is written in is client-side

1332025
put	get
as for making it into a cocoa app add an nstextfield label to your main window in interface builder put in a button add in an application controller a subclass of nsobject that you make put in the outlet and the action do the proper connenctions and in the get ip method put in that code and set the value for the label s stringvalue

1332058
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i just tested it it works in current firefox safari google-chrome opera and ie

1332119
antivirus	rootkit
it is detected by many antivirus as rootkit which it is but this one is supposedly tame so it might be probematic to run on systems you don t have full control over when antivirus mandated by domain policy etc

1332140
writetofile	nsdata
the easy way is to use nsdata s convenience methods initwithcontentofurl and writetofile atomically to get the data and write it out respectively

1332166
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
mousedown mouseup mousemove

1332166

keydown	keyup
keydown keypress keyup error

1332184
int	chars
int main int arg_count chars arg_vec

1332212
nsstring	nsxmlparser
i know apache has an option where you can turn on directory indexes so you could do that then download the generated directory index and parse the html using an nsxmlparser or some other parsing library adding an nsstring to an nsmutablearray every time you find a file name

1332247
vb.net	vb6
i m trying to solve this exact same problem myself right at the moment for an application that i am migrating from vb6 to vb.net

1332372
icmp	udp
well php supports a set of socket functions that allow you to deal with udp i ve used them myself to build a nslookup class which i could specify the name server all in udp and a ping class raw icmp

1332377
client-side	server-side
is it client-side processing client bandwidth server bandwidth or server-side processing

1332427
accessor	properties
you should almost never call properties accessor from within the implementation of the same class

1332466
a-star	dijkstra
my question is how does a-star compare with dijkstra

1332474
accessor	properties
if you re using core data you should essentially always use the accessor since some properties may not be loaded from the persistent store until needed

1332474
accessor	properties
if you re modifying the value of myobject you need to use the accessor in order to make sure that any other objects observing the value of that properties are properly notified

1332482
vbscript	jscript
we have implemented this integration in 3 ways using vbscript jscript and runtestset utility

1332527

no it can t be a real-life problem even md5 is enough to generate unique hash for real-life files

1332533
mouse	keyboard
allows sharing keyboard and mouse

1332534
width	height
keep in mind that block-level elements which are not re-sized in some way using height width or float or margins will always take up the width of the window even if the content of the element does not

1332537
width	height
in the case of those plugins they make it cover the entire page but in your situation just position it at the same position as the panel giving it the same width and height

1332543
mergesort	heapsort
sort the array o n log n at worst - mergesort heapsort binary tree sort etc

1332549
int	boolean
for example if you knew the list was large and only contained int from 1..n where n is fairly small you could use a pair of boolean arrays or a bitmap and do something like this

1332551
keydown	keyup
i don t know of any specific problems with this approach but i opted against it simply because i wasn t comfortable simulating input without looking at how the clr handles the actual input and without at least raising the complete lifetime previewkeydown keydown previewkeyup keyup i was wary of unintended consequences

1332571
keydown	keyup
if the data is not one of your special barcodes then inject them as keydown keyup windows messages so that it will seem to work in the same fashion as in keyboard emulation mode

1332583
imagemagick	mogrify
for each subdirectory my script scans the text file then calls a few external programs one detects blank images custom exe then a call to mogrify part of imagemagick which resizes and converts the images and finally a call to 7-zip which pacakges all of the converted images and text file into a single archive

1332602
serializable	deserialization
but there will be problems with loading as registration will be dynamic not static as i understood you must register classes prior to serializable deserialization

1332626
folder	directory
however because i use joomla where every folder has a index.html file to prevent directory listing there are thousands of those files

1332638
width	height

post	get
just initalize your form with post or get data as you would in any other form processing view and pass your form instance in the context

1332954
postgresql	mysql
other than those there s lots of db specific stuff count is relatively slow on postgresql subselects are dog slow on mysql etc

1332989
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
design for inherited or prohibit it inherited introduces a whole extra layer of complexity as you need to work out the interactions between superclass and subclassing

1333049
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
also if clspatients is self-refreshing make sure it implements inotifypropertychanged or inotifycollectionchanged as appropriate in order for the binding targets to update when the data changes

1333065
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
an alternative approach would be to use a testing library such as powermockito it currently works with easymock and mockito to clear the static fields in testb s initialisation this avoids the need for any jvm forking and ensures your tests are portable

1333065
easymock	powermockito
powermockito is a framework that extend other mock libraries such as easymock with more powerful capabilities

1333065
easymock	powermockito
developers familiar with easymock will find powermockito easy to use since the entire expectation api is the same both for static methods and constructors

1333065
easymock	powermockito
powermockito extends the easymock api with a small number of methods and annotations to enable the extra features

1333228
rss	feed
i would like to edit the rss feed so it shows the image and the description rather than the complete post

1333245
int	double
the best way around is to not use the built in double - use int only if possible with power of 10 coefficients sum everything up and display the final useful figure after rounding

1333264
integer	fractions
you cannot expect to be able to store any random fractions with perfect results just as you can t expect to store any random integer

how would you calculate the md5 hash under these circumstances

1333573
post	get
my problem is that i can t work out how to distinguish a get from a post other than by checking the number of keys in bindingcontext.valueprovider.keys and this seems so wrong i m sure i m misunderstanding something

1333731

1334252
firefox	safari
this doesn t work in ie6 which may be an issue but it ll work in ie7+ and firefox safari etc

1334336
filtering	grouping
here s one approach you first create the query with all the correct inner joins then you create the outer grouping using a distinct filtering then create the xml from the grouping using a where clause to join them

1334379
onkeyup	onkeydown
implement it on the onkeydown or onkeyup attribute of the textbox

you can add information about countries and states to your cities list and then grouping by them and avoiding the second join and filtering

1334620
width	height
as i understand you have an xml file with a lot of different elements and want to add the width and height to all the elements without touching the rest of the xml

1334620
width	height
it copies all elements and attributes as-is unless i made a mistake but treats elements specially by also adding the width and height as looked-up in the figure.xml file

1334660
width	height
how would i transfer an unknown group of properties and their values for example width and height from something like type.video into settings

1334689

it s a php tool which you install on your own server which allows you to combine group rss feed

1334689
rss	feed
a group of rss feed has its own rss feed in gregarius

1334689
rss	feed
you don t need to look at the frontend you can just use gregarius as backend and use the group rss feed to visualize your project

1334802
ant	maven
i do not want to use ant or maven

1334831
folder	directory
the client remembers which directory you do not want to update and does neither fetch the updates nor create a checkout for this folder

1334852
serializable	deserialization
i understand that using interface builder actually creates instances of view window button etc objects that are serializable and have to be deserialized when you load the application but is the deserialization that expensive

1334857
gauge	progress
this would give the user a relaxing sense that things are happening and if the directories are all ordered alphabetically they can even gauge for themselves the overall progress of the operation

1334873
multicastdelegate	delegation
all events are delegation types they all inherit from eventhandler that inherits from multicastdelegate which interits from delegation

1334929
free	malloc
not sure what exactly malloc does here but every call to malloc or free can have far-reaching consequences to all dynamic memory of the virtual address space of a process

1334929
free	malloc
somehow malloc or some system call malloc uses zeros the already free memory where the pointer itself is located not the data it points to the pointer itself is in dynamic memory

1334933
versioning	upgrade
how do i automatically upgrade silverlight 3 applications and start the new upgrade versioning without user interaction

1334933

i recently learned that a having clause can filtering the results of an aggregate query by targeting the results of a grouping by

1335071
cvs	svn
with cvs svn and other version control systems you can do an export

1335107
spaces	delimiter
you should set for spaces not to be considered delimiter more info here

1335107
spaces	delimiter
if you don t have inverted commas and spaces in the text you can use alexander s trick and wrap the text between delimiter in inverted command so that hello hello bye bye turns to hello hello bye bye

1335107
versioning	upgrade
maybe it s time to upgrade to a newer versioning of delphi

1335126

i see boost offers a bind function of its own that looks like something that would be of use here but what is the stl solution

1335151
onfocus	onblur
there is an onblur but no onfocus as far as i can tell

1335173
free	malloc
in that case malloc could be modifying the memory thinking that it is free

1335186

add a css class to the image that hides it and put something random or the current date in the query string so that it doesn t get cached just to be on the safe side

1335211
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
use autoresetevent or manualresetevent

1335239
free	malloc
you only need to call free on values which are explicitly created via malloc

1335242
free	malloc
if you use malloc the space is allocated on the heap which must be explicitly free

1335245
free	malloc
if you don t malloc it then you can t free it as far as i remember

1335246
free	malloc
good rule of thumb if you malloc you must free

1335247
free	malloc
note that you only free what you malloc

1335249
free	malloc
compare this to memory allocated on the heap via malloc which you must explicitly free

1335285
range	max	range	min	min	max
however a cheap hack that might serve your purpose is to select out the min max of overly_specific_date in your original query to show the offending date range which is turning up

1335315
post	get
i feel that the same code which determines whether a user can get or post to the edit action should also be responsible for determining whether to render the edit link on the index or details views

1335325
packets	pcap
or pcap is an option for the raw packets data

1335345

freebsd	solaris
similar mechanisms freebsd has kqueue and solaris has dev poll

1335447
getter	setter
with regards to the generated classes if you went the class generation route i m betting every field has a getter setter whether fields should be read only or not did somebody say thread safety and mutability and that you can t add behavior because it gets overridden if you regenerate the classes

1335490
gif	png
this will now replace the first part of the path for jpg png and gif and keep the filename

1335492
nsmutablestring	nsstring
problem ehre assuming you initing your array properly could be that foobar assings an nsstring not an nsmutablestring so its failing because if distinct types you should do

1335511
post	get
if the business rule changed so that anyone who had rsvp d could edit the dinner you d have to change both get and post methods and the view and the get and post methods and view for the delete operation too although that s technically a seperate business rule

1335867
groupbox	panel
as a test i made a groupbox and placed it on top of inside a panel

1335867
groupbox	panel
i changed the background color of the panel to red and the background color of the groupbox to transparent and those ares of the groupbox are properly transparent

1335876
pop-up	dialog
if the error requires some sort of output logging pop-up a dialog write message to stdout i let it pass down to some centralized point at which point it is caught and distributed to the appropriate output mechanisms

1335916
inherited	subclassing
but the second - and maybe more important - is that inherited requires you to understand the workings of not only the parent class but all of the ancestor classes which makes extension harder but also more brittle because a change in the parent class implementation could easily break the subclassing

1335920
client-side	server-side
you need to mark the property secure for it to pass from the client-side installuisequence to server-side installexecutesequence

1335972
pascal	delphi
the first use of properties was as far as i know in delphi object pascal 1994

1336003
cvs	rcs
i m not certain of the exact reason but one possible influence may have been the versioning imposed by code repository systems such as rcs cvs - which of course find the numbers much easier to manipulate than strings

1336041
postgresql	mysql
i ve been working with postgresql firebird oracle mysql mssql more than 6 years ago and my preferred are firebird and postgresql

1336130
width	height
therefore a more feasible approach would be to load the wiki page into an iframe and then using javascript code to modify the properties of the controls you want to hide by either setting their visibility to hidden or their width height to 0

1336151
merb	ruby-on-rails
my solution was to run the cucumber script directly without rake but this can require a some configuration in ruby-on-rails with merb it works out f the box

1336177
for-loop	loops
since we re changing data within the loops the current implementation needs a for-loop to prevent the exception

1336184
cobertura	emma	emma	jdepend
there are plugins for many of the major reporting tools such as cobertura emma junit jdepend etc

1336271
distance	altitude
the mean square distance between the altitude of the surface at the sample point and the actual measured altitude at that point

1336278
cpython	ironpython
this would probably be easier to implement in c++ c# or ironpython than in c or cpython directly since they provide very easy high-level synchronization tools for handling the threading issues especially when using .net

1336320
ilist	iqueryable
the only issue is that now my service isn t returning ilist but instead iqueryable

1336335

using converters which are dead-simple to write you can bind boolean to visibility settings strings to images int to background colors and so on

1336460
draggable	droppable
i m using jquery s sortable not draggable or droppable and i was wondering how i could highlight the potential drop areas using css that a user has when the user has begun sorting

1336481
width	height
validate the minimum width and height of those images in flex or if they have to

1336507
valgrind	gprof
you should use a tool like qprof valgrind or gprof to profile your code and see where the most execution time is being spent

1336509
stdout	fflush
after all printf calls use fflush stdout

1336513
public	protected
so if you have any protected public variable declared inside partial code behind class and you populate that variable with some value in page_load and if you wants to print on .aspx page using variablename it should print the value which is assigned in page_load on web page

1336534
width	height
assuming you re talking about client-side validation you could always load the image to an object in flex and test the width and height of the loaded image object manually

1336534
client-side	server-side
however this should be done in addition to server-side checking if this limit is important as client-side checks can be circumvented by crafty users

1336546
versioning	upgrade
.net framework 1.0 service pack 3 √¢ message box √¢ net framework 1.0 sp 3 √¢ the upgrade patch cannot be installed by windows installer service because the program to be upgrade may be missing or the upgrade may update a different versioning of the program

vmware	virtualbox
the vpc images are intended for use in virtual pc and can also be made to work in virtualbox or vmware workstation since each of those can import vpc images

1336845
qtreeview	qabstractitemview
i ve a simple question regarding the update of a qtreeview or any subclass of qabstractitemview when a model object changes externally

1336845
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
but since this signal as all qabstractitemmodel functions signals slots work with a qmodelindex which is not persistent as the documentation clearly says am i supposed to store somehow a mapping of my data to qpersistentmodelindex es so when my data change i will be able to find the corresponding qpersistenmodelindex and use that as argument to the various qabstractitemmodel functions

1336879
opera	firefox
note this only happens in firefox and opera

1336880
many-to-many	one-to-many
at the moment datamapper can use strategic eager loading sel for one-to-many relationships but not many-to-many where n+1 queries occur

1336884
hash	md5
assuming that a collision between two md5 hash is p 2 -128 this gives an expected number of 2 -59 for the number of collisions

1336884
hash	md5
hence even the probability that the md5 hash collides for two inputs is already very small

1336905
portrait	landscape
anticipating that the android os will be appearing on netbooks with default landscape 16 9 screen format what is the best way to handle images that are in a portrait mode format

1336905
portrait	landscape
in other words since you can t rotate the screen on these netbooks if you display a portrait mode image on landscape mode screen there will be large blank rectangles on either side of the image

1337030
min	max
anywhere the arc intersects an axis will be a max or a min

1337030
min	max
find the max and min of those coordinates to draw the rectangle

1337085
portrait	landscape
in terms of image resources within the application such as is the case with background images it is a common practice to have different image set for landscape and portrait mode or even different screen sizes

1337085
portrait	landscape
it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitable

1337124
accessor	properties
a properties access is an implicit accessor message so this both retains the array or copies it once you correct the properties as i suggested above and posts kvo notifications

1337125
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller visible at the same time

1337142

1337283
width	height
the size is 225 52 width height

1337291
vb.net	vb6
the other way round vb.net to c# could be harder because people might be used to making use of the my namespace and other things put in there to make vb6 developers feel at home

1337293
rpm	yum
there s a red hat rpm package for tomcat 6 - just yum install tomcat6 and it will put everything in the right place for you and fix up the security by running tomcat as a dedicated user not to mention taking care of updates and patches by putting tomcat into the rpm repository

1337315

have you thought about redirecting stdout and stderr to a file ex

1337317
ifs	dash
the maintainers of dash maintain that ifs is not supposed to interpret escape sequences see for instance here

1337328
width	height
i want to create a textblock or some other element with text in it for display only that is vertical -90 transform angle but i want that element to fill up the vertical space it is contained in but have a defined horizontal amount i m using vertical and horizontal terms instead of height and width since it s swapped when i have the textblock go vertical and have it aligned to the left side of the container

1337343
width	height
to height 80 width 90

1337343
width	height
note the only attributes i m trying to change for this particular script are height width and border because our client utilizes a tool that automatically applies styles to elements that they drag around with a wysiwyg-style editor

1337343
width	height
obviously using a regex to strip these out of a lot of places works fairly well as you just let the table cells be sized by their content which looks okay but i figured a quicker way to deal with the issue would just be to replace those three attributes with width height and border attributes which behave mostly the same as their css counterparts excepting that css allows you to actually customize the width color and style of the border but all they ever use is solid 1px so i can add a condition to replace solid 1px with border 1

1337343
width	height
this one only replaces width and height the border attribute we re scrapping for now

1337354
interpreted-language	compiled-language
c# is not an interpreted-language it s a jitted just-in-time compiled-language which means it s compiled from msil at runtime

1337510
width	height
meta name viewport content width device-width height device-height

1337510
width	height
width and height these specify the width and height that the viewport should be set at for this web page

1337510
width	height
the values can be set in pixels or you can use the device-width and device-height values respectively to specify that the width and height should be set as the full width and height of the device√¢ s screen

1337510
width	height
the default value of height is calculated from the width of the device and its aspect ratio and it can be set from 223 to 10 000 pixels

1337510
width	height
it is recommended that width and height values are not hardcoded for a single device such as the iphone

1337566
post	get
also always try to post links to your site on other websites to gain visibility and get importance for crawlers

1337622

altering the encoding via the -d switch is going to affect all your default encoding mechanisms including redirected stdout stdin stderr

1337643
min	max
for min and max you can order by and fetch the first row

1337664
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i think you want a concrete item superclass since it will likely have common fields ie title copyright_date publisher etc and subclassing for each subtype and further sub-sub-classes if you like ie from toy to actionfigure with number_of_joints field using multi-table inherited

1337665

inherited	subclassing
joined table inherited enables you to have foreign keys to subclassing enforced by the database it s a lot simpler to have non-null constraints for subclassing fields

1337882

floating-point	fractions
then the comparison compares the 80-bit sum to a 64-bit sum and they re different primarily because the fractions part 0.3 cannot be represented exactly using a binary floating-point number so you are comparing a repeating decimal actually repeating binary that has been truncated to two different lengths

i believe you re only allowed to submit just one at a time - this might be a bad practice but how about basically duplicating each forms code and replicating it in an iframe submission the form there either that or relying on xhr .post to mimic what the forms would do

every depth level has its own cd entity with parent children isleaf properties

1340014
profiler	hprof
--openfile open file specified by file can be application snapshot netbeans profiler snapshot or hprof heap dump

valgrind	gprof
gprof would be the obvious choice if you are using gcc and i suppose valgrind should work too

1340069
button	checkbox
i have a listview bound to a datasource each row has a checkbox control on it what i want to acheive is when i press a button i want to check through all of the checkbox in the listview and check if any of them have been ticked

what i tried first was to add a onclick event to a button and loop around the listview.items and check the checked state of the checkbox control however this always returned false even if they have ticked the item

1340072
sorting	grouping
you have one sorting pass o n lg n and then a second pass where o lg n comparisons are performed for each grouping so this is done at most n times also yielding o n lg n

1340088
profiler	yourkit
alternatively any java profiler should work yourkit as you ve already mentioned

1340088
profiler	visualvm
visualvm has been bundled with the jdk since 1.6.0_10 and it is based on the netbeans profiler

1340207
nunit	mstest
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest

also when i say does microsoft use this more specifically for exmaple in the atl and wtl libraries do anyone of yourselves have preference or have some advice regarding this

1340269
client-side	server-side
you probably heard that client-side validation can be circumvented so there is still a need for server-side checking

a sure shot workaround is to navigate to the jre installation directory c program files java navigate to the bin folder from command prompt and then run java -version

1340372

also bear in mind that many programs exist in the c program files x86 folder on 64bit versions of windows

1340491
gridview	onclientclick
i put a button outside of the gridview with an onclientclick event

1340553

the problem with this approach is that you either have to pick a titlebar width and stick with it and not respond to global theme adjustments that change the titlebar height or you have to take many different bmp snapshots at different sizes

1340585
mousemove	keydown
if that s okay with you then you should attach listeners for events like mousemove keydown mousescroll

1340598
hash	hmac
one method you could look into is one which many including some amazon web services and the likes of ebay i think which is hmac hash message authentication code

1340656

the nfa dfa part comes into play in the implementation of the accept method

1340671
integer	fractions
distinguish the integer and fractions

1340694

go to the bin debug directory folder and right click on the directory

1340796

1340806
unsigned	short
unsigned short

1340853
superclass	subclassing
when you do that kind of refactoring you don t lose any coverage on the account of having only one of your subclassing tested for its superclass behavior

1340853
superclass	subclassing
therefore i m of the opinion that it s generally ok to test just one of your subclassing in order to test a superclass behavior

1340923
public	protected
i searched on the forum internet for the solution how a propetryinfo object of a public property can reveal if it has a private protected setter .

1340934

if you have freedom to switch from apache to lighttpd then the most straightforward solution would be to use mod_secdownload which would do exactly what you want that is provide application authentication while serving the actual files via web server

1341041
jdom	xerces
there s nothing wrong with the jdom api but i don t like having to include xerces with my deployments

1341065
post	get
a post to your save action and the rendering of the resulting view isn t fundamentally different than a get to your recent comments page - and if querying from a database is okay on the comments page then it should be okay on the save in my opinion

1341079
put	get
i have inherited a web application and when trying when trying to put it on the same server on a different ip and iis site i get a page full of stuff like this in all browsers

set	bag
final note you might need more permission to set the property bag value to spweb

i m inclined to go with what s easiest until you identify that performance is an issue in which case i would set a flag on the list s rootfolder s property bag

1341262
accessor	properties
once you have the propertyinfo for the properties you can call its getsetmethod function to return the methodinfo for the set accessor

1341262

does anyone know how to get tcpdf to output a .gif file with a specific number of inches width x height

1341343
gridview	objectdatasource
you can use objectdatasource - to wrap call selectforgrid also you can direct bind list to your gridview

1341345
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
but if i hit .read again i start at 6 and not where the bufferedreader stopped so if 3 is a line break and i told the bufferedreader to print the first line it prints 1-2 and then using .read from the fileinputstream gives me 6 and not 3.

1341403
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
if your users use only opera 9.5+ safari 3+ internet explorer 9+ and firefox 3.6+ then the answer is yes

1341425
affinity	processors
you can query the processors affinity with getprocessaffinitymask

1341425
affinity	processors
if you haven t set processors affinity i m unsure how useful the result will be though as the thread can flit between processors

1341426
super	implements
there s also a myriad of ways you could either call this via ajax or web-service from the parent blog or implements a memcache solution so that this data can be centrally stored and managed if this becomes an issue but i think if you use the object cache here with something like wp super cache on the front end you should be fine

1341462
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko

1341465
rss	feed
that runs in the loop for every item in the rss feed

1341470

as others have said you can use getprocessaffinitymask or getthreadidealprocessor but those will only work if you ve already set an affinity mask or ideal processors for the thread

1341478
firefox	safari
ie firefox safari etc.

1341494

1341540
getter	setter
and instead of your implementation of the setter and getter let the system synthesize them for you

1341801
super	self
matt gallagher what does it mean when you assign super init to self

1341801
super	self
cocoa-dev self super init debate

1341801
super	self
if you didn t assign the return value of super s initializer into self then you could potentially be dealing with a partially initialized object because the object that super initialized isn t the same object that you re initializing

1341822
put	get
- get pyparsing.py from here and put it in your app engine app s directory

1341825

try mysql or postgresql instead

1342011

due to some complicated reason with paging sorting and multilevel grouping behavior i cannot achieve appropriate paging behavior with this query

pop-up	dialog
when the checkin modal dialog pop-up even though it shows your entire list of pending changes by default only items that are currently in the solution will be checked

1342112
mouseleave	mouseenter
the others blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit are all events which don t bubble therefore they can t be used with live

1342130
for-loop	loops
i need to make a for-loop and between every loops wait 2 seconds and continue

1342142
post	put	post	get	put	get
by rest style that means using http get put delete post instead of sql dml and for returning results it uses json and atom pub an xml format kind-of similar to rss instead of a binary result structure and protocol like microsoft sql servers tds the protocol used for sending tables back to clients

1342152

1342249
jsf	seam
if you liked jsf and want to use it i would recommend the use of seam

1342249
jsf	seam
you can also use spring but i think that using seam makes the use of jsf much easier

1342268
hash	md5
the way i have always done it is to concat the user agent and ip address into an md5 hash in some cases this will allow people from the same ip to vote long as they are using different browsers and store that as a fingerprint for the vote the the database and add a unique key to it

1342315
width	height
you could then have them scale a slider or something similar to meet the width or height of that object

1342315
width	height
by holding a credit card something with a relatively known height and width up to the screen you can easily determine the ratio of pixels to inches and use that to your hearts content

1342337
config	ini
if you re talking about jparameter which is the default class for handling config presented in the ini or xml files you ll find the api docs helpful

1342361

i want to change the toggle function so that it changes the text of the link to say show hide or expand collapse

1342546
hide	show
it would do a replacement of the show string by hide and show the div

prepare	execute
abstract out the database prepare execute etc

1342658
google-chrome	firefox
the div has an onclick call to a javascript function that changes the color of the div inside the label and also checks the checkbox for some reason ie and firefox didn t want to check it correctly google-chrome worked fine

1342658
google-chrome	firefox
ok so using this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie 7 haven t tested other versions yet it will only check the checkbox if you click the image inside the div

1342663
width	height
i receive error messages when attempting to encode files in expression encoder when the file width or height is not a multiple of four or is smaller than 64

migrate	upgrade
we have last generation of the stack currently and i assume they will put in the current generation when they upgrade and migrate the servers for php mysql and apache

1342750
lan	intranet
ok if the user was on the same lan say in a company intranet for example this could be determined by having the ip address and using command line tools like arp

1342756
free	malloc
when you do malloc since malloc guarantees that it returns a continuos block of memory the crt will try to find 1 gb of continuos free memory which may not be avaiable hence the malloc fails

1342871
opera	firefox	pop-up	dialog
when i attempt to navigate to the service in firefox or opera the basic authentication dialog pop-up and i enter credentials

the only methods you ll need from the system.drawing.graphics object are drawrectangle fillrectangle measurestring and drawstring

1342892
width	height
1 garbage poller looks for background containers that are 2 times the stage width or height away from the player s x or y coord respectively

1342899
division	subtraction
since threshold 25.0 note the decimal point it s a float so the subtraction and division will all work as long as you re not using uints

1342900
width	height
i have .las lidar data file now i wanted to know the size of it for example how long it s width and height in kilometers

1342903
put	get
maybe i m not seeing everything here but why not just get rid of the serverfiles table and put uniqueuploads on the files table

1342945
implements	extends
it woudln t have been my first choice to implements it this way but given what s there i want to extends it to cover .js too instead of including another different redirection rewrite method iis redirection configuration a rewrite module etc. which may complicate deployments and testing of the app especially on iis6

1343027
mouse	keyboard
some other sql tools have shorcuts that run the query that is under the cursor which keeps the hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse

1343046
for-loop	loops
i m reading about stl algorithms and the book pointed out that algorithms like find use a while loops rather than a for-loop because it is minimal efficient and uses one less variable

1343046
for-loop	loops
the while loops consistently reports taking around .78 seconds and the for-loop reports .67 seconds

1343060
filtering	grouping
how can we filtering or restrict an exposed interface or method by client based on its user grouping maintain in ad

1343100
vim	emacs
if there is a shortcut to recover this file in emacs i will switch to emacs from vim

1343110
inline	inlining
as a rule of thumb if inlining this method improves performance the jit will inline this method

1343211
put	get
in short they get both put on the stack at the same time you execute your main

1343229
folder	directory
set your iis application to windows authentication right click the app folder in iis select properties directory security tab

1343270

1343311
button	marquee
while this is running i will have a marquee progress bar and would like to disable all button

1343321
accessor	properties
note that unless you add a properties for your tableview you won t call self because there is no accessor

1343328
stdout	stderr
2 you will probably need to call getstdhandle to get stdout stderr

1343346
width	height
given a square described by x y width height and an angle in radians i need to calculate a vector that originates at the squares centre and terminates at the point that collides with the edge of the square at the given angle

1343392
width	height
given the square s width and height you can then determine the center of the square x+.5w y+.5h

1343409
width	height
i also want to set the height and width of the button but i imagine the method for doing this will be the same as for setting the caption

1343428
width	height
it even does not crash if width or height are zeros

1343462
redmine	trac
think sharepoint redmine trac basecamp etc

1343471
stdout	stderr
i have a bash script that simply calls different calls and redirect stdout and stderr outputs to different files

1343471
stdout	stderr
i thought i should see no output on screen because i m redirecting both stdout and stderr to files

1343488
internationalization	translation
this is actually pretty advanced internationalization testing not for the faint of heart including date formatting percent calculations upper lowercase translation etc

1343498
codeigniter	cakephp
if you need something truly unique then you should use a real framework like cakephp or codeigniter etc

1343500
put	get
to get started i thought i d make sure that i could just take my models from the old project and put them in a new project then query them in the console

1343508
getc	gets
give this a shot using getc instead of gets

1343531
cos	sin
however cos angle or sin angle could be zero so you should cross multiply that out to get

1343553
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in ie firefox and google-chrome 2.0.172.43 but not safari nor opera

button	checkbox
some browsers won t let you change much or in some cases anything about how things like checkbox or radio button are rendered and in any case are inconsistent across browsers

1343569
width	height
i assume the rectangle s width and height are

1343569
width	height
for the trapezoid i assume it has height h1 and that it s lower width is w0 while it s upper width is w1

1343596
public	protected
but that can be anything - a field a property and of any visibility private protected public

1343635

1344053
subtract	add
to insert an item take the target and add subtract 1

1344072
client-side	server-side
ajax can t specifically check for file existence server-side because javascript is a client-side technology but you could write your ajax success and failure callbacks so that they behave correctly if it gets a 404 for the file you re requesting

1344117
yslow	pagespeed
install firebug and pagespeed or yslow and you ll have plenty of information about what you re doing right and what you could be doing better

1344342
width	height
how do i reference the screen height and width in vb.net

1344349
free	malloc
your free malloc 400 is possible because free and malloc are inverses

what s wrong with shark profiler which is built-into xcode

1344432
ienumerable	iqueryable
i only tested it with ienumerable so i don t know for sure that it ll work properly with iqueryable

1344446
for-loop	loops
how could i write a for-loop to go from 1 to 10 and then use loops var as part of the line that updates the image

1344460
udp	tcp
but to match them to specific process ids you would have to manually enumerate the system s open handles looking for tcp udp handles and then query the process information from them

1344471
int	chars
this works really well and keys your key sizes small assuming your codes are simple int or small chars compared to the larger description fields

1344516
post	get
the site2 view functions however use urllib2 to make http get and post requests to site1

1344561
folder	directory
directory to the addins folder for

1344581
profiler	aqtime
aqtime ants profiler are good options but they are not free

1344596
children	parent
so for each row in the parent table it can have zero to many children

1344596
children	parent
i have an index view of the children table inner join d to the parent table note i m only indexing some of the fields from either table .

1344672
mouse	keyboard
so if you want to write a program that runs without an os your program will have to replicate at least some features of an os taking over from the bios during the boot process initializing devices communicating with the disk controller to load code and data communicating with the display controller to show information to the user communicating with the keyboard controller and the mouse controller to read user input etc etc etc

1344688
hash	salt
still it s preferably to hash your passwords with salt

1344691
prepare	execute
i would guess that the command pragma table_info probably can t be execute directly as a prepare statement

1344762
hex	binary
use hexdump or a hex editor to view a binary in hexadecimal bytes

1344772
uicontrol	uibutton
this method is on uicontrol which uibutton inherits from which is why you might have overlooked it at first glance.

1344812
mouse	keyboard
an operating system includes all sorts of functions for doing this -- disk i o screen output keyboard and mouse input networking etc. so forth and so on

1344870
free	malloc
if it happens to fall to zero -- which it might not for a variety of reasons -- then the objective-c runtime will invoke the method -dealloc which will then invoke -release on all of the object type instance variables and free on malloc d memory if any

1344912
memcpy	malloc
some many provide full blow c c++ libraries so that you can call functions like memcpy and sometimes even malloc and printf

1344944
int	chars
parlanse is a compiled c-like language with traditional scalar data types chars int float dynamic data types string and array compound data types structure and union and lexically-scoped functions

1344945
mouse	keyboard
it is assigned to the logon session of the interactive user and contains the keyboard mouse and display device

1344962
folder	directory
a lot of publicly downloaded php software usually have the config file with db passwords in a directory under the www root folder and as long as your server is configured correctly it should be ok

1345027
put	get
talk to whomever administers your system to get them to fix site-start the library name is stored in the variable site-run-file to not load that stuff but instead to put that kind of stuff in default which is loaded after the user s .emacs

1345081
stateless	stateful
can this stateless ejb can access the db utility which will open connection stateful

1345139
getter	setter
make this class globally accessible provide necessary setter getter for token-manipulation

1345200
nsurlcache	uiwebview
others on the apple forums report experiences with rude engineers when asking about uiwebview and nsurlcache where in bug reports the engineers say it should work but actual developers say it doesn t

1345200
nsurlcache	uiwebview
further proof that nsurlcache can work is found in icab blog url filtering for uiwebview on the iphone aug 18 2009

1345210
gif	png
i am creating a webpage and i am trying to put a png buttons over gif files

1345210
gif	png
when the page renders it makes the png file appear after or under the gif file

1345220
gif	png
use the background-image css attribute on a block-level element etc. for the background gif then place the png buttons inside that block element

1345234
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the mutable types are classes which can be changed after they ve been initialized like nsmutablestring vs nsstring

1345236
gif	png
first set the gif image as a background to the cell and place the png button in the cell and position it inside the cell

1345278
folder	directory
all ideas i ve seen to perform such a check involve iterating over the entire directory and counting every folder

1345278
folder	directory
considering my concern is with very large directory is there a better way to retrieve the number of files folder it contains

1345290
post	get
i posted this question on another site but didn t get an answer i ll post it here

1345312
min	max
you could use the max and min functions

1345324
min	max	minimum	max
you can use the max min functions as they will return an array containing the maximum minimum of each index

1345326
min	max
get the first element assing the count to both min and max

1345326
min	max
iterate over the rest compare count to each min and max if smaller larger assign the new count value

1345340
concave	convex
what you need to do is to define an indexing vocabulary for each face of a jigsaw puzzle such that the index of a right-facing edge can can tell you what the index of a corresponding left-facing edge is e.g a simple vocabulary convex and concave with convex on a face implying concave on a matching opposite face and then classify each piece according to the indexing vocabulary

1345340
concave	convex
for instance you may have flat edge straight-edge-leans-left straight-edge-leans-right concave convex knob knob-hole ...

1345400
post	get
counter-intuitively on any post dx8 hardware ie any dx9 or 10 hardware you ll find that the use of this post transform cache and extra simplicity of triangle lists means that you ll actrually get better performance from a triangle list than a triangle strip

1345473
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
in firefox 3.5 ie 8 opera 9.64 safari when we click on the scrollbar the input field will not loose focus

1345528
min	max
in contrast to what others have posted you cannot use the min max functions for this problem as these functions do not understand the datastructure array which are passed in

1345528
min	max
the reason why the use of min and max seem to yield the correct answer is related to type-casting arrays to integers which is an undefined behaviour

1345528
min	max
actually min and max do work with arrays but not in the way the op needs them to work

1345528
min	max
when using min and max with multiple arrays or an array of arrays elements are compared element by element from left to right

1345528
min	max
translated into the op s problem this shows the reason why the direct use of min and max seems to yield the correct result

1345528
min	max
the arrays first elements are the id -values therefore min and max will compare them first incidentally resulting in the correct result because the lowest id is the one with the lowest count and the highest id is the one with the highest count

1345630
maven	pom.xml
the second pom.xml will retrieve any packages required from the maven repository and invoke adt to compile them

1345652
hide	show
if i manually use show hide in conjunction with visible expression it ll work just fine

1345652
hide	show
i m assuming that the slidetoggle doesn t do a show hide - is there something else i can check

1345652
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried in firefox 3.5 ie 7 8 and google-chrome 4...all with the same results

1345691
ssl	https
both the credentials and the data in this session is transmitted via https ssl

1345753
getter	setter
i have seen member variables given a private modifier and then using getter setter methods just to set and get the values of the variable in the name of standardization

1345753
getter	setter
why not then make the variable public itself other than cases like spring framework which depends on getter setter for ioc etc

1345753
getter	setter
in c# i have seen getter setter with capitalization of the member variable

1345760
getter	setter
getter and setter are used to provide a defined interface to a classes

1345763
getter	setter
these are really just getter setter under the hood but with a more concise syntax

1345766
getter	setter
even back in 2003 it was known that getter and setter methods are evil

1345771
getter	setter
this is done so you can change the getter or setter implementation in your public api after you release it

1345772
tiff	bmp
this really depends on the extension - a bmp is totally different to a tiff or whatsoever.

1345789
getter	setter
it s part of encapsulation abstracting a class s interface the getter and setter from its implementation using an instance variable

1345793
post	get
i ve read here that loading a bitmap loses the alpha value but it post to a solution which is for another file type and i don t understand enough of the example to get it working with the png

1345805
listview	gridview
i have a gridview in a listview contained in a scrollviewer element

1345842
pull	push
an alternative is to switch to using the stax parser see pull vs push

1345859
addclass	removeclass
also the addclass removeclass stuff in the tabs.js file doesn t scale too well

1345861
getter	setter
the most and foremost use for getter and setter in java is to annoy the developers

1345861
getter	setter
the define if you ll have a getter or setter generated for you

1345861
getter	setter
so the only solution was to force people to write all the getter and setter manually

1345865
getter	setter
getter and setter may very well be the greatest lie ever told

1345865
getter	setter
new programmers should be taught proper encapsulation not to write dumb data carrier classes that contain nothing but getter and setter

1345865
getter	setter
the idea that you need getter and setter to future-proof your code if you want to change the implementation later on is an obvious case of yagni

1345869
int	chars
as you say you re capable i m sure you ve seen the tables you need are the eav_ tables for you chars and int etc etc

1345876
getter	setter
when the developer believes that encapsulating stuff really just means getter setter rather than encapsulating behavour

1345876
getter	setter
the valid reasons for having getter setter are

1345876
getter	setter
by using a getter setter rather than direct access to the variable means that you can do some pre-processing on said variable first such as validate it is with a set range or change the underlying implementation switching from an int to a biginteger without changing the public api

1345879
getter	setter
hence to access a field through an interface you need to have the getter and setter

1345892
post	get
after having done some more looking around and have chatted a bit in irc it seems that what i should do to keep the get parameter away from users containing payment info is to send them as post instead

1345932
jdom	dom4j
i find dom4j to come out on top of anything else i ve used especially jdom which i find to have a particularly poor api

1345967
min	max
if so using min or max together with group by is the simplest and most efficient solution

1345974
getter	setter
in the case in question there is no need for getter and setter if the value is simply read or written

1345985
libjpeg	libpng
luckily for most formats you can find libraries that do it for you like libpng or libjpeg

1346123
interbase	firebird
the application used to connect to an interbase 6.x database using dbexpress but the new version needs to connect to a firebird 2.x superserver

1346139
for-loop	loops
if you need to iterate the table then you can either use a for-loop or a foreach loops like

1346161
keydown	keyup
to capture function keys reliably across all modern browsers you ll have to look at using keydown and keyup events

1346188
pull	push
there are two kinds of streaming api - push and pull

1346188
jdom	xom
there are several more convenient dom-like apis such as xom my favourite for the same reasons that adam batkin gives above or jdom

1346196
pull	push
plus you will need your own ssh and httpd for your user to push pull to from that server

1346196
pull	push
git itself didn t include smart http which meant the only protocol with authentication for pull clone and push operations was ssh convincing users to generate and manage public private keys is.

1346196
gitolite	gitosis
authorization layers was clunky gitosis and gitolite was barely starting

1346198
mouse	keyboard
after uninstalling resharper 4.5 from vs2008 the normal code editor context-menu mouse right click doesn t work the way to let it work just one time is to let it appear by click the keyboard key near the altgr key and the clicking again the mouse right button

1346296
keydown	keyup
unfortunately depending on how the browser interprets the function keys it may require preventing keydown and keyup events being raised for that particular key in addition to the behaviour here

1346364
min	max
and of course set min and max of scrollbar to 0 image.width .height

1346394
direct3d	directx
i m absolutely new to directx and i d like to draw some untransformed primitives with the most basic direct3d configuration for learning purposes

1346436
put	get
however if we put a custom constraint in to stop this happening using regular expressions we get a 200 and an empty response rather than the expected 404

1346466
kerberos	ntlm
if your other web application uses windows integrated authentication ntlm or kerberos authentication or even basic authentication then it can act the same way

1346517
for-loop	loops	put	get
so what i ve just decided to do is put it in a for-loop and once there are the right amount of files that have been downloaded onto my hard drive then i ll get myself out of loops

1346518
min	max
in my experience swing components respond better to preferred size than min and max size

1346549
equals	compareto
in the .net framework version 2.0 this method uses the equals and compareto methods of the array to determine whether the object specified by the value parameter exists

1346549
equals	compareto
in the earlier versions of the .net framework this determination was made by using the equals and compareto methods of the value object itself

1346568
implements	extends
for example there is a possibility that author of the parent class that i m extends will decide to implements some side-effect in the method that i m overriding and without that side-effect the state of the object will be incorrect

1346578
disk	ram
i would like to monitor cpu disk ram network.

1346578
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
it would be great to have a library to monitor not only linux but even freebsd windows solaris and mac

1346604
int	chars
in short order i came across the integral types table which listed sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong and chars

1346616
google-chrome	firefox
- so you can target firefox v2 firefox2 firefox v3 firefox3 google-chrome google-chrome etc

1346621
yacc	bison
if you are using c try f lex and yacc bison

1346702
websphere	ibm
typically these would be provided by an application-server vendor ibm websphere or jboss

1346748
gina	winlogon
but you need to implement your own gina dll which is loaded by winlogon

1346794
hide	show
i ve never been a fan of toggle in jquery and would only ever consider using it to hide show itself

1346794
hide	show
even then i just use standard hide and show methods

1346794
fadein	fadeout
i changed your toggle calls to a fadein fadeout and closed off the function calls with semi colons

1346802
rss	feed
with some basic rss feed stuff thrown in

1346820
vim	emacs
a number of people at the company i currently intern at prefer emacs or vim

1346836
vb6	vba
basically vba in access is mostly vb6 but with sufficient differences to drive one slightly mad.

1346838
vim	emacs
the efficiency provided from vim emacs is mostly afforded by their heavy keyboard use

1346838
mouse	keyboard
in these programs you can do most anything directly from the keyboard rather than having to stop and use the mouse

1346855
inherited	properties
it s a hassle having to inherited of every type of control i want to specify custom properties for not to mention overriding shadowing the properties and setting the defaultvalue attribute

1346856
vim	emacs
i d say the actual vim emacs editors are far superior to the eclipse text editor in terms of the shortcuts they offer

1346909
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example if your rest api has a resource named mailboxes which supports get post put and delete and accepts and returns representations of type application json you could model the resource and its methods by creating the following soap methods

1346917
vim	emacs
vim emacs

put	get
or put differently can i get my example below to render the same in all viewers without abandoning absolute units at all

1346955
children	parent
i have 2 types of objects parent and children

1346955
children	parent
there are 2 types of parent parenta parentb and there are 2 types of children childa childb

1346955
children	parent
each parent has a collection of children

1346955
children	parent
type a parent can only have type a children and type b parent can only have typeb children

1346969
inherited	properties	getter	setter
the trap class inherited from movevariables many getter setter functions structured as properties

1346976
client-side	server-side
you are mixing client and server-side code -- the code you wrote seems like you re expecting a javascript function on the client-side to magically set a php variable on the server-side when in reality that type of operation is not possible

1346989
int	double
how do i check if a result is of the right type int float double etc. and then throw and catch an exception in case it s not

1347024
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works in firefox ie 8 and google-chrome

1347082
folder	directory
2 to get a list of all the system directory issue the command reg query hkey_local_machine software microsoft windows currentversion explorer shell folder and read the lines

1347124
draggable	droppable
for example i have two list of members in two divs i want them to be draggable n droppable in across the divs

1347127
post	put
some time ago i put my thoughts on skill matrices in a couple of blog post

1347156
post	get
you don t get anything preformatted like from wp_get_archives just the list of post but you get the post by author

1347192
jobs	cron
is there any danger in scheduling and deleting cron jobs from php

1347196
ienumerable	ilist
an ienumerable is just an interface for an iterator design pattern whereas list ilist is a data container

1347206
draggable	droppable
have you tried to set both divs draggable and droppable

1347215
jobs	cron
i would suggest that you do not add or delete cron jobs using php

1347218
draggable	droppable
you can make the container divs droppable and the list element divs draggable

1347250
client-side	server-side
there might be some client-side javascript but it doesn t compare to the amount of work done server-side

1347306
post	get
i m still going to try and get this working and i ll post back with update- but if we can t get this going soon we re going to have to drop amazon

1347387
rss	feed
this is example code puts your rss feed into a collection of syndication items

1347446
children	parent
styles applied to parent elements also apply to their children

1347462
margin	height
with a bottom margin height of the green div

1347508
int	chars
don t store them all in the same directory use some technique to put them on several dirs for instance you could use last two chars of a guid or last two digits of an int id and then store the path on db

1347573
rss	feed
rss feed for weather news etc

1347625
perforce	cvs
i use perforce at work having previously used cvs at my last job

1347625
perforce	cvs
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control system i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it

1347625
bazaar	git
on the other hand i ve recently been looking at some distributed source-control systems git mercurial and bazaar specifically

1347646
postgresql	mysql
i get the following error when inserting data from mysql into postgresql

1347666
getter	setter
you wont see the synthesize call being invoked synthesize just generates getter and setter for your property how are you declaring the property

1347675
width	height
or in the likely event that this is not possible is it possible to at least say display this image at 50 of its normal width and height

1347675
width	height
the width and height attributes distort the image -- as far as i can tell this is because they refer to whatever attributes the container may end up with which will be unrelated to the image

1347683
chown	mkdir
the functions you re asking about actually fall under several categories - file stream i o fopen fread etc. lower-level file descriptor i o open read etc. and filesystem directory manipulation chown mkdir etc.

1347687
ienumerable	iqueryable
if i have an ienumerable method called list what s the general best practice for an iqueryable

1347701
width	height
only set the width or height and it will scale the other automatically

1347711
x86	64bit
i m assuming you mean x86 and x86_64 here when you talk about 64bit

1347723
width	height
3 living with it and setting the width and height this although will make it look distorted but the right size will still result in the user having to download the full-sized image

1347760
interpreted-language	compiled-language
this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

1347793
ant	maven
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

1347846
button	checkbox
i want the user to select the checkbox click the register button outside the gridview and have a title from the selected row displayed

1347846
button	checkbox
from what i ve read i should put the checkbox check in the button click event

1347850
webclient	webrequest
use the webclient class or the underlying webrequest based classes if you need to programmically make requests

1347863
gif	png
if your image is some sort of png gif on a solid background you may be able to do something like this

1348018
treemap	linkedhashmap
this makes it much easier to change implementations to a treemap or a linkedhashmap in the future

1348023
mouse	keyboard
this class is used to generate native system input events for the purposes of test automation self-running demos and other applications where control of the mouse and keyboard is needed.

1348077
division	addition	division	modulo	addition	modulo
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

1348077
division	addition	division	modulo	addition	modulo
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

1348099
accessor	properties
create accessor properties that return your now private data where necessary and mark them obsolete your goal is to make the object the master of its data and only return results not the internal data

1348114
boost	stl
however stl containers are preferred for another very practical reason many third-party libraries boost arabica crypto++ utf-cpp... are designed to work with stl but know nothing about mfc containers

1348173
post	get
i d like to be able to do get the username of the user that created this post with something like post.user.username but i m wary of creating an entity based on the aspnet_user table for fear of creating a model that let s me bypass the membership class when making changes to the database

1348188
ironruby	ironpython
thanks to suggestions from a previous question i m busy trying out ironpython ironruby and boo to create a dsl for my c# app

1348230
put	get
this interface is a contract saying that the object maps keys to values and supports various operations put get

1348261
client-side	server-side
if i recall the hardest part was understanding the tight integration between client-side events and server-side event handling

1348266
actionscript	mxml
i m using ant and mxmlc to compile actionscript classes and mxml into swfs while maintaining the default organization of a flex builder flash builder project

1348266
folder	directory
the only problem i have is i do not know how to create the same directory structure as what lies under my src folder

1348327
opera	firefox
if you need to access the line number of something in javascript as long as you are using firefox or opera just access new error .linenumber

1348334
sequence	permutation
because a library that uses iterators to combine sequence of any kind with algorithms so that a all sensible permutation are possible and b it s universally extensible is when you think about your concept of a container library as it was 15 years ago such a mind-blowingly marvelous idea that it has pretty much blown out of the water everything else within less than a decade

1348382
hide	show
is there a better way to encapsulate the notion that these elements are paired and should show hide opposite each other

1348399
children	parent
i have a parent thread non-ui which creates some child threads to do some jobs these children are from a different class sounds odd but the code sample will illustrate it - at some point the parent must wait for certain tasks to be completed by the child thread - this does not mean the child is finished but only that it has reached a certain point and the parent can now continue processing .

1348411
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
i ve had good luck with monit on linux ubuntu opensuse and fedora builds - all 2.6 kernels mac os x 10.5 never tried older and netbsd

1348414
put	get
if i put a break point on the containing data flow task in the control flow diagram it stops but when i try to step into it i get the error message unable to step

1348435
draggable	droppable
however i just created some droppable elements outside of the scrollable div and my draggable elements can t leave the scrollable div

1348458
udp	tcp
2 use udp instead of tcp

1348458
udp	tcp
whether you use tcp or udp if you are concerned about every block of data arriving at its destination you should build some application level checking that all blocks arrived in order and uncorrupted.

1348479
hex	binary
i need a fast decompression routine optimized for restricted resource environment like embedded systems on binary hex data that has following characteristics

1348546
google-chrome	safari
however safari and google-chrome need some extra work

1348568
pull	push
i ve been performing all of my transactions clone push pull etc through ssh but recently ran git-update-server-info because i wanted to experiment with running git-clone over http

1348606
int	double
arithmetic types like int double decimal should implement iarithmetic

1348639
stdout	stderr
it s run by cron so in order to not leave a zombie around i shut down stdin stdout and stderr

1348655
wadl	wsdl
there seem to be efforts under way to come up with something similar to a wsdl for rest called web application description language wadl but i don t know how far that effort has come and as far as i know the wcf rest starter kit doesn t support any of that just yet

1348658
maven	pom.xml
however it s worth pointing out that the maven super pom.xml configures central to have snapshots disabled so maven shouldn t ever check for updates for snapshots on central unless you ve overridden that in your own pom.xml settings

1348757
hash	md5
md5 hash function and used as a

1348766
subtract	add
- add or subtract days from any date

1348781
jboss	weblogic
jboss some free apache projects related like apache activemq for jms weblogic websphere.

1348823
hash	md5
my suggestion is that you are not computing md5 hash since md5 produces a fixed length output of 32 hex numbers

1348844
jquery	jqmodal
i m hoping someone can point a relative jquery jqmodal newbie in the right direction for debugging this error

1348844
jquery	jqmodal
i m showing my jqmodal dialog in the response from a jquery call function foo is called from an onclick event

1348892
int	double
i need to get the left hand side int value from a decimal or double

1348903
free	malloc
it is not the c runtime that python links with so you shouldn t call the malloc free from msvcrt

1348911
int	double
i can see how the msdn article can be misleading they should have specified that while the result is an int in this case meaning whole number it is still of type double

1348917
int	double
don t cast the original double as an int because the rules for floor are different iirc for negative numbers

1348958
int	double
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

1348994
rss	feed
the rss feed is giving me everything even if i have the list filtered of looking at a specific view

1349003
appfuse	spring
everyone talks about how jsp is harder to get set up then php this maybe true but you should look into appfuse lite it will help you get your spring ibatis setup running in about 15 minutes

1349094
content-disposition	content-type
these are usually after the body and will have a content-type header that will tell you how to decode the attachment and some info about it as well as possibly a content-disposition header that provides some metadata about the attachment

1349096
appkit	nsimage
please see the appkit release notes for details of the nsimage changes

1349133
width	height
use a plain old textarea styled for height width font etc. rather than tinymce

1349142
getter	setter
i started a discussion about encapsulation on a forum in which i asked whether you should always clone objects inside setter and or getter as to preserve the above rule of encapsulation

1349144
touchesbegan	touchesended
i know that the first event triggered is touchesbegan and then the last one triggered is touchesended however i just don t know how i would go about measuring the time that the user has touched the view for

1349145
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb6	vba
vb6 vbscript and vba have the reputation because they just aren t industrial strength languages

1349153
int	boolean
most of these properties are boolean only hold 0 or 1 around 12 are with int values and some are string

1349162
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i have a css dropdown menu which is working great in ie7 firefox safari and opera on pc haven t been able to test on mac yet

hide	show
i want to provide a checkbox option to show hide a plot s legend

1349245
memcached	apc
if performance is really a problem and based on what you ve said it won t be then you might consider caching the results using something like apc memcached or xcache

1349339
rss	feed
there are rss feed and atom feed so i will assume you are talking about one of those

1349393
uitableview	uipickerview
you can use the built-in uitableview with a uinavigationcontroller to create a hierarchy of screens so your users can drill down from say a list of players to the player s stats then perhaps a detail view or a uitextview or a uipickerview to change those stats

1349413
versioning	upgrade
the only downside unfortunately there s no good way around it at the moment is that if you upgrade django you ll have to be on the lookout for any changes to that index.html file and copy those changes over into your versioning as well

1349443
inherited	properties
you class that contains dependency properties must inherited from dependencyobject

1349549
rss	feed
ok i m assuming you are talking about rss feed

1349549
rss	feed
point it at an rss or atom feed it will give you back php arrays and objects

1349576
jar	war
on the other hand if you want to share code across multiple war files then you would bundle the wars into an ear and bundle the shared business logic code in one or more jar files stored in that ear

1349613
try-catch	exception-handling
sometimes there are some isolated cases where it is known that this block of code occasionally throws exception-handling and i ve handled it in with a try-catch

1349660
touchesbegan	touchesended
store it in touchesbegan and fetch the duration in touchesended as this

1349707
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode which even if resharper does it for me is extra needless code

1349777
hide	show
right now i m able to show all 4 sub-divs at the same time where it should hide the currently visible one then show the new one

1349887
rss	feed
fortunately most search engines understand rss or atom so be sure to include a news feed with your site

1349930
inherited	base-class
where a derived class of virtualroot hides a member from the base that member of the derived class is dominant over the member of the base and will be used even though the base-class member can be reached by other path in the inherited tree

1349932
width	height
i want the script to get the width and height of each image then format this into an img tag that would include the url i m using

1349935
mouse	keyboard
in order to do anything that invokes a prompt flash requires user interaction like keyboard or mouse input

1349979
wan	lan
however it seems to me that this roadblock is evaporating as new technologies and robust api s eliminate many integration difficulties created when running applications outside the lan wan

1349982
width	height
furthermore i don t understand why you would want to include image height and width in the img elements as there is no need to specify those

1349982
width	height
the height and the width are only used to modify the image dimensions as the browser automatically display s the actual size

1350013
webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest response and webclient will catch most of the redirects but not all of them since there are pages that do the redirect via javascript

1350014
rss	feed
this one uses tags only but meant to be an rss feed selector

1350103
stdout	stderr
you can close stdout stderr stdin in just the child process if

1350119

indesign	automator
and a workflow guide from adobe using automator and indesign

1350153
rss	feed
is it practical possible to use serialization to read data from an rss feed

1350153
rss	feed
i basically want to pull information from my netflix queue provided from an rss feed and i m trying to decide if serialization is feasible possible or if i should just use something like xmlreader

1350155
udp	tcp
with socket.sendfile since sockets are by definition protocol-agnostic you could potentially send the file via udp or tcp with the same code but i would only recommend that if you re sending via a lan where packet loss is virtually 0

1350164
hide	show
so here s my question how to i load unload or show hide views

1350167
rss	feed
you can then use linq to xml to query against and render the rss feed into something usable

1350170
rss	feed
the system.servicemodel.syndication namespace provides a bunch of types to manage feed feed content and categories feed formatting rss 2.0 atom 1.0 etc

1350171
public	protected
if i have a java class which is package-private declared with class not public class there is really no difference if the methods inside are declared public or protected or package-private right

1350180
integer	unsigned
as stated below it turns out after a tiny bit of investigation that for positive floats in intel ieee754 format of size n-bits that are +infinity treating the concatenated exponent and significand as a n-1 bit unsigned integer adding one gets the next higher and subtracting one get next lower

1350183
mouseleave	mouseenter
the pseudo-event-name hover is used as a shorthand for mouseenter mouseleave but was handled differently in earlier jquery versions

1350183
mouseleave	mouseenter
still a popular question so it s worth drawing attention to dennis98 s point in the comments below that in jquery 1.9+ the hover event was deprecated in favour of the standard mouseenter mouseleave calls

1350188
rss	feed
if you can use linq linq to xml is an easy way to get at the basics of an rss feed document

1350188
rss	feed
this is from something i wrote to select out a collection of anonymous types from my blog s rss feed for example

1350192
public	protected
if i have a java class which is package-private declared with class not public class there is really no difference if the methods inside are declared public or protected or package-private right

1350192
public	protected
but if you then or in the future declare a protected or public class that inherits from the package-private class then the visibility of the members of the original class do matter

1350195
put	get
i m trying to get data from isnare and put them into mysql table

1350209
websphere	ibm
this is more or less born out of frustration with the jax-ws 2.0 implementation in the web services feature pack for ibm websphere 6.1 - apparently wsdls are not generated for jax-ws webservices if they have a soap 1.2 binding defined using the bindingtype annotation

1350231
actionscript	mxml
in actionscript and mxml the whole concept of fluid layouts

1350232
client-side	server-side
if you treat asp as the server-side and flex as the client-side then you just need to sort out what the api will be

1350234
uiview	subviews
when you are satisfied with your drawing on the seperate uiview you can then combine the two views by adding the uiview as a subviews of the uiimageview and then get a flattened uiimage from the uiimageview as follows

1350248
post	get
basically you re typing your search term into a form which then post via get to a search page which queries its database for records matching that string

1350264
try-catch	exception-handling
since i always believed that a try-catch always takes a small performance hit even when not throwing the exception-handling i made a little test

1350266
rss	feed
i m working on a web page rss feed form in a winapp to show current system status and recent updates

1350277
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
loki is a plug-in built by skyhook which works on internet explorer 6 internet explorer 7 firefox 2 firefox 3 safari and opera

1350277
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
you can install google gears on internet explorer 6+ firefox 1.5+ safari opera mobile and ie mobile

1350315
integer	unsigned
additionally it returns an unsigned integer for the resultant color

1350315
integer	unsigned
anyhow i don t see anything in the api for converting a color to an unsigned integer or for simply interpolating between two instances of color

1350318
post	get
you should be able to do all the relevant includes inside your script.php and pass any parameters that need to carry through from post or get via ajaxsubmit

1350332
unsigned	short
i ll bet they re doing a + on an unsigned short

1350332
unsigned	short
the result of the addition gets cast to an int implicitly then needs to be downcast back to an unsigned short for the assignment

1350335
setinterval	settimeout
flex has enter_frame events timer calllater settimeout setinterval all which delay calls and create new execution stacks

1350335
pull	push
the idea being that you push functions closures into an array and the active object controller pull the next one off the list when the previous one has run to completion

1350346
put	get
so i get only the last value inserted in the database but when i put the query line inside foreach loop like

1350380
g++	gcc
i am running g++ gcc version 3.4.4 on cygwin

1350386
implements	extends
lastly maybe you should just enforce an interface to be implements in stead of extends the base class

1350428
clang	llvm
in terms of features my favorites are the integration with clang llvm instruments upgrades major the new doco system and general improvements to the editor

1350428
versioning	upgrade
also keep in mind that you need to download and install the snow leopard versioning of the iphone sdk once you upgrade to xcode 3.2

1350451
setinterval	settimeout
you could use settimeout or setinterval the latter is probably best suited to what you want to do

1350454
hide	show
to show and hide the div you can use one of the various effects functions

1350463
ssl	https
consider ftps or webdav over https ssl which are feature rich and secure

1350520
filesystems	xfs
one excellent impact reduction strategy is to use a filesystems like xfs

1350540
innodb	myisam
if innodb doesn t exist mysql will automatically substitute myisam unless you change the default sql_mode to avoid this substitution

1350548
prepare	execute
you could however build a string with those variables and then prepare and execute it as dynamic sql

1350566
int	double
the numbers are either int or double

1350566
int	double
i can t use int because some of the input i get are double s

1350567
int	chars
however if the client violates that precondition as in the example you provide above where chars is not the same as int then it will be up to the client not you to correct the compile-time error

1350598
width	height
this worked fine until i realized that i needed two pieces of information from the view in order to make this operation complete the way users expect the width and height of the canvas specfically

1350598
width	height
how do i pass both width and height to my command

1350601
int	chars
the inputiterator can be of either unsigned chars chars or std string iterators and t is expected to be a signed int such as signed int int or long

1350633
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails merb sinatra or any other web framework would work

1350641
realloc	malloc
if you allocate the initial buffer using malloc you can use realloc to resize the buffer

1350681
width	height
the function on this page will return a rectangle with the top left height and width co ordinates of a passed element relative to the browser view port

1350719
hide	show
basically the fx option is used to call animate you can specify a single option or two in an array that will be used to do the show and hide effects

1350737
vim	emacs
alternatively a good editor such as emacs or vim should help you make that type of mechanical change semi-automatically and fairly quickly if you can drive the editor well

1350781
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
the only one that i know about that is included in the base class library are the ftpwebrequest ftpwebresponse classes

1350809
width	height
you can use a grid and put a video element in last z order and let its width and height be auto and you can have a video played in it and put your container in front of it

1350819
free	malloc
dynamic allocations with new delete are said to take place on the free-store while malloc free operations use the heap

1350819
free	malloc
free store and heap not new malloc

1350831
yslow	pagespeed
you can also use firebug yslow pagespeed as firfox plugin to help you

1350832
free	malloc
the term heap may also refer to a particular data structure but in the context of the c++ malloc free new and delete operations the terms heap and free store are used more or less interchangeably

1350833
free	malloc
area allocated free by malloc free

1350833
free	malloc
malloc and free by a particular

1350855
put	get
when you unzip the files don t get put into a subdirectory like tar usually does

1350875
superclass	subclassing
it is similar to how normal extension can add methods except the subclassing is only coupled by a reference which means that any superclass can be used

1350893
int	double
in both of your examples one list contains one number that is an int last 1 in the first case and 2 as the first element of the second list the rest of the numbers are double

1350893
int	double
if you also try it with scala 2.8 then it should use numeric instead of anyval as it became the supertype of both double and int

1350893
int	double
in this case the int values you gave will be converted to double

1350917
post	get
i want id to be sent with post not get

1350952
post	get
post requests can contain get variables too whereas get requests can t contain post variables

1350978
post	get
note the use of acceptverbs to identify which method to invoke for post requests and get requests

1350991
qlist	qvector
qt containers can be converted to from stl containers e.g qvector tostdvector qlist fromstdlist

1351008
post	get
the variable contains both post and get data

1351008
post	get
post and get data usually originates from being entered into a web form by a user but get data can also come directly from a link to an address like in your example

put	get
you can get pretty close though with a solution that lars fastrup one of the sharepoint regulars here on stackoverflow put together and placed out on codeplex

1354468
base-class	subclassing
as3 doesn t allow you to do overloads more than one function with the same name differentiated by return types or parameter types only overrides subclassing can replace base-class implementations

1354560
nsmutablestring	nsstring
yes you can pass an nsmutablestring for an nsstring

1354560

1354690
fastcgi	scgi
this happens for all 3 supported apis fastcgi scgi and http proxy

1354690
apache	lighttpd
more conserns me is the fact that apache -- mature and well supported web server as lighttpd

1354690

when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it

1354971
children	parent
i was looking for a fairly generalised solution - but i ve been able to make do with something fairly specific - basically it uses the visualtreehelper to find children with the same parent as the control that i want to tab next to and sets focus to that

1355057
qgraphicsview	qmouseevent
here is what s happens -- qgraphicsview receives qmouseevent translates it into qgraphicsscenemouseevent and passes it to the scene

using only the keyboard the mouse works too

1355168
mouse	keyboard
whenever you transverse with your keyboard or mouse the closing tag tm will flash you the opening one

1355207
inherited	subclassing
they are represented in 3 tables with the same names using table per subclassing inherited structure

1355214

wanting to work with the siblings of this textarea and other children of its parent i wondered how you could best implement closest div or td whichever comes first logic via jquery syntax

1355382
loops	while-loop
so anything created inside of a function is destroyed when the function returns and likewise anything created inside of a while-loop s body is automatically destroyed when loops reaches its end regardless of whether it terminates or iterates again

1355382
int	chars
i used the term object repeatedly above but the same rules apply to fundamental types like int chars bool etc

1355398
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
win32 programmers have been using various other mechanisms for a long time and these are exposed by the autoresetevent manualresetevent and mutex classes all of which derive from waithandle

many-to-many	one-to-many
but then i ve made as best practices advices one-to-many association instead of many-to-many in my mappings

1355407
folder	directory
it s always fun for me the first time one of my newer programmers puts in a http handler in a root folder and then all of the apps in the virtual directory under it explode because they don t have the dll they should have put the http handler statement only in the app that needed it not in the root

1355438
gridview	formview
normally i want the user to select the item from the gridview and populate the formview

1355441

i eeked out a few more characters by combining the logic from the while and for loops into a single for-loop and by moving the declaration of the c variable into the main definition as an input parameter

1355625
superclass	subclassing
i don t think there s a way to dynamically choose whether to extend one class or another except if you made a program that can manipulate bytecode directly simple example hold the compiled bytecode for both versions of the subclassing as strings and just use a classloader to load whichever one corresponds to the superclass you have available

1355626
implements	extends
java does know that mylist extends but it also knows perfectly well that does not implements mylist

1355631

1355656
children	parent
its children and parent objects in turn should follow the same rules

1355656
post	put
obviously each individual post ought not directly put itself on the home page but when a single post has been updated that event is released from the deepest point in the hierarchy - a single post - and floats up to eventually the top level where it is dealt with choosing whether or not to display on the home page

1355663

unfortunately the height of the text box is user-agent specific thing i believe that firefox opera and ie will treat it like a box object while safari and possibly firefox on mac

1355829
stdout	stderr
in some cases i d be inclined to use process.start so that i could capture the stdout stderr streams independently and maybe even control stdin interactively depending on the application

xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
is there any difference on how they work with different des like gnome kde xfce etc

1355923
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
for example pyqt pykde and the brand new pyside will play nicer in a kde environment while the gtk versions including the wx-widgets will blend better into a gnome xfce desktops

1355923
kde	gnome
you can go for basic portable gui kit or you can to a deeper integration with tour de like use of integrated password manager and configuration file parsers that are integrated in a specific de like kde or gnome

1355948
kde	gnome
for example kde uses qt and gnome uses gtk

1355952
hash	salt
implement a salt hash in javascript

1355975

1356478
folder	dir	folder	directory
if your testing it from vs then the current directory is the project dir not the release debug folder where your exe is

1356504
children	parent
the point is that either you load the children together with the parent or you load them separately

1356504
children	parent
when you load them together with the parent product in your example the parent controls all access to the children including retrieval and write operations

1356504
children	parent
a corrolary to this is that there must be no repository for the children - data access is managed by the parent s repository

1356510
sorting	filtering
the application requires a lot of filtering based on user input sorting and structuring

cvs	svn
ask hudson to check periodically the cvs svn ... and if there are changes since the last build then it will start the build

1362171
postgresql	mysql
orm based on propel doctrine so you can use mysql postgresql or sqlite

1362198
hide	show
may be hide all div.actions at first and show only when parent was been hovered

1362203
children	parent
each row should have two columns a text box showing the parent s name and a datagridviewcomboboxcolumn containing that parent s children from which the user can select the parent s favorite child

1362203
children	parent
i d like each instance of the combo box to bind to the list of each parent s children

1362203
children	parent
it s not too tough to make a separate list of all the children and filter it by parent

1362251
post	get
alex feinman describes how it works and how to get around it in this blog post

1362388
children	parent
anyone has an idea on how to get all parent and children of a page

1362418
keydown	keyup
do you have any keydown keyup keypress event handlers that may intercept the ctrl+v keystrokes

1362444
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie7 and google-chrome browsers and one friend tested on firefox 3.0 and it worked

1362447
int	chars
since x is always passed in as an unsigned chars then it will always have a value between 0 and 255 inclusive regardless of whether you cast x or 0 to a signed int in the if statement

1362452
hash	md5
store the results into a session a good idea would be to create a hash of that data using md5 then using that cache the session per multiple users

1362458
int	chars
since an int is bigger than a chars casting unsigned chars to signed int still retains the chars s original value

1362465
int	chars
all the values of an unsigned chars can fir perfectly in your int so even with the cast you will never get a negative value

1362499
profiling	debugging
don t profiling or otherwise judge performance in the debugging configuration

1362584
getter	setter
sometimes a lot of helper classes is a symptom of an anemic model if are related to classes that mainly have setter getter in those scenarios helpers grows up from behavior that isn t correctly assigned to domain objects

1362620
post	get
if you are creating a client application only you will need to set service.useproxy to false and use either get or post

1362651
floating-point	integer
it s not entirely clear but i think you re asking how to convert a floating-point value myduration to an integer in bash

1362677
cvs	svn
i ve seen various schemes along these line using cvs no externals here so it was checked-in scripts that had to be executed and svn

1362689
boost	allocator
3 is it possible to use boost pool allocator with the bgl

1362704
post	put
i started series of post about great plains automation success story where i put all the details and steps of my investigation along with sample code

1362704
mouse	keyboard
of course without any use of keyboard mouse hard-coded workarounds

1362723
width	height
i tried all sorts of things even going through the windowmanager to expand the window to full width and height manually but nothing works

1362723
width	height
for instance i show a progress bar circle which has width and height set to fill_parent so does its layout container but still the dialog wraps around the much smaller progress bar instead of filling the screen

1362725
hide	show
this code is going to hide all the images in the popups and then only show the first image in the collection which is inside the a.effect projectpopup

1362725
width	height
the problem with resizing the popup has to do with getting the size of the first img using width and height

1362725
width	height
to fix this while looping through the projectpopups temporarily show them off screen so you are able to get the width and height of the first image

1362755
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade it to the latest versioning 1.03 via cpan

1362762
equals	gethashcode
two rows will only be joined when gethashcode of left and right are the same and equals returns true

1362773
width	height
width and height are both int properties

1362794
children	parent
and i would like to eager load all parent and children for a given grandparent

1362842
hash	md5
otoh if you need a cryptographically strong hash function i would avoid md5 and use sha-256 nowadays

1362857
range	max	range	min	min	max
i m dealing with lots of data that have a min max range and i need to group these together based on the same min max values

1362857
min	max
basically this could be a linq query on the dictionary of all values where the provides value is between the min and max value

1362883
equals	gethashcode
using a key in a dictionary is a matter of overriding gethashcode and equals

1362894
hide	show
with this method you can then return true or false depending on whether you want to show hide the button

1362894
hide	show
i want to show hide the button later on how do i get the callback to trigger

1362908
unicode	ucs
the specification defines unicode√¢ s character set the universal character set ucs and some encodings to encode that characters the unicode transformation formats utf-7 utf-8 utf-16 and utf-32

1362917
hide	show
in other words if i want to write a winforms db application with an appearince like vs that has docked panels and also the ability to show hide forms within some of those panels how would i structure the interface

1362923
width	height
if a do that i get a problem when i rotate the image for the image width can be bigger then height of the image so then i need to reset the image x y coordinates to 0 0

1362993
equals	compareto
first don t confuse equals with compareto

1363052
pop-up	dialog
i want to show a modal dialog pop-up window when the user has not filled in a text field on the page instead of using an error text field on the page

1363054
equals	gethashcode
type t basically has to be dealt with as an object using only the lowest common denominator of operations available to everything assignment gethashcode equals

1363067
prepare	execute
prepare statement is just a parsed and precompiled sql statement which just waits for the bound variables to be provided to be execute

1363067
prepare	execute
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

1363071
getter	setter
in java defining getter setter instead of defining public member variables does not result in performance degradation as the jit inline the getter setter

1363100
countif	sumifs
edit i also recommend that you google advanced excel functions like sumproduct sumifs and countif

1363117
profiling	benchmarking
i guess it doesn t really matter but i tend to think that when gather information about what will run in production it is best to test exactly what will go to production this goes for analysis profiling benchmarking etc.

1363119
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring you may have been given a mutable string at assignment so other code may modify the string s value without your knowledge unless you are using key-value observing to observe those changes

1363119
nsstring	nsdata
for this reason it is usually appropriate to use copy semantics for properties that you intend to hold an immutable value nsstring nsdata nsarray nsset are the common--though not exaustive--suspects

1363128
excel	listobject
i am trying to save a listobject from a .net 3.5 excel 2007 vsto workbook to a new sheet done and save that new sheet to a new workbook done without that workbook requiring the vsto customization file

1363147
public	protected
the only additional access that making it public would provide would be to allow instances of the class to be declared as variables in scopes that cannot access its protected members but instances of abstract classes cannot be declared at all

1363171
put	get
i don t think that 2 is true because i put calls to append to a file in the shared new the public new and finalize functions and all i get are

1363171
min	max	percentile	max
i ve replaced min max average stdev small percentile skew kurtosis and a few more

1363214
public	protected
my opinion would be that the public constructor might be seen to be confusing and as you say making it protected would be correct

1363252
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have a weird scenario i need to use the ajax scriptmanager and updatepanel on two specific asp.net 2.0 pages

1363295
division	modulo
this is done using integer division and modulo mod operators in your programming language

1363295
division	modulo
however if the page size is 4 a power of 2 then 4 in binary is 100 and integer division and modulo can be computed using special shortcuts you can strip the last two binary digits to divide and you can keep only the last two binary digits for modulo

1363301
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie8 but in firefox and google-chrome the nested table is ignoring the colspan and is only sown in the first column

1363303
button	checkbox
on the application s properties i used the signing tab set on the checkbox for sign the clickonce manifest clicked the create test certificate button and entered passwords

1363308
direct3d	directx
will wpf stop running in absence of a directx direct3d capable graphics card drivers or will it just run slower

1363308
direct3d	directx
i know wpf is based on directx direct3d even for simple controls but i cannot find any reference on the topic which provides a good overview of borderline scenarios

1363325
google-chrome	safari
i have tested it for ie safari and google-chrome revealing no errors

1363338
uiview	calayer
you can do something similar to extract the content from a calayer-backed uiview although we had to subclass calayer in order to get vector elements to render to a pdf properly

1363446
boost	stl
it will probably make you able to do more in less time than with c++ stl qt boost

1363485
spweb	spsite
it is almost always better to use dependency injection to provide an spsite or spweb reference for your class to use perhaps through the constructor

1363485
spweb	spsite
however you should track and dispose the spsite rather than the spweb

1363492
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn	cvs	svn
note that i said a vcs so it can be svn cvs bazaar .

1363509
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
i m reasonably familiar with the various forms of vb that existed prior to .net vb6 vba vbscript... but have yet to delve into the sweet new flavor that is vb.net

1363518
children	parent
i want to retrieve all anchor tags + all children and parent and their attributes for every anchor tag

1363524
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb6	vba
what you can do is contrast with vb.net with vba or vb6 or vbscript or some other variant of visual basic

1363528
directx	gdi
additionally on modern hardware 2d gdi or gdi+ can be about as fast as 2d opengl or directx

1363534
put	get
to put it simply you get inner joins if you use the first form

1363582
gridview	repeater
instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater

1363654
width	height
i figured it out by the way - the solution is to use the regex module to substitute existing width and height values for new ones

1363665
cos	sin
you can change cos to sin

1363665
cos	sin
dont forget that sin and cos are periodic

1363733
inherited	properties
i would like to have a role base class that has properties for activedate and deactivedate that each role like applicationadministratorrole can inherited from so that every role is forced to have these properties

1363747
width	height
this will allow you to measure the width and height of your text taking into account font size etc

1363796
nunit	mstest
without integration of nunit one of us has resharper while the other does not we are leaning toward mstest

1363817
int	double
it looks like there is a shared lock that is used whenever is called when formatting an int and presumably double

1363818
fontfamily	font-size
i recommend doing fontfamily helvetica neue helvetica arial font-size 20pt and setting the font weight to the lowest possible 100

1363845
int	boolean
i could have overloads for all the different underlying types they re all dates int boolean and decimals but i wanted to see if i could get the generic version working

1363850
button	checkbox
depending on what sort of back-end is handling your form after it s submitted some people name radio button and checkbox with a after their name to make them convert nicely to arrays in the form handling system

1363873
mbunit	nunit
it includes mbunit but its runner can run tests from other frameworks like nunit xunit etc

1363880
wordpress	phpbb
or if your site will be hosting an install of wordpress or phpbb there are ways of leveraging those technologies authentication modules to sign in to other pages of a site

1363881
nunit	mstest
see msbuild nant nunit mstest and frustration not written by me

1363904
folder	directory
so if i put all the pdfs of the job descriptions in a folder called .. jobops with the php file located in root directory what would i need to do

1363915
hash	salt
the solution is that before a password is hash it is combined usually concatenated or xor d with a value called the salt which is unique to each user

1363949
folder	directory
to do this create a folder in the same directory as your script called whatever you like populate it with at least one image so that the following if doesn t unset the entire array and see if that works

1363951
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup events

1363960
int	boolean
the states parameter arrives either as an int or a boolean never an array

1364084
postgresql	mysql
nor does mysql support a sequence object like oracle or postgresql or ibm db2

1364116
invokerequired	begininvoke
however when combined with the invokerequired property or the invoke begininvoke method it is bad

1364148
put	get
if we can get that to work we can start thinking about where we really want to put the else statements at a later date

1364150
post	get
visit make post or get http request php page from your java program for example via httpurlconnection type

1364181
hide	show
why not just show and hide it on the users request

1364187
union	distinct
in c c++ an object must have a non-zero size iso c++ 1.8 intro.object 5 - this indirectly implies that every object has a distinct address union notwithstanding - so even for an empty class it still has to be at least 1 byte

1364223
mvp	presenter
in that article it says unlike the presenter in mvp a viewmodel does not need a reference to a view

1364310
post	get
i m having trouble both finding how to access a cookie on an http post in the web service code how to take that cookie and get the membership user

1364368
ant	maven
i d like to reference the maven project from the ant project and pull in all of the required dependencies

1364458
backtracking	greedy
although i don t like how much it backtracking making the catchall greedy between begin and rate will allow you to skip to the rate in the section where code xx

1364469
post	get
once you do your initial post and get that working you simply call usr bin curl again with the second url

1364484
getter	setter
because the .net property wrappers are bypassed by wpf at run-time one should not include logic in the getter and setter

1364485
datalist	repeater
datalist repeater

1364530
vbscript	jscript
i work on a jscript vbscript html application so we can execute at higher privileges than a normal web page and we re providing the capability to download a file and need to provide feedback on the download progress to our users

1364538
datalist	repeater
i would not use the repeater or datalist

1364538
datalist	repeater
it is much faster then the repeater grid and the datalist

1364563
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to new versioning of no-script and still had problem

1364575
client-side	server-side
i am willing to try client-side or server-side solutions

1364609
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

1364640
superclass	subclassing
also the subclassing don t need to have the generating function in them if i need that again i can just call the code generator from the superclass

1364647
postgresql	mysql
i don t like mysql licence firebird and postgresql are better

1364666
postgresql	mysql
drupal core only officially supports mysql and postgresql as database providers for drupal 6 with work being done to support sqlite for drupal 7

1364703
single-quotes	double-quotes
which allows only within matching double-quotes you could similarly expand it to allow single-quotes

1364740
children	parent
if you have multiple documents the parent is going to be navigating between which are all part of the same application and should not close the children you re making things really hard for yourself

1364770
inherited	properties
now your csv code would only need to access and loop through the key value pairs within the properties hashtable it inherited from the domainobject to get the names and values

1364770
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
but obviously this only works if you have a level of control over your objects necessry to make them inherited from the domainobject and it wouldnt involve 30 years of drugery to rewrite all your properties accessor

1364833
free	malloc
you should get a few linker errors about undefined malloc and free and so on

1364840
google-chrome	firefox
wpf in the browser aka xbap is works just from firefox mozilla and google-chrome

1364842
google-chrome	firefox
i have some js that runs fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome i see the following error

1364842
google-chrome	firefox
also any clue why this might work on ie firefox but not google-chrome

1364875
post	get	inherited	subclassing
you could deploy this check-and-redirect-if-needed or other behavior alteration of your choice in any of various ways decorators wsgi middleware inherited from an intermediate base class of yours that subclassing webapp.requesthandler or whatever other base handler class you re currently using and method names different than get and post in your application-level handler classes and others yet but i think that the key idea here is that os.environ is set by the app engine framework according to cgi standards and so you can rely on those standards similarly wsgi builds its own environment based on the values it picks up from os.environ

1364895
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
if your programming language and environment do not allow similar tricks like dynamic creation of subclassing python s metaclass - some kind of inherited hook etc

1364925
put	get
since the only way for data to get into your sandbox is for you to put it there most apps have intrinsic knowledge about the data of any file they can read

1364930
rss	feed
we have a site that is serving some rss feed and we d like to know how many people is subscribed to each one without using a system like feedburner to serve them

1364930
rss	feed
being google s property now it can surely find out how many people are subscribed to a certain feed in greader specifically but i m sure there are other online rss feed that would pose the same problems

1364952
super	self
for an nsobject instance its dealloc routine will get called as the object is going away -- you should have a chance there to save off any state you need to before destroying self and super

1364978
ingres	postgresql	ingres	mysql	ingres	firebird	ingres	oracle	postgresql	mysql
it gets us much closer to making applications truly db-agnostic - you can swap out the sql server provider for mysql postgresql oracle firebird sqlite ingres - and all the linq expressions stay exactly the same

1365003
sorting	grouping
one contained culture-invariant data the code s internal id for sure the code itself if the code was culture-invariant and possibly other columns like sorting grouping categories

1365034
haskell	sml
i m doing some homework and while i have some experience with sml haskell has some oddities

1365044

it looks like volume is an int and symbol is a double but in your error lines you re using one or the other as a different type

1365075
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
apart from lxml is anyone aware of python packages that depend on libxml2 and libxslt

you need to to use the attr method to set the src attribute of the existing image like this

1365122
getter	setter
adding attribute getter and setter

1365131
gobject	dbus
i have a convenience function for gobjects but i actually need this class for a more general case -- both for dbus signal callbacks and gobject callbacks

1365131
gobject	dbus
it is a very clean encapsulation of the weak callback but with the gobject dbus specialization unnoticeably tacked on

1365154
width	height
my flv file is actually 600x678 but shows up scaled down on the stage and tracing the width and height i get 320x240

1365170
rpm	yum
i found one document to build rpm 5.0 and yum on aix

1365193
pop-up	dialog
a button to make this detailed-info editable seems a very smooth natural and seamless approach without the unpleasantnesses connected with dialog pop-up tooltips appearing on hover and the like

1365197
sorting	filtering
power users can get into middle-clicking to open in a new window and you get sorting filtering etc as the list grows

1365202
vmware	virtualbox
i wonder how virtualization software such as virtualbox or vmware workstation works

1365290
firefox	safari
i have tried this in ie safari and firefox 2 all have absolutely no problem

1365290
client-side	server-side
i know it is not due to server-side processing network latency or client-side script

1365295
post	get
if i leave it off i get a 500 error response informing me that my post entity body was empty even though it was not

1365300
versioning	upgrade
for example if some hypothetical windows server 2011 comes out before you re ready to upgrade your production install of windows server 2008 r2 your evaluations may all expire and you ll discover that the 2008 versioning are no longer available

1365334
mvp	presenter
mvp model - presenter a bridge for exchanging data between model and ui - iview represents actual views ie

1365368
fputcsv	fgetcsv
i m not too well versed in extremely complex regex s so assuming you re looking for a one time conversion i would write a quick script to open the csv in php read the file fgetcsv built into php5 and write fputcsv line by line into a new file while str_replace ing the newline characters

subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
bigdecimals are preferred for being completely accurate for multiplication addition and subtraction division isn t normally an issue when it comes to currency amounts

1365382
post	get
send a post or get request to a server which can send the email on your behalf

1365382
post	get
what you want to do is number 2 so that means you need access to a server capable of sending mail that can also receive get post requests

1365387
activemq	rabbitmq
possibly activemq or rabbitmq

1365409
public	protected
it has also changed visibility from protected to public but that is not a problem

1365410
portrait	landscape
i m trying to change an individual page within a multi-page report so that the orientation is landscape instead of portrait

1365417
viewdidload	viewwillappear
so in this function i save the region of the current view to my appdelegate mkcoordinateregion variable and then let the new view s viewwillappear or viewdidload get called

1365417
viewdidload	viewwillappear
somehow the exact same code in viewdidload produces a different result when run in viewwillappear

1365440
mouseover	mouseout
one for mouseover and one for mouseout

1365452
testcase	fixture
they differentiate fixture from testcase

1365460
chunked	transfer-encoding
setting the binding to use transfermode streamed was causing a transfer-encoding chunked

1365502
opera	firefox
note i realize dom is handled differently in different browsers and so the innerhtml from opera will look different than the one from firefox

1365585
required	placeholder
this page would contain a the buttons and textbox required to make up the inner browser ui and a placeholder that would contain the page that the user requested

1365606
win64	windows
i m looking for an x64 compiler that i can include in my releases so that users of my application can get around win64 s windows on windows system to access native resources

1365641
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if this is the cause of the mishap and your server is apache just add the line adddefaultcharset utf-8 either in the mainl httpd.conf file or a .htaccess in the webroot folder

1365653
stdout	stderr
i suspect that the stderr output of the ssh command somehow works into the issue for now i have redirected stderr to stdout in the ssh code to execute

1365661
fink	macports
personally i have a long background of unix development including cross-platform work and had been an avid fink then macports user for years

1365661
fink	macports
when doing a clean install of leopard i never got around to installing fink macports and haven t had a need to since

1365661
fink	macports
both macports and fink are awesome

1365686
put	get
you say the jsp page s encoding is not unicode but rather big5 so what are you doing to get that string out of the attribute map and put it on that page

1365761
equals	gethashcode
if you always want author objects to be compared based on the name values then override gethashcode and equals or implement iequatable

1365761
equals	gethashcode
the two members on the iequalitycomparer interface are equals and gethashcode

1365773
equals	gethashcode
you ve overriden equals but make sure you also override gethashcode

1365795
equals	gethashcode
if you have not overridden equals and gethashcode then it uses the default implementation on object which compares references

1365795
equals	gethashcode
the simple solution is to add a correct implementation of equals and gethashcode to all classes which participate in the object graph you are comparing ie book and author

1365795
equals	gethashcode
the iequalitycomparer interface is a convenience that allows you to implement equals and gethashcode in a separate class when you don t have access to the internals of the classes you need to compare or if you are using a different method of comparison

1365849
textmate	gedit
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x

uiview	subviews
i have added several uiscrollviews as subviews of a single uiview and set the frames so that each one is clearly visable

1366224
for-loop	loops
i do this in a for-loop and with each pass of loops i release the uiscrollview though the object is still stored because it has been subviewed into the uiview

background-image	background-color
require that they explicitly write background-color background-image

1366344

nsobject	nsmanagedobject
i ve tried looking around in nsobject nsmanagedobject docs but found nothing

maven	pom.xml
note this is a flat structure for maven as all non-leaf projects have a packaging value of pom.xml

1366535
maven	pom.xml
the maven parent pom.xml notion would be fine but it is already used by the modules so it is not available for our requirement

1366552
dictionary	map
all you need to do is map the url profile password check to a view and within that view fetch the value for the key oldpassword in the request.post dictionary do with it what you will and return either true or false

visualvm	jrockit
beside visualvm which nick mentioned another good and free for development piece of software is oracle jrockit mission control

1366574
datarow	bindingsource
i then tried sending in the actual datarow and even the datarowview object of the parent bindingsource and using the find method on the details bindingsource - but they all just return -1

1366654
int	double
i would advice to use int or enumeration for the priority as priority doesn t sound to be a good candidate for beeing double

1366761
width	height
of course by using either the height or the width as the anchor one way or other the new image will cause scrolling assuming the original image is larger than the window in the first place

1366768

but here lies the problem the logic deciding what to show or not has to be written once in the server-side and once in the client-side language

1366908
superclass	subclassing
another warning even if there were a conversion from subclassing to superclass it would incur slicing of the subclassing object since you provide the arguments by value

1367228
ant	maven
update as for the question of integrating ant or maven with eclipse see my answer on best way to share jars across multiple projects

i have a large project where we have 2-3 dll projects that are converted from vb6 to vb.net

1367345
xna	slimdx

1367380
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade macports to 1.8 removed all previously installed ports and reinstalled them in 1.8 which i assume would have installed a 64-bit versioning of the ports including freeimage

i have an uitableview in my app and i have to load some images that have a fixed width but different height

1367416
opera	firefox
this standard applies to ie firefox opera browsers

1367416
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
but the above code only works in safari and in ie and firefox and opera it will become 1020px overall width

1367453
chunked	transfer-encoding
i run into all kind of funky encodings for example transfer-encoding chunked have to parse all that stuff manually and i feel like coding c not python at the moment

1367468
post	get
ie will then detect that the form contains a utf-8 character and use utf-8 when you post or get

1367474
nsurl	nsdata
resulting in boilerplate code to just to decide if i should open the image with nsdata datawithcontentsoffile or nsdata datawithcontentsofurl sadly you can t create an nsurl from a local file name

1367533
webrat	celerity
however i still think that this will be the way the headless browser tests will go and apart from the immature webrat culerity interface you could probably create some decent test suite based on celerity htmlunit

1367579
width	margin
i guess under the w3c box model a box having a width of 100px with 2px padding on each side a 3px border and 7px margin on each side will have a visible width of 114px

1367579
width	height
not 124 as w3c excludes the padding and border from the width height of an element

1367609
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

post	get
if you want to post to the server use jquery s ajax get post method s

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i ve got the jquery validation plugin working beautifully in firefox opera safari and ie8

1367711
keydown	keyup
put another way keydown + keyup keypress

1367720
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

1367735
onclick	preventdefault
either live with letting the button look like a button or use onclick and preventdefault on a link

1367741
keydown	keyup
depending on the typing delay settings there can be multiple keydown and keypress events but only one keyup event

1367746
keydown	keyup
the keydown event happened once before the first d appeared on the screen the keypress event happened 6 times and the keyup event happened after the last d appeared on the screen

1367775
keydown	keyup
keypress is a higher level of abstraction than keydown and keyup

1367775
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup are hardware related the actual action of a key on the keyboard

1367865
keydown	keyup
notice that keypress occurs in between keydown and keyup not after keyup as many of the other answers have stated that keypress is not called when a character isn t generated and that keydown is repeated while the key is held down also contrary to many of the other answers

1367865
keydown	keyup
for the curious keydown roughly correlates to wm_keydown keypress to wm_char and keyup to wm_keyup

1367870
tapestry	wicket

if absolute performance is key and if you are just checking for int not floating point numbers i suspect that iterating over each chars in the string returning false if you encounter something not in the range 0-9 will be fastest

with regards to performance if your biggest bottleneck is the difference between chars 1 and int then i salute your tuning prowess

1369968
try-catch	exception-handling
now i want to catch the exception-handling that opening this file could cause and this is fairly high risk code in that it can fail due to the environment but if i write try-catch inside would that not be repetition

1369968
try-catch	exception-handling
however i would want to catch the exception-handling opening a file can cause so i should wrap the try-catch outside the using statement s scope and also the exception-handling for whatever i do inside the using block so i should add the try-catch inside the block

awt	swing
you can then draw this information with awt swing or whatever you like

1370092

inside set_values you can use the members width and height and they would be the members of the object whose set_values was called

1371201
width	height
on the other hand you cannot use identifiers width or height by themselves inside duplicate because it is not a member function and therefore it does not have the implicit parameter i

if you have a display inline parent element and if this parent has a child that is display block then the existence of that child seems to make the parent nearly behave like display block and ignore the fact that it s defined as display inline in that the parent now contains nothing but anonymous and non-anonymous block children it no longer contains any inline children

1371353

but i cannot work out where to put the function when i put it under the node i get an error saying xsl function cannot be a child of the xsl stylesheet element

and if i put it under the node i get a similar error

1371669

on request i have implemented support for moving an os x window by dragging it using an area within the content part of the window i.e replicating the drag and move functionality of the title bar but in another area

1372011
move	drag
the problem i have yet to resolve is the fact that if the user drag the mouse quickly it can leave the window area and then no more mouse move events are received

1372079
width	height
you will also want to set the autoshow false visible width and height properties and change the windowstyle property to make it a child window

1372083

1372503
width	height

1372532
collabnet	svn
i would suggest using svn server on a separate machine either visualsvn as suggested before or collabnet subversion server and tortoisesvn with jvcl integration expert also as suggested before

1372535

otherwise scale source height to fit the destination height and scale width by the same ratio

1373059
integer	fractions
this takes advantage of the fact that date time columns in excel are just numbers integer portion is the date fractions portion is the time

1373072
width	height
another option might be to scale to maximum width and then check if the scaled height is greater then the maximum allowed height and if so scale by height or vice versa

1373078
subtract	add
sometimes i ve also seen a calculator web service as the hello world example where you support various operations like add subtract et cetera

this attempt fails in the above example the securitymanager check in classloader s constructor throws a security exception but the attacker simply ignores any exception and waits for the virtual machine to perform finalization on the partially initialized object

1373421
mkmapview	mapkit
as well as my question removing mkmapview annotations causes leaks. i have discovered that if you create a view based project add a uisearchbar and mkmapview into the view s nib wire up the delegates i m not creating any methods as we don t actually need to do anything to trigger the leaks link in the mapkit and fire up the project then simply clicking in the uisearchbar causes a 1k+ leak

there are times where i want to declare a new object of the inherited type and call methods on the base class with the base class knowing inherited type it is working with and the most logical choice would be to use the discriminator properties

1373518

when i added serializable i run into the problem that after deserialization the mconnection will sometimes have an empty string and sometimes will have the ip address that was serializable

1373720

1374168
superclass	subclassing
if i have two classes subclassing and superclass

1374171
width	height
it appears that if i want to set a maximum width of a form then i have to set a maximum height as well

1374220
superclass	subclassing
for example what if the type of the superclass constructor parameter was different to the parameter type in the subclassing

1374274
boost	stl
this is a part of the boost library though and not stl so it may not be available on your particular platform

1374291
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

1374340
width	height
if you are unfamiliar with what this line is doing it is responsible for ensuring that the user s default printer is set up to print whatever is provided to it in landscape mode and also provides landscape orientation dimensions height width on the printer object so following code can properly base item placement coordinates on the page

1374346
iprincipal	iidentity
first have a look at the definitions of iidentity and iprincipal

1374346
iprincipal	iidentity
they ve chosen to implement an additional property called role on their implementation of iidentity sampleiidentity and then they ve used it from their implementation of iprincipal

1374355
powerpc	i386
this would be doable on i386 and not really on powerpc

1374382
width	height
if by collapse you mean hide this will work by setting the height and width on tgrid1 and grid2 to 0

1374386
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve had trouble with attribute selectors in firefox once or twice so if you ve only tested in firefox check google-chrome ie safari opera etc

1374394
client-side	server-side
everyone has focused on server-side client-side but in truth we don t know why you are asking this question and it s important

1374419
bluetooth	usb
nokia series60 devices should have a javax.microedition.io.commconnection that would allow the use of usb infrared and or bluetooth comm ports via the generic gcf api

1374448
http.sys	httplistener
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener

1374448
http.sys	httplistener
you can t do streaming with httplistener but you can do that with http.sys - question about httplistener streaming

1374463
gridex	janus
they will save you time very quickly - some like janus gridex control costs relatively little a few hundred quid and will save you hours - which if you work in a commercial environment can translate to much more than the cost of the control

1374467
button	checkbox
i m trying to iterate over checkbox in an asp.net web page and if any of the checkbox are checked then i want to enable the button on the page but if none are checked i want to disable the button

1374594
mouse	keyboard
unplug the keyboard and mouse and lock them up in a cabinet

1374614
superclass	subclassing
the reason is when you define parameterised constructor in subclassing you want to override something from superclass

1374619
superclass	subclassing
what bothers me more is when i have a superclass a with two subclassing b and c and b and c both require the same 10 constructors with a bunch of parameters

1374619
inherited	subclassing
if i can write an ordinary function in a class that is inherited by its subclassing why can t i write a constructor

1374694
postgresql	mysql
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

1374768
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
the amount of physical ram in your box does not directly correlate to how much memory you can allocate with calloc malloc realloc

1374811
superclass	subclassing
the concrete class compiles fine because b extends a and since java 5 a return type on a subclassing can be a subclassing of the return type on the superclass

1374908
cat	tee
another way is to use cat and tee as follows

1374914
width	height
i m not really interested in the merits of this approach but rather wish to understand why jquery seems to be unable to get the width and height as defined in the css for a anchor in safari

1374914

1375003
distance	altitude
does postgres spatial plugin or any spatial package for that manner factor in the altitude when calculating the distance between 2 points

1375003
distance	altitude
also keep in mind that if i have 2 points are at the same ocean altitude but a mountain exists between the 2 points - the distance package should account for this

1375012
msisdn	sms
for example we send large numbers of sms using a 3rd-party aggregator service and each sms has an originator field which can be a phone number specifically a msisdn or a text value

1375036
rss	feed
as there was no obvious way of sharing map data from the map page itself i thought maybe i could pull the location data out of the rss feed

1375043
int	double
i hesitate to even suggest this but you might consider runtime checks against the type of t in the method and throw if t is not an int long short float or double

1375045
post	get
you could have pagename.html resubmit as post via ajax if it s loaded as a get request though

1375061
distance	altitude
if the distance formula you re using does not take the altitude of the two points as parameters in addition to the latitudes and longitudes of the two points then it does not factor in altitude to the distance calculation

1375061
distance	altitude
in any event altitude difference does not have a very significant effect on calculated distance

1375061
distance	altitude
as usual with gps the difference in distance calculations that altitude would make is probably smaller than the error in most commercial gps devices anyway so in most applications altitude can be safely dispensed with altitude measurements themselves are pretty inaccurate with commercial gps devices although survey data on altitudes is quite accurate

1375088
ironruby	ironpython
as for dynamic - it doesn t really help in this case unless you fancy letting your users write code in ironpython ironruby

1375105
nspanel	nsmatrix
now i want the nspanel object which contains this nsmatrix to resize to wrap nicely around it

1375105
nspanel	nsmatrix
the nspanel also has a button at the bottom which should be under the nsmatrix

1375149
distance	altitude
postgresql does not factor in altitude when calculating distance

1375155
internationalization	translation
i ve found that the simplest approach to internationalization is to simply maintain a list of all the different pieces of text in your application labels buttons form captions etc. in a spreadsheet or tab-delimited file of some sort and then send this file to the translators to add in one additional column for each language all the translation

1375258
arcgis	proj

1375263
cos	sin
cos d r √¢ÀÜ sin lat1 sin lat2

1375265
inherited	properties
then in your inherited form you can either set up an event handler for the execinvoked event you can probably do this using the events list in the properties grid or you can override the onexecinvoked method

1375308
button	checkbox
i was given the code below to disable a button on an asp.net page if none of the checkbox are checked and to enable it if any checkbox get checked

1375400
mouseover	mouseout
the trouble is that the mouseout event of the menu item fires before the mouseover event of the div

1375405
post	get
i would post this under the top answer but apparently this site by design requires that you get 50 reputation points before you can respond in the thread-appropriate location.

1375412
rss	feed
why not use the standard imported sites feature that reads your blog s rss feed

1375419
mouseover	mouseenter
you can use mouseenter instead of mouseover

1375444
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
if it s because trygetvalue doesn t throw an argumentexception but instead throws an argumentnullexception you should be safe in fixing it

1375488
qobject	qwidget
however when looking in the property editor only the qobject and qwidget properties are visible

1375499
rss	feed
this is great for things like atom or rss feed which was the original reason i designed the library

1375591
client-side	server-side
the advantage is that you use standard mechanisms and that you can access them for doing server-side as well as client-side validation

1375605
min	max
i guess i would try a max or min on the two other tables

1375641
int	double
if p is a primitive numeric data type float double int etc it should probably be in lowercase

1375641
int	double
also since it translates to if x and y where int and p were float or double you might not get the answer you expect

1375646
firefox	safari
it works fine on firefox and safari but when i test it in ie the background is being removed

1375710

t make sense from a business perspective but hey... then you can use min or max whichever you prefer

1375747
getter	setter
it actually populates the object using the fields setter getter

1375877
put	get
while i dont think it can be put in the place of the actual start menu search going to thier site and getting involved will probably get you a lot closer to where you want to go

1376046
mbunit	mstest
we had a test project that started out as mbunit v3 gallio but decided to go to mstest

1376046
mbunit	mstest
we took out the gallio mbunit tests and added the reference to the mstest stuff microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework and swapped out the c# attributes to use mstest verbiage testmethod etc but when attempting to run tests visual studio doesn t see the tests at all

1376054
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout do transitions from 0 to 100 but the above will allow you to fade to an arbitrary opacity

1376089
rss	feed
i got the urls from the rss feed but the feed does not include the full text

1376095
pull	push
you need to push state to the client as well as pull state

1376163
for-loop	loops
the other comments about the test in the for-loop looking suspect are probably correct but in addition if you re getting this segfault the first time you try to go into loops then it s possible that you re working with a dictionary that has no entries

1376186
put	get
if i put the list initialization before the class i get

1376230
jobs	cron
i think you can use memcache on other systems and set cron jobs on them tool

1376284
freebsd	linux
this linux computer was followed by a hp ux machine the hp ux followed by a freebsd

1376337
multiplying	add
to calculate the total bytes over a given time interval you should find the index closest to the starting and ending point and multiplying the value of y by the spacing of your x-points and add them all together

1376347
hide	show
jquery to allows the user to go back to an image that they have previously seen and hide the last show div at the bottom

1376358
int	double
how does the serializer know whether it should be an int a string a double or something else .

1376369
post	get
what are the strengths of get over post and vice versa when creating an ajax request

1376375
post	get
you should think about ajax requests like you think about regular form requests and their get and post

1376394
prepare	pdostatement
within pdo use prepare statements the pdostatement object

1376415
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
yum install php-soap for centos or apt-get install php-soap for debian ubuntu etc

1376416
post	get
you should use get and post requests in ajax calls just as you would use get and post requests in normal calls

1376426
int	double
the key and value types are both restricted to the basic .net types bool byte all the int float double guid datetime and string

1376455

look at richfaces or icefaces as libs

1376595
filtering	grouping
the authorize filtering allows you to specified grouping of users that can access a controller or action

1376596
globalization	localization
i d recommend reading the wpf globalization and localization section on msdn since this is usually done a bit differently in wpf than it was in windows forms

1376619
google-chrome	firefox
this appear to work fine too until i reload a page and then the page is all messed up in firefox and in google-chrome if i use any comments like this in css

1376634
fixed-point	fractions
unless you can represent the number ranges you need whole and fractions part using a 16-bit fixed-point number there will be no storage difference between float and 32-bit int

1376635
subtract	add
you can still compare sort add or subtract speeds

1376647
getter	setter
for example can i annotate getter that would be used to get the computed values with persistent instead of fields there would be no corresponding setter or field

1376669
division	modulo
incidentally another old approach is to perform pairs of integer division and modulo operations .

1376684
int	chars
make the two chars a short and drop the last 4 bits which is the same as dividing it by 16 and getting the int part

1376684
division	multiplication
you also have a performance gain in that sinse using bitwise operations is a little bit faster than using multiplication division despite this gain is almost insignificant for actual computers

1376696
winpcap	libpcap
take a look at libpcap winpcap

1376723
osql	bcp
you could use system.diagnostics.process to run the sqlcmd or osql or bcp programs to dump out csv files

1376763
width	height
if you need sizes changed dinamically try to put your content inside a vbox for example of any relative container and use minwidth minheight to set it up otherwise canvas is a component so is whould have width and height properties

1376784
unix	bsd
although the application apis are the same or similar for unix and windows and both implementations are historically based on the same berkeley sockets bsd code the operating system architecture and hence the ways you access low level os functions such as network io are completely different

1376787
children	parent
you can then easily locate arbitrary nodes and find parent and children

1376793
openbsd	linux
i don t know if it will work on all unixes i ve tested linux and openbsd but you can try this instead

1376800
rss	feed
what are good resources if i want to develop rss feed readers for n97 e71 and other symbian phones

1376837
qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
if neither of those help you might investigate how qpushbutton and qtoolbutton are declared to see if that gives you any hints

1376852
width	height
to get the swf width and height in

1376866
sin	sqrt
then let r sqrt -2 log u and return x r sin 2 pi v

1376891
getter	setter
the person class is a simple getter setter each type being of string name address except dateofbirth which is datetime

1376892

this may appear to be a duplicate of this question which asks what√¢ s the difference between sortedlist and sorteddictionary

1376967
ggplot2	lattice
i am trying to plot lattice type data with ggplot2 and then superimpose a normal distribution over the sample data to illustrate how far off normal the underlying data is

1377042
lemmatization	stemming
by the way stemming or lemmatization is the term you re looking for

1377049
stdout	fflush
btw maybe you have to add fflush stdout

1377060
nswindow	nspanel
the origin of an nspanel nswindow frame is always the bottom-left corner it s measured from the screen origin

1377143
pexpect	subprocess
have you considered using pexpect instead of subprocess

1377145

1377167
verilog	vhdl
we sell obufuscators to people designing circuits in vhdl and verilog

1377169
mvp	presenter
the way i have done mvp is to have the presenter have a single method called initialize which takes the view as an argument

1377169
mvp	presenter
one way to think of mvp is that the presenter is manipulating the view through the views interface

1377174
disk	ram
i know others have talked about swap and memory availability and i would recommend that you set up at least a small swap partition ironically even if it s on a ram disk .

1377190
width	height
width 250 height 250 status 1 im

1377246
move	drag
every second time the control size shrinks ie drag the the border one pixel i get a scroll bar on the bottom which can t move at all not even one pixel

1377264
minimum	max
if you only need to know the minimum or max remaining in the stack then esrogs is optimal

1377318
punctuation	words
what has worked best for me is to sanitize and tokenize the addresses get rid of punctuation split things up into words and then just see how many tokens match up

1377377
post	put	post	get	put	get
if not then either add the variables to be sent via post in .send or change the method to get and put your variables in the url

1377384
versioning	upgrade
also because the maintenance release only contains one small change they don t need to go through an extensive uat process whereas if they upgrade to the next normal release which could be several versioning on they would be receiving maybe 30 or 40 product changes that in their risk-averse opinion require extensive uat

1377408
versioning	upgrade
you ll have to put up with supporting multiple versioning of your software because some customers just won t upgrade

1377486
mouse	keyboard
it seems like you re already halfway there to your own custom solution but as an alternate you might want to check out synergy an open source keyboard and mouse extender

1377497
munin	cacti
there are a lot of monitoring tools out there that can be taught how to watch db2 but one of the most versatile and widely used is rrdtool either on its own with a collection of custom db2 scripts or as part of a cacti or munin installation which automates many but not all aspects of working with rrdtool

1377518
g++	gcc
some tools in eclipse need to launch gcc or g++ to generate some sort of info

1377524
width	height
how do i get the width and height of the entire screen in xna

1377593
width	height
this seems to be it just googled for xna screen width height myself

1377641
versioning	upgrade
this is the default from sql 2000 onwards but if you ve upgrade from an older versioning then the old default will still be active

1377652
pypdf	xhtml2pdf
you will also need to install the following modules xhtml2pdf html5lib pypdf with easy_install

1377691
wordpress	joomla
when working with open source project like wordpress drupal joomla i always find in the php pages a syntax like this is an example from drupal

1377749
firefox	safari
i don t know how cross browser compatible it is it works in firefox and safari but you could try this solution

1377750
pull	push
i intend for them to push pull into their individual repository when they complete an assignment or are given a new one

1377762
width	margin
perhaps take the border+background off the input and instead enclose it in a div with border+background and width 100 and set a margin on the input

1377780
width	height
it would only search for .jpg files but for every file i would calculate a hash value over the first 1024 bytes then append the width height and size of the image to it to get a string like 875234 640 480 13286 which i would use as key for the image

1377861
javadb	hsqldb
if not you could either use the javadb or hsqldb and the use sql scripts to create the database

1377868
hide	show
those tools would show the php tags as just that or even hide them completely

1377871
google-chrome	safari
i m having an issue with the visualization of my site on google-chrome and safari both using webkit rendering engine the site is built upon symfony framework version 1.1 unmaintained version

1377888
hide	show
i want to hide that input and browse button which show when i type

1377895
post	get
if you want to see the code for yourself i suggest you either get reflector and do it yourself which everyone should have already or more simply look in the revision history of this post since there is nothing i can do about that

1377995
post	get
i would suggest checking the value received by php the one in the _request array if that has missing characters check the post or get request that is sent on the wire use firebug or similar

1378013
stdout	stderr
with ipc run i run commands like i would do with system array which is much more secure and i can bind to stdin stdout and stderr separately using variables or callbacks which is very cool when you ll be in situation that you have to pass data to external program from long-running code

1378025
google-chrome	firefox
i have linkbuttons inside table columns and want to display tooltip even if it is disabled..this worked fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8 as ie8 disabled elements don t receive any events i tried this workaround

1378025
google-chrome	firefox
but again ie8 applies the jquery generated code to the table cell as well as the span and so my tooltip generates 2 times making it appear bolder.......i don t want this.this works fine in firefox and google-chrome

1378066
onfocus	onblur
i like to know what the onfocus event is if there will be any when i receive an onblur event in my javascript handler

1378066
onfocus	onblur
so if an onblur event occurs i only want to forward it when i notice that it s not followed by an onfocus event on another textbox in the group

1378078
prepare	execute
prepare statements get cached and the resulting access program similar to an access plan but actually a jvm program is reused the programs for execute statements are not cached

1378092
multiplying	add
if you assume the simple o n√¢¬≤ approach to multiplying a by b then for each bit in a you have to shift b and add it to an accumulator if that bit is one

1378129
ant	maven
i m migrating a medium sized java application s build from ant to maven

1378129
ant	maven
the easiest way would be to call the original ant scripts through the ant plugin but i thought maybe i should look around first for some maven support

1378129
debian	linux
for linux now i think we only have a tar.gz and some bash scripts to start the daemons - a debian rpm package would be much nicer maybe with dependent package definitions too

1378133
versioning	upgrade
if people are running scripts that they do not check or maintain when they upgrade oracle versioning then let them suffer the consequences of that choice

1378151
hide	show
i could also create dozens of loaders one for every image and hide every loader except the one that i want show

1378151

which suggests the error occured during cgxgriduserdragselectrangeimp onlbuttonup which seems a bit odd as i don t think there was a mouse keyboard screen button pressed at the time

1378180
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
if you know that the stream will always contain a bitset don t use an objectoutputstream - and if space is a premium then convert the bitset to a set of bytes where each bit corresponds to a bit in the bitset then write that directly to the underlying stream a fileoutputstream as in your example

1378198
retaincount	dealloc
in dealloc its retaincount goes down by one but it won t be released completely since you now have ownership

pygtk	gio
as important as the toolkit is its underpinnings with pygtk you use glib as well with its filesystem abstractions python module gio that are very important for the linux desktop its high-level cross-desktop functions such as glib.get_user_data_dir and its other application framework tools and gobject and its property and signals model

1378349
tostring	icomparable
instead of adding strings create a class that implements icomparable and overrides tostring

1378366
dictionary	map
if you need to map a 1-n relation and map it as dictionary rather then list then read dictionary based collections

1378399
folder	directory
i ve been developing my first iphone app part-time and would like to start using a more rigorous form of version control than i ve been using over the past four months copying source code folder to another directory and time stamping them

cvs	svn
if you don t like svn i think xcode supports cvs too

1378429
post	get
rather long winded post but this will get you started

1378446
perforce	cvs
i just looked in xcode 3.2 though so it may not be exactly the same and the options for source control integration are subversion cvs and perforce

1378483

opera	google-chrome
ie8 ff3.5 google-chrome 2 opera 9.5 correctly renders these elements without the spacing

1378569
for-loop	loops
assuming loops length is an integral constant expression the most probable outcome it that a good optimizer will recognize both the for-loop and the memset 0

1378686
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1378686
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

1378686
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

1378686
equals	gethashcode
types that override equals must also override gethashcode

1378686

i have read many different post on forums and articles on how to try and get around the en-us problem but i cannot seem to get around it and hope that someone here can help

1378955
folder	directory
you should place your view in the views employment folder of your mvc.net application directory

1378995
ant	maven
the non-dvcs way to handle it is to set up your build process to read the connection strings from separate config file and then preprocess it during the build process in java you could use ant or maven to filter from a properties file i don t know about ms-land

1379024
git-am	git-apply

versioning	upgrade
if management is nervous about changing framework versioning you could upgrade to vs2008 and use c# 3 but still target .net 2.0

1379109
versioning	upgrade
it s always easier to upgrade versioning by versioning than it is to jump several versioning

1379109
versioning	upgrade
upgrade that jumped multiple versioning required a signficantly larger amount of extra code and testing

1379127
ubuntu	centos
the following code works as expected on centos and ubuntu o s but not on red hat

1379163
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
well the file name would be server-side so it shouldn t matter if you use ie6 or firefox or google-chrome or opera

centos	linux
i ve got both red hat enterprise linux and centos boxes here i know they re the same thing

1379197

nunit	typemock
i am just starting to do test driven development and i am wondering the major differences between rhinomock typemock and nunit s built-in mocking

1379275
for-loop	loops
but if i have a loops that needs to some post statement i d use for-loop like this

1379291
for-loop	loops
refer to the other posts - looking at for-loop someone thinks the incrementor is declared within loops

1379303
getter	setter
that said you may want to use getter and or setter methods and use delegates on those

1379308
int	chars
i m not relying on ascii int conversion and am rather using an array of chars

1379311
boost	stl
as to your rationale against boost its templates are an order of a magnitude more flexible than what you can find in stl functional header

1379340
int	chars
about 1 2 of the data is text and the other half is either chars fields or int

1379346

profiling	instrumentation
do some profiling using the instrumentation app found in the same directory as xcode

1379407
nunit	typemock	nunit	moq	moq	typemock
typemock is a commercial product meaning you ll have to pay for it but will allow you to mock concrete objects - unlike rhinomocks nunit moq which can only mock an interface abstract class

1379422
tiff	png
however in the article i believe it explains a way to convert the tiff image to a jpeg or a png which is supported by silverlight

1379436
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation is your friend in this regard and has many excellent profiling tools for finding memory leaks how much memory you re using detailed tracing of what code is running when and so on

1379436
profiling	instrumentation
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters

1379446
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	png
a tiff file is a multi-page format so rendering it is not as simple as a png gif or bmp

1379485
nunit	moq
mocking sharepoint classes is not possible with rhinomock moq nunit etc since i believe they require interfaces to mock objects rather then being able to mock the actual concrete classes

1379497
operands	scalar
they differ in how the operands are evaluated as well as whether or not they operate on arrays or scalar

1379509
gif	png
when you load bitmap from gif png jpg formats they will be opened as an encodedimage anyway and if you do this many times it may beat performance ex 50 seconds to load 14 png from resources to bitmaps on bold avg size 80 kb tuned up to 2 seconds loading into encodedimages

jsr168	jsr286
the two sun specifications in question that we want to duplicate are jsr168 and jsr286

1379607
jsr168	jsr286
also i suspect this question has been caused by a misunderstanding on our part of how the jsr168 jsr286 specification works

1379607
jsr168	jsr286
i think that jsr168 jsr286 is an arcane protocol for communicating some sort of content between separate applications but in the java world that tends to be done by other methods such as soap

1379668
folder	directory
ignore the bin and obj folder for each directory when it comes to commits as well

1379680

gridview	formview	gridview	detailsview	formview	detailsview
for any column in a gridview or field in a formview or field in a detailsview there can only be one templatefield

1379845
for-loop	loops
in the specific case of an infinite loops i might choose a for-loop over a while loops for that reason

1379875
post	get
you can also get the id of the current post being displayed by

1379878
folder	directory
it obviously is looking on the wrong directory cause the project folder is in my desktop

1379902
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
setting the datatemplate s grid s width and height to be larger than the cell with a negative margin can produce a close result but if you resize the column the problem shows itself again

i don t see any sort of log file and no output is written to stdout or stderr

1379973
floating-point	integer
beyond number.max_safe_integer + 1 9007199254740992 the ieee-754 floating-point format can no longer represent every consecutive integer

1379979
for-loop	loops
you might want to use a do-while loops instead of a for-loop so the code is processed at least once before conditions are checked and met or not

1380017
hex	binary
a hash function might be defined to avoid √¢ fixed points√¢ where hash x x but your hash-quine differs a little in that you re taking the string representation in hex of the hash rather than the raw binary

1380064
ready	each
pretty much creating a new instance of the program which will be passed along each user control until the user is ready to submit to the database

1380071
int	boolean
you should also ensure that get_original_passhash is returning the right type of variable - int string boolean etc

1380089
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work fine in google-chrome ie firefox

1380121
django	web2py
once you ve learned web2py you have to be careful learning django that you start fresh with no translation from old concepts to new

1380144
client-side	server-side
a lot of the solutions i ve seen are client-side - i think a server-side solution makes more sense for my needs since i can give feedback to the user if the javascript is invalid and only save it on the server once it s clean

1380153
post	get
many many times on a page i will have to set post and get values in php like this

1380172

pop-up	dialog
pop-up is a dialog extended from a jframe

1380203
pop-up	dialog
i tried using a boolean variable and a loop to check if something was entered in the pop-up but it doesnt work the dialog is desplayed but there is not textfield or ok button so the only thing i can do is to kill it

1380243
cassini	iis
why does the application restart automatically when we create a new folder under a web site in iis 7.0 or cassini

1380273
pop-up	dialog
if possible you should re-implement pop-up to inherit from dialog instead of jframe and call dialog s setmodal true method which will prevent subsequent code from running until the dialog is dismissed

1380290
width	height
for example the list would contain the best data type and size for id ip address email subject summary description content url date timestamp and human readable geo points media height media width media duration etc

1380296
equals	tostring
you ll get 714341252076979100 instead of this number because tostring as described by ecma-262 √¢ 9.8.1 works with powers of ten and in 53 bit precision all these numbers are equals

1380303
children	parent
well i m a little worried about where to put the user controls and the forms children and parent the helpers classes and so on

1380324
post	get
this post talks about boosting the default sample rate of the accelerometer functions so that you can get a pretty fine-grained picture of the user s movements

1380334
pull	push
google was at least initially going to implement a gchat api you could use for a push pull implementation

1380340

int	boolean
as written the boolean conversion will also succeed to convert to any int type

1380369
serializable	deserialization
boost has a very nice serializable deserialization lib boost.serialization

1380390
decltype	auto
and since the inner class here is private no client code can possibly declare a variable of that type auto and decltype in c++0x provide a way though

1380391
union	distinct
solution use union all instead unless you really need the implicit distinct that it forces

1380480
opera	google-chrome
in ie8 opera and google-chrome it works just the way

1380503
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m dealing with uinavigationcontroller in my application all handled by an uitabbarcontroller

1380512
fadein	fadeout
the reason you need to use animate rather then fadein and fadeout is because of a weird bug with fadein fadeout and the hover event

1380566
getter	setter
the three getter and setter are all identical except for the object property they are modifying x y z

1380567
boost	stl
i m already using stl to maintain platform portability and would prefer not to add another library dependency like boost

1380600
post	get
the question is if i design it as above how will i get the uisegmentedcontrol to slide away with the wall view if the user clicks on the comments to a post which pushes the comments view onto the navigation controller s stack

1380601
multiplying	multiplication
second if you you want your multiplication to be correctly rounded as in ieee-754 you will sometimes need the low part of the multiplying in order to deliver the correct rounded result

1380608
rss	feed
also u can once define hooks like generating an rss atom feed for all the operations on particular table

1380650
nsmutablestring	nsstring
that way it can t change out from under you if somebody passes in an nsmutablestring which is valid √¢ it is a kind of nsstring

1380656
gridview	formview
i would suggest using a gridview control with autogeneratecolumns set to true instead of a formview control

1380678
int	double
3.0 is considered a double 3 is considered an int

1380717
sorting	filtering

1380756
bazaar	svn
i would like to run these on a project that is now in a bazaar repo so i was wondering how i could get a copy of the bazaar repo on my machine and then translate it to a svn standard so pysvn can use it

1380756
bazaar	svn
i found some documentation on going svn to bazaar but not the other way around

1380778
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i haven t used it for bazaar but i have used tailor to keep an svn repo in sync with a git repo

1380838
post	get
i m not sure if this is your problem but try changing your type from a post to a get

1380866
filesystems	ntfs
size on disk might be different if you move the file to another filesystems fat16 ntfs ext3 etc

1380883
put	get
what i would do is get firebug and put in the following just before your loop

1380899
min	max
the sql functions max and min

1380919
put	get
to get the arrow in the cell put this in your tableview cellforrowatindexpath method

1380920
integer	fractions
if you want to exactly represent all the possible 3-decimal-place fractions you would be better off using an integer and multiply the values by 1000

1380953
folder	directory
when you run your web application your current or working directory is most likely the bin folder of your application server

1380958
integer	unsigned
numeric id auto_increment primary keys use an unsigned integer

1380970
autofac	castle-windsor
i like autofac because i like the philip k dick reference but castle-windsor is great

1380988
gtk	wnck
import gtk wnck

1380989
put	get
if not tweak it until you get the appropriate behavior and put the new expression in the linq statement

1381066
vtk	paraview
there are other packages built on top of this such as mayavi and paraview but the vtk wrappers alone are often easier to use

1381118
hash	md5
how could i create a trigger that at any insertion on my table users will change automatically the content of its password field to its md5 hash

1381136
children	parent
so you would have the parent run a loop to fork off 10 processes and in the children you do whatever you wanted to do concurrently

1381164
hash	salt
the garbage prepended to the passwordproxy is a salt to avoid the rainbow attack mentioned it will make your password hash different from just hashing the base string

1381175
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have the following drop down menu and the background looks black in google-chrome but white on firefox ie safari across windows linux mac

1381184
hash	md5
it replaces the default insert with something you define for example an md5 hash of one of the inserted columns

1381187
children	parent
i have a parent children classes as follows

1381200
background-color	transparency
why are you using background-color transparency

1381201
serializable	deserialization
most languages not sure about c# give you some way to read and write raw bytes so do all of the serializable deserialization memberwise instead of a singular memory block and the packing padding problems go away

1381227
hash	salt
if you use safe hash function see hash function and hash algos in php documentation it should be pretty safe you may consider using salt hash and also add some protections to the form itself

1381233
bazaar	svn
you can use bzr-svn plugin to push bazaar branch into svn repo

1381309
put	get
to get the installer to put entries under hklm the installation has to be marked as permachine the default seems to be peruser as done below

1381326
int	boolean
is a struct containing a boolean hasvalue and an int

1381327
int	boolean
i m not 100 sure but i believe it should be 8 bytes 4 bytes for the int32 and since every thing has to be 4-byte aligned on a 32 bit machine 4 bytes for a boolean indicating whether the int value has been specified or not

1381334
postgresql	informix
i have done simple python utilities that shows schema info for informix oracle and postgresql

1381340
put	get
the closest you could get it to use codedom to generate some code - you ll need to produce a wrapper module and a function with return then put the expression from the database into that return - compile it and check for compile errors run it and see the result

1381346
rss	feed
i have a website which fetches information from rss feed periodically well currently manually and this is my problem

1381376
division	multiplication
multiplication and division of decimals will result in a decimal that has a scaling factor that is the sum of the scaling factors of the two decimal operands

1381377
x86	64bit
agree with previous commenter that this is probably something you don t want to do but for me setting a conditional breakpoint at the last instruction on eax or rax if you are on 64bit x86 works just fine

1381386
opera	firefox
edit havenard made me realize i was typing the wrong characters because my browser opera was displaying them badly so now i m using firefox to edit this question and hopefully it ll be clear

1381393
getter	setter
if your getter and setter are a carryover in practice from something like java then do not write them

1381393
getter	setter
on the theme of getter and setter in python the general consensus as i understand it is don t write em til you need em. only write setter and getter if they actually add value to your program like protecting an internal data structure perhaps

1381441
client-side	server-side
you might think of the field as an analogy to javascript validation - we might do a quick client-side check for the user s convenience but we still do a proper server-side test and enforce it for all requests

1381448
hash	md5
i ve got an old application that has user passwords stored in the database with an md5 hash

1381448
hash	md5
the first time the user authenticates after this replace the md5 password hash with the sha password hash and set the flag

1381448
hash	md5
the first time the user authenticates after this hash the password with sha and store it in the new field probably delete their md5 hash at the same time

1381454
versioning	upgrade
currently the easiest solution if you have a 32-bit intel processor is to upgrade to snow leopard which includes 32-bit and 64-bit versioning of java 6

1381464
hash	md5
there s no way to reverse the md5 so you have to wait for the user to authenticate again to create a new hash

1381481
opera	firefox
on the page linked to by the answer to my previous related question it states for firefox and opera a simple check of event type will determine if it is domcontentloaded

1381481
setinterval	settimeout
safari and ie will check against the document√¢ s ready state....finally in case all else fails the onload event will bring up the rear. perhaps a setinterval similar to my settimeout above could be the penultimate course of action before relying on onload as a last resort

1381485
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
hashtype is either sha1 or md5 salt is a random string used to salt the raw password and at last comes the hash itself

1381493
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
for that simply install some linux distro ubuntu or centos for example and play with it for a while to learn the libraries and apis

1381530
hide	show
if a user picks usa then a state dropdown list is below it if any other country is selected then it will show a different text input box and hide the dropdown list

1381574
versioning	upgrade
alternatively you can recommend that you don t have to upgrade frameworks just because there s a new versioning out or because the framework is no longer being maintained

1381589
versioning	upgrade
if ci comes out with a newer versioning i have to go back and upgrade multiple apps

1381612
exponent	modulo
the rsa encryption algorithm is based on the fact that if you have two publicly known numbers which are two parts of one public key the exponent e and the modulo n then given a message m it is easy to compute c m e mod n

tried using both post and get data

1381683
jar	war
and i added the jar to the web-inf lib and make the war all this with maven and deploy in tomcat and it works also i deploy it in websphere 7 and also works

1381684
accessor	properties
you can hide the internal memory optimizations behind your properties accessor and the xmlserializer wouldn t even know

1381720
move	drag
but basically you would want to click and drag elements right to make the page move to the next page

1381739
mouse	keyboard
however every time my program executes the java program a java window is created in my dock with an annoying animation and most importantly steals the focus of my mouse and keyboard

1381785
filesystems	ntfs
these documents are stored on a windows server with ntfs filesystems

1381826
temporary	tablespace
they are not cached in memory they are written to the temporary tablespace

1381864
jar	manifest.mf
the classpath set in the manifest.mf file in the jar that you build must specify the classpath for finding all related jars on the remote machine - you have to find where that jar is installed and then add that path to the manifest classpath

1381865
tstringlist	tlist
do everything above the same way except use a tlist instead of tstringlist

i would convert the two dates in julian day and then do the difference but i would have to check if this is a good solution with no drawbacks first

1381875
opera	firefox
if you want it for yourself then use opera has them built-in very well implemented and integrated with fast forward which guesses next page on most sites add extension to firefox search for mouse gestures - few options are available or install system-wide gestures xgestures for os x stroke-it for windows

1381877
onclick	onsubmit
in my case i had a button with an onclick event so i moved the function call with the added return keyword to the onsubmit event

1381895
single-quotes	double-quotes
the lookaheads assert that if there are any double-quotes single-quotes or parentheses ahead of the current match position there s an even number of them and the parens are in balanced pairs no nesting allowed

1381921
perforce	svn
practical perforce the red bean book svn eric sink s blog vault etc all have good insights

1381982
onclick	onchange
onenter and ongotfocus seem to be too early and onchange won t fire just for clicking a link but the control s onclick event might do the trick

1381983
hide	show
if a user selects usa then it will show the usa state list and hide the other state text input

1381983
hide	show
if a user selects a country other then the usa then it should hide the usa state list and show the state input text box

1381983
hide	show
however if you select the usa it will show the state dropdown list which is great but it fails to hide the state text input box

1382010

put	get
basic operations get and put

1382116
put	get	folder	directory
3 is there a way to put the htaccess file in a higher directory from the uploads folder so it can t get overwritten my some ne erdowell while it s in the uploads folder

1382116
folder	directory
i only want it to affect the uploads folder not the directory in which it s placed though

1382157
put	get
the next one is 1 query that would get you the whole results set and put the comment s order in all rows so you could then just check the first row s relevantcommentorder field inside php and then slice the array so it d display only relevant comments this one is only efficient if the whole results set is not too big

1382164
hide	show
your selection method clicking images seems ok as you d detect which image is clicked and show hide the corresponding panels

1382200
put	get	folder	directory
your customers appear to have their directory structure enforced -by you- but finding things that they did last week is easier if they only have to traverse the date remembering where they put something last week when they get to the six-digit unique number-named folder is going to be well difficult

1382215
prepare	execute
how do you hash the password while using pdo prepare and pdo execute

1382231
hash	md5
if you wanted to hash using md5 you could do the following with the password before constructing the sql statement

1382245
x86	64bit
if the application you are trying to use to connect to oracle installs into the c program files x86 path on 64bit machine you will have to change the install path to something that doesn t have the in it like c program files_x86 due to a known bug in the oracle drivers that has yet to be fixed to my knowledge

1382318
post	get
i know there were similar post but i still do not get it

1382319
mp3	ogg	mp3	flac	flac	ogg
i know formats such as mp3 ogg and flac have tags such as artist album etc

1382323
width	height
setting the css of an anchor that has nothing to do with the presentation of the anchor seems kind of backwards just set it in the javascript to look for a.popup.large and set a certain width height for the popup

1382323
width	height
else look for a.popup and set a different height and width

1382330
unsigned	short
bcc32 error unit1.cpp 830 e2357 reference initialized with unsigned short needs lvalue of type char

1382330
unsigned	short
but key in somefunc1 is instead a word which i understand to be a typedef for unsigned short

1382330
unsigned	short
it seems to me that your c-style remedy is brutally reinterpreting which is the address of an unsigned short as the address of a char

1382337
hash	md5
1 create a new field in the users table that stores an md5 hash

1382340
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
give the special cookie a name like autologin and a value that contains their username and a salt md5 hash of their user data

1382340
hash	md5
split off the username and hash then fetch the account out of the database based on the username and re-do the md5 to compare to the cookie hash data

1382346
flac	ogg
ogg vorbis be careful to point out vorbis and flac share a tagging format called vorbis comments

unfortunately there are no global variables in pl pgsql although you can find ones in other pl languages that come with postgresql specifically in pl perl pl python and pl tcl

1382432
maven	buildr	ant	maven	ant	buildr
what s the point of using ant maven and buildr

1382476
width	height
it would involve inserting an empty div in the main text and giving it a set width and height then placing the post-it over that same location with absolute positioning

1382476
width	height
dynamically determining the width height of the empty-div so that it matches that of the post-it can be pretty easily done with javascript

1382504
put	get
sometimes there is no convenient way to get the literal into the right type so you have to use a static_cast or put a constructor around the literal

1382520
cos	sin
basically calculate the circle as the x y cos a sin a and then multiple this both terms by a radius that s the appropriate function of the angle

1382522

1382537
width	height	qgraphicsview	qmainwindow
my qmainwindow contains a qgraphicsview which should ve minimum width and height

1382553
jquery	scriptaculous
i don t know about jquery but scriptaculous definitely doesn t support this

1382558
hash	salt
if the underlying vulnerability must be fixed then it is necessary to treat the submitted hash as a password in clear text which should then be hash with a salt preferably before comparison with a stored hash

1382576
solaris	bsd
- i d focus instead on whatever else the scripts the candidate will produce or maintain if hired are supposed to do -- linux kernel and sysadm issues or maybe windows or bsd or solaris ones -- or release engineering concepts version control systems distributed or otherwise bioinformatics.

1382636
x86	mips
do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set

1382649
subtract	add
one sensible way to handle this would be to compute internally with ordinary numbers which go from positive to negative at zero and only add subtract 100 for presentation

1382781
cos	sin
sin x+y sin x cos y + cos x sin y

1382781
cos	sin
cos x+y cos x cos y - sin x sin y

1382781
cos	sin
you can compute sin n x cos n x for n 0 1 2 .

1382781
cos	sin
iteratively from sin n-1 x cos n-1 x and the constants sin x cos x with 4 multiplications

1382781
cos	sin
of course that only works if you have to evaluate sin x cos x on an arithmetic sequence

1382859
ant	maven
netbeans nativly uses ant as its underlying build tool and recently can directly open maven projects in netbeans

1382859
ant	maven
hence your typical netbeans project can be compiled with ant and your maven project already is a netbeans project

1382859
ant	maven
using ant or maven means that every one can choose his her own ide to work one the code

1382859
ant	maven
in case of netbeans ant or maven is used so you can get all the advantages and disadvantages of those

1382859
ant	maven
as for the build tools themselves maven is significantly different from ant

1382895
svg	vml
if you don t mind using javascript check out cufon which uses svg vml to render whatever font in most web browsers used today even ie6

1382909
getter	setter
i thought of subclassing the unit class and overriding the getter and setter but that seems too messy

1382911
touchesbegan	touchesended
this class has its own implementations of touchesbegan touchesended etc

1382915
button	right-align
i have a very simple wpf window - the only thing in it is a right-align button

1382918
trie	tree
if you don t want to use a trie you could either use a hash table or some kind of binary tree

1382969
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox 3.5 opera 10 and safari are expected to support css3 style font-embedding using ttf fonts google-chrome does not feature safari s support for css3 font embedding for some reason

1382969

other browsers but not chrome apparently will try to use the eot then fallback to the ttf rendering

1382993
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	informix
microsoft sql server oracle informix mysql postgresql sybase will all handle this situation easily

i want to fill a text field of a http form through java and then want to click on the submit button through java so as to get the page source of the document returned after submission the form

1383104
serializable	deserialization
the easiest way of fixing this is to patch the nsdate sqlpersistence category defined by sqlite persistent objects in nsdate-sqlitepersistence.m to include the timezone in the format string yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss.ssss z during serializable and deserialization

1383163
post	get
for more details see sending arguments with get post methods

1383164

internally date times are represented as a double where the signed int part is the number of days since december 30th 1899 and the fractions part is the unsigned offset of hours within the day

1383228
ubuntu	linux
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

1383230
int	chars
one trick is to use string.format which seamlessly converts between an int and its chars counterpart you can also use casts.

1383235
subtract	add
obviously you can add what a standard html page needs or subtract if already provided

1383254
stdout	stderr
i can t figure out how to log info-level messages to stdout but everything else to stderr

1383284
free	malloc
it does make a single malloc call but in my case i simply replaced this with a stub that returned a pointer to a static block and a corresponding free stub

1383355
cos	sin
static class may be considered a bunch of methods - you would use it if you just need to group some methods sample usage mathhelpers with methods like sin cos convertxtoy or to host extension methods

1383365
temp	tmp
c temp log1.py tmp

1383365
temp	tmp

assuming you use a decent source-control system this scheme will allow you to easily upgrade to newer versioning of third-party libraries and then merge those changes with the changes you ve made locally

1383450
int	chars
i wanted to ask whether the following statement where printf has been provided with a type int where it expected a type chars will invoke undefined behaviour

1383473
children	parent
first-child and last-child retrieve the list items if they are the first last children of their immediate parent

1383493
int	double	int	chars
variable arguments are subject to the default argument promotion eg chars will be promoted to int float to double that s the reason why you only have a single format specifier to print both single and double precision floating point values

1383493
int	chars
so passing an int instead of a chars is perfectly valid and even desirable as chars literals are of type int anyway

1383493
int	chars
according to the c99 spec section 7.19.6.1 √¢ 8 on seeing the conversion specifier c printf expects an argument of type int and will then go on and cast this value to unsigned chars

1383514
twitter	bit.ly
you can use bit.ly twitter uses this

1383528
mouse	trackpad
using touchesbeganwithevent touchesendedwithevent etc you can get the touch data from the multitouch trackpad but is there a way to block that touch data from moving the mouse activating the system-wide gestures similar to what is done in the chinese text input

1383560
put	get
the unfortunate truth is that no matter what barricade you put in the way if the honestly want in they ll get in

width	height
when you set the minimum width and height of your graphics view it sets a flag somewhere that the window the graphics view is in needs re-layed out

1383584
client-side	server-side
see this tutorial that explains how to implement it with both a client-side and server-side version of the validation

1383585
n-gram	words
you could expand any of the algorithms to look at higher-order n-gram for example two or three words sequences or other features in the text

1383607
public	protected
as you may have heard some suggest putting public members of classes first and private protected ones after

1383642
clang	llvm
i m using llvm with clang

1383642
nsstring	nsdata
the same problem appears with nsstring instead of nsdata

1383651
strlen	strncpy
instead since you calculate the strlen s of the individual strings anyway put them in variables and then just strncpy twice

1383788
getter	setter
the property must be public and have a getter and setter to be serialized

1383823
post	put	post	get	put	get
i received a post on the kvm news group on the topic that states there is a bug in the jadtool and the author claims to have filed a bug report and posted a patch l kvm-interest f s p 9858 one interesting note that was also posted was that the cert jad params are static so once you get them from the wtk correctly you can put them statically in the ant script.

1383843
actionlistener	focuslistener
what you want is a focuslistener not an actionlistener

1383949
aggregate-functions	sum
but your query doesn t have any aggregate-functions like sum or count

1383968

for bottom-right alignment for example you could set the x position to the width of the manager minus the width of the field and the y position to the height of the manager minus the height of the field

1383970
free	malloc
then i added a malloc and free inside the loop

1383970
printf	strlen	free	malloc
so malloc + strlen + free do not dominate the profile enough to make avoiding printf worth while

1384011
put	get
insert in the database the information about the module and about that top section of the template you should totally create a table in the database about template structure so the system can know where to put every module related with every page and just use the system to get the module needed in every page request to the right position making it load its own view s into that place

1384023
portrait	landscape
all previous view should be in portrait mode only the last image displaying view controller should be in landscape mode

g++	gcc
i need to implement a simple graphical message box for a linux sdl application similar to the windows messagebox in c++ gcc g++ 4.4.0

1384128
vb.net	vb6
so to clear things up a bit both vb6 and vb.net are dialects of the visual basic language family let√¢ s call it that

1384128
vb.net	vb6
the differences between vb and vb.net are even bigger by some metrics because no complete vb6 code is valid vb.net

1384128
vb.net	vb6
saying like kibbee that the compilers of vb6 and vb.net are √¢ ≈ìbasically the same√¢ is flat out wrong

1384128
vb.net	vb6
let me sum up the main point of this rather long posting so it doesn√¢ t get lost just like java and javascript vb6 and vb.net have very similar names and for very much the same reason too marketing but this is entirely misleading

1384142

1384208
hide	show
i am wanting to use jquery to do a show hide of a div from a text link

1384208
hide	show
for making it generic it could be where i assign a div that is show hidden with an id like id toggle-hide-1 and just change the numbers in my page to make it a different show hide area

1384208
hide	show
i could just name the id using a name that will make the function show hide a div and to seperate it from other divs that show hide on a page i could add a number to it

1384208
hide	show
below is partial code that will do a show hide of a div on a link click but is not exactly what i need

1384236
hash	md5
i have a field in my users table called session_key varchar 255 in which i store the users ip address hash with md5

1384236
hash	md5
when they login and if they have checked a checkbox named autologin it will store their md5 hash ip address in field session_key

1384240
vb.net	vb6
however vs does have a tool for converting vb6 to vb.net

1384240

1384291
gtk	fltk
fltk gtk and qt support opengl widgets in a portable way

1384291
gtk	cairo
it s also worth pointing out that cairo has an opengl backend and there are a number of toolkits that depend on it including gtk

1384298
put	get
because this location will be exactly the same as the uri of the put request except that it should be a get request is that okay

1384369
selecteditem	selectedindex
i did a test where i temporarily replaced the view model selecteditem property with a selectedindex property and i bound that to the listbox.selectedindex property

1384440

opensymphony	webwork
i inherited somebody else s code and it uses opensymphony webwork which i ve never encountered before

1389188
ubuntu	debian
see here for a debian ubuntu description

1389248
webrat	cucumber
sudo gem install cucumber will install the cucumber gem but will also install its dependencies such as the webrat gem

1389252
multiplying	add
multiplying hours with 60 and add minutes

1389253
spweb	spsite
then i have dispose all my spweb and spsite object that i have used in user control but still login process is not wotking

1389267
ceil	floor
you can use the c# floor and ceil method of the math class

1389300
wordpress	joomla
personally i guess a combination of a blogging tool joomla wordpress with developer related plugins - syntax highlighting - calendar project management plugin with a wiki will be best for me .

1389323
tabcontrol	tabitem
presumably this indeed important tip originates from karl shifflets blog at least he s addressing the same topic wpf validation errors disappear inside tabcontrol when switching tabitem

1389334
colorbox	thickbox
with jquery you can try thickbox and colorbox

1389350
lan	intranet
is there any open source code or free software is available for intranet lan messenger near to

1389363
x86	64bit
the programfiles x86 environment variable only exists in 64bit os versions

1389384
ant	maven
i m running an ant task that runs a junit test from within maven using maven-antrun-plugin

1389384
ant	maven
it looks like maven does some magic or invokes ant in another way

1389413
folder	directory
it ads some exception handling overhead but how many users will create custom folder in the installation directory with the fake resource named exactly as localization file

1389441
gtk	motif
whether you use motif or gtk or qt is irrelevant since the close box belongs to the wm not your application

1389489
onclick	onmousedown
previously instead of using the onmousedown event handler we had the onclick event

1389522
zoo	xts
both zoo and the newer and also highly-recommended xts package can use posixt and especially the compact posixct type for indexing

1389523
folder	directory
given how costly in time it is in some source code control systems to move files between directory i would consider starting of just using msdev folder until you are clear on the structure you want

1389574
disk	ram
so you will experience a certain delay when the first request comes in - how much that is really hard to quantify and depends on your hardware mostly disk speed available ram

1389579
getter	setter
synthesizing a property only creates getter and setter methods and therefor won t release the ivar when the object is deallocated

1389613
post	get
this is known as the prg post redirect get pattern

1389623
ant	maven
i ve included two examples to demonstrate an ant failure causing a maven build failure

1389623
ant	maven
this trivial example shows that an ant failure will cause a maven build to fail

1389676
gridview	onclientclick
being a web forms n00b i don t know what s special about a gridview or this use case that makes it behave differently sets up an onclientclick handler to handle the click without a page load

1389698
prepare	execute
whenever you execute a sql query it has to be compiled into a prepare statement

1389699
metaclass	subclassing
subclassing modelbase to use your own metaclass

1389716
children	parent
it seems bad to me as the state of the parent is it s children

1389716
children	parent
the second way seems more reasonable to me because if you need to reject some children parent can t have some types of children or need to do some actions when you are getting new children like prepare a bedroom or buy some toys you ll be have to call all this from your child class

1389889
google-chrome	firefox
using the vb code provided here btw i could open that page only from ie7 not from firefox 3.5 nor google-chrome 2 i wrote following function

1389928
wxpython	pyglet
again i d prefer to stay in 64-bit mode but if nothing works i ll switch to 32-bit and try wxpython or pyglet again

1389937
ant	maven
of course this could be done within an ide but afaik only by invoking something like ant or maven to handle all the build steps

1389962
aggregate-functions	sum
sum can be replaced by any other aggregate-functions

1389973
postgresql	mysql
i never tried on any unix but i think that postgresql or mysql should be more mature

1389993
haskell	sml
functional languages like sml and haskell lack arrays just like lambda calculus and these are actually useful languages

1390025
postgresql	mysql
sql database - you may use interface to some of dbms like mysql postgresql etc. but it s only good for larger amount of data thousands of records

1390035
pexpect	subprocess
to avoid the many problems that can always arise with buffering for tasks such as getting the subprocess s output to the main process in real time i always recommend using pexpect for all non-windows platform wexpect on windows instead of subprocess when such tasks are desired

1390076
x86	64bit
accidentally i mixed up between 32bit and 64bit library files on my x86 embedded linux system

1390082
getter	setter
in the example module below the getter and setter are generated by adding anonymous subroutines to the symbol table

1390082
getter	setter
after the methods have been created in this manner will the resulting code be functionally equivalent in terms of behavior speed etc. to a module with manually-written getter and setter or does this approach have some sort of inherent liability

1390083
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme etc

1390089
stdout	stderr
file descriptor 0 is stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

1390137
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this combination work well in firefox but not in other browsers like safari google-chrome or internet explorer

1390221
post	get
i just want to use hyperlink and post way not get

1390237
redhat	fedora
i have tested it on fedora core 11 and centos 5.3 community version for redhat enterprise

1390237
opensuse	debian	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	opensuse
another hint for you is that firebird stable is included in ubuntu debian and opensuse

1390248
mouse	keyboard
of course some users use keyboard mouse

1390270
scipy	scikits
you can use scikits audiolab to read in any file supported by libsndfile and then use pylab numpy and scipy to do the processing

1390303
mkmapview	mkannotationview
i m trying to add a pin mkannotation and mkannotationview to my mkmapview and allow the user to drag it around

1390323
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can store the id in the session on the edit get method and put it back in the company object on the edit post method

1390359
post	get
i just want to use hyperlink and post way not get

1390361
glut	pyopengl
i haven t used the wxpython stuff with pyopengl so that s where you might be running into problems but pyopengl also includes glut which both run fine

1390383
entities	entitymanager
instead many applications create a layer of data access objects--separate from the entities--that use entitymanager instances to query load and save entities

1390384
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works well in ie firefox and opera but i can t make it going in google-chrome safari

1390422
int	chars
in short when int is 4 bytes long adding 1 to a pointer will actually add 4 to it so it s better to cast any pointer to chars before doing calculations

1390424
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome but not ie 8

1390438
int	chars
you are mixing pointers of different types pointer arithmetic relies on the pointer type int + 1 and chars + 1 have different results because int and chars have a different size

1390460
width	height
tabctrl_setitemsize sets the width and height of tabs in a

1390498
stateless	stateful
ad 1 it s used mainly for jpa and stateless stateful local session beans

1390502
getter	setter
with large numbers of attributes there will be a difference in compile time and memory use...both in favor of the generated getter and setter not the manually-written ones

1390511
children	parent
it turns out with the help of microsoft that sqlmetal generates different output than the ide s mslinqtosqlgenerator because the dbml file generated by a tool i created had some relationships defined where the parent could access the children but the children did not define the parent association

1390511
children	parent
if you only have an association from the parent to the children defined and don t have the reverse association defined or the reverse association has a different name then the .net source code for that association will not be generated in either direction

1390548
jar	war
the maven-dependency-plugin unpacks the jar s contents into a specified location in the war project

1390548
folder	directory
that folder is then specified as an external web resources directory for the maven-war-plugin

1390548
folder	directory
the following configuration will unpack the contents of my-resources into the target external-resources directory then include the contents of that folder in the war as if they d been defined in src main resources

1390567
division	multiplication
the same principle applies for multiplication and division especially when change bit widths

1390597
ant	maven
it sounds like an interesting approach but personally i think it is best to manage build dependencies using an external build tool like ant or maven rather than tying your build to an ide

1390597
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
if you use maven and the m2e plugin it will automatically set up eclipse project dependencies when loading the maven pom.xml if those other projects are also in your workspace

1390612
min	max
the statement has been terminated. my field is decimal 11 2 at the table and my max and min values are 1 603 837 393.70 -- -1 688 000 000.00 amount

1390619
int	double
that does not make sense it is like saying operator + may operator on int or double

1390641
post	get
if you do want to append the params using a get statement since the form will default to post you can add a method param

1390645
ati	nvidia
a simpler approach might be to employ cuda nvidia or stream computing ati to harness a gpu s power for image manipulation because these apis are much closer to regular array-based c++ programming

1390652
ant	maven
i wouldn t use plug-in projects personally i would use build tools such as ant maven and others

1390653
maven	m2e
osgi can be made to work alongside maven using additional libraries such as bnd and m2e

1390659
persistent	transient
the reason is because i have some transient attributes that i can t persistent to the database facebook data and when the facebook data is already loaded in memory i don t want to re-query facebook for the data

1390677
daemons	launchd
you could set up an applescript folder action arrgh or use a launchd daemons and the fsevents facility to watch your source code files

1390693
post	get
i remember having to deal with a similar issue a couple years ago i wanted to have an applicationhost use a custom config file and bookmarked this blog post which i used to get me started

1390706
instances	transient
you could make an alternate getter transient non mapped for hibernate that would provide the user instances by looking into your map

1390710
range	max	range	min	min	max
you say my field is decimal 11 2 at the table but this contradicts what you say about the max and min values which aren t within the range of decimal 11 2

1390725
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it seems like a mixed metaphor to be creating a uinavigationcontroller but then not using its usual navigation methods pushviewcontroller animated and popviewcontrolleranimated and instead using the modal methods inherited from uiviewcontroller

1390780
webclient	httpwebrequest
from my investigations the behaviour of the webclient class is the same which is somewhat expected since it appears to only offer a more simple interface to the httpwebrequest

1390780
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
the problem with all this is that once all connections of the httpwebrequest s underlying servicepoint are used up closed by the remote server there will no new ones be opened up

1390789
jar	war
how many times to i have to mention that jar war and ear ant tasks are subtasks of the zip one

1390862
ssl	https
i know that the http rfc specifies not sending the referrer info from https - http but does this also apply to https - https across domains or ssl certs

1390867
min	max
i m making use of q_property s in my project and i m trying to figure out the best way to add some attributes to those properties like min and max value

1390869
folder	directory
this page on latex packages says you ll need to install the .sty file in the latex installation directory my installation of ubuntu seems to be usr share texmf-texlive tex latex or you need to have a copy of the .sty file in each file containing latex source -- in your tex documents folder at the very least

1390905
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
beyond your choice of frameworks for gui-based cross-platform desktop app development of course lie many many other choices of tools and approaches -- but they re less crucial for solo development than they are for effective team cooperation so until teamwork is in prospect for you it won t hurt to use whatever tools you find simplest svn rather than a dvcs i strongly recommend a dvcs such as hg git or bazaar for team use but for a solo developer i guess svn is still quite acceptable and perhaps simpler to install and use

1390934
public	protected
in your case deriveda can t even see staticvar since it s private not protected or public so it doesn t even know there is a staticvar variable in existence

1390953
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
whenever the copy to clipboard button is pressed i want the contents of the clipboard to get copied to the clipboard and work in a cross browser way across internet explorer firefox google-chrome opera etc

1390963
getter	setter
don t use any getter setter or

1390972
google-chrome	firefox
zeroclipboard is another choice and this does appear to work well tested in firefox 3.5 ie 6 and google-chrome

1391020
int	chars
you can choose a variety of types for the code column - a single byte tiny int a small chars field or an int depending on how many values you might need

1391097
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
if you are on a debian-based distribution ie debian ubuntu ... you ll have the apt-get command-line command which allows you to install packages

1391109
kerberos	ldap
how do i implement integrated windows authentication using asp.net kerberos protocol ldap in iis

1391138
ant	maven
i d suggest to use maven to manage your build and distribute your sources maven is widely used and like ant lost of java users programmers have it installed on their computer

1391144
vb6	vba
vba vb6 - 484 chars

1391199
exponent	modulo
for testing purposes i have a set modulo and private exponent that i want to export into rsacryptoserviceprovider

1391209
getter	setter
then use synthesize in someobject s implementation to synthesize the setter getter

1391241
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i had a quick look and it seems there are lots of git mercurial and svn options but no bazaar

1391243
hide	show
i need to show the number of results for a given category and hide any categories that give no results

1391260
ivar	nsmutableset
my other option is to put an ivar on the parent controller either an nswindowcontroller or an nsmutableset of nswindowcontroller s and then watch for the nswindowwillclosenotification in the parent controller and release it in response

1391277
inherited	subclassing
each concrete subclassing of staticinitializer gets it s own static constructor initialisation method but you keep the advantage of having true inherited

1391282
post	get
post get request cookie like it is infected

1391283
implements	extends
one thing i obviously stumbled upon is the fact that i can register multiple components that can be injected of the same type extends same class implements same interface s

1391299
post	get
all i would really need is the post id in question and i could get all the other information

1391299
post	get
aka the post they are viewing. so how would i get this id in the first place

1391299
post	get
basically when viewing a post i want to get its category or title but not while the loop is going

1391313
dictionary	map
a set is like a dictionary or map of key value pairs except that it only stores is a collection of keys without associated values

1391314
ubuntu	linux
what s the easiest way to do this on linux ubuntu

1391324
parentviewcontroller	pushviewcontroller
parentviewcontroller is for the purposes of navigationviewcontrollers and presenting modal view controllers there is no way to set the property without the methods pushviewcontroller or presentmodalviewcontroller

1391324
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the parentviewcontroller is a readonly property can only be read by the uiviewcontroller class and uinavigationcontroller class subclasses of these will not have access to set the property

1391343
std	ostream
this way it works with both std cout and plain cout and ostream is available when including

1391360
firefox	safari
but with firefox 3.5 and latest versions of ie and safari i think the gap is much smaller if there is any

1391395
post	get
the pages i m grabbing can accept post or get requests but it seems to be exiting either way

1391396
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
doing it in a pseudo fashion is simple enough - i know how many touches i have just by using touchesbegan and touchesended but the problem is that only touchesmoved sends events

1391406
post	get
i will try to edit a better program into this post when i get time.

1391411
post	get
how do i use ajax to send post requests to the server instead of get

1391418
post	put
put post in as the first argument to xmlhttp.open assuming you re using pure javascript

1391461
width	height
innerhtml iframe height 600px width 100 noresize noresize

1391467
subtract	add
to access elements on the left or right subtract or add 1 take care at the row boundaries

1391467
subtract	add
to access elements above or below subtract or add the row size in this case 3

1391473
coalesce	isnull
a slightly more concise query though it there a difference between using isnull as opposed to coalesce

1391495
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock
you can store the readwritelock instances in a map keyed on path just make sure that you get concurrent access to the map correct possibly using concurrenthashmap

1391541
zlib	libpng
the libpng zlib combination is just too big

1391543
width	height
do the tags have an explicit height and width

1391543
width	height
if this is not defined the browser does not know the height and width of the image until it s loaded

1391564
getter	setter
so the question is how to synthesize setter getter for class variables in objective-c

1391566
getter	setter
i think the point being said is that use the auto implemented instead of field so that you can change it in the future if in case you need to add logic to getter and setter

1391566
getter	setter
my idea is add a new private variable and add the same x getter and setter

1391567
super	self
if self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil

1391576
getter	setter
also you can put breakpoints on getter and setter but you can t on fields

1391578
multiplying	addition
in addition multiplying the scrolldecay vector by the decay value

1391620
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
store a hash bcrypt or pbkdf2 of the password which has been salt

1391620
hash	salt
non-random salt for password hash

1391631
irc	telnet
try connecting an irc client using telnet and check what mirc does when you use ctrl+k

1391631
irssi	mirc
you re not likely to get a standard cohesive behavior across irc clients...ansi escape codes are processed by more of the old-fare staple unix clients like irssi and mirc sometimes does its own thing

1391657
lxml	beautifulsoup
i ve been trying to use beautifulsoup and lxml thus far to accomplish this task but i m not sure how to handle the two div tags and td tag because they have attributes

1391657
lxml	beautifulsoup
in addition to this i m not sure whether i should rely more on beautifulsoup or lxml or a combination of both

1391724
integer	unsigned
for example you could define that the message sent consists of a 4-byte unsigned integer in network byte order defining how many structures follow and each structure could be a sequence of 4 signed 4-byte integers for the array followed by a single signed 4-byte integer for _data2 also sent in network byte order

1391728
hash	salt
you will want to use a hash preferably sha1 with salt

1391763
post	get
sounds like you really should sit down and read about ajax if you can not figure out how to move from a get to a post

1391801
bindparam	bindvalue
i m just learning pdo but i think you need to use bindvalue not bindparam

1391855
cdr	cons
all this means that √¢ if you wished √¢ you could define lists backwards with car pointing to the next cons cell and cdr pointing to the value

1391880
fgets	strtol	fgets	strtod	strtol	strtod
there s no one best way to deal with this but generally the approach is to read the whole line as text using either fgets or scanf with a sized s conversion specifier which will consume the newline then convert to the target data type using sscanf or strtol or strtod

1391892
cdr	cons
a cons cell is one third of a contract consisting of cons car and cdr with the requirement being that they behave as pairs as others have mentioned

1391900
ubuntu	linux	mouse	keyboard
on linux ubuntu the keyboard and mouse devices are found

1391953
ant	maven
to me there are as many pros as there are cons to using maven vs ant for in-house projects

1391953
ant	maven
you can do anything with maven you can do with ant but where ant doesn t encourage any standards maven strongly suggests you to follow it s structure or it ll be more work

1391953
ant	maven
true some things are a pain to set up with maven that would be easy to do with ant but the end result is almost always something that is easier to build from the perspective of people who just want to check out a project and go

1391977
cvs	svn
the only downside is that due to the licensing you aren t allowed to automate the encoding so i think you aren t supposed to script it into your cvs or svn post-commit

1392016
subtract	add
if angle is outside of 0..pi it s correct in this case to add subtract pi as many times as needed or use function fmod and for 0..pi all is clear

1392020
min	max
these columns would represent things that are common to the entire group like count sum max min etc

1392020
filtering	grouping
it filtering out entire grouping that do not satisfy the predicate in the having clause

1392073
int	double
most of the database operations are writing triples int int double of numbers about 20-50 triples per second

1392074
hide	show
in fact one action might depend on a variety of permissions and the view might hide or show certain options depending on the permission

1392074
hide	show
should i have some kind of permissionset object that the user carries around throughout the web app in session or whatever and the mvc action method would check if that user can use that action and then the view will have some viewdata or whatever where it checks the various permissions to do hide show

1392100
hide	show
in that way only two reflows will occur one when you hide the tile container and other when you finish the element manipulation and you show it again

1392114
width	height
they should scale down to specific height and specific width

1392199
mouse	keyboard
am i must hacke the motherboard buffer that receive the mouse and keyboard coordinates and presses

1392269
getter	setter
just use dynamic and implement the getter and setter to reference static variables from your implementation file

1392355
domxpath	domdocument
you can use domdocument and domxpath for that

1392393
put	get
but if i put back the selected attribute after removing it or to an tag without selected attribute i get the same output

1392400
folder	directory
your as3 class path is pointing at a directory to low in the flashdevelop library folder structure to pick the mx class prototypes

1392480
ubuntu	linux
my tomcat running in linux ubuntu crashes sometimes with a thread dump appended to catalina.out

1392516
put	get
think of the difference between opengl and a game engine like the difference between getting a car building factory where you have to program all the machines yourself to get the desired car s part opengl and having all parts of the car ready for assembly already game engine and only having to put them together maybe change the color here and add a gear there

1392538
vb.net	vb6
this approach was suggested to vb6 developers who were thinking about upgrading to vb.net

1392545
integer	unsigned
with your sample input the resulting value is 0x1c800 - larger than even an unsigned 16-bit integer

1392552
put	get
extractto get the files out of the zip archive to put them somewhere

1392674
firefox	safari
neither firefox 3.5.2 safari 4.0.3 or ie8 shows the amount column below as right aligned

1392794
portrait	landscape
it may seem to work in ie7 but this is because ie7 will remember the users last selection of landscape or portrait in print preview only the browser is re-started

1392864
width	height
getting the mouse coordinates is no problem but i need to determine the width and height of the window in order to calculate the offset for setting the left and top properties

1392864
width	height
is there a way to determine the width and height of a window before showing it calling the show method

1392903
rss	feed
which is the best way to parsing thousand of rss atom feed with rails or javascript jquery

1392932
folder	directory
i am trying to mimic when you right click a project and say new package - the source folder browse give a directory dialog with only those folder which are open projects..

1392951
opera	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and opera its an valid html 4.01 transitional page and the css is also validated wc3 wise that is

1392963
put	get
finally we will execute that nvarchar string and get out put

1392970
google-chrome	firefox
seems to be independent of user agent we have these exceptions for ie6 7 8 firefox google-chrome

1393021
width	height
perhaps you need to specify the an exact width height of some of your grid containers

1393065
free	malloc
basically it has two main functions malloc and free

1393078
profiler	callgrind
kcachegrind visualize data files generated by callgrind profiler tool

1393210
put	get
which will allow you to get strings from the list but not to put anything in

1393227
google-chrome	firefox
sporadically i see errors in firefox only not in ie or google-chrome when trying to communicate with the embedded flash object

1393236
rss	feed
i currently use feedzirra in a production system that is continuously importing thousands of rss and atom feed

1393277
iboutlet	ibaction
you can then configure it to have three sections and connect up an iboutlet ibaction to it easily too

1393389
getter	setter
in scala when you write a var foo the scala compiler automatically generates a setter called and a getter called foo for it and sets the field as private you ll see it as private if you decompile a class having public scala fields with javap

getter	setter
in your trait you haven t defined a method and for a public field setter and getter always come in pairs

1393389
getter	setter
if you want to have similar behaviour to a var you could do something like this by having explicit setter and getter

1393394
int	double	int	chars
let us assume i have declared the variable i of certain datatype might be int chars float or double .

1393394
int	double	int	chars
note simply consider that i is declared and dont bother if it is an int or chars or float or double datatype

1393394
int	double	int	chars
since i want a generic solution i am simply mentioning that variable i can be of any one of the datatypes namely int chars float or double

1393426
put	get
even if it would be possible to get the value to serialise it it can t be deserialised as there is no way to put the value back in the new object

simple question folks i do a lot of programming professionally and personally in compiled-language like c++ java and in interpreted-language like python javascript

1393883
interpreted-language	compiled-language
i know why compiled-language use static typing most of the time but i can t figure out the aversion to static typing in interpreted-language design

1393920
getter	setter
when i created the proxy class it generated all the getter and setter methods as well as a field

1394005
vb.net	vb6
have a bit of code ported from vb6 to vb.net

1394005

1394287
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the last case is so called nrvo named return-value-optimization

gif	png
select an image jpg gif png from local file system

1394428
submit	submission
further confirming my suspicions about what s going on is that when i simply submit the form without jquery catching the form submission the cart gets saved properly so that when i load the page normally the promo code remains applied

1394467
int	double
we all know that parameterized sql is the way to go when dealing with user input and dynamic sql but is casting from string to int or double or long or whatever as effective if the input you are seeking is numeric

1394479
accessor	properties
setting up your picklist properties as nonatomic retain only applies if you access the properties via a properties accessor as follows

1394648
jquery	scriptaculous
by the way the page is using lightview wich works with prototype and scriptaculous but not jquery

1394651
interpreted-language	compiled-language
maybe it s because one of my main interpreted-language is perl and one of my compiled-language is objective-c but i never strongly felt that there was anything special about compilation vs interpretation that suggested dynamic over static typing

1394653

1396350
hide	show
i seem to keep running into these complex show hide scenarios in asp.net web forms where the logic goes if field a equals blah and field b equals blahblah then field c is show hidden validated whatever. before i run off and start building custom validators and custom controls so i can more easily manage it in markup or backend code are there any libraries or simpler solutions i m missing out there in the wild

i m wanting to read hex numbers from a text file into an unsigned integer so that i can execute machine instructions

1396744
subtraction	addition
the speed of the native addition and subtraction opcodes is irrelevant

1396758
put	get
but if i put 0 1 0 0 only the right to read then i get redirected to and one particular thing that i have noticed is that it doesn t call the app_controller or at least the beforefilter function in the app_controller

1396785
mouseleave	mouseenter
both mouseenter and mouseleave only take one argument but you re defining two callback functions

1396812
int	chars
where the function convert_xdigit_to_int simply converts 0 the chars to 0 an int 1 to 1 2 to 2 .

1396829
strtol	atoi
atoi is obsolete due to the fact that it does not check for errors like strtol does

1396896
folder	dir
maybe you should not put the include file in your web root dir or a sub folder

1397046
subtraction	addition
the way this experiment should be designed is to write 2 different programs - 1 for addition 1 for subtraction

1397046
subtraction	addition
if you wanted to analyze different methods of addition subtraction and looping again each of those should be a separate program

1397046
cpu	processors
experimental error might arise from heat of processors and other activity going on the cpu so i d execute the runs in a variety of patterns.

1397047
cvs	svn
if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs

1397223
children	parent
so while there are no objects being violated in this awkward predicament there is a more natural way of writing addchild statements and that s to add children from parent instead of the other way around because that s the order laid down by the syntax

1397241
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
a nice thing about using json.stringify is that in browser that support native json serializing firefox 3.5 ie 8 nightly builds of safari and google-chrome it will automatically take advantage of the browser-native routines instead of using javascript

1397266
pull	push
in version 1.6.4 git gained the ability to have a remote pull from one url and push to another using the remote.name.pushurl config setting
