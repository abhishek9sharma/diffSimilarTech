this does perform the rotation but i m not sure where to call it as the tab bar controller doesn t call things such as init viewdidload obviously putting it in viewdidappear etc will cause an infinite loop

getter	setter
declaring and synthesizing a property generates getter and setter for the instance variable according to the criteria within the parenthesis

9702358
getter	setter
this is particularly important in objective-c because it is often by way of getter and setter that memory is managed when a value is assigned to an ivar it is by way of the setter that the object assigned is retained and ultimately released

9702370
getter	setter
when you define a property a getter and setter is created for you

9702370
getter	setter
when you access them using object.member setter and getter are called automatically

9702370
getter	setter
when you declare variable in interface setter and getter are not written for you

9702378
getter	setter
they can t be accessed outside the class. important point unless you provide custom getter and setter

9702378
getter	setter
if you make a property then the variable can be read inside the class as well as outside the class..so the setter and getter are generated for you..automatically

int	chars
in c c++ double-quoted expressions are strings or technically string literals and resolve to or type while single-quoted expressions are chars or chars literals and resolve to chars type which can be implicitly casted to int

9702584
int	chars
that explains your error the compiler cannot convert the chars int type to the that the function signature requires

9702695
maven	pom.xml
ranges is generally a bad idea in maven because it is buggy and because maven does not by default deploy the resolved pom.xml files

if maven always deployed resolved pom.xml files ranges would be a good idea

9702734
hide	show
use hide and show

9702760

i think you want to use the rect width and height instead of this width and height

9702767
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i moved the call from viewdidload to viewwillappear and there it works fine

9702767

9703078
width	height
other than wrapping the text in tags you also have to put the label into a container that respects the preferred height and sets the width to maximum

9703078
width	height
the label will occupy the whole width and the height will adjust accordingly to wrap the text

profiler	visualvm
i suggest you take a heap dump with -xx +heapdumponoutofmemoryerror and read this in a profiler visualvm to see why it s using so much memory

for-loop	loops
note that we only do ++t if we don t remove an element and not on every iteration through loops as you did with your for-loop

9705307
uiview	subviews
the topmost element is a custom uiview subclass whose subviews in turn are comprised of the appropriate controls

google-chrome	firefox
it runs ridiculously slow in ie7 but later versions of ie are fine along with firefox and google-chrome

9706158
post	put
for some resources the client needs to be able to assign a relationship to another resource however it seems to me that requiring the client to generate a hyperlink and post put patch whatever this hyperlink into a resource has some drawbacks more complexity for the client security and load balancing concerns etc.

9706257
client-side	server-side
preferably all of this could be specified on the server-side rather than by duplicating code in client-side javascript html

9706293

create an user libs with all the jars placed under the lib folder located in the opencms deployed war and add it to the buildpath

9706551
filesystems	ntfs
the cifs filesystems driver exposes the ntfs filesystems in such a way that you in the worst case can only read files

9706551
filesystems	ntfs
and of course you need to check the acls of the exported ntfs filesystems

9706551
filesystems	ntfs
if this operation is supported by the cifs driver and should work it will still fail if the ntfs filesystems has the wrong owner or a read only bit set

9706553
cos	sin
be sure when specifying the angle that you use radians or degrees as appropriate to the trig library you use to calculate the sin and cos

9706725
typo3	templavoila
i have installed typo3 templavoila and mapped a template

9706735
onclick	onchange
the problem is if i click on button when it s disabled jquery catches the event and prevents the default behaviour to occurs which should release the focus on the input field and trigger the onchange event before the onclick is triggered on the button

9706858
int	chars
with a newtype instance id and id chars are both int but they have different types

9706862

i want to take a back of a directory subdirectories in it say backup from g drive to a drive using perl and archiving and then unarchiving and without disturbing the folder structure in the backup folder

9706886
strlen	realloc
as this is c take a look at realloc - but you will need to also have a parameter for the old size or perhaps use strlen

9706894
int	chars
my problem is that when i am using int 21h to take in values its taking only single digit chars as input for each variable

9706900
post	put	post	get	put	get
a normal web browser makes only get and post requests to a website so it is very difficult to render template by a put request for the user because the user is normally not able to start a put request

9706904
width	height
the choice what dimensions becomes length width and height is essentially arbitrary

9706904
width	height
for example we would like to be able to tell that the box with length 1 width 2 and height 3 is the same box as the one with length 3 width 1 and height 2

9706904
width	height
the values of the length width and height columns can be interchanged to form another legitimate record

9706904
width	height
it could be implemented as a function based unique index as long as we can express a b c analytically in terms of length width height

9706904
width	height
piece of cake a is the greatest of length width height

9706904
width	height
symmetric functions rewritten in terms of length width height are

9706904
addition	multiplication
our last solution is strikingly similar to the earlier one where the greatest operator plays the role of multiplication while the least operator goes as addition

9706904
width	height
in the box inventory database example we donâ t even need schema redesign we can just require to change the practice of inserting unconstrained records length width height and demand that

9706929
addclass	removeclass
instead of setting fixed styles using style i recommend to use the functions addclass removeclass and toggleclass

9706944
children	parent
remove the parent field from the image as an aside it would be a onetoone instead of a foreignkey to prevent multiple children from a single parent

9706960
free	malloc
and preferably without using malloc free and with the spirit of raii

9706972
min	max
i want to know this because i have numeric and non numeric data about 10 columns long andhave to normalize using min max only the numeric fields and it would be faster if they were all in one half of my dataset so i can just use a loop

9706976
maven	pom.xml
check this maven pom.xml reference it might give you some clues

9707056
width	height
i m using divs with hidden overflows and am animating the width and height properties to reveal each segment

9707056
width	height
my idea is to separate all the leaves into pngs and position them in the correct place then i want to reveal each of them individually from specific points of origin the root of each leaf which appears in different places and reveal each leaf by animating the height width in the opposite direction

9707070
ssl	ntlm
if you really want to know whether something is secure or not you need to specify the types of threat that you need to protect against what your tolerance is for breaks in that security and what additional mechanisms that you have taken to secure your site for example password authentication ntlm ssl etc

9707074
spaces	delimiter
if you want your input to be split not only using white spaces delimiter but also

9707099
width	height
to fix this you can either resize your uiimageview to be the same size as the image or have the same width height ratio as the image if you re scaling down or actually add a border to the image itself

9707185
subtract	add
for the next part of the program i will need to add these new multiplied numbers in the list together then i will use the mod function to get the remainder then subtract the number from 11 any assistance with any of my coding or incorrect statements on how to calculate the isbn would be greatly appreciated

9707202
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to apply some css3 transitions on some headers in a website i m working on but there s something about transitions on elements that contain text that really bugs me in browsers that apply hinting or grid-fit a font s glyphs which i guess is most of them bar perhaps safari there is a noticable jump at the beginning and end of a transition where you can see that text is snapped back to the pixel grid as demonstrated in this jsfiddle part of this is probably a momentary blur due to filtering but there s definitely some shape modification going on here at least in firefox and google-chrome

9707220
hide	show
you can put all the three registration pages in a single ctp file and just show hide the respective portion of the page once the user is done with filling all the three pages submit the form and save the data in their respective tables but you need to be careful about model field validations

9707233

int	chars
assuming we have 32bit int 8bit chars gcc compiler and intel architecture

9707273
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
this sounds like a misuse of the maven-surefire-plugin cause you seemed to have some kind of integration-tests which should be done by the maven-failsafe-plugin instead

9707273
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
the maven-surefire-plugin is intended to run unit tests where as the maven-failsafe-plugin is intended to run integration tests

9707539
fdt	swc
instead i created a blank project in flash builder 4.6 and then loaded the font swc you created via fdt

9707539
fdt	swc
it seems to me that the issue is not the font swc or fdt but rather related to the air or flex sdk you re using or the instantiation of the font library

9707551
post	get
in order to get this to work in my lisp application i really need to see the content body of my http post i have been able to see the headers using a call like this

9707707
min	max
the method to limit the results will depend on your requirements - adding limit 1 to the subquery will work but you might want to do some sorting or use min max to specify which row you get

9707713

9708016
width	height
once it s floated it s not calculated in the width or height of the parent container by default

9708027
getter	setter
most important that if you decide to override default behaviour of such setter or getter you can easly do this without need to change client code because setter-getter calling syntax is same to calling methods

9708073

google-chrome	safari
-webkit-calc currently works in the google-chrome dev build and should be included in the next release of google-chrome and safari

9709088
equals	gethashcode
on the other hand if one overrides equals one should also override gethashcode

9709236
postgresql	mysql
the authentication module is entirely optional and is built-on the clean icacheclient isession apis and ormlite which allows your sessions to be stored in memory redis or memcached and your userauth info persisted in ormlite s supported rdbms s of sqlserver mysql postgresql sqlite as well as redis data-store or inmemory useful for dev testing

it is not a good idea to use this in a production application because it will piss off users and cause other bugs when a user tries to min max the frame

9709345
getter	setter
of course this is a normal class and you can add all the methods you want and use getter and setter instead of instance variables var for the getter and for the setter

9709557
nsnull	nsstring
if you send isnullorempty to an object that s an instance of nsnull your method here which is a method on nsstring will not be called

9709557
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring instances do respond to length but casting the object to nsdata doesn t use the nsdata version of the method -- it still ends up as the nsstring version of length because the object actually is an nsstring casting only happens at compile-time

9709557
nsstring	nsobject
several of the things you are doing would require this to be in a category on nsobject so that the method would in fact be called even if the object was not an nsstring

you can t cast them double are laid out different in memory than int this isn t a case of simply changing their name

9710554
int	double
edit only if double was a super or subclass class of int then it might be possible

9710557
int	double
int is a type and double is a type and they have no relation so such assignments are not allowed

9710617
width	height
you would have to detect the mouseover yourself using jquery methods offset width and height for the static element and either cursor position from the event object for drag event or jquery ui s own ui.offset whichever fits your purpose better

9710617
draggable	droppable
another option less elegant but probably easier to implement would be to make your static element a droppable in which case jquery ui lets you handle an event when a draggable hovers over it

repo	egit
after the edit is saved right click on the git repo in your egit git repositories perspective and choose properties you will now see this section of keys has been created or more likely just read from the config file and a remote master to local master git pull will operate as expected going forward

9711056
repo	egit
i didn t actually try adding the keys manually through the property editor nor am i likely to as i know this method works and makes sense since egit is simply calling through to the local git repo

addition	multiplication
that means it can t be specialised at the call sites and the dictionary lookups can t be eliminated to possibly inline addition and multiplication which might enable further optimisation

9712133

9712552

width	height
now all that should happen is that when i set the background of the imageviews the png adjusts uniformly its size to the parents 100dp height while the width should scale uniformly - down or up

9726222
width	height
when its set to 300dp for example then it stretches the png width to 300 and 100 height while it should only stretch it s width so far that the height reaches 100

9726383

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
as pilavdzice said the right alternative to this would be to have both classa and classb inherited from another class an abstact superclass which then in its initializer decides what concrete subclassing to use

you could put the part where you have your post in a partial and use it in the general layout of your app

pull	push
local develop â local push to github â remote pull from github â remote test â repeat

9726600

the problem appears to be the fact that django class based views only populate the form kwargs if the http method is post or put

9726634
keydown	keyup
just an extra note for everyone using keydown and keyup events to suppress key repeat

9726634
keydown	keyup
if you do this you need to exclude catching meta keys like alt shift etc otherwise when those keys are held down the actual key you want will not be sent since this is a two key combination and keydown and keyup events catch all keys

i was setting up a simple example to just get the form to post but realizing there are probably many things i am doing wrong in magento

i have a winforms mdi app where a window that is a child of the mdi form pop-up a dialog like this

9727379
post	get
getpost can also take a parameter to fetch a single post value - but it does not get get values

9727379
post	get
getparam will return both get and post values alike

9727394
post	put	post	get	put	get
put or post the template to the server then do a get request passing along the uri of the template i just posted plus the input values - the get response body would have the .odt

9727394
post	get
like 2 above except do the whole thing as a single post request instead of get

width	height
let s say i have a large set of data within which each datum has several searchable columns color height width etc such that a user could issue searches like all red items or all green items with width under 50

9739581
width	height
your call to gluortho2d is telling opengl that the width and height of your output is always roi_width by roi_height units

9739581
width	height
you should probably set width and height in gluortho2d to the pixel width and height of your output area your window or view or screen depending on how you ve set things up

9739584
put	get
so in the web.config i put the impersonate to false but when i try get the current user with environment.username the app keeps getting the network service user

while steve is functionally correct that should work for all elements what was not visible in the google-chrome developer tools were a number of characters which in google-chrome and firefox jquery notices when evaluating empty which internet explorer does not

internetexplorer ignored the new line and white space when considering empty while google-chrome and firefox did not

9739897
children	parent
what would be the proper way to select children of the parent div

9739897
children	parent
the reason i do not use a more direct single selector like #parent #item1 is the parent could change or could be selected from a callback function and i want to be able to select its children without directly knowing the id of the parent but rather using a jquery object of the parent

9739907
onclick	onchange
you should use onchange or onclick instead

9739933
width	height
layeredpane.setpreferredsize new dimension width height

9739945
submit	submission
for example if i got a submit button click after submission of page then i want to display a div which i have hidden on page

9740049
ord	chr
python doesn t actually have a character type unlike c so yea chr ord is the way to do it

9740058
int	chars
python doesn t automatically convert between a chars and an int the way c and c++ do

9740115
children	parent
if your object will receive subscriptions and unsubscriptions from its children in a threading context which is not compatible with the parent s subscription and unsubscription methods imho iobservable should have required that all legitimate implementations allow subscription and unsubscription from arbitrary threading context but alas it does not you may have no choice but to have the intermediate iobservable immediately upon creation create a proxy object to handle subscriptions on your behalf and have that object subscribe to the parent s event

9740120
lxml	beautifulsoup
then you can use beautifulsoup or lxml for html parsing

9740127
vsto	add-in
i have a word 2007 vsto add-in for creating document templates

whats the code to generate the equivalent object for other browsers ie7 firefox google-chrome opera safari

in this particular case you can use a pseudo-class eg before background-image display block and a fixed width and height to show the image

9740208
profiling	instrumentation
i looked up the documentation from xamarin on how to profiling my app with instrumentation but this documentation says i should start instrumentation via the terminal

on my team we constantly switch from the google-chrome driver desktop browser to the iwedbdriver mobile safari in iphone simulator

9740395
oncreate	recreate
i assume that i also have to drop and recreate table using oncreate and onupgrade methods right

9740409
post	get
it has been my experience that you re just specifying parameters to the api using get or post as your request method

9740445
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when site a receives this number in firefox it is correct at 433 but when i receive this exact same message in ie google-chrome and safari i get extreme results

9740445
post	get
it is consistent on reload but every time a new post message is sent i get a different number

9740445
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari - pattern

9740501
post	get
make a valid post or get to request the page and update the with the returned code

9740575
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve tried moving some code over from viewdidload to viewwillappear but all i ve accomplished is that when selecting a new employee the detail view show the values from the previously selected employee but if i scroll so that the cells get out of view and then release the info is updated

9740577
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
so if you have administration rights on weblogic the simplest solution is to upgrade the slf4j versioning of weblogic to 1.6.4 by updating the file on weblogic installation folder

9740583
post	get
if you changed these parameter names you will get an error at runtime when your form post back to the controller action

9740691
versioning	upgrade
in other words if i have the spark example_spark 1.0.0 and then it is upgrade to example_spark 1.0.1 i think i would then have 2 versioning in the sparks directory

9740703
put	get
i want to do something like the help you get when put the cursor over a qt class or function name

9740782
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve got a stylesheet that works fine on google-chrome and safari but looks horrible on ie and firefox like it s failing to identify any of the code

9740878
super	implements
iterable is a super interface to collection so any class such as set or list that implements collection also implements iterable

9740912
folder	directory
i am facing the problem that i can not access the folder in the workspace directory since the links to this directory are missing an ending

9740920
src	attr
if i change all the src and href occurences then run it through regex to to find and replace all bad paths then change the attr back to src and href will it work

9740920
src	attr
of course it shouldn t change anything if the href or src attr is on another domain or already absolutely pathed

9740986
hide	show
you should use the hide and show methods instead of changing the display css attribute

9741024
rmdir	mkdir
as far as file system commands are concerned you can make a directory with mkdir copy is cp move is mv remove file is rm and remove directory is rmdir

9741029
put	get
i am trying to put this css menu together but i couldn t get it working right

9741044
width	height
what i still unable to accomplish is to get width and height of the embed clutterstage

9741054
range	minimum
a progressbar has maximum and minimum properties that are used to define the range of values that it will accept defaulting from 0 to 100

9741064
post	get
api functions are called by get post requests with xml which you can call using the xmlhttp object

9741064
vbscript	vba
again since both the asp and the vba are using the vbscript syntax it could probably be adapted

9741091
min	max
the trick is to use length specifiers min and max for s plus a string filled with your padding character to the maximum potential length

9741139
ubuntu	debian
if that s the case then you just need to install the python-dev package at least that is what it s called on debian and ubuntu

9741159
lsp	principles
i think you have mixed up the direction of lsp liskov substitution principles lsp is strong behavioral subtyping not strong behavioral supertyping

9741223
unsigned	short
wchar_t and gu vs unsigned short _wu

9741249
installation	upgrade
this installation was just upgrade to typo3 4.5

9741305
onresume	onpause
so if you have a progessbar on the ui and you want it to continue updating it you should start your service and bind and undbind it in onresume onpause

9741310
width	height
i notice that your framelayout weight is 0 along with the height and width

9741338
post	get
at this point i am just trying to get the username to post on the next page

9741364
inherited	subclassing
here s an example that inherited from normalize to make a subclassing textnorm which is used to convert a string to a value from 0 to 1

9741375
submit	submission
but if before saving each command i will need to first iterate through the array to check weather the same command already exists and overwrite if it does and that will happen on form submission that means until this matter is sorted out the form will not submit

9741376
post	get
a user clicks on a post that was published on 12th march 2012 for example they get taken to single.php where the content of that post is displayed as normal

9741393
submit	submission
both use the same database where the info is stored which means the forms are always the same so i need a conditional something along the lines of if this page is in an iframe pass form to script on parent for submission else submit form as-is

9741446
google-chrome	firefox
check out tampermonkey it s a google-chrome extension for running user scripts equivalent to greasemonkey for firefox

9741465
nsoperation	nsmanagedobject
otherwise if you mean you have large amount of data that are retrieved as nsmanagedobject probably loaded into a uitableview consider using some kind of nsoperation for asynchronous loading

9741467
width	height
so it makes multiline since curses has fixed width and height and automatically move the buffer to the next line

9741506
submit	submission
you don t need a conditional just use javascript unobtrusively ie if javascript is enabled javascript stops hijacks the form submission sends the form data to parent and closes the iframe - if javascript is not enabled the form submit normally with jquery

9741544
children	parent
if all these elements are children of a container element you can add a single event listener to the parent element to capture all these events

9741549
qmainwindow	qdialog
in my qmainwindow class i have another class named mydialog that inherits from qdialog

9741553
width	height
as a rule of thumb you never want to change the css width height of a canvas

9741553
width	height
you need to set the canvas height and width as attributes and not as css properties

9741571
pascal	delphi
unfortunately it haven t current pascal delphi binding

9741624
int	double	int	chars
it s not an int it s not a float it s not a double it s not a chars it s not a long

9741628
post	get
however when you send a post request instead of a get if you throw an exception on the backend code of course the browser won t render the response text

9741661
pull	push
i understand the pull and push patterns respectively but how does c# in terms of memory etc notify subscribers for iobservable that it should receive the next bit of data in memory to process

9741723
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
for my ios app i am writing my own httpclient using nsoperationqueue and executing each operation wrapping nsurlrequest and nsurlconnection on main run loop with nsrunloopcommonmodes so it won t block the ui

9741727
onclick	onchange
and javascript is not needed inside onclick and onchange simply use

9741747
inherited	subclassing
first of all i can t see in your subclassing definition where you specify the inherited

9741766
post	get
recall from my post on cassandra query plans that once rows get to a certain size they include an index of the columns

9741768
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that it works only on firefox but doesn t on safari nor google-chrome don t ve ie to test on it

9741771
qstring	qfile
i need to convert the path to qstring to pass it to the constructor of qfile however straightforward conversion qstring fromlocal8bit and qfile decodename don t seem to help

9741788
int	double
there is a predefined implicit conversion from short to int long float double or decimal.

9741804
width	height
you load the image resize it first so that it has the minimum side being 150 then you crop to the 150 width height relative to the center

9741808
width	height
array 0 354 1 332 2 2 3 width 354 height 332 bits 8 channels 3 mime image jpeg

9741855
setinterval	settimeout
you don t need setinterval you need settimeout

9741855
setinterval	settimeout
as the name says setinterval fires regularly while settimeout fires only once

9741856
setinterval	settimeout
you have cleartimeout and settimeout so its very similar to setinterval

9741886
ironruby	ironpython
after microsoft takes the thing they want they unpurposely cut down the support for ironruby and ironpython and jim s boss asked him if he want to do anything else other than ruby

9741917
daemon	cron
-the first 5 arguments in the line tell how often or when the cron daemon will execute the 6th argument

9741948
hide	show
you might want to ask yourself why certain rows are hidden visible and if there s a good reason make sure you re tracking facts related to that and using that to hide show elements instead of depending upon some state of elements themselves

9741966
udp	tcp
tcp connections can be hijacked and naked udp literally has ip spoofing written all over its head

9742025
button	checkbox
i did take care to not have double post so that the browser does not warn the user that he s going to post again but then apparently this leads to another issue if i use the back button from chrome then the value of the checkbox aren t correct

9742025
button	checkbox
user goes back to page1 as it was before the checkbox was checked which is exactly the expected behavior for the back button but the checkbox is still checked

9742029
put	get
then i opened one session per host with jsch and simply created a channel for each action a single send would create a channel put the file closed the channel but i encountered the same thing when trying to do it 10 or more at a time i would get connections refused as some channels were still closing when another request came through

9742053
put	get
if you can put the image file into assets folder the code below can be used to get the uri -

9742077
folder	directory
that s because whenever any changes are made in folder being monitored by asp.net there are good blogs on what directory are monitored the application pool is unloaded and reloaded

9742099
post	get
this is an older post but should get you pointed in the right direction

9742123
superclass	subclassing
another possibility is you have created another subclassing of superclass with no constructors and thus c++ is generating an implicit default constructor

9742157
put	get
how to manually i am guessing that when i put this together half a year ago the reference was updated automatically but got destroyed when my boss edited copied values or whole rows of data from other files deleting the files after - i get broken link message now set it back

9742169
oncreate	onstart
your ui will only be rendered after oncreate and onstart take place

9742200
width	height
so basically you set its size for drawing objects etc via the width and height properties like so

9742238
int	chars
ip will contain the address of the next int either 0x00004002 for a 16-bit int or 0x00004004 for a 32-bit int but cp will contain the address of the next chars 0x00004001

9742239
subtraction	multiplication
one issue is that the order of operations is messing you up multiplication is done before subtraction

9742307
width	height
if you can put exact width and height of the div it s easy to center with out using jquery

9742362
codeigniter	yii
i have worked on codeigniter but yii is far more ahead of that

9742392
rss	icalendar	rss	feed
put together a script that monitors the rss icalendar feed for his calendar and looks for events that are missing the desired tags

9742392
google-chrome	firefox
for example when he types .hw. in a google-chrome window or firefox window it will generate the template

9742478
inject	interceptor
unity allows developers to wire up interceptor to be inject at the class or method level

9742498
hash	salt
use an algorithm like bcrypt with many thousands of hash iterations bcrypt calls this the cost factor and it should be at least 16 meaning 2 16 iterations and a random salt

9742557
cifs	smb
the filesystem i will be using with vfs is either a local file file or cifs smb

9742560
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard events are high on my todo list though i will update this question when they have been added

9742562
g++	gcc
whether g++ should accept the code or not with a few changes it would be valid c valid c++ acceptable to both gcc and g++ and better style

9742599
hash	salt
therefore you should not hash the password on the client side but concatenate it with a some arbitrary string selected on the server side usually called a salt and hash the result

9742608
g++	gcc
mingw gcc g++

9742654
express	node.js
so there are two heroku apps the rails web app and the node.js express web app

9742721
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is working in google-chrome firefox safari opera although a little more clunky safari ipad android phone

9742765
int	chars
consider the test cases - there are 2 chars 8 and 7 and they both form the int 87 that you should be returning

9742765
int	chars
this is somewhat pedantic but the int value of the chars 0 isn t necessarily less than the value of 1 2 etc

9742777
post	get
what i ve understood by reading some other post that you can somehow get the result by dividing by 10 but i didn t really understand it so if anyone could point me in the right direction i d be glad

9742799
mouse	keyboard
is there a visual studio 2010 11 extension that would somehow monitor all commands that the developer is executing either via mouse or keyboard and show them in some window

9742801
notepad++	jedit
to clarify i m not doing any transformations with this expression i m just plugging it into an xpath expression evaluator such as in notepad++ or jedit - via plugins to help debug subtle data errors in very large xml files

9742831
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
even distinction between checked and unchecked-exception is fuzzy why for example would i insist on the client code catching exception when a lazy or impatient programmer can easily wrap it into runtimeexception and rethrow it on me

9742864
lapack	magma
b magma runs always slower than lapack sequential around 10 times slower

9742872
svg	vml
rapahel uses svg for almost all browsers and fall back to vml on ie

9742874
post	get
author creates a post 30 days after the creation of this post the author will get a mail on the email-address which he she filled in at the admin profile dashboard

9742883
hid	keyboard
works very well in our case with any scanner working as an hid emulation keyboard and where we can configure the preamble

9742892
setinterval	settimeout
if dowork is already running it s either a blocking all other js code and you have no choice but to let it finish since you have no way to execute any interruption code until it finishes on its own or b dowork is scheduled to fire off on an interval via settimeout or setinterval

9742892
setinterval	settimeout
if it s the latter case settimeout and setinterval return an id

9742909
hash	salt
i ve created a basic user provider and have it working perfectly when using a sha1 hash however i m completely stuck don t understand how to get it working with salt

9742930
children	parent
if the automatic deserialization doesn t work you could have your parent class implement the ideserializationcallback interface and update the children in the ondeserialization method

9742940
punctuation	words
frequently if you start with a string of tokens you need to preprocess them for example remove punctuation or special symbols remove words that are not relevant stemming etc

9742940
punctuation	words
but maybe you can use some symbols say punctuation between cities and countries - melbourne australia so you assign that set of useful punctuation symbols to other symbol # and use that as a context so the next time you find an unknown words next to a comma next to a known country you can use that knowledge to assume that the unknown words is a city

9742962
jboss	glassfish
if i compile my app against jetty can i still deploy the app under tomcat or any of the ee servers glassfish jboss etc...

9742965
post	get
after the first comment i d like to point out that every submit leads to a post redirect get and take the user to a new page

9742965
button	checkbox
and then if he clicks on the back button he sees his previous page as it was before its checkbox was checked

9742965
button	checkbox
this way if the user clicks on the back button he s taken not to the final state the checkbox was in but to the original state

9742965
post	get
it s really just simply post get and submit when the user clicks a checkbox

9742967
hide	show
so if someone checks an option to save for e-mailing i want the print layers to hide and the e-mail layers to show

9742967
put	get
it does what i want it to do haven t put it in a function yet but i ll get there

9742968
mbunit	nunit
what i ended up discovering is that out of the box nunit offered more options and plug-ins such as pnunit for parallel testing and another plug-in for performance testing where xunit mbunit lacked all or some of these features

9742968
versioning	upgrade
where as with xunit i would have to modify the source and thus it would make it a major pain point to upgrade my versioning if xunit released something cool later on

9742992
put	get
if you have threads that routinely take 20 minutes to do something but want to be notified if it takes longer than 25 minutes then have to increase the stuck thread limit to 25 minutes and get the notification at that point then you must put this limit from 600 seconds to 1500 seconds 25 60

9743018
min	max
and your graph will be rendered correctly with or without the min and max definitions

9743020
post	get
so don t be surprised you the method is get not post

9743054
hash	salt
second is a hash over the document-content not sure if there is some more salt in there ..

9743062
button	checkbox
this row layout let s call it row_layout.xml may have two text areas if your items are text or it may have a text area and a checkbox button if that s what you want

9743090
int	double
edit i will also add that the real bean for our project contains about 100 int double and those can change over time as business requirements change

9743125
hide	show
i d suggest making it an onchange function from the first select which calls show or hide on the options of the second select and resets it so that it s not left sitting on a hidden option

9743136
folder	directory
when setup.cmd runs the current directory will be your web application s bin folder so make sure to use a cd setup command inside setup.cmd

9743161
tabcontrol	tabitem
if you mean loop in tabitem of tabcontrol

9743174
button	checkbox
button label textbox checkbox etc

9743184
setinterval	settimeout
support is not that great at the moment so you may want to shim its functionality with setinterval or the recursive settimeout pattern

9743198
html5lib	beautifulsoup	html5lib	lxml.html	lxml.html	beautifulsoup
try lxml.html html5lib or beautifulsoup

9743205
cat	tee
and i m not sure why i chose tee instead of cat

9743238
profiler	gprof
here are 2 options either use profiler again to compare results of incremental and unity builds but this time you need a sampling profiler like oprofile while an instrumenting profiler like gprof most likely is too heavy for this task

9743249
inline	inlining
one such optimization is inlining the compiler can only inline a function if it knows its implementation at compile time

9743270
post	get
i added setusername and setpassword to the request and i was able to get the nsstring information to post and save to my database successfully but the image didn t share the same fate

9743291
versioning	upgrade
i d advise you to restore the previous menu versioning and stick to that until you upgrade your instance to 1.4

9743294
gridview	objectdatasource
both the gridview use objectdatasource

9743294
gridview	objectdatasource
i tried the following codes in the rowupdated event of both the gridview and the objectdatasource

9743315
children	parent
i m having a devil of a time with unwrap and parent and children

9743331
java.util.date	simpledateformat
my guess is that you ve got an import for java.util.date or some other date type whereas simpledateformat parses to a java.util.date

9743335
stdout	stderr
you should also replace with which is the correct way to send stderr to the same place as stdout

9743367
ubuntu	linux
10.04 lucid linux ubuntu 64 bit.

9743371
versioning	upgrade
nevermind i ve upgrade gwt to versioning 2.4.0 and recompiling

9743399
weinre	console.log
i used weinre for debugging and almost missed that it overrides the console.log method

9743399
weinre	console.log
therefore console.log doesn t work with weinre

you not only have to know the opcodes machine code for the instruction set but need to know the binary file formats for the operating system coff elf exe etc and would need to hand code all of that information much better suited to have your machine code assembler create that header for you if needed

9747767
joystick	keyboard	mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick
so the thing is this in java application if we want to listen to any keyboard or mouse input we can easily to do that with the keylistener and mouselistener classes but what i am talking here is if i want to create a java application that listens to all of the user s specified inputs be it from joystick touch screen or whatever regardless of which application has focus at the time and map these inputs to other inputs and macro

what s the easiest way to convert a get url string to post in jquery

9748594

9749102
jar	war
using sub-modules you can for example create two war modules and put the shared resources in a shared jar

9749305
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it s not that rails doesn t scale but rather requests for live data in ruby or any interpreted-language do not scale as they are comparatively far more expensive both in terms of cpu memory utilization than their compiled-language counterparts

9749305
interpreted-language	compiled-language
of course rails tends to be on the innovation forefront so the 99 non-twitter level trafficked applications of the world can get by just fine with an interpreted-language although i m now solidly on the compiled-language side of the fence scala is just too good

fast-forward	merge
you need to decide if you merge back in master as a fast-forward merge or not

9749667
fast-forward	merge
however if you made a branch to isolate a short-live development you can incorporate back your feature branch in master through a fast-forward merge in order to blend completely the two branches

9749667
fast-forward	merge
if master had some commits while you were developing feature you will need to rebase feature on top of master first then merge feature in master this will be fast-forward

9749753
hide	show
the theory is that you hide your dropdown submenu by adding display none or pushing it far off the screen with a left position like left -9999 and then when you hover over your menu item you reset that position or display property to show your menu like so

post	put
to put it all combined this is what it is sent with post 3 checkboxes are checked for variable2

9750208
post	get
since you have no control over over the form that sends the data to your php script and thus can t change it to ensure that the later checkboxes with the same name do not overwrite the earlier ones you ll have to get access to and process the raw post data itself

9751159
opencv	emgucv
hi once i worked on emgucv opencv but i do not know if it will help you but to detect custom objects you would have to work on harrcascades

9751161
ubuntu	linux
i have a string that is read from a text file but in ubuntu linux and i try to delete its newline character from the end

9751178
libc	tcmalloc
jemalloc and tcmalloc are implementations that on top of performing better for multithreaded code that typical libc implementations add some utility functions of that sort

9751184
public	protected
then you must change there protection level to protected or public or provide an access method that is

9751190
unix	aix
if the list of installed base products on aix is correct you do not have the sas access to pc file formats product licensed on unix

9751219
maven	pom.xml
in my maven project i have defined a bunch of spring dependencies and i notice that in some cases it will choose different versions of the artifacts even though they are specified identically in my pom.xml

9751222
margin	height
this is achieved by setting the height padding and margin of every item to conform to a standard unit line size

9751257
twitter	myspace
i have multiple fields for social networking websites where users can enter their username and it would link to their twitter facebook myspace account etc

9751263
int	chars
this is the case when you want to see for instance what key the user pressed and you don t care about the the type of it may be a string a chars or an int

9751263
addition	multiplication
for example if you are performing some addition or multiplication operations then you want to make sure that the operands are of the compatible type

9751294
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop with counter set to the number of items in the arrays with the idea of inserting data from each arrays into the fields of the following diffarray

9751305
return-value-optimization	nrvo
keep in mind that return-value-optimization and nrvo named return-value-optimization might account for the calls not happening as you expect

9751307
width	height
when doing the rotation gesture the view spins wildly around it s center with it s height and width changing as follows height becomes width width slowly turns into height

9751307
width	height
the subviews have height and width springs and left top strut

9751366
hash	salt
salt should be randomly selected for each hash password not a fixed predictable value otherwise a pre-computed dictionary attack is possible

9751427
gif	ico
other formats such as gif and ico can only be read using a custom decoder

9751468
width	height
you can use the following method to get the width and height of the view

9751574
post	put
i put staticly 1 after some id and class elements to check how my problem would be solved it works fine with post 1 which id and value are 1 now i need to replace the 1 at the end of #post_id .vote_succ .up_perc .down_perc by dynamic code to make it work with dynamic elements generated by the php code

9751594
kerberos	ntlm
i am experiencing a connected problem which is that fallback to ntlm does not work when the issuer is specified using fqdn and kerberos fails sspi negotiation failed i think because i have no issuer principal name in the config

9751609
post	put
i can t post more than 2 url s yet so ive put all the screenshots in 1 image sorry

9751624
google-chrome	firefox
the accept-charset attribute worked well with firefox and google-chrome but not with ie

9751625
width	margin
in main div i give width of 100 background color red and in child div i give width 100 and background blue and margin top 100px

9751638
return-value-optimization	nrvo
also do not forget the potential impacts of return-value-optimization and nrvo on the expected output

9751639
getter	setter
if you don t want to write getter and setter you can use project lombok you ll need to set it up in a subproject though

9751711
chunked	transfer-encoding
since the response is streamed to the browser with transfer-encoding chunked right

9751733
min	max
examples could be min max maxnoofnodes etc

9751733
min	max
where params would encapsulate the min max etc to be updated

9751775
int	boolean	int	chars
however besides primitives int boolean chars etc... everything else is a pointer

9751794
bison	cup
if you re using a parser generator like cup or bison you can specify how to build the tree in the grammar actions

9751794
int	boolean
there are only but a few instances where you d actually store a lexeme s string value for an identifier and for a string boolean int literal

9751854
mvp	presenter
mvp paradigm assumes that the model and view are connected via the presenter but celltable by default requires a type argument in its constructor

9751864
hash	md5
why not simply use the md5 hash of the string

9751872
x86	mips
you might usefully look for mips arm or x86 to see their bus cycle

9751881
portrait	landscape
i want one of them to be visible in portrait and the other in landscape

9751928
squash	branch
fall back position #2 is to do the same then squash the whole branch history down to one commit

9751929
getter	setter
in that case you have to realize that when you call you are actually using the getter and not the setter

9751929
getter	setter
so coding the getter and setter isn t any different with an array than with any other variable type

9751939
hide	show
then hide the and show the

9751939
hide	show
when the user clicks the then hide the and show the

9751947
int	chars
if you read a chars into input it will automatically be cast to an int

9751969
post	get
in that case your game code simply calls the appropriate url using the standard get or post methodology for passing in arguments and processing the response text returned by your code

9751975
overwrite	preserve
since a network doesn t preserve the order of the requests in the order of the responses i wouldn t want a n earlier search for francis to overwrite a later search for francis haart

9752080
addclass	removeclass
not too sure that you are trying to accomplish with the numeric parameters in your addclass removeclass calls

9752088
folder	dir
-use -execdir instead of -exec this will extract each zip file within its current folder otherwise you end up with all extracted content in the dir you invoked the find cmd

9752097
tax	shipping
each order has a tax shipping and discount total column at the top level

9752104
squash	merge
do your rebasing squash or whatever you need to to prepare to merge back to master then when you want to add the new functionality back in you can apply the patch in reverse mode with

9752108
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is the css file i am using works fine if worked on firefox but the page layout is getting all messed up on google-chrome and ie8

9752155
equals	gethashcode
i m not overriding equals and gethashcode but rather preserving the common but by no means ubiquitous convention that equals means identity equality for classes and that equals means value equality for structs

9752157
int	chars
where first 5 positions are int 1 next 5 positions are chars ps1 next 5 positions are chars a1 next 5 positions are int 1 next 24 positions are divided into 3 columns of 8 positions with 3 decimal point floating numbers

9752165
google-chrome	firefox
i tried using firefox google-chrome and ie but i am getting the same error

9752204
octal	decimal	octal	binary
152.35964 between binary octal decimal and hexadecimal numbers

9752204
int	double
all that i have found was in documentation but these functions bindec octdec binhex etc and base_convert operates just with int and i need floats or double

9752235
liferay	alfresco
i think i can use php or java cms for the moment after some research i decided to use liferay or alfresco

9752298
ant	maven
edit this question is not about how to solve dependencies using ant maven gradle or whatnots

9752324
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox rendered differently it s better if you want result same in all browser the always give width in even values not in odd

9752336
put	get
you need to put name.seek 0 in there to get back to the start of the file before you call countchars

9752359
maven	pom.xml
satisfiable pom.xml myproject-core line 1 maven dependency problem

9752364
cos	sin
now i am trying to expand this program to be able to evaluate expressions with functions like sin cos log for example 5 + sin 2 + log 2

9752384
jobs	cron
you can use cron jobs

9752434
for-loop	arrays
i think that everywhere that you are using in the arrays inside your for-loop you need to be using instead of

9752458
google-chrome	safari
if you re using google-chrome or safari you can use the input -webkit-autofill css selector to get the autofilled fields

9752465
stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
if it s a terminal device according to isatty 3 then stdout is line-buffered it gets fflush every time a newline character gets written

9752465
fflush	gets
if it s not a terminal device then it s fully buffered it only gets fflush whenever a certain amount of data usually something on the order of 4 kb to 64 kb gets written

9752510
width	height
tilemanager.def_ts is the default tile width and height 32

9752529
sorting	filtering
i used to be able to have a table with a two row column header where sorting was done in the top row and included the column name and filtering with inputs and selects was done in the second row

9752545
min	max
i cannot group by price because products will be missing if they have the same price and i cannot do min max price for the same reason of eliminating some products

9752550
int	double
1 is equivalent of an int trying to point to a double object

9752550
int	double
there is no such subtype relationship between int and double as is between dog and pet in c++

9752550
int	double
try not to mix these into the discussion because they are different you cast between values of int and double int double is explicit double int is implicit you cannot cast between pointers to them

9752583
ubuntu	linux
for information the development environment is linux ubuntu kernel 3.0.0-16 and everything is made using the c language

9752625
unsigned	short
readutf expects a specific format you need to send the length as a big-endian 16-bit unsigned short followed by the text utf encoded

9752625
16-bit	64bit
if you are sending 16-bit 32-bit or 64bit data values then you could have a problem with endianness

9752689
ubuntu	debian
from my understanding authbind is only for debian ubuntu

9752723
requestfactory	gwt
the first thing my gwt app does when it loads is request the current logged in user from the server via requestfactory

9752727
ubuntu	linux
first case if you are running php on a server like apache. then you need to give access only to the apache user this user depends on your linux distribution for example on ubuntu it is www-data while on other distros it might be apache

9752742
typedef	struct
when i try adding extern as in typedef extern struct node it gives a error of multiple storage class but if i miss it i get error for multiple definitions

9752765
width	height
the second two parameters are the width and height of your button

9752766
put	get
on the other hand if you inadvertently put the same book in the refrigerator well when mother goes to get the milk she s going to issue you a segmentation fault

9752815
iboutlet	ibaction
the i connected all the iboutlet and ibaction

9752837
width	height
so btn5 will be in the position x 211 y 280 and will have the dimensions width 109 height 60 if you use this code

9752870
google-chrome	firefox
when i apply a negative margin-top of -3px in a parent element all the childs move to the right in firefox and ie8 but in google-chrome looks perfectly fine elements are centered

9752882
post	get
i ve been searching for hours and tried everything - basically i ve stripped it down to post get

9752882
post	get
when i set the method to get on both the form and script page it works fine when i set it to post i get this error

9752899
requestfactory	gwt
it can be a little messy to get the server to read from itself and print out data using requestfactory - here is a demo example of how this can work using gwt 2.4 the main branch has the same thing for 2.3 or so - not quite the same thing that you are after but it may be possible to use this same idea to populate a string in a proxy store that can be read in the client seen here

9752907
google-chrome	firefox
for now though the bug is still open and it seems like your hackish solution is the only solution for google-chrome however a the solution for google-chrome doesn t need settimeout and b it seems like firefox might respect the

9752915
client-side	server-side
you want to do client-side validation which is nice-to-have but not as required as server-side validation which you can only do on the server

9752937
google-chrome	firefox
web page developer tools like those in google-chrome firefox and ie make it a cinch to change attributes of a form

9752937
post	get
a user can send post or get data directly to the action url without going through your page

9752937
client-side	server-side
users can turn off client-side javascript but they can t turn off php server-side validation

9752937
post	get
for instance i personally have contributed to one such library that does a good job of evaluating fields in either a post or get type form

9752937
client-side	server-side
you should view client-side validation as a way to inform the user that there is a problem with their form input without reloading but always use server-side validation to actually look at the input for problems

9752948
client-side	server-side
i read about commonjs but this is on the server-side and here we are talking client-side

9752957
range	minimum
notice how the snippet above also tests for the minimum range of a short

9753028
codeigniter	kohana
i ve came to kohana from codeigniter which was a little bit bigger documentation and easier to understood but as far as i found out many programmers say that kohana are alot better than codeigniter

9753073
hash	md5
is it possible to decrypt md5 hash

9753084
hash	md5
md5 was designed to be hash which is one way only otherwise it would not be a hash

9753089
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
by the way in order to increase the security of your database you should salt the password hash as just md5 hashing the password text makes it easy for somebody with the hash to get the passwords using a rainbow table

9753096
sudoers	visudo
once logged in on the remote server you can use sudo you have to configure etc sudoers file first with the visudo command to execute commands by another user

9753096
sudo	passwd
to avoid sudo to request for a passwd because you are authenticated in etc sudoers... you have to set the nopasswd flag like the line below

9753111
post	get
saw similar question on stack but dint get the conclusion from those post

9753147
openssl	gnutls
the most widely used tls libraries for linux appear to be openssl and gnutls correct me if i m wrong

pop-up	dialog
i am trying to have my social share buttons facebook linkedin tweeter google+ creating their dialog in jquery dialog pop-up

the error i am thinking must be here since the code works perfectly in firefox but does not run at all in google-chrome or ie

9753231
width	height
i want to set initial width and height to my linearlayout object that i am returning in getview method

9753257

9753279
folder	directory
there is no stats folder in the root directory on your server i believe

9753322
hex	binary
note 3 these aren t complex algorithms and you shouldn t need to mess about with high level languages first unless you don t understand the theory maths behind binary hex conversion perhaps

9753358
liferay	alfresco
seriously in your requirements context i would compare alfresco share with liferay

9753372
punctuation	words
i.e. move every words and punctuation mark into a seperate token element

9753390
min	max	tax	shipping
you could substitute max or avg for min and still get the same result since the tax shipping and discount are a constant for a given order

9753399
for-loop	arrays
in your code you don t assign any value to arrays in the for-loop

9753437
microchip	avr
it s supposed to be portable between different compilers including microchip c18 c32 and in further also arm and avr

9753447
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
assume the binary expression tree and how the inorder preorder and postorder traversals act on it

9753447
preorder	inorder
as we know the first element of preorder array is our root and we could find our corresponding root in inorder array

9753503
noexcept	throw
after the edit your implementation of operator- is guaranteed not to throw any exception well at least if you mark as noexcept that is and it is thus safe to mark it as noexcept

9753503
noexcept	throw
now depending on the implementation of and the copy-constructor it might actually never throw but that does not make it noexcept

9753503
noexcept	throw
as of the copy-constructor if you don t define it the implicitly declared copy constructor will be noexcept or not depending on whether all the members of your type are noexcept again not only that they don t throw but that they have that qualification

9753538
portrait	landscape
apple s view controller programming guide has a section on using separate view controllers for portrait and landscape

9753547
children	parent
you essentially have a hierarchy of people parent that contain other people children and grand children so you could use a recursive function to traverse the children of a person object

9753554
folder	directory
disable the add rename delete right for root directory but assign the right to all folder under

9753568
dropbox	rapidshare
examples of cloud computing services dropbox gmail facebook youtube rapidshare

9753655
width	height
the rectangle constructor that you re using takes a width and a height

9753684
folder	directory
name it and save it anywhere you like though putting it in a parent folder to both project directory might be a good idea

9753695
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview before findviewbyid

9753737
vbo	vao
the only thing i m not sure about is how to make sure that vbo is associated as vertex location data with the vao and that the vao is actually correctly bound when i call the draw function

9753738
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to highchart versioning 2.2.1 form the previous 2.1.7 that i was using before and the graphs are rendering ok

9753762
put	get
when the cpu for example encounters the add instruction the microcode describes how it should get the two values feed them to the alu to do the calculation and where to put the result

9753774
division	multiplication
remember that if there are any matrixs at all and you don t want to do matrix multiplication division use the . and .

9753785
maven	m2e
the most important thing in that case is don t use eclipse eclipse anymore use the m2e plugin instead in relationship with maven

9753806
int	chars
i ll do that by switching to a dictionary containing each string s hashcode value int instead of the actual chars

9753808
pop-up	dialog
it seems like a lot of work though and i think you would be better off just using a dialog box once and then making sure it does not pop-up again after someone has clicked on it through a stored preference

9753836
ssl	https
probably your configuration is ssl enabled but you have not generated the private certificate for https

9753843
pop-up	dialog
these two components have an oncomplete attribute where you could put a code that opens the pop-up dialog like this

9753851
mkmapview	mapkit
i am working on mapkit and have my current location displayed on map.is there any way i can find out the speed of how fast my location is changing.is there any default property of core location or mkmapview or mkannotation class

9753861
hide	removeclass
or removeclass hide row

9753931
int	chars
it should suffice to turn the chars into the int it represents by using int

9754000
hide	show
i have this sample notification script that show hide notifications and delete the field whenever the notification is clicked

9754017
folder	directory
you need to check your project settings under c++ check include directory and make sure it points to where gameengine.h resides the other issue could be that gameengine.h is not in your source file folder or in any include directory and resides in a different folder relative to your project folder

9754021
int	chars
1 convert the first chars to int so that you can compare them properly

9754024
rss	feed
my public activity rss feed still has links to all the diffs that detail the very information i wanted to remove

9754029
httprequest	httpresponse
furthermore i d like to have acces to the httprequest and optionally the httpresponse

9754071
put	get
i ve never done it myself but at least in theory you should be able to put in the tz code there and it should get translated into a tzinfo embedded in the datetime time object

9754133
put	get
it would be nice if i could put each individual word into an ordered nsarray and then just go through that array and get information out from that

9754137
hide	show
can i show or hide stuff using ony css where the stuff that hide or show depends on checking or unchecking a form box

9754173
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it worked perfectly on ie opera and firefox but it s very slow and choppy on google-chrome and safari the 3 backgrounds are a bit large but when i tested with smaller ones

9754180
jar	war
i have a spring mvc application which has a public front-end war an admin front-end war and a shared services jar

9754180
jar	war
also the two war based apps rely on the shared services jar

9754180
jar	war
would you include all of the appropriate spring jars and the service jar in to both war files

9754192
hide	show
afaik you can show hide stuff using css properties through js

9754204
profiling	instrumentation
i try to run the time profiling on my ipad 2 5.0.1 on xcode 4.2 and it resets as soon as the record tries to begin.allocation instrumentation works though

9754213

what i want to do is to get the total number of comments from dynamic pages post and insert that number to a mysql table so i can filter the post of those pages according to the total comments number and display each post s comment number in the forontapage sidebars etc

9754254
backbone.js	zepto
backbone.js isn t a replacement for jquery it still uses jquery or zepto out of the box to do ajax dom stuff anyway

9754274
bluetooth	usb
on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does

9754274
bluetooth	usb
if you are on a budget and can do with a hardwired connection i highly recommend usb over bluetooth

9754292
gif	png
suppose i have external url not from my website and i want to verify it to make sure this url is one from these files - jpg jpeg gif png and also is a correct image file not any script file or php

9754322
express	node.js
i m messing around with node.js for the first time and decided to create a simple application using express

9754322
express	node.js
now seeing as i have nearly no experience with node.js and express i m pretty sure i did something wrong

9754325
express	node.js
using connect-assetmanager in a node.js express app

9754333
subtraction	multiplication
i have some simple operations subtraction multiplication with big numbers integers

9754380
hide	show
i have a page in for printing i just want to show the gridview and hide all the controls what i have to do with css

9754400
int	double
if you are working with big int why not try to write a bigint class instead of using long double

9754415
super	extends
i know what extends and super mean in generics

9754443
super	extends
pecs - producer extends consumer super

9754443
super	extends
the lack of extends and super means you can do both for the exact type specified

9754446
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this whole feature is working great in google-chrome firefox and safari

9754469
nsorderedset	nsset
you need to create a one-to-many relationship which makes a nsset of destination objects or if you want to keep them in the specified order click ordered and it will be a nsorderedset

9754470
int	double
at least right off my immediate guess is that you d be doing a fair amount of extra work for fairly minimal savings just storing the final bytes of the million int obviously occupies 1 megabyte and three levels of table leading to that would clearly occupy a fair amount more so you d double the number of levels to save something like half a megabyte

9754495
cgpoint	cgrect
for changing the values you might try to create a cgpoint or cgrect from the string then changing it and finally converting it back to a string

9754592
hide	show
you can use this block to add remove show or hide subviews of the specified view

9754620

for instance a box that has a length a width and a height

9754713
google-chrome	firefox
everyone who has firebug installed in firefox or just has the google-chrome dev tools open already has what you re asking for though perhaps in not as noob-friendly a fashion

9754733
gson	jackson
i already have a gson custom provider and reader and will now create a modified version for jackson

9754733
gson	jackson
i know if i created a json wrapper object i could code to an interface and using spring to swap implementations easily jackson imp vs gson imp but this would mean i wouldnt be doing it the jax rs way

9754734
folder	directory
create a folder called system-images in the top level of your sdk directory next to platforms and tools

9754734
folder	directory
extract the complete armeabi-v7a folder to these directory

9754744
hide	show
so instead of using .show hide i now hide and show the content by setting the height of the sections to 100 0

9754765
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is supported in firefox google-chrome v8 and partially supported in opera 9+ and safari

9754767
post	get
so now i can be sure that my server accepts post get options if response headers work like i expect

9754773
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that a button which opens up a jqueryui dialog works before i search for anything but won t pop-up after i search

9754781
post	get
same code with post method works ok however this particular script requires get parameters

9754785
qapplication	qcoreapplication
however since there were some qt uis that used the same dlls we couldn t always call qcoreapplication in case the ui had already called qapplication

9754809
centos	linux
i m using linux centos 5.4 i installed mongodb now it s availabled as a daemon and service

i need to add a gridview to my page where the sqldatasource is based on a query that returns records that fall between sunday and saturday of the current week

9754907
gif	png
the following screenshot shows two images the one to the left is the original png image with alpha channel transparency while the right hand side one is a transparent gif image converted from the same png image

9754907
gif	png
png 49k gif 17k

9754944
int	double
this rule ensures that making a method that extends double does not also extend int

9754959
int	chars
i also tried using an array and converting the array to an int or chars but i have no way of knowing how many digits each value is

9754988
integer	unsigned
incompatible pointer to integer conversion sending nsnumber __strong to parameter of type unsigned long long

9754994
put	get
basically i am creating some quick static pages and have to put in 4 different changes controller action method routes and view....is there any way to do this quickly and avoid all the process and just get rails to pick up default controller and view

9755003
put	get
i was going to use any answers given and put it in a while loop so i can get all the possible combinations of a string while swapping two characters at a time

9755030
google-chrome	firefox
works fine for me with that image and the following code in the latest firefox and google-chrome beta on mac

9755039
width	height
if the program has read the header it has the values of width and height for the image data

9755051
leiningen	counterclockwise
the easiest way to get it done in a structural way is using leiningen in combination with the leiningen counterclockwise plugin

9755051
leiningen	counterclockwise
then call lein plugin install lein-ccw 1.2.0 to install the leiningen counterclockwise plugin

9755058
stdout	fflush
if you call fflush stdout before you call _exit you should get your output

9755058
stdout	fflush
the reason exit works is because that function is guaranteed to close and fflush any open streams such as stdout before calling _exit itself to actually terminate the program

9755062
stdout	fflush
the runtime will register such handlers to be run on exit that fflush open file such as stdout

9755062
stdout	fflush
you should see output if you call fflush stdout after the printf call or if you just run the program in a consol without piping the output to another program - in which case stdout will normally be line buffered so stdout is fflush whenever you write a n

9755070
stdout	fflush
so unless you ve fflush stdout it may get discarded

9755120
uilabel	uibutton
because uilabel is not intended to be added to uitoolbar i ve gone down the path of creating a plain uibutton and doing setenabled no to prevent the glow effect from appearing when tapping it

9755178
put	get
you have complexity of o countids countmaps if you put all maps into 2 dictionaries indexed by source and destination you ll get o countids + countmaps

9755185
rspec	minitest
i recently switched a very simple rails app from rspec to minitest

9755185
rspec	minitest
my question is is this an intentional difference between rspec and minitest and i simply need to logout the user after each test

9755245
ember.js	backbone.js
ember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.js

9755276
width	height
adding width and height dimensions to that are half of image s real pixel size is a good way to serve high dpi images although it is going to waste some bandwidth on regular-dpi screens

9755302
folder	directory
in my home directory creating folder like bin local lib and python was looking for its packages there where there were none

9755314
post	put
basically put the contents of your search in a dictionary make a post call to the server and read your response

9755341
hide	show
the user ggg has kindly gave me an example of how to show and hide stuff using css itâ s here

9755341
hide	show
the stuff that show hide has a css class and itâ s not adjacent to the checkbox example

9755358
redhat	fedora
for rpm support is listed for redhat centos which seems to imply it would also work on newer fedora releases

9755374
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome all the top links work where as on firefox they don t do anything

9755384
onresume	onpause
at second onresume after onpause hit the home button then reaccess the app the black screen occurs

9755397
scikit-learn	libsvm
i recommend libsvm for this and the scikit-learn implementation is easy to use for this in python

9755485
google-chrome	safari
ie google-chrome and safari do not append the loading image

9755488
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
html and html5 is supported on all major browsers internet explorer firefox opera google-chrome and safari

9755501
portrait	landscape
as has been mentioned it is possible to specify that you want to handle configuration changes such as orientation yourself or even force only one landscape or portrait

9755501
portrait	landscape
some layouts may work fine in portrait but not in landscape or vice versa and the aim of the designed approach to destroy recreate the current visible activity is meant to accommodate that

9755623
gentoo	linux
i m using gentoo linux and issuing the following command to compile

9755641
post	get
i ve been unable to get a model to post to the next view no matter what i try

9755753
int	double
under the hood it only has storage types 64-bit int sqlite_integer 64-bit float double sqlite_float blob binary sqlite_blob and string sqlite_text

9755756
ubuntu	linux
i am using eclipse on an ubuntu linux server

9755761
setinterval	settimeout
i would recommend using setinterval instead of settimeout

9755785
for-loop	loops
instead of a for-loop i m using a construct called a named let which permits the initialization of some iteration variables i in this case initialized to 0 and the repeated execution of a recursive procedure loops in this case producing an effect similar to a for even in performance

9755786
children	parent
in this case it is #select1 i dont want to manually travel through the dom with prev parent children etc. because my form structure can change in the future like add fieldset td tr etc.

9755788
jar	war
either in the war jar ear lib or in some server lib

9755815
stdout	fflush
and then you need to force it to refresh and force the output to stdout with fflush stdout before sleeping

9755827
hide	show
build the form2 ahead of time and use setvisible true to show it and and setvisible false to hide it

9755868
hide	show
one thought is to possibly load all the data for the helper upfront which may allow me to show hide something while it loads the data

9755871
lxml	beautifulsoup
but really you should avoid using regex for parsing html use beautifulsoup or lxml instead

9755874
calloc	malloc
but after some reading i see a lot of people allocating the memory directly without calloc or malloc like this

9755894
width	text-align
the has text-align center so the will be centred if the size of the is less than the width of the

9755905
expression-blend	silverlight
now i know all of that can be done in silverlight w xaml and expression-blend

9755906
intersect	contains
the rectangle class has the methods intersect and contains

9755929
calloc	malloc
a good rule of thumb about when to allocate memory on the heap via malloc calloc is if you need to use it outside of the function

9755965
post	get
when attempting to post a new gist i get the following error

9755972
folder	directory
changed directory to the src folder in the source code

9756011
hide	show
i have this code that should show and hide element outputs according to specific checkboxes

9756016
google-chrome	firefox
the photo slideshow can t display on google-chrome but it looks perfect on firefox

9756016
google-chrome	firefox
and by the way the favicon can t show in google-chrome either but successfully in firefox

9756077
put	get
given the basicness of these coding errors i suggest you improve your coding skills before attempting to put something onto a public-facing webserver or you re likely to get your site pwn3d in short order

9756094
vim	emacs	macvim	emacs
i just made the switch to vim from emacs using macvim with janus

9756094
vim	emacs
which also brings me to ask - is there a way to compile in vim similar to emacs where you type meta-x compile and then are able to click on errors to bring the cursor to the relevant line

9756143
client-side	server-side
if you need precise values for these dates for instance to properly order when this or that action was done relative to another user s action you can t rely on the client-side date library anyways and you need to calculate the dates server-side based on when the client contacted you

9756143
client-side	server-side
remember as well that basically all of your client-side code can be modified by the client and malicious values returned instead you can only guarantee the code on the server-side -- treat the client-side like a possible attacker

9756200
getter	setter
every example i have seen regarding object serialization includes an all field constructor and a getter and setter method for every field

9756222
getter	setter
there are no requirements for the existence of getter setter or constructors of a certain form though there may be other legitimate reasons to want those

9756225
google-chrome	firefox
tested in both google-chrome and firefox with identical behavior

9756232
getter	setter
the constructor getter setter are not mandatory

9756340
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in my project sometimes i set in - void viewdidload sometimes i set in - void viewwillappear bool animated

9756343
mouse	keyboard
and i would like to not have to touch the mouse at all nor the keyboard so i would like to have the playback started as soon as the page appears

9756361
spine.js	sproutcore
good like - spine.js knockout.js sproutcore etc etc.

9756366
post	get
what need to be pass in post_type to get data from books regular post

9756398
tcpdf	fpdi
afaik this is not possible with pure tcpdf - you can combine it with fpdi v 1.2.1 and up

9756398
fpdf	fpdi
fpdf together with fpdi

9756411
google-chrome	firefox
it is okay if the solution only works on google-chrome and firefox

9756488
range	median
mean median mode range - java

9756511
realloc	malloc
an alternative version would use malloc for the initial allocation and realloc thereafter

9756539
equals	gethashcode
i saw the question posed here have i implemented equals gethashcode correctly

9756547
put	get
i ll create a webservice to handle with database on host and use some cross-platform framework to building an app then connect to webservice in order to get and put data to server

9756590
hash	salt
they can t be sequential ids and make sure that they re not trivially forgeable even if someone has a bunch of different ids for example you might want to salt the username and then hash it

9756613
google-chrome	firefox
while the html file displays correctly in dev mode when i actually try to run it directly from the war directory a blank screen is shown in ie firefox and google-chrome

9756622
coalesce	isnull
use full join clause and check on null using any available function in your dbms like isnull or coalesce

9756624
union	distinct
actually i need the distinct values from multiple union statements but i do not getting this

9756632
int	chars
also you are writing sizeof a or 100 int into fp2 for every chars

9756664
width	height
so if you wanted km pixel near the middle of the view for instance you could take the width and height of the plugin divide them by two then offset in each direction by 10 pixels do the hittest query find the distance between the returned coordinates then finally divide by 10

9756693
comparator	comparable
further more if you want to sort your own objects collection provide the facility to sort them using comparable and comparator

9756755
for-loop	arrays
second thing is if you widen your i scope by declaring this outside the for-loop you still not get all the arrays element because you are not looping each of element

9756758
stdout	fflush
print something in . foo doesn t fflush its stdout buffer if it is redirected to the pipe in this case when stdout is not connected a tty-like device to an interactive console

9756789
spaces	linefeed
however if you re generating the value of an attribute this assigned value will be normalized by the dom as soon as it will be set so all whitespaces spaces tab cr linefeed will be compressed stripping leading and trailing whitespaces and reducing all middle sequences of whitespaces into a single spaces

9756789
spaces	linefeed
note that this trick will not work to preserve other whitespaces spaces tab linefeed even if they are represented by ncr because the normalization of all whitespaces with the exception of the ncr to cr is mandatory in all attributes

9756789
gif	png
such non-plain text strings would also be the result of reading from a binary file such as an png gif or jpeg image file or from your javascript reading from a binary-safe network socket such that the io stream passes 16-bit code units rather than just 8-bit units most binary i o streams are byte-based anyway and text i o streams need that you specify a charset to decode files into plain-text so that invalid encodings found in the text stream will throw an i o exception in your script

9756793
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
make sure your for-loop is actually a fast enumeration loops rather than using the count of the arrays as a loops integer

9756820
uigesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
you could also have a look at uigesturerecognizer in particular uiswipegesturerecognizer

9756858
wadl	wsdl
wadl is an alternative to wsdl for restful web services

9756879
post	get
i have tried a number of sites and tried using different http methods post vs get and i keep getting the same error

9756891
stateless	stateful
a saga can be just a stateless coordinator but it can also be stateful so it knows which commands would have to to be compensated in case a subsequent one has failed

9756891
saga	cqrs
just google cqrs saga and go from there

9756900
min	max
but i m not fully satisfied because on different devices there are different constants like types of events min and max values etc. and i ll have to either parse them from getevent -p or specify a configuration file

9756938
nsstring	nsdata
you can t serialize your item class to a property list since it isn t a property list object nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary

9756948
firebird	bde
i am rewriting an existing bde database program to use firebird using the fibplus components

9756976
equals	gethashcode
why not just override equals and gethashcode

9756991
dia	visio
microsoft visio is unaffordable so i tried using dia v0.97.2

9757022
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to work against other browsers google-chrome firefox then you ll need to implement the data framing describe in rfc 6455

9757055
disk	ram
i only have a i7 core and 8 gb ram and 2 tb hard disk

9757055
postgresql	mysql
i have tried postgresql mysql kyoto cabinet with fine tuning with protostuff encoding

9757077
equals	compareto
note that it is not required if two classes are equals according to the compareto they don t have to hold equals

9757077
equals	compareto
however in this particular case you might want to add secondary attributes to comparator if ages are equals so sorting is always stable and predictable across same-aged people so after all including the same attributes in compareto might be a good idea in some cases

9757085
put	get
to test and validate this you could create a bean and mark it as lazy initialization and another bean with no lazy initialization default eager put the log statement in both of them s constructor the beaneager s constructor would get invoked as soon as contextt gets loaded but beanlazy s constructor would get invoked only when you try to actually fetch that bean from context

9757088
client-side	server-side
we use mustache and use the same templates for rendering in php server-side and javascript client-side

9757091
firefox	safari
so even firefox or safari web browsers can consume these applications

9757103
apache	nginx
i noticed that the problem seems to stem from the fact that the php script gets only one parameter src into the array with nginx but with apache rewrite it s broken down to different parameters.

9757109
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox google-chrome safari but ie throws security blocker

9757136
google-chrome	firefox
my background images appear in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie 8

9757138
chown	chmod	777	tmp
created chmod 777 and chown www-data www-data the tmp apache2-dgb-dump set

9757144
for-loop	loops
if you want a loops that always includes an increment even when you continue consider a for-loop which would be a better choice for this situation in any case

9757168
istream	getline
since every is a char array with a fixed size you can easily use std istream getline

9757172
post	get
redirects are get not post

9757296
min	max
edited first try found the min instead of the max

9757306
min	max
also when it is more efficient to use the built-in min and max functions

9757374
post	get
you can get all post of a group using fql for example here are all of the messages posted in a group feed

9757384
portrait	landscape
i have taken gccalendar which only works in portrait orientation and extended it to work in landscape similar to how the iphone s calendar app works

9757384
portrait	landscape
so when the phone is in portrait orientation the cgcalendar is instantiated from the apps main view controller using the original portrait view class and when in landscape orientation using the new modified landscape view class

9757390
portrait	landscape
so far i m able to apply the effect when from portrait go to landscape but not viceversa

9757390
portrait	landscape
in this way i have the desired effect when passing from portrait to landscape but when i put the device back to portrait it doesn t load the portraitview the landscapeview remains on

9757390
portrait	landscape
but i have the big issue that when i switch back from landscape to portrait the landscapeview remains on the portraitview

9757400
folder	directory
2 next navigate into the library folder inside the root of the actionbarsherlock directory checked out from github

9757409
multiplying	add
you then do the equation above which is really fast look at accelerate s fused add and multiplying

9757411
maven	pom.xml
its resources were set up in a pom.xml which i built using maven

9757464
versioning	upgrade
if the user first tries free versioning and acquire for example 10 gold and then upgrade to paid versioning i want him to keep those 10 gold and not do a fresh start

9757499
rdf	owl
for more you can check out the answers in this essentially the same question what is the difference between rdf and owl

9757524
inherited	properties
it seems one have to inherited from a lower level control to initialize the vertextbuffer with more properties

9757526
lisp	scheme
recently i started using emacs as my scheme lisp editor

9757560
mockups	usability
if you want to dig deeper and have better understanding of design principles and usability concepts behind a successful product or if you are yet to come up with wireframes page mockups etc. the reading list expands

9757570
appdata	uninstaller
note that file under appdata folder will uninstaller together with your app

9757576
next	except
the next code will halt all the above clients except pgadmin3

9757605
int	chars
so it promotes the chars to an unsigned int sign extending as necessary and then prints out the resulting value

9757672
button	checkbox
this is a really tough problem as far as i know and i don t know that much changing the checkbox from the button will not fire its change event but since you re using a function you can just change the attribute then fire the redraw function

9757672
button	checkbox
you could modify this a little and have a button for each checkbox if you wanted

9757708
jar	manifest.mf
an option may be to declare jar file dependencies in meta-inf manifest.mf file thanks to the class-path attribute

9757716
apache	nginx
you can hook it up behind nginx or apache so they would do the static file exchange but since you want to use websockets then it shouldnt be good idea

9757723
put	get
is there a good way to get all thread objects pointers and put them in one place so i can manipulate those threads

9757733
hide	show
to have better performance with many hidden columns i would recommend you to call showcol or hidecol inside of beforeprocessing and hide show the columns on the empty grid

9757736
wordpress	phpbb
how can integrate wordpress blog and phpbb forum in codeigniter

9757757
put	get
right now im using an infinite while loop with a getasynckeystate inside to get any typed letters but i dont know how to take that information and change it and put it back into system.

9757760
width	height
this way your label will be considered as a block for everything width and height related and your 100 width will be applied successfully leading to a nicely centered text

9757860
children	parent
you can traverse the relationship from parent to children not sure if child is a to-many or a to-one though and again out to the grandchild

9757908
mamp	wamp
on windows i used wamp with fairly few problems and on osx i m using mamp

9757909
width	margin
now i tried to treat it as a block-element using width and margin to position it correctly but somehow it failed

9757914
jtextfield	jlabel
ive read some guides on the net that talk about using a jtextfield to simulate a jlabel however this is no use to me as i my jlabel will span multiple lines

9757925
versioning	upgrade
i m looking for the easiest and the most recommended way to upgrade mongodb versioning standalone server and mongodb shell

9757925
versioning	upgrade
if someone knows an easier way to only upgrade the mongodb versioning i would really thank him her

9757930
folder	directory
directory of folder

9757945
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i know i can read and write data using fileinputstream and fileoutputstream respecitvely

9757956
profiling	instrumentation
when profiling my app in instrumentation for memory leaks it shows leaks at the following function

9757960
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i would use a jeditorpane or jtextpane

9757963
margin	height
line height padding margin tables etc

9758019
filesystems	hfs+
in particular the hfs+ filesystems uses utf-8 encoding and a normalisation form close to d which requires composed characters like ã to be decomposed into oâ

9758028
int	double
in this code sample from i was shocked to learn that in class derived f int and f double are not visible

9758041
int	double
essentially hides base f int and base f double

9758078
width	height
i want to set width and height to my newly created linearlayout

9758079
int	chars
i am writing a code which uses templates to support int datatype and chars datatype

9758123
onchange	onkeyup
you need to use a key event either onkeypress or onkeyup in combination with the onchange event

9758131
keydown	keyup
i believe the correct event you need to bind to is the keydown event as shown at or perhaps keyup depending on the behaviour you need

9758151
bmp	png
i want to get as string the image extension for example jpg png bmp ecc. of the images loaded from the gallery or picked from the camera

9758239
onchange	onkeyup
you should try the onkeyup method because onchange only fires when your textbox loses focus and in the case that someone pastes something into you textbox your should try the onpaste method this combination should work fine

9758277
src	attr
var the_image_src this attr src

9758333
ontouchevent	ondraw
in the on ontouchevent method you just only need to take the cordinates of the touch and draw the picture into ondraw method

9758403
emgucv	opencvsharp
i recently shifted my project library from emgucv to opencvsharp

9758480
midi	osc
i have a good understanding of connecting to my laptop via wifi to this point transmitting and receiving midi and osc messages but after a two days of searching the net and dev documentation i just cannot figure where to start with the keystroke emulation and transmission

9758493
dbcontext	objectcontext
i managed to create a model first dbcontext model before it was a normal objectcontext derived model

9758498
std	ostream
error default argument given for parameter 1 of void fa write std ostream const

9758512
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
i use caliburn.micro and contentcontrol to show currently active viewmodel

9758513
ceil	floor
in python floor and ceil round to the next higher or lower integer

9758596
versioning	upgrade
if you re absolutely reliant on the .net 1.1 versioning of random then the only thing i can think of is to create a new assembly that targets 1.1 and call that from your upgrade .net 4 application

9758638
keydown	keyup
if you want the background to change only while the key is down you need to set it on keydown and set it back on keyup

9758638
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup return key codes not character codes but as far as the alphabet keys go it is safe to treat them as if they were character codes for the uppercase letters

9758688
wtl	atl
if you re interested in more modern c++ frameworks for windows consider using wtl and atl instead of mfc

9758691
button	checkbox
i have had this problem before with other things that checkbox also different types of jquery mobile button won t appear as they should when added by javascript

9758712
int	chars
the chars value passed to printf is extended to an int before the call to printf

9758712
int	chars	unsigned	short
int so chars short unsigned chars unsigned short are converted to int

9758712
int	chars
it never passes a chars unsigned chars signed chars as a single byte it always passes an int

9758712
int	chars
the chars value is interpreted by my mac s gcc compiler as signed chars so the compiler generates code to sign extended the chars to the int before the printf call

9758712
int	chars
where the signed chars value has its top sign bit set x80 the conversion to int sign extends the chars value

9758712
int	chars
where the signed chars value has its top sign bit clear x70 the conversion to int still sign extends the chars value

9758712
int	chars
but it is printing the entire int it happens that the value is 0x00000070 and 0x00000080 because the unsigned chars values were converted to

9758712
int	chars
you can force printf to only print the low byte of the int by using suitable formatting hhx so this correctly prints only the value in the original chars

9758712
int	chars
because printf interprets the hhx to treat the int as an unsigned chars

9758712
int	chars
this does not change the fact that the chars was sign extended to an int before printf was called

9758751
hide	show
if user already logined in facebook then i have to hide name section in my add comment form if not it need to show name and comment fields

9758782
erd	diagram
is there a way for me to generate an entity relationship diagram erd from sqlyog

9758793
postgresql	mysql
in mysql .uniq works in postgresql not

9758801
width	height
well meaning width and height added up would be quite senseless as this doesn t say anything about the size a 8000x192 -texture has quite a different size than a 4096x4096 -texture

9758819
spaces	delimiter
since the original string already contains those spaces delimiter try

9764148
capistrano	rvm
this all sound very hard but in practice for us at least creating a user account that was the one that apps ran as and installing rvm as that user with a little other setup made it all just work especially for cases where you re running rake bundle capistrano and other stuff

prepare statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

9765233
tabs	tabpanel
closest i can suggest to a workaround except for putting a scrollpanel inside the tablayoutpanel instead would be to know the height of the current tab s contents add to that the height of just the tabs themselves and assign that as the height of the tabpanel

rvm	bundler
the bundler approach i ve been playing with using rbenv instead of rvm but i don t understand the workflow as clearly

9771172
rvm	bundler
bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies. there is a plugin rbenv-gemset for getting the same results as rvm s gemsets but sam clearly favors using bundler instead

9771227
width	margin
margin 5 and finally the image within the cell div is styled at width 100

9771241
width	height
if you need to keep the width change the width and the height to the height it was with the desired width

9771265
width	height
you just specify the width and height attributes and the image will be displayed in that size

9771277

django	web2py
and for last cgi scripts are rather 20th century internet - if you want to develop a python web application or site i seriously recommend you to move to a provider where you have shell acess preferably a vps and do your project in a modern framework such as django or web2py - you willb e reinventing the wheel several times over developing using cgi and its performance is as bad as it can be since it will runa separate instance of the python interpreter for each incoming http request

9771572
post	get
anyway if you head over there and maybe post on their forums or look at some of the examples you should get the idea

9771612

9771696
getter	setter
at last you can also define your own getter and setter

9771699
stdout	stderr

9771699
stdout	stderr
here the stderr fd for the echo process is set to the stdout fd

9771699
stdout	stderr
then the stdout fd is set to the stderr fd accomplishing nothing since the new assignment is the same as the current value

9771699
stdout	stderr
here the stdout fd of the echo process is set to the stderr fd

9771699
stdout	stderr
the function s stdout fd is set to dev null and the function s stderr fd is set to the value of the stdout fd which is of course dev null

9771703

9772171
post	get
my solution basically involved growing two additional controller actions get and post

9772171
post	get
the additional createbytype controller actions get and post only needs to deal with the abstract base because it requests the instance from the service layer passing the enum value

9772199
folder	directory
virtual directory has web.config and folder bin with dll inside

9772218
int	double
the rating value will be the partial view s model object as an int or double use it like you would in a normal view

9772377
hash	salt
without salt an attacker can use an offline attack to precalculate the hash of common passwords secret qwerty etc

9772377
hash	salt
no salt allows an attacker to tell when different users are using the same password as they will have the same hash

9772377
hash	salt
salt prevents precalculation and avoids the matching hash problem

9772377
hash	salt
rather than storing hash password + salt you store hash n password + salt where n is large enough for the overall calculation to take at least 0.1 second

9772396
getter	setter
i also tried instantiating the coredata itemdata object using a standard init but now understand this won t work because coredata doesn t understand the context and also doesn t have getter setter for the properties

9772561
rational-numbers	integer
will it only do integer maths 5 3 1 or use floating point 5 3 1.6666667 or perhaps use arbitrary size rational-numbers to get extreme accuracy

9772561
multiplying	add
and operator handling might be split into multiplying divide add etc

9772561
subtraction	addition
i tend to like working from the top down start with the user interface but working from the bottom up is equally good start with routines to do addition subtraction etc

9772576
range	max
basically the inner two mean take the mean of the input array and the outer max will find the maximum value over the range

9772586
hide	show
in a rails 3 app using jquery i m trying to dynamically show hide form elements based on whether a boolean field is true or false

9772621
notepad	scite
sometimes scite and also programmers notepad stop handling error messages that dmd.exe outputs

9772623
action-filter	onactionexecuting
however if you implement your own action-filter you can override onactionexecuting and inspect the action parameters in filtercontext.actionparamters

9772746
stagefright	opencore
both devices seem to use stagefright for the media framework as opposed to opencore

9772757
apache	nginx
this is not exactly an answer but if by any chance you re using apache and mod_jk only as a proxy to gf as we did for years - install nginx and forget about apache

9772812
realloc	malloc
generally speaking since you don t know how many tokens will be in the result you ll need to allocate the array dynamically using malloc realloc and or some equivalent

9772831
onclick	onsubmit
call your validatemail function at the forms onsubmit event instead of one of the buttons onclick event

9772837
sorting	grouping
a way to tie the two fields sorting of grouping should also sort dt

9772923

9772933
post	put
whats the best practice on post and put operations

9772935
width	height
i can t post you the correct code but i think you must use fill_parent for width and height

9772970
folder	directory
this does not seem to be a general issue in the kernel since the temp folder live from the fact that concurrent access to a directory must be possible

9772970
put	get
you can put only one read only file into the source directories to get a fast copy and many concurrent directory accesses

9772972
mapquest	directions
the android maps api uses the mapquest directions web service for routing functions

9772976
mvp	presenter
i am trying to develop a project management system in my application following the model view presenter mvp pattern

9772976

my question is this i have seen numerous examples of mvp but i haven t seen one with one presenter and multiple views

9772983
versioning	upgrade
if this is indeed fixed in the newest versioning of rails 3.2 confirmed with a github commit then i ll upgrade instead

9773002
for-loop	arrays
because by the time your callback method is called the for-loop has finished executing and i is set to the highest index in your arrays + 1

9773030
getter	setter
you can use properties and synthesize property to auto-implement instance variables along with getter and setter methods

9773070
ria	smartclient
i am investigating the possibility of implementing a ria involving lots of grid-based views think excel using a combination of django or rails and smartclient smartclient.com or extjs

9773109
post	put	post	get	put	get
all the standard verbs get put delete post head options do not have this problem

9773112
post	put	post	get	put	get
post put get are all http verbs and do not in and of themselves indicate a format for transferring the data so there is no post format

9773135
put	get
that works great and gives me a table that has the needed columns but i am stuck as to how and get each users answer and put it under the appropriate column

9773141

versioning	upgrade
but we want upgrade those files to versioning 1.7.1 and 1.8.18 respectively

9773250
ienumerable	iqueryable
entity framework s iqueryable implementation is more picky about creating new objects in objects than regular linq to objects ienumerable

9773260
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i had declared objectinputstream and objectoutputstream as private and had made it global

9773281
union	distinct
you need to create an equality comparer and use it in the union or distinct see here

9773287

for example commonly it is used in conjunction with http verbs like get put delete and post to represent the common functions of lookup inserting deleting and updating a record

9773304
children	parent
got parent id then applied changes to it s children only

9773307
versioning	upgrade
if you need help with an upgrade path that you re having issues with have a look at the release notes between the versioning

9773318
width	height
if i set the div and the image s width and height to 100 it takes the window s height not the wrapper s

9773324
stdout	stderr
at this point the stdout and stderr results from the command will be stored in those two lexicals

9773325
put	get
yet when i put an alert in that loop both get saved

9773327
fadein	fadeout
if you just want them to slide up and down rather than fadein and fadeout you can use the built-in animations .slideup and .slidedown

9773347
installation	upgrade
besides the issue of the cost of add-ons which imo is worthwhile you also add complexity to your installation the more software you add to it making it more time consuming to troubleshoot bugs and to upgrade ee

9773366
width	height
you can set the width and height manually

9773387
gif	png
right now i generate it as a png or gif and stick it in my sql database in an image field

during initial testing for membership.validateuser with a sqlmembershipprovider i use a hash sha1 algorithm combined with a salt and if i changed the salt length to a length not divisible by four i received this error

9773523
folder	directory
make sure the files are uploaded only to directory that are not directly accessible from the web use the .net app_data folder or a folder outside of the iis root

9773524
gif	png
magento only accept jpg jpeg gif png image types

9773535
post	get
so i see there has already been a post very similar to this issue however i am in a situation where i have no power to specify the location of this file within my jar and so am hoping someone is aware of a solution to get around this

9773553
integer	fractions	ceil	floor
ceil floor an integer always bigger smaller than a given value if it has any fractions part

9773596
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	md5	salt	md5	scrypt	salt	scrypt	md5	scrypt	pbkdf2
however please use a cryptographically secure slow hashing algorithm such as bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 - not salt md5

9773596
hash	salt
these would be hash but not salt and would not have any account association stored

9773596
hash	salt
when this user next attempts to log in and their hash salt password matches the hash salt value stored in their account record the unsalted hash password taken from their user input is stored in the fraudulent password list

9773603
min	max
in the case where min 32 and max 46 then i would like php to automatically the value to the nearest 5 10 in this case min 30 and max 50

9773603
min	max
but in the instance of course if min 35 or 40 and max 40 or 45 there would be no need to round off

9773603
range	infinity
it needs to work for a range of numbers ranging from 0 to infinity

9773624
width	height
width and height both 50

9773624
width	height
width and height both 75 etc.

9773624
width	height
so when they select an image with the jfilechooser and click open i need to validate the image size and if it doesn t have square dimensions i need to present the user with a dialog informing them the image must have the same width and height

9773717
width	height
when an element isn t displayed it has no height or width

9773721
width	height
that is just to get the css attribute a hidden object has no height or width so you ll need to display it get the measurments and hide it

9773782
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

9773783
vmware	virtualbox
the bad news is this means ultimately that the linux host hypervisor vmware virtualbox on the host must know to process that information and pass it out to the appropriate location

9773785
post	get
get the email and password from a post request

9773785
everyauth	connect	express	everyauth
passport an authentication library that depends on connect express similar to what everyauth offers

9773788
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

9773795
width	height
i was wondering if its possible to get the dimensions of the images with javascript or html5 before the image loads and then go in with jscript html5 and set width and height attributes to the tags on the initial page load-- before the images fully have loaded

9773795
width	height
edit i cannot use the width and height html attributes off the bat since the images are from all different sources with no pre-known width and height its mostly random user posted images

9773803
hide	show
the fragment hide show example provided by google should give you some good ideas

9773830
hide	show
basically looking to hide show table rows when a tickbox is clicked with jquery

9773869
width	height
this is what the height and width attributes are for on the element

9773869
width	height
set those to the height width of the image and that space will be reserved by the renderer

9773874
google-chrome	firefox
it is entirely possible this is a firefox issue as i am using firefox 11.0 and it seems to work in google-chrome

9773890
profiling	debugging
what i find strange is that while in debugging profiling xcode this error goes undetected and the for-loop executes without issue

9773890
profiling	debugging
what flags are responsible for letting this kind of mistake execute in debugging profiling

9773936
folder	dir
i m storing my content in library caches dir seems to work fairly ok except for localized html content when i was storing it in app s bundle i had lang_code.lproj folder and had no issues

9773936
folder	dir
know that i migrated all those lproj folder in caches dir localized content won t load

9773945
versioning	upgrade
2 upgrade your versioning of ssrs if it s not the latest but check it is worthwhile doing the upgrade first

9773960
printf	strcpy	strcat	gets
finally many functions such as strcpy strcat and printf do no bounds checking but since they don t deal with external input like gets does they can be used in a safe manner

9773980
put	get
simply put you use math.round to get a random index for your display object array in this example that happens here

9773990
folder	directory
as long as you have .lproj folder in that directory you should be able to access localized resources in the same way

9773991
maven	pom.xml
is there a way to find use the library objects with maven so that i can specify them in my pom.xml or am i stuck with individual entries for each individual .jar file

9774064
hide	show
there is the ajax version cooler but more complicated and the simple show hide

9774065
jboss	weblogic
i am not sure what you are using jboss websphere weblogic etc and i am no expert on any of them we stopped using ejbs a long time ago but any time you get a noclassdeffound error it means the current classloader the one that loaded the .class your code id in cannot find a referenced class

9774086
profiling	debugging
when compiled for the debugging profiling the storage for variables can shift around compared to release

9774096
put	get
my main goal is to unzip cbr cbz files archives containing only images jpg png i am trying to put each of these images on a arraylist so the zipinputstream to arraylist was my plan to eventually get them to bitmaps but if you can get them to bitmaps straight from the zipinputstream would be great

9774126
for-loop	arrays
it only gives me the first entry in the php arrays so it seems like everytime the for-loop is repeated its initialising the php file from scratch and so setting the counter to 0

9774159
ant	maven
eclipse netbeans and intellij are all pretty good at building projects from maven or ant build files

9774159
hudson	bamboo
with this solution you have a simple build that is easy to setup in ci hudson bamboo whatever and you don t have any ide specific files checked in

9774169
ienumerable	iqueryable
i notice that it s expecting an ienumerable generic rather than an iqueryable which is strange

9774169
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can t cast ienumerable to an iqueryable without doing an asqueryable

9774169
ienumerable	iqueryable
the question then is why is it giving me an ienumerable instead of an iqueryable

9774195
for-loop	loops
if it is false the body of loops does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement past the for-loop

9774208
post	get
what you need is to authenticate the user requesting user_groups permission to access groups information and than retrieve feed to get images associated with post

9774208
post	get
than iterate over post to get images

9774216
width	height
i ve even got a video css rule that sets the width and height but the video isn t sized to fit the box like the top row examples

9774216
width	height
yes i ve put the height and width into the video tag itself too

9774228
portrait	landscape
in my case for example i needed to show one bitmap for landscape and one for portrait

9774307
post	get
you need to get access_token for the page - read this on how to get the right access_token just change the permissions to what you need - facebook post image and description to wall and in page album via php

9774320
width	height
i am pretty much a beginner at this stuff but it would seem if left and width work with a percentage shouldn t top and height

9774329
google-chrome	safari
when done this way where the css change happens while the transitions class is not applied to the element but is applied immediately after some browsers google-chrome and safari in my testing still apply the css transition when by my logic it should just snap to the new location

9774329
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome or safari click the no delay button and see that it does still animate the position of the box while the delay button which uses a timeout set for one millisecond later doesn t animate the css change

9774329
google-chrome	safari
as indicated in the jsfiddle i m having to use a settimeout call to get the proper behavior in google-chrome and safari

9774375
chown	chmod
i am sure we could do a chown or chmod in terminal but this isn t really a great solution

9774383
width	height
let point p half the width and height of the element using getcomputedstyle if necessary

9774396

9774427
hide	show
it wraps the show operation in a try finally block that that hide the modal form on the way out

9774495
lisp	scheme
among other modes that help me write lisp are hideshow mode for folding of sexps slime which is primarily for common lisp but i use it s indentation capabilities in scheme too low-contrast color theme called solarized with which my eyes don t fatigue any more and heavily mutated vim mode which permits me to keep my keybindings manageable through editing modes

9774520
for-loop	arrays
then length of the arrays is 2 arr1.length so this for-loop should work properly

9774540
post	get
namely you have to get a bunch of proxies so you can get past the rate limiting and the 302s + captcha pages that they post up any time they get suspicious about your activity.

9774550
put	get
for instance if you create an object and put in in a instance1 reference you get the instance1 method

9774550
put	get
if you take the same object put it in an instance2 reference you will get the instance2 method

9774560
submit	submission
you can create a function in ajax that submit the form to save the data entered by the user without submission before idling

9774568
fgets	getline
just use fgets to load lines or getline if you have it

9774655

i believe you have to add a -m to the jar command to use the manifest.mf file you are specifying

9774675
int	double
the crash problem still rears its ugly head when i use the istringstream to convert an int long short and then use that same stream to convert a float or double

jar	war
how to load resource from jar file packaged in a war file

9774824
int	double
value types are typically your simple basic types like int double etc

9774824
int	double
when you pass value types like int and double then you are passing a copy of the value so if you pass int x 10 into a method a change to x in the method won t be reflected once you leave the method

9774865
client-side	server-side
it can be done in both client-side and server-side

9774886
for-loop	arrays
in the one argument constructor i use a for-loop to go through the file and put each character into the appropriate arrays index

9774936
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
also you could consider using backbone.js or some similar javascriptmvc framework

9774948
hide	show
my suggestion would be to change these to classes and use jquery to hide show

9774958
cos	sin
since then cos beta 1 and so sin beta 0

9774975
superclass	subclassing
the super keyword allows you to tell the compiler that you want to call a method from the superclass without checking if the method is overridden in subclassing

9774987
margin	height
the next element that clears the 0 height parent container will automatically add a top margin to properly accomodate for the collapsed height of the previous parent containers

g++	gcc
ps as compiler i use g++ part of gcc 4.6.1 under ubuntu 11.10

9775022
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i ve successfully used objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to serialize and deserialize objects for a server and client i am writing

9775024
children	parent
floated children do not contribute to the height of their parent unless they are contained

9775024
padding	overlapping
as to why adding 1px of padding to .view results in much more spacing than that right now the p tag margins are overlapping the .view box and the li bottom margins

if you wanted to keep it make the variables class variables and provide getter and setter for them

9775253
ant	maven
i would recommend to use the maven plugin instead of ant calls

9775279
inotifycollectionchanged	ilist
however if you want a more complex check you might just implement an ilist inotifycollectionchanged and throw some custom exceptions if the criteria are not met when adding new items

9775284
g++	gcc
we re using gcc g++ 4.4.3 in linux

9775313

google-chrome	safari
not knowing how any of the browsers apply styles i could guess that safari and google-chrome do some optimizations to not have to re-flow the page after every style update

9775333
put	get
this works because you are forcing the browser to stop and evaluate the css so that you can get the value of left although you could put any valid css attribute in the second .css call

9775376
innodb	myisam
so you need to recover the data from somewhere - either a backup of your db made using mysqldump or of your file system the data files of myisam tables are all simply structured and on the disk - recovering innodb tables are complicated by the shared use of ibdata files

nsmutablestring	nsstring
since mutablecopy returns id referencing a nsmutablestring the assignment to an nsstring is ok by the compiler id can be assigned to anything so compile time it s ok

9775476
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the mutablecopy message returns a copy of your string as a nsmutablestring object which can be assigned to a nsstring as nsmutablestring derives from it

sse	avx
unfortunately even though avx features a _mm256_hadd_pd instruction it differs in the result from the sse version

9775538
sse	avx
i believe this is due to the fact that most avx instructions work as sse instructions for each low and high 128-bits separately without ever crossing the 128-bit boundary

9775547
spaces	delimiter
moreover if you transmit that as text you need to consider more bytes used as delimiter for example using a spaces you ll need n - 1 extra bytes

9775737
button	checkbox
while your control may look like a button it behaves like a checkbox in the sense that it has two states

9775738
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox 11 google-chrome on windows even if the user navigates somewhere else and then uses the back button they get the page with their latest edits

you can t use findviewbyid from the oncreate method to search for a view that is in a listview row layout

9775826
getter	setter
since the only connection to the models was from tableview s model property - which is just a wrapper for c++ getter and setter - ruby thought it lost the reference to my models and gc d them

scheduler is an add-on for running jobs on your app at scheduled time intervals much like cron in a traditional server environment

9775897
post	get
well to get a full answer you need to post the fields in your two tables but it should something of this sort

9775916
int	chars
it contains the function chrw that gives the chars from a unicode value passed as int

9775921
stdout	stderr
node doesn t seem to have anything like system or sh -- it looks like the nearest equivalents are child_process.spawn and child_process.exec but neither of them wires up stdout or stderr so you can t see any output from the child process unless you do some extra work

9775937
innodb	myisam
is it worth changing my tables over to myisam in order to make use of fulltext or are there other benefits of innodb that mean i should make do with my like keyword search solution

9775952
min	max
i figure i need to wait until the query is applied and then iterate through the markers to find the min max x y locations and pan to that rectangle but i don t see a way in the maps api to access the markers of a layer

9776011
stdout	stderr
displays output both stdout and stderr as the child process generates it so you see incremental output as the command runs

textview	listadapter
right now i have a custom listadapter and in the getview method i m programmatically changing the font color for each textview but that is very tedious

you will find the keys in a folder names .android in your home directory in linux user directory in windows

9776293
children	parent
in a sense it s required in ie7 for the parent elements to give z-index to it s children

9776307
implements	extends
there is libopkele basic_op which i need to extends and implements pure virtuals

9776308
children	parent
this works ok but has the problem that each parent row effectively has a seperate datagrid for the children so things like navigating with the keyboard don t work too well as the child rowdetails area is skipped over the only thing we navigate is the parent

9776326
innodb	myisam
instead of referring to wiki or other pages for comparisions check their myisam and innodb limitations on dev.mysql.com

how to do that using jython or jacl

9776443
innodb	myisam
i found a good article about innodb vs myisam that says this about performance

9776443
innodb	myisam
large margin in the benchmarks between myisam and innodb when the

9776443
innodb	myisam
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

9776495
portrait	landscape
what you can do is to create a dummy group with minheighttostartnewpage property set to something like 700 800 depends on your report design for portrait and 500 550 depends on your report design for landscape setup

9776505
min	max
i have a simple php script to let the user enter in min and max values from none some all of the attributes and then display a table with the corresponding lenses

9776611
put	get
i can get the pictures to float around my worksheet but i need to put them into a cell

9776618
children	parent
the trick being that the click handler is on the parent container not the individual children so when they are moved you don t need to keep managing their handlers

9776642
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

9776655
put	get
the best way that i have found to get such an architecture in place with grails is to use a message queue like rabbitmq for example with a series of queues one for each step in the pipeline and then have the controller s put messages into the first step of the pipeline

9776714
firefox	safari
what happens is that firefox croaks with a attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope error and safari doesn t get that error but doesn t load anything

9776716
subtract	add
in summary i need to produce a new list with the same number of elements as the input list and it must take the first or next numerical element to produce the resulting list using a specified number to add subtract values to

9776733
width	height
each div has a fixed width but an unknown arbitrary height

9776737
width	height
instead of setting the height and width properties of dridpanel use css to set the height and width - 500 and 980 when the media is screen and just set the width to 100 when the media is print

9776749
width	height
new code new image is the correct height width of rotated image still getting black bars

9776769
width	height
it seems to be using some kind of fixed aspect with only width being taken into consideration and the height being calculated from that

9776769
width	height
therefore the simplest solution in your case given that you have a fixed height is to reduce the width of the container therefore making contentflow calculate an smaller height

9776811
getter	setter
i tired writing my own getter and setter but it didn t work

9776829

in my maven pom.xml file i added a dependecy for my api bundle in the correct version like this

9776896
sudo	passwd
open terminal - type sudo su - enter passwd

9776966
width	height
you can also create a div width a height of 100 which will act as the body div

9776971
wordpress	phpbb
you can use to integrate the phpbb and wordpress logins and then you can use the phpbb login in codeigniter

9776972
puts	gets
i have a function that gets filenames from a directory and then puts them in an array

9776994
portrait	landscape
so if the device rotates from landscape to portrait while the dialog is visible then the edittext will be too wide for the screen

9777028
stdout	fflush
this is probably because you re piping the process s own stdout into a file and stdout normally doesn t close and fflush until after node.js starts to clean up the process

9777036
iboutlet	ibaction
typically you add iboutlet properties and ibaction methods to the object that will load a .xib such as an application delegate or a view controller

9777106
postgresql	mysql
as well as the default sqlite sqldf supports h2 mysql and postgresql

9777143

hide	show
you can just show hide the required option conditionally on change event of select element

9777206
spaces	delimiter
all the fields are delimiter by the spaces

9777215
stdout	stderr
i can write code to accept data from those pipes and write it to my process s stdout and stderr but if i do that the apis force me to sacrifice some flexibility

9777215
stdout	stderr
but exec insists on buffering the child process s stdout and stderr for me and giving them to me all at the end and it limits the size of those buffers configurable 200k by default

9777276
post	get
the post returns a subscription_task resource which can be monitored via get polling until the task is complete

9777278
background-color	transparency
i cannot simply remove the a hover class and replace it with another one of background-color transparency because my js still picks up the onhover function i could target onhover only for that changed class maybe..

9777286
hid	keyboard
i m currently developing a very smal and specific hid keyboard with a atmega microcontroller

9777286
hid	keyboard
i think the hid keycodes are really bad designed to support multiple keyboard layouts

9777295
min	max
min and max being variables that are rounded either to the nearest 5 or 10

9777295
range	max	range	min	min	max
how do you generate an output that counts in five within the min and max range in a table format

9777303
firefox	safari
you want to specify the content-type and content-dispisition headers like so - response.contenttype application vnd.ms-excel works in ie and firefox but not in safari then stream your file

9777309
int	chars
a chars is an array of chars and chars are one byte unsigned int

9777309
strtol	atoi
the function you re looking for is either atoi as mentioned by scott hunter or strtol which i prefer because of its error detecting behaviour

9777356
jobs	cron
the only reason we put the target app read-only is to prevent things like your taskqueues or cron jobs from running on partially copied data which could yield bad data in your target app

9777391
printf	strtol
i d use printf to convert it to a char reverse it with some simple arithmetic then use strtol to convert it back again

9777392
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
you can then use a for-loop to loops through the lines and the string type s split method to separate each line into another arrays and store the values in your formatted arrays

9777396
width	height
so what you want to do is do some trigonometric calculations beforehand to decide the maximum width height of the rotated image and combine that with the original width height

9777396
width	height
resize your image centering it using those dimensions rotate it and then crop it back to the width height of the rotated image

9777486
put	get
either way i would love to be able to get to the bottom of this and put it behind me

9777526
for-loop	loops
i was told to use a for-loop then switch to a do while loops

9777557
pop-up	dialog
if they have a view pop-up with a feed dialog with the wall post information

9777557
pop-up	dialog
after logging in they will be taken back to the app and the feed dialog view will pop-up

9777557
pop-up	dialog
the feed dialog pop-up but it is completely blank and dismisses automatically

9777564
squash	merge
now there have been substantive changes to foo and we d like to merge in those changes ideally squash them in

9777598
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
more and more browsers are supporting css3 and major browsers such as the latest versions of google-chrome ie safari opera and firefox covering over 90 of users certainly support it

9777611
put	get
i think you should get rid of the inner do-while and put outside the for-loop

9777622
for-loop	loops
regarding the use of a for-loop versus a do-while i m guessing that it s not a matter of using both loops at the same time it s a matter of using a for-loop to illustrate the concept and then switching to use a do-while loops to illustrate the concept

9777655
free	malloc
what you have malloc -ed needs to be free by yourself

9777680
post	get
if code along these lines doesn t get you on track then maybe you can post all the relevant code from your troubled project here

9777690
width	height
ideally i would like the view to wrap both it s height and width to fit the content within it

9777696
width	height
move image back into the center remembering that now width old height and height old width

9777703
ilist	icollection
well hashset conceptually is a list of unique values but in difference from it doesn t actually implements ilist interface but implements icollection

9777741
portrait	landscape
i am now adding support for both portrait landscape interface orientation

9777741
portrait	landscape
for now i prefer not to allow the interface to rotate to from portrait landscape while my gcd async task is running

9777812
hide	show
i also found it helpful to create a .js class hide it in the css file and show with javascript after any necessary scripting is complete

9777825
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
my first calculator program didn t have any problems registering the boolean flags signifying the operator as true or false it dealt only with addition and subtraction but when i implemented multiplication and division into the boolean everything gets registered as true so that all the results for every operation is listed

9777827
getter	setter
note you have to implement default constructor and all getter and setter for the person class

9777849
serializable	deserialization
i figured that this would simply use the base class s data for serializable deserialization but i got the following error

9777915
rss	feed
the feed has the ability to create nodes from an rss feed

9777948
mockito	easymock
one of my preferrable is mockito there is also easymock and others.

9777989
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i managed to eleviate the errors that you were getting by implementing the inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces in the assetholder class

9777994
min	max
min and max value 0 - 4 000

9777994
min	max
min and max percent 10 - 90 i believe you can use max_value - min_value to get the actual value

9777994
min	max	percentile	max
min and max percentile 0th percentile - 100th percentile

9778115
width	height
the fft returns data in an array where each array element is somewhat related to cycles per total data width or height etc.

9778125

the error message we get from fb when trying to post to the 2 fan page albums that do not allow it is application does not have the capability to make this api call

9778195

what i noticed while browsing through my access logs is that i do get a post request from paypal which is turned down

9778195
post	get
i tried to modify paypal standard pdt views.py to accept post requests but i still get the 401 error

9778199
qtcore	qtgui
usually its qtcore qtgui and whatever you configured explicitly in the .pro file like or etc

9778239
pull	push
i m not as worried about figuring out git-svn first thing i want is just to be able so pull push from multiple dev machines

9778287
affinity	processors
by setting the processors affinity of matlab to a subset of available processors this problem is resolved

9778287
affinity	processors
the trick of setting processors affinity via the command-line of a shortcut doesn t work since the engine is launched from within my application not via a shortcut

9778287
affinity	processors
specify processors affinity for the matlab engine from within the application when the engine is launched

9778287
affinity	processors
specify a default processors affinity for the matlab engine separately from the full matlab application itself

9778287
affinity	processors
is it possible to set the processors affinity from within my application and if so how

9778291
try-catch	exception-handling
they also recomended to put the try-catch block around main which will handle any exception-handling regarding for example memory and then let the app exit

9778303
vmware	virtualbox
as for virtual machine creation i prefer vmware workstation however there are free alternatives such as virtualbox and vmware server

9778313
inherited	subclassing
the headerfactory s getheader method returns one of the subclassing that inherited from csvheader

9778315
int	chars
your example allocs memory for max int chars 2

9778346
arrayiterator	each
it seems you may have mixed up iterator and arrayiterator as each has their own valid api call

9778353
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
replace fadein fadeout with slideup slidedown respectively as it makes a more natural switching between content

9778368
yslow	pagespeed
i have also tried this solution with 3.1 - no change i check the results with firebug s pagespeed and yslow

9778386
innodb	myisam
currently myisam but innodb is possible as well

9778427
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
aside from the suggestion i made in a comment of using a linked list nsmutablearray my other suggestion would be that you use realloc instead of constantly using malloc copying by hand and then free ing the old allocation

9778433
int	double
you are causing undefined behaviour since the type of a b is promoted to double which does not match the format specifier d which expects an int

9778435
hide	show
why not just mark certain users as admins and then hide show and allow disallow those actions that way

9778448
post	put	post	get	put	get
select network tab then click the get or put or post request that is executed and check things out

9778454
put	get
check the existing classes there to get an idea what to put in there

9778469
google-chrome	firefox
anyway i have some code that works just fine in ie9 firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

9778479
filtering	grouping
i do plan on throwing the stringgroupedkwhlist list into a highchart for the user to view and throwing the firstq query results into a telerik grid for the user to filtering sort grouping on so they can work with the details

9778487
width	height
the useful screen properties are availwidth and availheight or width and height

9778487
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
is the least standard firefox safari and google-chrome

9778501
stdout	stderr
now communicate will return the output of both stdout and stderr

9778501
sudo	passwd
also its possible that the sudo might cause you problems if it requires a passwd input

9778510
subtract	add
you need to take into account the location of the chart so if you use the left and top attributes you can add on half the width of the plot and subtract half the width of your text bounding box

9778510
subtract	add
thus instead of subtract half the height we actually need to add it

9778510
google-chrome	firefox
this works in all browers that i have tested including ie7 8 9 firefox and google-chrome

9778513
int	double
however i also want to make this code work with any data type like strings int double etc and different kinds of containers like arrays hashsets lists and collections so i won t have to waste so a lot of extra lines to overload the method

9778563
ant	maven
note however that this is only implemented in the wsdl2java maven plugin but not in the ant task or the command line tool

9778565
width	height
remember to set the width and height for each div or they will collapse as they are technically empty

post	get
another possible cause of this is that after you received the get request from paypal your app sends the post data to your app instead of to paypal postback endpoint

9778616
post	get
i would look at the access logs to see if the post request comes after a get request for the same url if yes i would check the value of the sandbox_postback_endpoint and postback_endpoint settings

implements	sealed
only implements for structs or sealed classes

9779009
implements	sealed
if a type is not sealed the only way to ensure that derived types implementation of will be compatible with their override of object.equals object will be to have the former method chain to the latter effectively nullifying any advantage one might have obtained from implements in the first place

9779009
implements	sealed
implements is often a big win for struct types saves a boxing operation on every comparison and a somewhat smaller win for other sealed types saves a typecast on every comparison

9779023

getter	setter
edit i know its wrong that way i should add getter and setter but this is how the teacher started and told us to start this way

9779313
getter	setter
you could use a global variable defining a constant would be better but using a setter getter method is best

9779313

you could achieve this by binding the margin of the label to the actualwidth and actualheight of the label and multiplying these values with -0.5

9779799
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
setting mover.movetomiddle to true means that the margin of that framework element is automatically bound to its actual width and height such that the framework element is moved to its center point

i guess if you want to change stdin you can change your terminal color to whatever you want to use for stdin and then use something like the above commands to change stderr and stdout to something else.

9780648
bash	subshell
the reason that bash | cd doesn t work is that each command in a pipeline is run in a separate subshell so bash | cd is essentially equivalent to bash | cd except that the latter launches even more subshell of course

9780648
bash	subshell
which runs cd before running bash since bash will inherit a copy of the execution environment of the subshell it was launched from

for-loop	arrays
so first i make a string arrays with the string dates dailydatasonce maybe that first for-loop is useless but i can skip it

9796555
hash	salt
however for best security practices generally people use a different salt for each password and store the salt alongside the hash in the database

9796555
hash	salt
with a scheme such as this your passwords are made more complex because if an attacker happened to get the hash he d have to also guess the salt during a brute-force attack

9796555
hash	salt
it s the same philosophy as your encodingkey in your configuration file but more secure since each hash has its own salt

9796759
getter	setter
first you need to know that for any non-private class var such as the ones used in the original question scala automatically generates getter and setter

9796759
getter	setter
so if we have a var called color scala automatically creates a getter eponymously called color and a setter called color_

9796759
getter	setter
finally putting these facts together you can easily get a type-safe reference to any var s getter setter and use that reference to dynamically set get that var s value

9796786

sorting	grouping
as of 5.6.21 i have noticed issues with the grouping by on the temporary table reverting the order by sorting

one reason you could be seeing this is that each iteration of your for-loop creates a new byte arrays

9797212
implements	extends
start from root nodes n with no incoming edges in this scenario presumably object and all interfaces without superinterfaces -- which one would have to examine the whole set plus all superclasses superinterfaces to collect and process all edges n m all m extends implements n information which again one would have to examine the whole set to collect or

9797212

even if you create an interface it often also makes sense to create an abstract base class that users of your library can extends in order to implements the interface

9797430
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
if you use plain malloc and calloc and don t free the allocated memory you are causing a leak

indeed with a test array of 100 sizeof int your test data area is only 400 bytes long on most general-purpose platforms today perhaps 800 bytes if youâ re on a 64bit platform or 200 bytes if youâ re using a 16-bit platform

9797444
multiplying	multiplication
if you view the numbers as binary than multiplication by a power of 2 shifts the bits to the left 101 2 3 becomes 101000 in the same way as in decimal multiplying by powers of 10 shift the number to the left 12340 10 3 becomes 12340000

getter	setter
to me this is crazy town as this is the whole point of having a setter...it also means that the property being set in the setter will just be overridden in the getter and therefor pointless

9797809
getter	setter
the concept being...is there any example when you d want to override the getter not setter getter only

9797809
getter	setter
i override the setter many times this question is about the getter

9797836
getter	setter
there are plenty of reasons for override both getter and setter methods for example i override setter methods when i make custom uitableviewcell objects so that i can set a property and then within that setter method it will automatically update a label or something within the cell instead of me having to call an update function after setting the property

9797836
getter	setter
i rarely override getter methods myself but i override setter methods quite frequently

9797850

9798312
hide	show
you could use jquery ajaxstart and ajaxstop to show the progress on start and hide it on end

9798312
hide	show
a route you could take if you want to limit it to just that particular fetch would be to override the sync method in that collection or model and wrap the default sync with some code that show and hide the progress bar

9798322

but i don t think that s the right way of going about what you re trying to do would you be better to create the dialog in a div lower down the page hide it and only show it when you click the link

9808841
hide	show
i have some divs that i show hide

9808879
portrait	landscape
the issue is that this error is only thrown when the app is started in landscape orientation not portrait

there s nothing that differs between the landscape and portrait launches apart from the orientation of a splash uiview which seems to be working fine

9808890
udp	tcp
the way tcp and udp work i guess you want to use these protocols and create your own on top of them is that a host have to contacts another to exchange information

i can just talk about x86 32bit x86-64 64bit

9808940
x86	64bit
since both x86 and x86-64 use the same opcodes with slightly different meanings a 32-bit application can not just run on a 64bit cpu in 64bit mode long mode

children	parent
you should set level property for the children in the data which will be used to fill the grid to the level of the parent +1

9809449
post	get
i m taking a wild guess change the get request to post and that should probably fix the problem

9809485
put	get
and when we don t get something out of the box we need to put it in the box

9809493
children	parent
i have a list of parent objects that has a list of children objects

9809493
children	parent
i need to write a query that would give me the parent that has the most children

9809526
children	parent
your query is not correct because c.children.max will try to iterate over children of one parent and if they support comparison children are ints will simply return biggest of them

9809542
int	chars
another common approach for non-web based applications is to restrict the input of the text box to only accept chars which would be parseable into an int

9809596
multiplying	add
i implemented add and multiplying and used that for an exponent example

9809604
min	max
advanced grid excel-style filtering capabilities and the ability to do averages counts max min and sum equations on the fly

from the app i do want to like on facebook picture 1 - better from a native button - with this i would like the authentication to be the same way fbconnect do open the facebook app or facebook.com on safari mobile

9809831
put	get
in some languages you can use the g operator to get all matches in the same place you put the case-insensitivity operator i but in php this is the way you do it

9809832
int	chars
it s just a reader so it has the same methods as any other reader including int read which will return you the unicode code point for each chars one by one

9809842
range	max
at the moment my formula is similar to max row 1 7 -- sum large indirect range row 1 7

9809843
getter	setter
now say i want to create a attribute that is a hash with a getter setter i m confused as to the options i have doing this

9809843
getter	setter
if i don t use the attr_accessor i have to create both the reader and writer or getter setter

9809879
sorting	filtering
also how do i get filtering sorting paging etc

post	get
once you have the urls with post get params you can reproduce it with a shell script and multiple wget calls

google-chrome	firefox
the kicker being that ie and google-chrome handled it one way and firefox a different way making it seem like a different bug

int	double
as the title says is there any scala library that exports functions to convert preferably fluently a byte array to an int to a long or to a double

9810022
jboss	glassfish
since jms is part of the java ee specification the easiest thing is to download a application server such as glassfish which is the reference implementation or jboss

i m thinking at an object that can contain int floats and double

9810111
apache	nginx
and question what i should be use server nginx or apache but i am choose nginx

in this case close the second emulator and restart adb via the ddms app or on the command line by using adb kill-server followed by adb start-server

content-disposition	content-type
in cocoa how would you go about posting a file big enough to cause allocation issues while still appending the content-disposition and content-type flags in code

9810200
hash	md5
you can create a md5 hash value without problems

9810228
int	chars
it uses the fact that you can subtract 0 from any digit chars to get the value of that digit and that you can explicitly convert from int to cellalignment

9810236
maven	pom.xml
and there is difference when i run mvn install from command line on the parent pom.xml to eclipse m2 plugin run-- maven install

9810236
maven	pom.xml
but if i go to my parent pom.xml run-- maven install it s run just fine with no error when i try to clean

9810246
rss	feed
installing canto the command line rss feed reader i get this error

9810260

i think you need to style that iframe to have a width and height

9810291
folder	directory
in this case try to browse folder using terminal because some directory are hidden

9810383
versioning	upgrade
now this module is one versioning behind current so maybe you can learn drupal by learning to upgrade the module

9810389
x86	64bit
with 64bit x86 code you need

9810466
children	parent
if a region is a parent â i need the count for all its children down as many levels and branches as it goes

9810466
children	parent
in other words if region 255 has parent 130 and 130 has parent 67 and 67 has parent 2 i need a count for 2 including all children and branches and a count for 67 including all its children and branches and so on

9810473
hash	md5
the pg_crypto module provides a number of standard hash functions md5 sha1 etc

9810504
nsstring	nsdata
similarly watch any use of anything that takes a length argument such as in nsstring and nsdata

9810563
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example using a post on a read-only get resource or put on a write resource that only accepts post s

9810573
inherited	subclassing
i have joined table inherited lets call it action and i need to get all records of action that satisfy the condition but the fields are in subclassing

9810604
mvvm	delegatecommand
i ve now moved the code behind for mvvm in a view model and use a delegatecommand on the hyperlink button

9810607
slug	permalinks
so if your theme allows for media files and permalinks to have their own page and the slug is the same as another one it will usually append a number to it because the database does not like it

9810615
cvs	svn
i ve seen this happen in cvs and svn as well so i m assuming it s a fairly common problem across any of the version control systems eclipse supports

9810625
weblogic	oc4j
we have recently moved to weblogic from oc4j where we used to configure this in system-jazn-data.xml

9810641
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
i mean i have a div with a mouseover mouseenter event and i want to trigger the action only if the mouseleave to the left side of the div and to the right but if it leaves from bottom or top it shouldn t trigger any action

9810702
folder	directory
from there the ajax script calls a php script which looks in that folder and gets a list of all of the directory and images in that folder

9810720
post	put
but if i put it inside a click event it no longer post

9810759
mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
it uses mousemove in the tutorial but it also works for mouseenter mouseleave

9810770
mouseout	mouseleave
maybe you could use the mouseout jquery function or mouseleave

9810770
width	height
and add a custom handler with javascript to get the co-ordinates of the element the height and width and track if the mouse co-ordinates are past your boundary

9810770
width	height
your mouse-out event fires the handler locates the element at x y - 10 10 the height is 20 and the width is 20

9810847
apache	nginx
the traditional way to do this is to use rewriterules in apache and i think nginx but if you re not familiar with them they will want to make you decide software was a bad career path and that one of those dirty jobs would be preferable

9810847
sorting	filtering
the case where this tends to matter is when you re adding query-string parameters sorting filtering searching paginating or even just for tracking that look different to google but are pretty much the same page

9810850
kombu	celery
i am using celery + kombu with amazon sql

9810886
put	get
if i don t put the whitespace i get results like -

9810889
gif	png
yours is written as if all image attempts fail which is not possible if a gif jpg png actually was uploaded

9810942
scrypt	md5
md5 and sha1 are well known examples but if you re building new code without strict performance constraints sha256 would be the one to chose and if you re looking to make it very difficult to recover the original words you might want to consider scrypt or bcrypt although they aren t as popular and unlikely that your language will include them in the standard library

9810944
put	get
to get a performance boost you need minimum to put the data on different disks preferably use sharding to place the data on different servers

9810947
getter	setter
attr_reader defines the getter attr_writer defines the setter and attr_accessor defines both

9810947
getter	setter
the error is because only getter method is defined but no setter

9810978
nsstring	nsdata
you declare htmldata to be an nsdata but the actual object you re assigning to it is an nsstring

9810987
pull	push
after reviews are complete we pull from the project s central repository rebase and push

9811038
pull	push
i think that this is possible because git remote show origin has told me at times that i have had branches configured for git pull but not for git push

9811043
rss	feed
on march 13 www.cliws.com hosted on google app engine stopped to fetch hn s rss feed located at

9811043

9811085
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
if you re serving large files however you might want to leave that task to your webserver you can use the x-accel-redirect header on nginx and x-sendfile for apache lighttpd to have your webserver serve the file for you

9811091
int	double
the details will vary based on the machine and compiler but assume that a float is 4 bytes a double is 8 bytes and an int is 4 bytes

9811223
apache	nginx
some people use apache or nginx in front of thin for production servers

9811232
pop-up	dialog
in the case you are using your service by setting up a service reference in the consuming application then an even easier method would be to right-click the service name select configure service reference... and about 1 3rd the way down of the dialog that pop-up there will be a dropdown with collection type label

9811263
post	get
i am trying to get a piece of data back using jquery ajax via a post response but i cannot seem to display the data

9811269
post	get

google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 535.21 khtml like gecko google-chrome 19.0.1042.0 safari 535.21 to test if that changes anything

9811310
width	height
how can i get the position width height when a div is wrapped around a polygon in the svg

9811357
put	get
that is no further changes and you really need to convert it to your own format than doing it manually which is tiresome so what you can do is get the fields name and its value and according to your rules put it in your own object

9811397
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade symfony to the 2.0.12 versioning

9811429
mp3	ogg
i m trying to accomplish a simple doodle-like behaviour where a mp3 ogg sound rings on click using the html tag

9811429
firefox	safari
it is supposed to work under firefox safari and safari ipad is veri desireable

9811429
firefox	safari
this seems to work great under firefox but safari seems to have a delay whenever you click even when you click several times and the audio file has loaded

9811485
height	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
the secret there is to use box-sizing border-box and some padding to make the second div height 100 but move it s content down 50px

9811488
hide	show
i can hide the toolbar with an animation but i can t let it show up again

9811512
avaudioplayer	audiotoolbox
this looks to be the same general backtrace as avaudioplayer throws breakpoint in debug mode though mine is the result of a more direct invocation of audiotoolbox

9811515
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh you can use handy readline shortcuts like these to navigate between words delete from the middle of the line etc

9811531
apache	nginx
based on the interchanged apache and nginx in your title question i m guessing you may have two web servers running

9811531
apache	nginx
apache or nginx on the other hand are specially designed and hardened to be able to be exposed to public networks such as the internet without jeopardizing the security of your system

9811531
apache	nginx
keep in mind as well that the primary purpose of having a reverse proxy in place is so that the only publicly exposed service on your machine is apache nginx -- so be sure to configure your firewall to block port 8787

9811567
google-chrome	firefox
we can not reproduce this error with our ie8 installs on our machines or on their machines running firefox or google-chrome

9811594
actionscript	mxml
but now i m wondering if i can make this image as the image below in flex 4 4.5 4.6 in mxml and or actionscript 3

9811639
put	get
that approach seems roundabout to me as you get strings from a stream only to put it into another stream

9811652
servicebus	was
so somehow on my test environment machine the servicebus scan of the directory for a class that calls ihandlemessages was failing to find my class even though the assembly was absolutely there

9811673
put	get
use the order you put the columns in to understand the lists that you get when you read the csv one line at a time- the order of the columns and the order of the items in each row is the same so use that information to index correctly into the list to find each field

9811696
google-chrome	safari
the issue we are seeing is most prevalent in safari but also shows itself occasionally in ie and google-chrome

9811742
vmware	bootcamp
it s like what vmware fusion did on a mac which boots windows in bootcamp as a virtual machine

9811780
mouseover	mouseout
jquery s .hover can use a function for the mouseover and mouseout states so it s trivial to do something like

9811797
for-loop	loops
how can i go about moving the inner for-loop one value each time i go through the other loops

9811801
free	realloc
if the call to realloc fails then you can no longer free the original buffer

ssl	https
naturally i have removed the force ssl and allowed both http and https for the time being

9811848
post	get
to show the difference clearly i made an anonymous post request to the end point it could have been a get request the end point has no real methods but thus returns a message to let us know it is still there

9811851
aggregate-functions	sum
for more information about the return type of the sqlstatement and how to access properties of the result object when using aggregate-functions such as sum where u should use aliases such as sum amount as sumamount to later access the property like resultobject sumamount or resultobject.sumamount

put	get
where you can put a class that will get executed

9811940
pop-up	dialog
i have a delphi 2006 app which can pop-up a modal dialog in response to an error condition

9811974
post	get
when you get the post with the signed request decode it and check if the user is authenticated if he is persist the data token and such somewhere session db cache

9811974
post	get
there should be only two times where facebook sends you the request once it is post when your canvas is loaded the 2nd is when the user returns from the authentication dialog in which you either get the code parameter or error in case the user declined the authentication

9811993
put	get
sometimes if you put the url later in the dynamic url it will get stuck loading

9812008
yacc	bison
bison yacc are very powerful tools and with great power comes great responsibility -

9812008
yacc	bison
imho lots are put off because they are also told to use yacc bison which are much more powerful subtle and complex tools

9812029
hash	md5
just keep the first 32 bits or 64 bits of the md5 hash

9812030
serializable	deserialization
3 23 2012 update #2 - fixed serializable deserialization but having another issue

9812034
serializable	deserialization
in the generated classes i can find methods to serializable the objects but are there also functions to do the deserialization

9812048

would my getter and setter just be

9812114
implements	extends
its ended up with and and i was looking how they implements widgets plugins so other could extends the framework

9812252
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i was thinking using qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsitem for the nodes

9812277
post	get
you get that with the brower because the kronos server only support post requests and the browser is issuing a get request

9812298
opera	firefox
i believe that there is an experimental version of opera that supplies one and an addon for firefox that does the same but none of them are ready for primetime

9812319
int	double
i disagree that int or double fulfill this role as they only wrap the fixed set of primitives and are not a generic container

9812389
jasmine	sinon
lots of jasmine people are using sinon

9812403

the place you get into trouble with cache coherency on general purpose platforms whether or not they re multiprocessor is when your processors has separate instruction data caches and you write self-modifying code the instructions written to memory are indistinguishable from data so the cpu doesn t invalidate those locations in the instruction cache so there may be stale instructions in the instruction cache unless you subsequently invalidate those locations in the instruction cache either issuing your own processor-specific assembly instructions which you might not be allowed to do depending on your os and your thread s privilege level or else issuing the appropriate cache-invalidate system call for your os

the reason i want to hide the control is that i don t want user to see the control when the form is show the very first time

9828186
equals	gethashcode
firstly as i think you understand wherever you implement equals you must also implement gethashcode

9828186
equals	gethashcode
the implementation of gethashcode must reflect the behaviour of the equals implementation but it doesn t usually use it

9828186
equals	gethashcode
as for whether you need to re-implement gethashcode in subclasses - yes if you also override equals - as per the first and main point - the implementation of the two must be consistent - if two items are considered equals by equals then they must return the same value from gethashcode

9829773
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
slideup hide the elements slidedown show the elements

9829792
addition	modulo
i chose for the array approach of storing the binary numbers because i need to perform some shifting and addition modulo 2

9830286
google-chrome	firefox
as i said in my comment you can use the net tab in firebug for firefox called timeline in google-chrome to see the actual load order on your page - you can even filter it on firefox for css only or images only - this will enable you to test

9830294
disk	ram
then later on when you use that memory again the os loads that whole page from disk back into physical ram

you should write something like this to correctly initialize max min data

9830676
directions	infowindow
i tried to display road network info in the respective infowindow generated by directions

9833086
distance	polygons
only polygons whose distance from the base are similar may be similar to each other

rvm	bundler
or use the bundler hook in rvm

9833875
width	height
if your want innerheight may be get original width and then zoomed width get zoom ratio and then calculate the new height after zoom

9833932
x86	64bit
change the build option to x86 you might be trying to import a 32 bit os dll into 64bit environment

9833960
swt	windowbuilder
edit to get google windowbuilder pro s copy of swt s browser widgets working in arch linux i created a vm and stepped through this process with the op

9833977
stdout	stderr
the progress status gets printed to stderr while the actual data cruises along from stdin to stdout

9834014
firefox	safari
maybe the actual problem is that i m using xml+xsl formatting in safari and plain html5 in firefox

9834025
lxml	elementtree
when using lxml an elementtree gets created

9834061
udp	tcp
i have a system that reads input data from a serial udp tcp source

9834061
int	double
the input data is simply a csv of different datattypes datetime double int string

9834108
orientdb	neo4j
i think this sounds like something that could help you interface a jung graph to a blueprints enabled backend neo4j orientdb etc

9834137
fadein	fadeout
here is a simple example but you would need to fix the multiple calls to the fadein fadeout methods possibly with an animation and a variable to test if its being animated already

9834170
getter	setter
setter getter are more preferable because you can encapsulate some processing in those accessor methods too

9834187
hide	show
here is the exact transition configuration we used to show and hide the entire element

9834189
subobject	instances
if ever you change things so that something else has to be set along with bfield or if bfield doesn t need a backing field at all -- for instances if setting it should set something on a subobject you ll be glad you called setbfield -- cause you won t have a dozen places to change code that sets bfield

9834207
versioning	upgrade
it obviously depends on the layout of your application and where this data is stored and how the clients are going to be upgrade but there could be a new versioning flag of some sort associated with the stored ciphertext

9834207
versioning	upgrade
when reading the ciphertext and this new field doesn t match the unicdoe flag you could upgrade the ciphertext by decrypting and encrypting using unicode plaintext and then re-save the ciphertext and set the new flag or simply put-off the ciphertext versioning upgrade until the plaintext has changed and needs to be updated.

9834305
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this on a galaxy nexus running android 4.0.2 in the default browser the latest opera mobile and firefox and google-chrome beta

9834308
sudo	nohup
i then entered the command sudo chmod a+rx etc udev rules.d 99-android.rules then i typed in sudo restart udev and then i typed in adb kill-server and then i typed in nohup adb start-server

9834331
getter	setter
create getter and setter for it then move on to the next step - changing its values in your other methods

9834331
superclass	subclassing
you define most of the default behavior in your superclass then selectively override or change just the pieces that are appropriate in your subclassing

9834357
sorting	filtering
so in external list the caml query is working fine for sorting and simple filtering query like where equalto condition i can t use logical conditions in the query

9834359
cfstring	nsstring
because nsstring and cfstring are toll-free bridged you can simply cast from one to the other

9834395
int	double	int	chars
i have a union type of array of three int 4 bytes each a float 4 bytes a double 8 bytes and a chars 1 byte

9834395
int	chars
if i assign 0x31313131 to each of the three int elements and then printed the union s chars i will get the number 1

9834414
int	chars
you are printing it as chars not int

9834414
int	double	int	chars
since it is a union all the int and chars share the same memory location the float and double does not matter in this context

9834414
int	chars
so assigning 0x31313131 to the int does affect the chars value -- nothing much confusing there

9834448
getter	setter
then the task would just need the project id and a getter and setter method

9834481
children	parent
i will double check this but i believe that if you spin up tasks within tasks then the parent will not be considered complete until all of the children are complete

9834500
hash	md5
finally for the op i m hoping by add you meant streaming data through the md5 hash algorithm and aren t intending to invent your own security algorithm

9834508
implements	extends
i ve implements a custom renderer that extends defaulttablecellrenderer below

9834573
rubber	fog
i am not really married to fog i can do rubber but could not find any guides that show what to do after the server is created how to actually send my rails app there get it to show up at some ip etc..

unless you re using reflection this means the public protected and package level methods

9834665
google-chrome	firefox	pop-up	dialog
but this creates a pop-up dialog that is blocked by default by both google-chrome and firefox

9834665
pop-up	dialog
is there a way to create an invite without the pop-up dialog

9834683
public	protected
object.clone is protected so we must override it with a public method in order for it to be accessible

9834683
getter	setter
clonebean will clone a bean based on the available property getter and setter even if the bean class itself does not implement cloneable

9834694
children	parent
for instance if you used container approach in step 1 and children approach in step 2 you might desire to improve the speed of certain algorithms and add references between each each node and its parent

9834723
put	get
i had tried to to put checkbox in listview through layout inflator and i got success but the problem is when i select the multiple contacts there is no problem but when i deselect it when i scroll down then go back to that deselected checkbox its get automatically selected.

9834732
visualvm	jstat
application hang i would start with visualvm or jstat both are part of jdk

9834747
int	chars
theses two links are great specially about to know more about the main reason of this header that is portability but for me what i like most about it that i think uint8_t is cleaner than unsigned chars for storing an rbg channel value for example int32_t looks more meaningfull than simply int etc

9834747
atoi	strtok
if everywhere how can i user functions like atoi strtok etc with it

9834794
google-chrome	firefox
through google-chrome s console and mozilla firefox s web console we can access manipulate javascript state of any page

9834794
google-chrome	firefox
but is it possible to access content scripts running in isolated worlds in google-chrome and in mozilla firefox

9834803
compass	neat
obviously this is not a very neat solution but given that compass does not allow us to set the position of images within a sprite sheet this is not possible anyway

9834832
int	double
so for example if you cast from an int to a double it will always be exact but for casting into into a float it will no longer be exact for very large int

9834832
floating-point	integer
there is one major example of extensive usage of floating point numbers as a substitute for integers it s the lua scripting language which has no integer built-in type and floating-point numbers are used extensively for logic and flow control etc

9834832
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication	multiplication	exponent	exponent	addition
denormalized numbers very very small numbers where the exponent has reached smallest possible value are often treated as zero and approximations in implementation of power logarithm sqrt and 1 x 2 can be made but addition subtraction comparison and multiplication should retain their properties for numbers which can be exactly represented

9834842
put	get
now i need to put conditions specific for that child class but i get this error

9834915
put	get
i need to get the username from the login.java page and put it in a variable in the account.java jframe

9834927
folder	directory
delete the public folder and put the zend framework files from it index.php .htaccess etc in your root directory htdocs

9834927
folder	directory
this way your zend application will run from your root directory and you won t need to use mod_rewrite to hide the public folder

9834929
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works on google-chrome ie and firefox

9834999

however if i remove the ratingbar item from row.xml and leave just the textview item then it throws fatal errors upon running

9835137
ratingbar	textview
also if i switch the order of the ratingbar and textview items in row.xml it throws the same error

9835149

9835687
hash	salt
you usually only save a salt hash of that password

9835687
hash	salt
as for storing login information in a cookie i d then store a salt hash of that password hash in the cookie

9835687
hash	salt
upon get you just create a salt hash of the stored password hash and compare it with the one from the cookie

9835692
int	double
int float double .

9835693
put	get
do only the services being clopted get put in memory or everything defined to the server

9835695
hash	md5
another issue is that you are storing only the md5 hash of the password inside the cookie and you expect to be able to decrypt it later with formsauthentication.decrypt which is not possible

9835701
jar	manifest.mf
i opened the manifest.mf of jar file and it look s ok

for that use the web view with fill_parent height and width

9836021
int	chars
i have a file and using fscanf i want to read only the int and ignore the chars if any

9836044
awt	swing
this is required for almost all interactions with awt and swing classes

9836044
awt	swing
notice that this uses a swing helper library that should be fine for awt but even better is to start using swing

9836055
strtol	atoi
you could use isnum to check the individual strings or just call strtol atoi and check if errno was set to einval

9836079
put	get
you can download the command line tools or simply get mysql workbench and put in your hostname and test the connection

9836093
min	max
for min and max read this and you can see that in jsfiddle as well

9836143
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
for example the methods tostring equals gethashcode and perhaps a few others are defined in object and hence also available in struct s

9836147
post	get
if it comes from a form you should maybe use a post instead of a get for your form and retrieve the value like this

9836212
hide	show
i would like to be able to show hide these individually preferably by clicking on the corresponding legenditem or inserting a checkbox in the legend item

9836256
free	malloc
you should not be using direct memory manipulation and especially malloc and free in c++ unless manipulating c-like structures and still...

9836256

9836378
screens	mdpi
screens density mdpi then the system scales them up when on a

9836388
boost	allocator
since boost intrusive list leaves allocator to you you could keep your objects in a std vector and allocate them in batches

9836388
boost	allocator
since using the custom allocator for std list is probably around as messy as using a boost intrusive list i d go with boost because you get many other useful features with that such as keeping the same object in multiple lists etc.

9836438
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
with kplaylist you can stream your music ogg mp3 wav wma etc. you can upload make playlists share search download and a lot more

9836448
getter	setter
not sure if i get what you mean but you in objective c you use setter and getter to modify your variables

9836453
superclass	subclassing
another simple solution would be to use a class hierarchy with the superclass implementing the - void draw method and every subclassing that needed a different implementation could override it

9836462
button	checkbox
when you then click the show button it s another postback in which your checkbox has not been created so it doesn t exist

9836462
button	checkbox
you can keep the add button but it won t actually add a checkbox to the page it ll just make it visible by setting visible to true

9836481
button	checkbox
run the application and click the add button to create the checkbox then click the newly added button and the checkbox will be gone after the postback

9836501
put	get
in that case you could use something similiar but when you get to a digit put it back in the stream with ungetc and read the number with fscanf ... d ....

9836529
portrait	landscape
i need to develop an application for tablet v3.1 in both portrait and landscape orientation

9836962
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
i am making splash screens which background have images.i put 480x800 size image in drawable hdpi similarly rest of mdpi 320x480 lpdi 240x320

innodb	myisam
no see another question about it why does mysql not have hash indices on myisam or innodb

9837215
google-chrome	firefox
function is defined in google-chrome s and firefox s console itself but it is a console s internal function

9837229
int	chars
the reason is that c and d implicitly get promoted to int and the resulting int isn t allowed to be narrowed back to chars in an initializer list

9837231
sorting	grouping
2 basically try out adding items before creation of the grouping and sorting

9837255

i m receiving stock exchange data from udp multicast so sometimes traffic my significantly jump lehman brothers bankruptcy etc. but let s assume that i will not receive more than 20 000 packets per second

9837338
superclass	subclassing
all subclassing invoke on construction the user-defined superclass constructor with parameters

9837339
children	parent
if every constructor of the children classes use an explicit constructor of the parent there is no need for the parent to have a default constructor

9837351
children	parent
a leaf has a parent but no children

9837351
children	parent
a node can have a parent and can have children

9837451
pop-up	dialog
as you re no doubt aware there s no real background processing on the iphone but you can set uilocalnotification which pop-up a dialog at some future point in time and can prompt the user to open your app

9837456
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in firefox and safari but not in google-chrome and opera

9837480
datalist	objectdatasource
efficient data paging with the asp.net 2.0 datalist control and objectdatasource

9837500

put the line clear all at the top of your script which will clear all variable assignments however if you overwrite a built-in function in one line of a script and then try to call it in a later line you will get the same issue

9837516
jax-ws	jax-rs
there are several ways of implementing webservices in java like jax-ws or rest jax-rs

9837516
base	fractions
this is just a fractions of all the possibilities but it should be a good base to get you started

9837529
hide	show
trying to make a toggle button that hide show the right window pane

9837531
jruby	mri
there s no such thing to my knowledge with webrick - it s basically the very same ruby code with jruby as it is with mri .

9837533
swt	swing
however there is a desktop application framework called griffon that uses the same language as grails groovy which should be easier than using swing or swt

9837582
min	max
i want to get max and min values with other column s values in ms excel 2007

9837582
min	max
i want to print out max values and min values of column b with column a values

9837671
joptionpane	jdialog
if you have a window that is meant to be a child and is therefore meant to be above another window then it should be a dialog such as a jdialog or joptionpane and should have its parent window set accordingly

9837688
put	get
you don t know what is the type of this list you know you can get elements from it it will be at least an object but you can t put anything in it as you re not sure that it will fit

9837704
hide	show
the hide show is functioning based on the following script

9837713
lxml	beautifulsoup
since beautifulsoup uses lxml i tested to see if lxml could handle the files independently

9837713
lxml	beautifulsoup
my current suspicion is some weird memory issue since the file size seems to make a difference perhaps in conjunction with some bug in how beautifulsoup 4 interacts with lxml

9837715
ssl	https
your error report says you are trying to run ssl locally by way of https

9837737
google-chrome	firefox
although i - too - cannot see this behavior in firefox neither google-chrome

9837739
width	height
via jquery i get the values of my browsers height and width

9837739
width	height
i send them with ajax to my script and simply calculate my width and height in the request

9837774
width	height
the itemscontrol then gets a datatemplate where height and width are bound to the properties of the items using a converter to display them properly

9837780
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the push segue is modeled for use with changing views from the uitableviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller modal is acceptable switching between uiviewcontroller

9837793
hash	md5
the md5 algorithm for example produces a 16 byte hash code

9837793
hash	md5
convert the string to a byte array using some encoding that preserves all characters for example utf-8 calculate the hash code using the md5 class then convert the hash code byte array into a string using the bitconverter class

9837805
hide	show
first using a hover event to show a navigation bar can be very difficult for users to use though is does save valuable screen space to have it hide

9837808

9837808
youtube	vimeo
videos are from youtube vimeo etc

integer	unsigned
i use my own types in that case derived from size_t when i m lazy or the largest supported unsigned integer on the platform when i m not

9837875
post	get
also check how to get the first image from the post and display it

9837881
opera	google-chrome
works in google-chrome ie 9 not 8 and opera at least version 11.61 which is the one i have installed

9837896
put	get
the recommended way to handle optimistic locking in a restful interface seems to be by returning an etag from the get and supplying an if-match on the put ie

9837921
telerik	radcombobox
i ve achieved this before but i did so using telerik radcombobox which was capable of including an item template

9837922
addition	multiplication
another problem that can rise is when you try to run operations on smaller integers addition multiplication and you risk the overflow or you have to cast to a bigger integer

9837951
put	get
no matter what i do i always get that same pass a put or a delete

9837996
dlsym	dlopen

128bit	64bit
for example while long long is at least 64bit it might be 128bit on some machines and using it when what you need is just a type that can store 64bit numbers would be very wasteful on such machines

9838995

for instance on x86_64 the 64-bit integer type is considered the fast one for 16- 32- and 64-bit values but while addition subtraction and multiplication are exactly the same speed whether you use 32-bit or 64-bit values division is almost surely slower with larger-than-necessary types and even if they were the same speed you re using twice the memory for no benefit

nsmutablestring	nsstring
a solution is having a base class using const objects and a subclass working with non-const objects a bit in a way it is done in objc eg nsstring and nsmutablestring

9842221
hide	show
the user also should be able to hide and show the view by swiping it to the left or to the right

9842257

you would need to override the original csrf function with a my_security.php file and make so you can get around it by in example sending your entire session cookie via post and make so the csrf can read it so you can be matched

9842471
post	get
when you need just one get or post value this is extremely annoying - for example will throw if there s an html-value anywhere in your get post data even if the xyz value you posted does not contain html

9842471
post	get
this effectively allows you to get an individual get post value while bypassing the validation

kde	kubuntu
i looked at konsolecalendar kde but it seems to be broken on my kubuntu linux

9842917
getter	setter
i always assumed that because c# getter setter are really methods in disguise then reading public field must be faster than calling a getter

9842939
hide	show
i believe it will only do a show hide but if you use it as an actual event handler it will do what ever you want it to

9842940
children	parent
this child module has dependencies on other modules in the overall set so the parent has 8 children 1 - 8 this module #5 depends on 2 and 3

google-chrome	firefox
at 1000 divs on the page ie9 firefox and google-chrome have no problem whatsoever and don t even seem to hiccup when scrolling

9842945
google-chrome	firefox
at 10 000 divs ie9 and google-chrome are able to scroll with a barely-noticeable delay still within the acceptable range in my book however firefox begins to lag more noticeably to the point where you feel the scroll bar is jumping into position a half-second later than it should

9842945
google-chrome	firefox
ie9 and google-chrome perform with only a barely perceptible delay in scrolling with google-chrome being the slightly smoother of the two and firefox has a delay that is very noticeable and would probably be considered annoying but still functions reasonably well it doesn t crash

9842949
portrait	landscape
however when the device is in the landscape mode the transition animation performs as if the device is still in the portrait mode

9842960
implements	extends
if you directly implements that interface rather than extends one of the above base classes then you need to implements handlerequest directly

width	height
i have the possibility to change the quad s dimensions with quad.setdimensions width height but what would be the size i d have to give it and also shouldn t i also have to worry about the textsize sp of the text i m drawing

9843000
getter	setter
as the getter setter are trivial very simple code the method calls are destroyed and the getter setter written in the surrounding code

9843000
getter	setter
this does not happen in debug mode in order to support debugging the ability to set a breakpoint in a getter or setter

9843005

portrait	landscape
in landscape mode the list and editor fragments are positioned side by side but in portrait mode only the list is shown in the main activity and the editor is shown by launching a new activity

9843029
portrait	landscape
under normal conditions this all works fine but when the screen is rotated from landscape to portrait and the main activity is destroyed and created again it seems to call onactivitycreated plus other callbacks on my editor fragment even though it is not part of the display now since in portrait mode it is just the list that is shown

9843082
disk	ram
how much cpu ram disk io is in use

9843092

if it evaluates as true you should then get the depth as an integer and use a for-loop such as creating an arrays of arrays as the one written above

9843311
spaces	delimiter
you need a spaces after the word delimiter

9843326
pop-up	dialog
i ve noticed when enclose the smart wizard within an additional tag with the intent of displaying the wizard within a jquery dialog pop-up the wizard will not advance steps when a function is specified for the onleavestep event

9843335
put	get
but i want to get a good advise here on where to put it and if possible how

9843342
popover	tooltip
for example popover have a header and content section but tooltip are just content

9843374
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like google-chrome needs preventdefault and firefox needs stoppropagation so return false accomplishes both of these

9843419
filesystems	ntfs
a quick search suggests that you should be using session_write_close to close the session when you are done using it if you are on an ntfs filesystems

9843426
opera	firefox
i cant test in any other version of ie just yet and firefox and opera work fine and even as i say ie works with the fiddle i created

9843498
google-chrome	firefox
it gives a different incorrect value for position.top in google-chrome but correct in firefox

9843515
folder	directory
for example if i have a parent directory of sales with child folder management customers and salesteam and i define a deny rule for sales then all users roles must be explicitly allowed in the child directory

9843555
pull	push
the basic commands you re going to need to learn to use git effectively include add status diff commit pull push checkout merge and branch

9843559
qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel
i have a custom qabstractitemmodel used to display information in a qtreewidget

9843560
freetype	libpng
building matplotlib requires libpng and freetype as well which isn t a python library so pip doesn t handle installing it or freetype

9843565
ant	maven
in case you don t get an answer on how to do this from the ant plugin take a look at the copy goal of the maven dependency plugin

9843568

9843578
width	height
they fill up the whole bitmap in width and height both but in all four edges there are transparent areas of course as it s a circle in a square

the code is working correctly in firefox and google-chrome

9843711
rss	feed
i tried to include an rss feed into one of my tabs but at the moment - it seems like i am having no luck

9843733
apache	nginx
you need to have mod_rpaf installed in apache and in nginx add the following

9843756
accessor	properties
also you should use ember s universal accessor get getpath set setpath when using properties on ember.object s

9843840
children	parent
bound to multiple selectors relating to same element bound to children within a parent ...

9843905
rss	feed
i did this some time before for validating rss feed

9843963
put	get
put quotes around the bar to make it actually have a value semi-colons and var on the objects but you get the point

9843976
rss	feed
my application is pulling in xml data from an rss feed

9844005
google-chrome	safari
since the performance profiler is pretty much identical in safari and google-chrome you should be able to determine this yourself

9844005
google-chrome	safari
your demo runs fine on both safari and google-chrome on my machine

9844005
google-chrome	safari
anyway i can t tell you why drawimage performs worse on google-chrome than safari only that it does when an image fails to load and is then drawn

9844005
google-chrome	safari
it seems to show google-chrome 19 running twice as fast as safari on my windows 7 machine

9844047
portrait	landscape
when the screen is rotated from landscape to portrait and the main activity is destroyed and created again it seems to call onactivitycreated plus other callbacks on my editor fragment even though it is not part of the display now since in portrait mode it is just the list that is shown

9844061
button	checkbox
question how do i disable the checkbox when run radio button is selected so the checkbox can t be selected and enable it while the pass radio button is selected

9844084
put	get
if i try to call a function that takes a parameter which i need to do so i can get the text entered by the user in the text box it won t even hit the function at all i put a break point on it and it never hits the break point

9844138
versioning	upgrade
so those are my two points - try to find an ics based device so you don t need to upgrade right away - and so that you can test your app on live hardware for the newest sdk versioning

9844165
tablet	galaxy
i would get the samsung galaxy 10 tablet

9844177
folder	directory
if you re not worried about losing history do a git checkout mybranch and then copy the directory contents to another folder

9844179
switching	screens
it doesn t want to work when certain movie clips are underneath it but i don t want to make it more complicated by switching to another screens

9844184
opencv	emgucv
using emgucv opencv wrapper the problem here is that when i use setcaptureproperty with cap_prop.cv_cap_prop_pos_frames avi_ratio or msec to sets capture s position the position isn t seted correctly i checked it using getcaptureproperty next to the setcaptureproperty instruction

9844224
explode	implode
use implode explode

9844238
tablet	galaxy
i d probably +1 for galaxy 10 tablet - they seem pretty popular and good modding scene support

9844274
pull	push
pull down the branch like normal and then push the branch to a new repository that you have created using git init

9844282
multiplying	add
if we take advantage of the property that bit shifting to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2 to the power of the number of bits shifted we can bit-shift up to the nearest power of 2 and use our previous algorithm to add up from there

9844291
put	get
which is why i put the for instance in instances but now i get this new issue of not displaying errors when saving a invalid object

9844403
for-loop	loops
and concluding with a quote from delphi s help on the compiler error message for-loop variable element may be undefined after loops

9844403
for-loop	loops
you can only rely on the final value of a for-loop control variable if loops is left with a goto or exit statement

9844469
put	get
the firefox browser does get launched but it does not put the url in address and program throws exception with out sufficient information

9844494
gson	jackson
i ve been given a sample of the resulting json and i am concerned that i will have to parse the json by hand that i won t be able to use normal class mapping provided by tools such as gson or jackson

9844517
avr	microcontroller
there are some implementations of classical string tools for avr microcontroller like arduino but they are done in a procedural way and not in an object-oriented way for c-style strings

9844528
idictionary	ilist
i also chose to implement various methods for sorting the way that does since this is essentially a hybrid ilist and idictionary

9844536
post	get
see the documentation for jquery get and jquery post

9844561
width	height
try this to loop through each select element and change its height width as you mentioned in your comment

9844585
superclass	subclassing
-creating a superclass for sprite resources and then create subclassing for every type of resource i need

9844594
filesystems	ntfs
one option is to create a hidden filesystems or map the virtual filesystems to the directory on existing ntfs drive eg

9844641
put	get
an awkward way of doing things i know but it s for coursework and i wanted to put an insertion sort in somewhere to try get an extra mark l

9844665
scrollable	panels
this does not pose a problem since the panels on which this thing is embedded is scrollable

9844733
postgresql	mysql
not free but i use navicat premium as a front end for mysql postgresql sqlite ms sql oracle

9844737
onfocus	onblur
try adding onfocus event on the window object to trigger your updates and add onblur to stop updating your live feeds

9844750
hide	show
but with javascript especially when using jquery it s pretty trivial to show hide change form elements and page sections dynamically based on the state of the form

9844750
hide	show
what you would do is attach event listeners to the form elements which drive the dynamic content and those listeners would show hide change page elements accordingly

9844757
uitextfield	accessoryview
even better idea is to make the uitextfield an accessoryview of the cell instead of adding it as a subview

9844770
accessor	properties
when using properties on ember objects always use ember s universal accessor get getpath set and setpath

9844846
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

9844880
put	get
on the other hand it doesn t make sense to put against an uri which will return a 303 see other when using get

9844920
getter	setter
checkoutclientconfigurationdto minus all the boilerplate getter setter

9844999
width	height
because of that i stored width and height in the struct as well

9845010
for-loop	loops
if you are using any js loops then for each loops is slower than normal for-loop you might wanna take a look at this

9845059
put	get
but i don t get how to put the xml in the mule-config.xml file

9845067
width	height
position fixed absolute are default take content width height

9845096
stdout	fflush
if you want stdout to update frequently make sure you call sys.stdout.flush to guarantee that the stream is actually published at that point rather than relying on implicit fflush which may not happen until the work completes

9845112
width	height
the audio player is going to be completed obscured to user aka zero width height div element so the look of the player is irrelevant for my needs

9845124
opera	google-chrome
the custom elements specification is available in google-chrome and opera and becoming available in other browsers

9845134
folder	directory
when i had the uploads folder in the same directory as the uploader.php script it was working however i placed my uploader.php script in the admin folder while keeping the uploads in the root folder

9845272
puts	gets
it gets the userid username email for each user and puts it in an array

9845277
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
since the input is a java inputstream we could use some kind of encoder to encode image as a png and write it to a bytearrayoutputstream which later will be fed to the above test class as a bytearrayinputsteam and the the gamma information if any will be removed

9845292
matplotlib	scipy
i have a bunch of matlab code from my ms thesis which i now want to convert to python using numpy scipy and matplotlib and distribute as open-source

9845305
postgresql	mysql
i don t know how great is triggers support in mysql since i switched to postgresql before mysql even had them

9845337
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
update to get the actualheight and actualwidth values of the canvas during runtime you can add an event handler for sizechanged easy to do within the xaml but not too hard within code to handle the change in height width value during runtime

9845420
strdup	malloc
this can be done either manually with malloc or using strdup

9845437
width	text-align
update 2 setting the ul to block fixes it as its currently inline-table but that removes the ability to have it set to the width of its childs and align it via text-align

9845474
versioning	upgrade
if you need string concatenation in sql upgrade to a more recent versioning of se

9845476
folder	directory
directory php_dir which is your pear lib folder

9845476
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your pear install to current versioning cmdline pear upgrade pear

9845478
int	boolean
add a variable that will keep track whether it is the first or second if testing whether it is the first or second then you can use a boolean variable otherwise use an int counter and do an if else based on the variable

9845478
for-loop	loops
or you can take an alternative approach by subsituting the while loops for a for-loop as in the following code

9845504
mouseup	mousedown
however it appears that click mousedown and mouseup events are handled correctly

9845533
width	height
the height and width of both are same

9845541
gridview	linqdatasource
create a gridview using a linqdatasource with your new datacontext to pull in the appropriate data and display it

9845550
websphere	ibm
i m developing an ear war application with ibm rad 7.5 and websphere 7

9845579
children	parent
the reason for all this effort is that if a parent object is deleted then the children objects which contain data should still be allowed to be viewed even though their parent is gone

9845579
children	parent
fair enough but there is no point of keeping it around when the children have become more relevant than the parent and for whatever reason the parent no longer is required to be kept

9845579
children	parent
at a later time the children may be re-assigned to a different parent object

9845590
versioning	upgrade
so the only thing i can think of being a variable is the versioning of py2app and its deps which have obviously been upgrade over time

9845633
stdout	stderr
i understand how to use stdin stdout stderr to interact with a user via the command line on a per-command basis like git maven javac etc.

9845699
mef	prism
i am having another go at a wpf application incorporating prism mef and attempting to gain a better understanding of the mvvm pattern

9845825
userprincipal	directoryentry
userprincipal has a method getunderlyingobject which will return the directoryentry

9845828
prepare	execute
so prepare your insert syntax iterating over your data array in a regular loop or using custom query builder than execute it once

9845831
put	get
if you instead put it in tableview didselectrowatindexpath note the slightly different name you ll get the callback as soon as the cell is tapped and the accessory view should appear immediately

9845848
children	parent
for extra credit you can make it a nested set relationship which will allow you to pull the parent and all the children in one query

9845924
pop-up	dialog
i have a very large wpf application that i work on and there are certain places where it just doesn t make sense to do mvvm usually when you get into simple dialog and pop-up windows

9845931
jar	war
the main maven idea is that each module must produce a single build artifact a jar or a war file

9845945
stateless	stateful
i was just reading an article ibm.com developerworks webservices library ws-restful about restful apis and after encountering the bit about paging i was worried that my quite stateful queue was similar to incrementing by a page but they re actually quite different as next page is relative on the client side whereas pop is always stateless for the client it doesn t matter what was popped before

9845963
put	get
but it requires you put all of your code into a single statement without a semi-colon to get the result

9845976
int	double
none of the other answers has mentioned visual basic which at least through version 6 has two operators for dividing int converts the int to double and returns a double while performs normal int arithmetic

9845976
int	double
another alternative would be to have only one int operation which always returns a double and require programmers to truncate it

9845976
int	double
this means you have to perform two int- double conversions a truncation and a double- int conversion every time you want int division

9845976
int	double
when the floating-point division of int is needed it may be invoked explicitly with a simple short and clear cast double a b rather than a b

9846018
gmail	hotmail
i have created a script on mac os x and it successfully sent an email to my gmail account but when i tried to use it to my hotmail account it didn t work is it because hotmail uses a spam filter or what

9846018
gmail	hotmail
i used the same code with gmail and it worked but it didn t work with hotmail

9846027
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

hg update creates a working directory in the repository on the server which you don t need if you only want to push and pull from that repository

pull	push
setting up the server also includes permissions not necessarily file permissions on the server - more like who has push pull permissions on a certain repository

memcached	apc
if you serialized your data you could use apc or memcached to persist an object array that contains your data

9846203

9847140

by default a parent build script gets evaluated before its children which explains why it s not finding any projects that have cpp-exe applied

9847201
getter	setter
there is no way to introduce a property with automatic getter and setter and specify a mapping which would somehow skip your intermediate entity

9847201
many-to-many	one-to-many
your model just does not have a many-to-many relationship anymore when you add properties to the join table and best practice is to consider it as two one-to-many relationships

width	height
in this case i position the div relative and use jquery to set the initial height width to the width of the document

of course i had to add extra blank space in order for the texute to be loaded so the final size of the image which will include content and empty space is still a power of 2 for both width and height 1024x2048 in this case

try just logging the width and height of your desired view in ongloballayout in a view tree observer and see what happens

9847820
setcontentview	findviewbyid
also be sure that after you call setcontentview you call findviewbyid again to find whatever imageview object takes the place of the old one

9847820
width	height
if you re still looking at the image view before the rotation the width and height will never be accurate since that view is no longer in any visible layout

9847824

9848894
for-loop	arrays
with this fixed logic the largest item in the for-loop is size-2 and when you add 1 to it for the next adjacent number it will choose item size-2 +1 which is the last item in the arrays rather than overflowing the arrays

9848897
dev-c++	codeblocks

in the end i visited and downloaded the latest php_codecoverage and phpunit_selenium tar.gz files uncompressed them and copied all the files inside into matching folder locations within my phpunit install directory

9853399
post	get
for example if i m at the index page and click a post article.php the post will dynamically get on the page removing unnecessary content and will get the js article.js on the page

9853428
haskell	scheme
where c is some typeclass describing the types of variables i can import into ghc as an ffi scheme so that i can write in my haskell program stuff like

9853467
gridview	datalist
i have an asp datalist with a nested gridview

9853525
google-chrome	safari
have an swf object in the header and a big image in the left near the footer both are not aligned well and i did t succeed to fix it on safari without leaving google-chrome and ie unharmed

9853531
tabcontrol	tabitem
i use a tabcontrol to navigate but how can i switch the content of an tabitem

9853563
calloc	malloc
you can allocate space on the heap with malloc or calloc

9853563
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
just make sure you always check that the call to malloc or calloc worked and that you always free the memory later with free

9853563
free	realloc
if you ever need to resize the matrix you will have to either use realloc or ask for more space on the heap copy your values over and free the older memory

9853571
realloc	malloc
you can do my using malloc and realloc

9853627
put	get
basically what i am looking to do is populate a dropdown box from the contents of a mysql_array into a dropdown box...after the user makes a selection and submits the form the dopdown box will not contain the selection they just used....this form will have to be submitted mutiple times...i can get it to work no problem if it was just submitted once...so for multiple times i was trying to put what they had already used into an array and then compare that against the mysql_array so the already selected items wont appear again....this is what i have and i might be way off.

9853630
fadein	fadeout
also notice that you in simple animations could use fadein fadeout instead of the animate method.

9853632
innodb	myisam
when joining myisam and innodb tables in a join mysql internally converts innodb to myisam

9853647
width	margin
notice that in both cases the width of the blue box is 120px and they are aligned according to the left and right side of the red box using margin

9853782
range	minimum
with pre-c++2011 you can force a minimum storage by using a suitable range of values

9853782
integer	unsigned
i think the compiler is free to choose either a sign or an unsigned integer type as the underlying type

9853782
range	minimum
of course this only forces a minimum range and the compiler is free to choose a bigger range

9853817
int	double
terms of â œdouble nextdouble â as int to double conversions and

9853817
int	double
is there a better way more performant faster to generate an int random number that doesn t use double

9853850
versioning	upgrade
i m not a huge fan of using beta versioning of things or of the classic just upgrade to the new versioning fix

9853854
width	height
the height and width attributes of an tag are of course in pixels by default and an image will render best if you don t ask the browser to resize it from its native original resolution

9853878
google-chrome	firefox
you haven t said what these are in your case but the results look like google-chrome or firefox on windows

9853894
int	double
std map double unsigned int s

9853900
switching	screens
visual studio will remember the panes settings the next time you switching to the full screens mode

9853917
ssl	spdy
when the client performs the ssl handshake the server needs to advertise spdy via the npn extension

9853933
post	get
and i have the question - can i receive get or post info with my client-side javascript and why

9853956
multiplying	multiplication
when you perform the element-wise multiplication by your array d you get the results of multiplying d element-wise by the ascii code for the character 1 which is 49

9854016
inherited	properties
as bigredbird inherited from bird it will have all its properties so you just need to do

9854029
post	put	post	get	put	get
that really comes from the ability to support http verbs get post put delete which rails does

9854071
multiplying	add
convert minutes to int multiplying by 60 and add then add that to the seconds which is converted to an int also

9854088
collabnet	svn
i m using collabnet subversion edge on windows 2008 â and trying to auto-deploy so update from repo to folder when any commits are made by developers using tortoise svn

9854097
keydown	keyup
the keydown and keyup events are unreliable for detecting specific characters because the event.which property of these events are not char codes

9854104
public	protected
like methods constructors can have any of the access modifiers public protected private or none often called package or friendly

9854109
post	put	post	get	put	get
and is to specify your get post put delete in a web type attribute

9854122
int	double
mersennetwister.next int maxvalue now stretches that bad double over the desired interval

9854146
strlen	substr
currentroute substr this- getrequest - getrequesturi strlen this- getrequest - getbaseurl

9854166
integer	unsigned
i wanted to test the possibility of collision if the integer were 32 unsigned int

9854173
width	height
as far as having the inner scrollbar you can make the illusion of this by wrapping the div with another div of equal height and with the desired permanent width

9854186
qpainter	qgraphicsitem	qpainter	qimage
so here s what i m trying to do - using a custom qgraphicsitem i have my qpainter setup to paint into a qimage which i then save to a file or just keep the qimage in memory until i need it

9854205
integer	unsigned
however as of java se 8 there are a few new methods in the integer class which allow you to use the int data type to perform unsigned arithmetic

9854205
integer	unsigned
in java se 8 and later you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2 32-1

9854205
integer	unsigned
use the integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer

9854205
integer	unsigned
static methods like compareunsigned divideunsigned etc have been added to the integer class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers

9854205
integer	unsigned
note that int variables are still signed when declared but unsigned arithmetic is now possible by using those methods in the integer class

9854230
kerberos	ntlm
to understand why targetname is needed in kerberos but not in ntlm you need to understand some more underlying implementation

9854230
kerberos	ntlm
the net net is that service request for ntlm is untargeted while the service request for kerberos is targeted

9854248
super	self
instance variable used while self is not set to the result of super or self initâ

9854252
hide	show
the reason i want to disable is that if i use my custom controls and if i mouse hover i need to show my custom controls and when i leave the mouse it should hide the controls and the problem is that when i select the showcontrols the default controls is showing up which i dont want

9854263
nsstring	nsdata
this method recursively validates that all the contained objects are property list objects instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary before writing out the file and returns no if all the objects are not property list objects since the resultant file would not be a valid property list

9854294
post	get
however when i do the same for an object in this case the point object defined in the same post i actually get its prototype

9854308
int	double
generating random int by scaling a double in range 0..1 is fine provided that the generated double is sufficiently evenly distributed

9854308
int	double
however most pseudo-random number generators including mersenne twister natively generate 32-bit unsigned int so it would be nice if we didn t need to make the roundtrip to double

9854334
for-loop	arrays
the second for-loop puts only the names into the arrays - which causes the value is not a function error when you try to access the arrays values as buttons because the value is really a string

9854336
hex	binary
now how to convert that hex to binary and save as jpeg file on disk

9854336
hex	binary
var declared as hex code and then convert that var hex code to binary and save on disk

9854354
folder	directory
in development its ok to delete all these 3 new folder assuming you don t have any need for the logs and data stored in data directory

9854399
pull	push
everything like push pull update is doing okay but one thing is going wrong when i am using push it is showing something like this

9854400
wordpress	phpbb
i need to take a phpbb database and convert it to a wordpress database

9854441
width	height
just set the width and height to 100 like that

9854457
margin	height
you get this because i think that the margin is added to the height of the content that is 100

9854481
width	height
you can also remove the height and width - the right and bottom values will take care of that

9854501
wordpress	phpbb
with this you should be able to select information from the old phpbb tables and insert it into the new wordpress tables

9854534
int	chars
the fgetc function returns an int result which is either the value eof typically -1 if there was an error or there s no more data to read or the value of the chars that was successfully read treated as an unsigned chars and converted to int

9854534
feof	fgetc
or you can call the feof and ferror functions after calling fgetc

9854547
ciimage	uiimage
in 1 we create the ciimage if you are getting nil there then make sure you are passing the right uiimage cgimage or path

9854555
post	get
t grab progress on http post file upload android -- include the multipartentity class from the full apache httpclient library and then wrap the input stream it uses to get data in one that counts bytes as they re read

9854575
portrait	landscape
the document is in landscape proved with preview but the uiprinterinteractioncontroller prints the document in portrait mode

9854590
gmail	hotmail
this code works great when i send email to the popular servers gmail hotmail etc.

9854594
post	get
i am using wordpress get post meta to store the value of a custom field into a variable

9854608
maven	pom.xml
you can use the maven javadoc plugin for this scenario by augmenting your pom.xml

9854648
google-chrome	firefox
this has been observed in firefox and google-chrome on mac os x

9854682
serializable	deserialization
this process is called serializable on output and deserialization on input

9854714
getter	setter
most people including me will advise you not to access your ivars directly unless it is really what you want for example if you are creating a custom setter or getter for the property

9854723
maven	m2e
however due to the fact that the embedded version of maven within m2e is broken when performing releases i have configured eclipse to use my maven installation located at e maven-3.0.3

9854737
portrait	landscape
if you switch between portrait and landscape onsaveinstancestate will be called and you ll fill in the bundle that s passed in

9854737
oncreate	recreate
then you ll get back that same bundle in a future oncreate so you can recreate your activity from where you left off

9854757
rtp	rtcp
these two ports will be used for the rtp and the rtcp streams video and control data

9854757
rtp	rtcp
in addition the rtp port number should be an even number and the rtcp port the next odd number see that question if you want the port range to be random rather than user selected

9854760
accessor	properties
now using the properties and synthesize directives creates those accessor methods for you as well as the variable itself

9854811
email	dkim
first you need to set up dkim domain key signature spf for your mail server then you should use some php mail module like phpmailer so your email would not go to spam

9854852
pull	push
i have enabled the extension for progress but here i can t see the progress bar when i am doing anything push or pull

9854859
width	height
i know that in java i could use the graphics.create x y width height function to create a copy of my graphics object which i could use which would draw within those bounds of the original graphics

9854888
put	get
when you ve done that submit that fingerprint to google to get a new api key then put that in your application to replace the existing one

9854906
sse	avx
but if you want to invest development time maybe you should redesign your code so that it can adapt to other paradigms for example vectorization to take advantage of sse avx or gpus

9854906
sse	avx
but if you want to invest development time maybe you should redesign your code so that it can be either parallelized or vectorized and thus take advantage of sse avx or gpus

9854918
dlsym	dlopen
i have created wrappers around the pthread functions using dlopen and dlsym

9854918
dlsym	dlopen
this approach is very unlikely to succeed in general for pthread functions because both dlopen and dlsym themselves call pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock and possibly others as does the dynamic loader itself

9854940
folder	directory
for example i have gradua.as at trailcrest gradua gradua.as and that trailcrest folder is located in the same directory as my flash project .fla

9854941
fancybox	colorbox
i m using a jquery-ui dialog although i could switch to fancybox or colorbox etc if i had to

9854944
getter	setter
and finally you can declare properties as virtual and override them in deriving classes allowing you to provide different implementations for getter and setter

9854944
getter	setter
starting with c# 7.0 both getter and setter can be written with expression bodies

9854975
versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade my dotnetopenauth versioning from 3.4.7.11121 to 4.0.0.12079-rc1 to get support for oauth2

9855064
range	minimum
but i want the values of contours to grow exponentially from the minimum value of z up to the maximum range which is 350

9855068
hex	binary
is the only solution converting them to binary performing signed subtraction and then converting the answer back to hex

9855071
filtering	grouping
you should use aggregates and grouping to sum travel costs filtering by job id

9855075
hide	show
i am simply switching classes to show hide the div which works great

9855087
integer	unsigned
i have a byte 4 which contains a 32-bit unsigned integer in big endian order and i need to convert it to long as int can t hold an unsigned number

9855087
integer	unsigned
also how do i do it vice-versa from long that contains a 32-bit unsigned integer to byte 4

9855118
integer	unsigned
for example if you have an array of 32 elements or less you only need an unsigned integer to keep track of your array

9855136
getter	setter
however what if myproperty already has a getter setter

9855150
post	get
if javascript is turned off on the client browser none of your javascript will run the form will post or get to whatever action you define editpost.php

9855167
daemons	systemd
i believe your systemd is linux since you used the term daemons

9855192
post	get
file_get_contents is going to make a get request to the url specified but oauth2 token needs a post request

9855230
ethernet	wireless
or just wireless and ethernet

9855231
pop-up	dialog
when clicked this toolbox icon will display a pop-up dialog containing options to manage the topic - however in ie9 it is impossible to click the toolbox icon

9855287
width	height
another approach relies on the fact that browsers respect an image s aspect ratio when you resize only its width or height

9855317
post	get
the only way you will keep the ui dialog open as far as i can see is to either use an iframe into which the new page gets loaded or to load the new page into a specific content div by using for example jquery load or ajax or post or get - while you keep the ui dialog div outside of the iframe or content div

9855328
kate	scite	kate	kde
if you don t want to install kde dependencies for run kate i found a solution that could work until scite implementation in gnu linux

9855335
superclass	subclassing
i ve read somewhere that at first in the subclassing s constructor the constructor of the superclass is implicitly called

9855367
hide	show
from there you can bind your own show hide event maybe call an ajax method that deletes the entry behind the scenes and make a re-call to .load again and refresh the page

9855406
post	get
i have found from analysis of the markup on this page that this is done by way of a simple xmlhttp post to shell.cgi parameters and the output is the stdout you d get if you performed this on a local shell

9855433
rss	feed
basically it works like parsing an rss feed then combine its articles into a magazine which can be converted to mobipocket too

9855516
integer	unsigned
edit 26 march 2012 and although the declaration i provided indeed works replacing long with uint would be even better as win32 s dword is a 32-bit unsigned integer

9855518
for-loop	loops
the for-loop works fine but the while loops is not printing the desired result

9855587
ubuntu	linux
i deployed my application to a linux ubuntu server

9855594
fts4	fts3
see the introduction to fts3 and fts4 from here

9855598
button	checkbox
user select checkbox and when press the button sil it has to remove the artist

9855610
move	drag
when your user drag the object to the edge of the scrollview cause the scrollview to move one page in that direction by setting the contentoffset to move in that direction according to the bounds of the scrollview

9855638
inherited	subclassing
i have not experimented with inherited at all would this resolve my issue if i somehow have fulladdto be a subclassing of simpleaddto

9855640
put	get
some folks program linearly and once some block of code has nothing to do with the language is typed twice in more than one place and there is a risk that it might be changed depending on that risk it might get put into a macro or function

9855677
int	chars
it is meant to receive a chars argument but in your case the int gets converted downgraded you might say

9855684
folder	directory
2 if you have access to one directory above the root of the site then copy there all the other folder except for public

9855693
ilist	icollection
the collections that i have in mind are ilist icollection and collection

9855702
int	chars
in general it is probably not a digit according to isdigit because this function only returns true for int values of the chars 0 1 ... 9

9855702
fgets	fgetc
if scanf fails you can read one character using fgetc and retry again or read an entire line not using gets but using fgets

9855706
width	height
which size should i use for width and height to get the best result

9855723
folder	directory
so i would like to copy recursively a complex folder files structure to another directory but i d like to only include files with txt extension

9855739
scala	typesafe
java claims to be object oriented and typesafe and scala even more so

9855741
debian	linux
i have apache tomcat 7 webserver on debian linux in the local network with port 80 open through the firewall watchguard firebox xtm520 running 11.5.1 so the website can be publicly accessible

9855753
post	get
have to post as an answer cause i want to get a screenshot up to you in case you want to diff before i m able to pull down your code and actually debug

9855775
google-chrome	firefox
my junit test case changed the firefox driver to google-chrome driver

9855777
inline	inlining
inlining in this context means inline as the resharper refactoring functionality

9855778
firefox	safari
for instance safari on the mac not sure about firefox renders with mac-styled controls which can have different sizes borders font-sizes etc

9855787
textarea	textbox
we need to be aware of the fact that if that input goes into a textbox value or into textarea value or into a division html area and so on

9855796
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following javascript code that works fine in firefox and google-chrome

9855806
put	get
buggy plugins -- even if the plugin exists across all operating systems like flash generally they work best on windows and then linux and mac fight it out for second place usually more effort put into the mac port but on linux there may be wiki guides to get it working better and the distro packagers may use these tricks when auto-installing the plugin for you

9855806
ubuntu	linux
the only solution i know is if you re a windows dev to have a virtualbox image of a linux distro like ubuntu or fedora that you test your site on and see how poor the plugin performs when you add all of your bells and whistles then assume that macs are roughly the same performance

9855811
put	get
choosing which images to put together to get minimal palette

9855821
atexit	main
that code in main assumes you can mix statements such as atexit and declarations such as int val_a arbitrarily

9855821
fputs	fflush
another detailed discussion point is should there be a fflush after fputs and before fgets

9855821
pop-up	dialog
have you ever had a program pop-up a dialog box at which you can only hit the ok button even though its not ok and then come back with the same box again over and over and over again

9855829
mouseup	mousedown
in both cases it doesn t register the click if the mouse has moved a certain amount of pixels between mousedown and mouseup

9855845
maven	m2e
i am using eclipse indigo with m2e which connects to an external binary of maven 3.0.3

9855845
m2e	pom.xml
also receiving an error about m2e ignoring one of my plugin goals from the company level pom.xml within the module

9855881
mouseup	mousedown
a click is defined as holding down the mouse button and then letting go of the mouse button. it is a combination of a mousedown and mouseup event executed on the same element

9855881
mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
if the user moves away from the element they are no longer executing a click simply a mousedown and also a mouseout and then a mouseup on a different element

9855881
onclick	onmousedown
if for your application it is really important than any click result in this submit happening for you then don t go with an onclick go with onmousedown

9855890
width	height
so if your box is 100x100 pixels your thumbnail images need to be resized to 100px width for a vertical image and 100px height for a horizontal image

9855900
min	max	minimum	max
so all we need now is a list of ten numbers let s say n numbers increasing exponentially from the minimum value call it min to the maximum call it max

9855901
apache	cherokee
i m not really good with apache our production server is cherokee using reverse proxy and native python servers and not mod_wsgi so maybe i m missing something basic

width	height
assuming you re building mipmaps in a standard way the number of unique images will be something like ceil log_2 max width height +1

9855976
maven	pom.xml
sounds like maven isn t able to download a plugin org.apache.maven.plugins maven-resources-plugin pom.xml 2.4.3 from the repository

9855976
maven	pom.xml
failure to find org.apache.maven.plugins maven-resources-plugin pom.xml 2.4.3 in was cached in the local repository resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of scs.internal has elapsed or updates are forced pom.xml scs-model-core line 1 maven configuration problem

9856165
mouse	keyboard
some tablets handsets support specific device classes for instance some of the archos internet tablets support keyboard mouse and mass storage devices

9856177
getter	setter
but as possible for security reasons they should be private and will be able to use with setter getter methods

9856182
entity-relationship	diagram

9856253
mouse	keyboard
the image of the game stays on the screen mouse keyboard and restart button don t respond

9856269
mouse	keyboard
since the user does not see the html in the tinymce visual pane - it might be possible to allow content only within to be editable and once recognized to be empty all delete functions mouse keyboard are disabled to preserve the div

9856274
int	chars
this will work even when you have not chars but int and values

9856319
lisp	scheme
the former can be used with common lisp via slime search the web for set-up instructions for your platform while the latter readily supports scheme

9856320
gif	png
drawing has a method called asstring with a one required attribute that represents the required drawing format such as png gif or jpg

9856367
pull	push
example of noise you don t need 10 merge commits when all you did was to add a single line to the same file 10 times. if the uninitiated simply does a git pull and push back without checking the noise will be checked in

9856419
width	height
basically i want to listen for when any of about 20 dom objects change height or width

9856435
wxpython	textctrl
i am trying to remove the very last character from a textctrl object in wxpython

9856438
folder	directory
the main difference is the other pages that work are located in a sub folder while form.php is in the root directory

9856457
width	height
store the width and height in a variable that is later referenced in closure

9856460
for-loop	loops
i now understand from your comments that the code you show us is surrounded by a while or for-loop which is being run 100 times and that allquants and mostcommonletters probably change inside that loops

9856503
min	max
i have a scheme assignment in which a user is to input a list of numbers and the output should be the max value and min value from the list

9856526
width	height
each image is the same width but the height vary so when scrolling the page the rows all end at different times

9856529
postgresql	mysql
most commonly data is stored in a relational database such as mysql sqlite postgresql and numerous others

9856585
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
about restricting to one comment per day - yes you can use cookie but the problem is that user might use another browser type google-chrome firefox safari and will be able to make multiple comments

at the very least you ll want to use better variable names this just demonstrates the idea of how you d show hide images in javascript in response to button clicks

9860653
pop-up	dialog
now i have a transient top level dialog window that pop-up

9860742
width	height
so i want to load the image in low height and width say 500px x 350px when the user click thumbnail

9860772
cos	sqrt	cos	exp
another important point to remember when working with complex numbers is that functions like cos exp and sqrt must be replaced with their complex forms ccos cexp csqrt

9860784
width	height
what is the best way to get nimbus to make all buttons have the same size width and height

9860784
width	height
in the sample code below the height is correct for the buttons in the first row but the width is not

9860784
width	height
in the second row the width is correct but the height is not

9860797
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it in firefox google-chrome ie7 ie8 and ie9

9860814
capitalize	uppercase
uppercase lowercase swapcase capitalize uncapitalize - changes the case of a string

9860833
width	height
i believe that if a element is put inside span tag then span tag width and height must be adjusted to child tag height and width.but that s not happening here

9860834
joptionpane	jdialog
use a modal jdialog or joptionpane instead

9860853
subtract	add
if any unit is negative subtract 1 from the unit above and add however many of the current unit make up the bigger unit

9860891
hash	salt
as long as you have a salt hash that you can verify on both ends thats unique along with ssl its probably as safe as you can get

9860896
for-loop	arrays
when i print out the arrays after the for-loop every nsmutabledictonary in the arrays is the same - after some logging i saw that every for-step all dictionarys in the arrays gets replaced and one is added at the end.

9860899
disk	ram
ensuring your query is satisfied from ram via caching instead of from the disk where the db is persisted tends to have a dramatic effect

9860910
portrait	landscape
i need to make adjustments to a layer when the iphone is rotated but only if it is rotated from portrait to landscape or vice versa

9860915
g++	gcc
i recommend to enable all compiler warnings -wall -wextra in g++ to prevent such errors in the future as gcc hints that there s something wrong

9860964
tabs	tabpanel
i m trying to make the tabs in tabpanel navigable using arrow keys

9860970
superclass	subclassing
other classes can be related to a class as superclass or subclassing but they are different classes

9861010
nsscanner	nsstring
the nsscanner class is an abstract superclass of a class cluster that declares the programmatic interface for an object that scans values from an nsstring object

9861010
nsscanner	nsstring
an nsscanner object interprets and converts the characters of an nsstring object into number and string values

9861028
post	get
this post gave me the good idea of where to get the guts flash builder the ide pulls to debug the application

9861059
screens	mdpi
find the screens resolution and denisty lets say 320x480 and mdpi

9861059
screens	hdpi
you can change the resolution and density hdpi ldpi nodpi etc... i don t think you can do it with the screens size

9861076
superclass	subclassing
you can always interrogate the actual class from the superclass to make sure of where you are or you can implements specific details in the subclassing

9861099
httprequest	httpresponse
inside this managedbean i could create a method and recover the httprequest and httpresponse

9861106
google-chrome	firefox
however while it worked perfectly in ie and firefox google-chrome for some reason includes image png as part of its accept header causing users to be unable to load any pages that were protected

9861109
width	height
this code ignore image rendering if width and height of destination image is the same as the source image

9861149
ciimage	nsimage
but you need to use ciimage not nsimage so you will need to convert it

9861153
rsa	dsa
dsa or rsa has a private key and pubic key

9861163
kerberos	ldap
most application servers come with a variety of implementations which allow you to do common things like authenticate using info from a database ldap active directory kerberos etc

9861187
post	get
so in the first example the color function i believe will get recreated everytime a new post is called

9861226
post	get
this way we still get the nice object-oriented syntax of calling p.color ... and the benefit of only one function method instance which is shared by all post instances

9861251
post	get
you ought to make a get method redirect after processing any post form

9861278
opera	firefox
but there is an issue of playing music in other format than .mp3 in firefox and opera

9861353
post	get
are you try to access your get or post data in your query

9861353
post	get
if so you just have to use the global variable _get paramname for get data or _post paramname for post data

9861363
client-side	server-side
you cant do it with pure php u need to do it using ajax....because its about clientside scripting and server-side scripting...once ur form is submitted it is redirected to the other php script at the server side...in oreder to publish a message in the client-side u just need to use ajax...thats the only possibilty in my view

9861380
min	max
how would i get the two min and max as two seperate variables using php getting rid of the - and people

9861392
dbcontext	objectcontext
your best bet is either to drop down to objectcontext like the other answers suggest or to use the much better wpf data binding supported by dbcontext but do so without using drag-and-drop

9861394
folder	directory
i have a project that has components in several different directory and would like to treat the contents of those folder as a single git repository

9861506
post	get
to get data of a post you can do that

9861516
src	attr
incidentally i can change the src of the first iframe if before .contents i put the attr code

9861532
for-loop	loops
this at least will improve the code a little bit as there is one allocation before loops and no reallocation and copy is done when the for-loop executes

9861559
multiplying	add
so that gives the coefficients for l i then you just multiplying them with y i you could do that by initialising coefficients to y_i denominator i points if you pass the y-values as parameters and add all the coefficients together finally

9861559
addition	multiplication
update in your jsfiddle you had an error in the polynomial multiplication loop in addition to the now corrected mistake with the start index i made it should be

9861593
onclick	onsubmit
bind changevideocontent function with your form using onsubmit onclick or other events

9861615
sorting	filtering
well to solve this kind of problems where not all products have the same filtering which is by the way different than sorting fields i use a many to many relationship table for instance

9861616
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can define the routes in backbone s own style and then attach action handlers to get post put etc

9861616
post	get
requests get is basically a clicked link post etc

9861622
qthread	qobject
essentially what you are doing is using the qthread like a basic qobject class and calling play within the same main thread

9861624
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari floors

9861648
width	height
i use twitter bootstrap and can not figure out how to make the input form that would have been flexible and zoomed-out that is when i reduce the form it should not only be reduced in width and height - so should decrease the font size unfortunately i do not understand how to do this without using js

9861686
post	put
ps sorry i couldn t put the code in this post but so keep nagging me about using the ctrl+k while i did

9861687
getter	setter
synthesizing the delegate is not enough because it just creates the getter and the setter methods

9861777
rdf	owl
it doesn t generate a load of python classes from owl rather supports mapping python classes to terms in an ontology thus providing a way do serialise instances of objects to rdf

9861807
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
use an objectoutputstream to send the data and an objectinputstream to read the data

9861835
opera	safari
opera and safari seem to load exactly the same state there were before so dynamic content seems to be already prefetched and displayed good

9861838
put	get
i write the following codes and run it in my linux.everytime after fork the terminals print two pid which shows both processes are scheduled by the os and then it is time for scanf to execute both processes are blocked waiting for the input.however every time i put a number and then i get the same pid printed on the terminal

9861863
nsviewcontroller	nsimageview
i subclassed nsviewcontroller to get the image from the camera class and set it to an instance nsimageview and set the nsviewcontroller s view to be the nsimageview

9861884
post	get
a simple example are elements that cause the browser to send get requests another example are elements that are automatically generated and send by javascript and can cause post requests

9861894
width	height
in other words you need to switch the width and height around when setting the preview size

9861894
put	get
now i understand the purpose of the demo is to show how to get a camera preview up and running and so this problem is beyond its scope but i m wondering if there is a clean workaround for this since i don t want to put if htc_hero style logic in my code anyway i m sure other devices will have similar behaviour

9861912
powermockito	robolectric
i use powermockito + mockito running in robolectric with rule becouse its an android project

9861933
try-catch	exception-handling
if you run that progresschanged method inside a try-catch i see troubles because when you update the progressbar percentage you get an exception-handling that could be masked

9861933
int	double
i also hope that processpercentage is an int between 0 and 100 and not a double between 0 and 1 something that causes the bar not to apparently progress

9861993
subtract	add
another idea that i came up with is an if statement that is first testing to see if the the original character from the text is a letter if it is subtract that character by the shift position and if that number is less than 97 this is the ascii value for a then add 25 to that number to bring it to z

9862084
put	get
put some debug in there and see if you really get the right value in here

if you use jquery i found the following code works in ie firefox and google-chrome

9862135
post	get
get and post

9862135
post	put	post	get	put	get
your server needs to understand the difference between a get post put and delete request

9862135
put	get
as you saw in the examples above get put and delete could all point to the same uri unless your server can differentiate between these http requests it will be very confused as to what to do with that resource

9862135
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can define routes uris like in the examples above and depending on whether the call is get post put or delete it will execute the right code

9862135
slim	recess
there are other solutions similar to slim like recess tonic

9862137

9862263
memcpy	memmove
you should be using memcpy memmove and you have to rely on the return value of read to know how much data you actually got

9862263
int	chars
buffer + x with x an int type whose value is less than the allocated buffer size is a pointer to the x th chars in buffer

9862270

9862275
width	height
the easy way if you have a fixed width and height

9862614
postgresql	mysql
you ll see that they do actually line up quite nicely and the integer timestamps differ by 32400s aka 9 hours or 28800s aka 8 hours or 9 hours with a dst adjustment in each mysql postgresql pair

fseek	fread
after using google i have come to the conclusion that my best bet is to use fseek to move to the position of the offset and then to use fread to read an amount of bytes from that position

9862770
fseek	fread
it appears that i was being a bit dim and all that is needed it would seem from my attempt is to put the fseek before the fread that i have in the code above and it seeks to that location and then reads from there

9862800

bigloo is performance based and has many compiler optimization options although i can t find anything comparable for ecl

9873521
bigloo	ecl
this one is more for bigloo - is it more functional than ecl

width	height
the unit struct is used in asp.net to specify either width or height of an element

9873776
post	get
this means that you are trying to access a resource using a method get post etc that it does not support

i m trying to print out the state of a game after each move therefore initially the array will be full of chars then each move an entry will be updated to an int

9874055
int	chars
i think the answer is yes this is permitted and will work because an int is 32 bits and a chars is 8 bits

9874082
width	margin
simple - float the first div and give only margin equal to first div width to second div a div is a block element so it already has a 100 width - just for the sake of validation you can add width auto

9874090
int	chars
int and chars are numeric types and chars is guaranteed smaller than int therefore supplying a chars where an int is expected is safe so in a nutshell yes you can do that

9874096

you could set div1 to position absolute that it lays over div2 then you give div2 a width of 100 and all child-elements of div2 a margin left of 200px

9874120
int	chars
yes it would work because a chars is implicitly convertible to an int

9874120
int	chars
i think the answer is yes this is permitted and will work because an int is 32 bits and a chars is 8 bits. this is wrong an int is not always 32 bits

9874125
int	chars
you can also make an array of unions where each element is a union of either chars or int

hide	show
show hide based on radio button selection

9874642

i am using jtextfield inside jtable cells

9874693

9874899
folder	directory
in iis you need to have a folder setup as an application and not just a virtual directory

9875331
int	chars
as explained chars is an int compatible type

9875331
int	chars
from your explanation you might initially start with an array of int who s values are chars then as the game progresses the chars values will no longer be relevant and become int values

9875331
int	chars
imho the problem is not putting chars into an int that works and is built into the language

9875331
int	chars
i presume you would like to see the int values printed differently from ordinary printed chars

9875331
int	chars
you could ensure the int values are not chars as my program did

9875331
int	chars
i think it is easier to use a flag which says the value is still a chars or the value is an int

9875408
maven	pom.xml
i use the maven cxf-codegen-plugin as configured in pom.xml to generate the client code which is located here

9875455
persistent	transient
jspon is convention for using json for persistent object storage as opposed to transient object transmission

9875457

big problem with that though is that the user could simply enter the numbers in a different language or with miss-spelt but easily understandable words - or they could add spaces or any kind of punctuation between each letter there are many ways around this

9875464
margin	height
it took some googling but i think i found out that although there are no x axis ticks the labels are put into the second line of text in the margin and the line height of both first and second line stay the same regardless of there being no ticks and the font size being reduced

9875469

9876038
superclass	subclassing
sometimes its used to cast a superclass to a subclassing so that methods in the subclassing can be called

9876043

getter	setter
yes -- by using property and synthesized getter setter you guarantee that

9876608
getter	setter
your getter setter can be subclassed and subclasses can override storage and or behavior

9876624
getter	setter
if you were to look at the il then you would see that it actually breaks that simple into a getter setter based on a generated private variable

9876624
getter	setter
they are just a type of compiler magic to cut down on boilerplate code of having to create a private variable when there is no real logic in the getter setter

9876632
getter	setter
also don t forget about dynamic properties when working with core data and the possibility to execute custom code when assigning or retrieving a property when defining custom getter setter instead of using synthesize

9876671
textarea	textbox
if you want to include textbox textarea controls you ll need to use a template field

9876683
onresume	onpause
if your app consists of multiple activites and or stacked activites like a tab bar widget then overriding onpause and onresume will not work

9876683
onresume	onpause
in onresume for each activity you increase the variable and in onpause you decrease it

9876708
g++	gcc
so if you re using g++ it should have a stdarg.h that comes with it to handle this -- it generally gets installed in gcc s private include directory which is searched automatically before the system includes

if you can determine a min and a max possible range for your search column and the search column is not null then you can do better than the search is null or col search see this area of the above linked article

google-chrome	firefox
assuming you are working with firefox or google-chrome

9876992

9879993
pop-up	dialog
once that dialog is closed if i left-click on the field it would enable editing of that field so basically i don t want to ever turn off jeditable completely i just want it to go into hibernation mode between the time that the user ctrl-clicks on the field and when the dialog box that pop-up because of that is closed

9880152
epl	zpl
i m afraid that creating the epl zpl code is not directly possible with sql server but you can do it with c# or any other programming language

9880152

there s the sip handshake protocol that you re missing as well as the sdp that you re missing that specifies the rtp streaming info of the data the part that you have a rough start on above. all these protocol messages have to be formatted correctly to be interpreted by your phone for reference here s the rtp header structure

9883224
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
the sip sdp messages establish information about the rtp endpoints including port numbers and codec selection that happen outside of the sip traffic

9883224
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
my recommendation is to pick up a packet-sniffer tool like wireshark and examine the packet information of a softphone -or- hook an existing sip phone into a hub where you can observe the sip sdp rtp traffic

9883224
asterisk	pbx
you could also try configuring an open-source pbx like asterisk that would let you configure a network of soft phones you could get by with a network of just one or two softphones

9883224

i suggest checking codeplex for sip projects that will let you skip most of the sip sdp drudgery

that wouldn t secure the user s browser but would make it difficult for an outside observer who can somehow defeat ssl -- you should be using https

9889547
webclient	webrequest
either write an http request to the socket or preferrably use webrequest or webclient so that you don t end up implementing an http client yourself.

hash	hmac
i think the best idea to make hash based on hmac make hash encrypted by some password this sequence username+user_id+timestamp

9889578
many-to-many	one-to-many
i don t think that s the best tool to share files but it a great one to do some one-to-many or many-to-many communication

9889596
folder	directory
i guess i had to choose server directory instead of folder

9889596
folder	directory	children	parent
i guess it was misleading because if i choose folder it also puts it under the server directory at least according to the parent label under the parent children section

9890194
ubuntu	linux
if you put your test.py file where ever you put your cgi files i think it s usr lib cgi-bin by default for apache on ubuntu linux you should be able to run the python file just by making a request to it s address

9890214
getter	setter
it works since proxies are interfaces with getter setter

9890230
hash	md5
you could write your own string.hashcodedouble returning the desired number perhaps using a common hash algorithm let s say md5 and adapting it to your required response range

9890230
hash	md5	put	get
example do the md5 of the string to get a hash then simply put a 0

if you aren t using an mdpi display android won t be able to find an image to show on the screens

9890249

9890274
ant	maven
between maven and ant i found differences

9890295
backslash	dollar-sign
in bash you can either quote a dollar-sign with a backslash

9890295
single-quotes	double-quotes
or else use single-quotes which are like double-quotes except that they don t allow -based expansion and don t handle

9890296
x86	64bit
since you say you run your code on 64bit machines perhaps you compiled with the configuration set to x86

9890310
post	get
the user made initially a get request not a post so if he she wants to refresh the page the browser will reiterate the last action which was that form.submit and not the get request

nsstring	nsdata
after you receive the response from your server you should convert it from nsdata to nsstring

9890452
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
my solution is to read the sampling frequency bit rate and mono stereo characteristics of the uploaded file and choose a corresponding copyright introduction that matches those characteristics and then append that to the front of the file by reading in the introduction and the user recording as fileinputstream s and writing out the intro and the user file into a fileoutputstream

9890452
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari and firefox on win7 seems to take the progressive route where google-chrome and ie9 on win7 only display the 35 seconds of intro length although the entire 45 minute merged recording does play

filtering	grouping
how can one filtering a grouping resultset for only those grouping that meet some criterion compared against the other grouping

9890740
int	boolean
according to the doc the return value for preg_match_all is an int representing the number of full pattern matches or a boolean false on error

9890741
bazaar	git
i tried using git reset --merge but unlike bazaar it refused to merge some of the conflicting files

9890779

now after every step that might have exceptions to pull out we put the following on the failure path the red arrow vice the green one coming out of a task a derived column task to get the information we want like filename and exceptionreason and data and then a destination connection to the exception table to actually insert the data

9891242
rtp	sip
in the end each ua sends its rtp to the other ua directly while sending the sip signalling information to asterisk

9891242
rtp	sdp
i would suspect since jitsi handles this setting well that the ua you wrote is not honoring the new destination ip address in the sdp of the re-invite asterisk sent to it and is instead continuing to send the rtp to asterisk when it should instead be sending it directly to the jitsi ua

9891255
button	checkbox
it would also take further work to create the page that lists the organizations with the checkbox with a select button that updates the organizations raw id field

9891671
int	chars
int dont use chars

9891705
dictionary	map
you are looking at implementing a customized map hash dictionary class for this purpose

9891705
idictionary	icollection
this data structure doesn t really map onto idictionary but you could maybe make it implement icollection if iteration and contracts are important to you

9891709
button	checkbox
i d like to always register any change in a checkbox without the use of a submit button the user could forget to do it and it would waste time

9891714

our organization is completely on gmail google apps and we are trying to figure out a way to show hide content in the body of the email and have the recipient decide whether to show the content or collapse it to hide it

9891812

post	get
i understand how ajax works but i need some help to create my function in order to achieve the url to be correctly sent to the server for both get and post requests

9891834

i had to add a property changed callback to the dependency property so it could call the two methods to add them as visual and logical children otherwise it doesn t understand the parent child relationships which screws up user input

9891895
qtableview	qtablewidget	qtableview	qstandarditemmodel	qtablewidget	qstandarditemmodel

here s the problem i need to validate the form before submission in the next way before user can submit anything he should click save button if he tries to click submit one receives message something like you should save form before submit

9892360
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
as you can see instead of an onitemclicklistener i ve set a onclicklistener to each list item

9892372

what it does is it sends the input you give it to the process while reading all the stdout and stderr output

9892565
google-chrome	firefox
this works absolutely fine in ie8 9 firefox and google-chrome

9892592
int	double
you have declared your method as returning a double even though the spec says to return an int and you are attempting to return an int i in the function

9892698
realloc	malloc
my guess is that the realloc call manages to extend the memory allocated by the call to malloc

9892698
free	realloc
you do not need to free foo at all because realloc will do that for you if the memory area was moved during reallocation

9892712
rss	feed
i think you can use a rss depending on you have the rss feed or not

9892724
folder	directory
it s an easy way for me to go to a directory which has a number of project folder and print out summaries

9892725
free	realloc
at the point at which you call free foo foo is invalid since it was already free when you called realloc

9892725
free	malloc
of course since this is c++ you should be avoiding malloc and free altogether and using

9892734
for-loop	arrays
the c function is called correctly the for-loop that fills the samples arrays is ok but it crashes somewhere between the return and the next c# line so i guess it has something to do with unmarshalling although i don t want any marshalling unmarshalling the arrays is blittable and must be written to from c

9892740
free	realloc
when you realloc memory you should not free the old memory

9892803
put	get
this works fine however if i want to use the same expression to convert a single field in member to an addressdto in the anonymous type the only way i can get this to work is to put the field in a single item array cast to queryable and then call select on that - this seems a bit circuitous and i am wondering if there is a better way

9892823
range	max
itertools.product from range 1 upto n where n is the max word size would give the desired result

9892827
free	realloc
once you ve passed a pointer to realloc it is formally deallocated free and you must not free it again

9892827
free	realloc
and once you ve passed a pointer to realloc or free you must assume it is no longer a valid pointer

9892831
inherited	subclassing
it just didn t seem quite right to me so i was wondering if there was a way to just inherited the knowledge of all the ui elements into another class subclassing

9893366
post	get
you should not use both get and post in a request

9893370
nsnull	nsstring
all objects are instances of nsstring nsnumber nsarray nsdictionary or nsnull

9893371

oncreate	ondestroy
however lifecycle methods oncreate onstartcommand onbind ondestroy etc. are called on the main application thread

post	get
therefore you want to make a general get request to the sign in page first retrieve the session id cookie you get there and the hidden form value and pass it along with the post request

9893490
width	height
ensure the height and width is set and that the display block and text-indent is set to remove the text and format it correctly

9893503
maven	pom.xml
is there any way a jenkins build can be aware of the maven version number of a project after processing the pom.xml

9893754
integer	unsigned
usually 16 or 32 or 64 bit unsigned integer

9893810
hide	show
this assumes that you only want to show div with the corresponding id when you click a link clicking the wedding-tab link will show the wedding div and hide the others

9893872
maven	pom.xml
or have one of your local maven admins deploy the pom.xml and jar manually

9894098
folder	directory
on the other hand the directory go src pkg go has folder with familiar names ast token parser etc. but all they contain are .go files

9894104
int	double
v8 compiles the code into an intermediary bytecode then the hotspots are analyzed by the crankshaft compiler and if it determines that certain variables will never be anything other than an int a double a string or so on it generates machine code with it unboxed.

9894107
salt	md5
you may generate it by hash_hmac sha512 token salt where token uniqid user_id true and salt md5 mt_rand

9894113
post	get
also notice that your submit location just like with the prior j_security_check isn t going to the same location for the post doprocess as the get doprepare that retrieves the form

9894158
superclass	subclassing
final the book says stops the subclassing method overriding the superclass method

in google-chrome and safari the color measures off by a hair #e9e8e0 and sometimes #e9e8df but to me it s quite noticeable that there s a color difference

9894218
google-chrome	safari
the bizarre thing is that eyedropping the color in the kuler app in safari google-chrome is always correct no matter what screen it is on

9894236
hash	md5
the easiest would be for the service to compute something and send it to the javascript last modification time or an md5 hash of the list of filenames

9894308

create a custom type to hold the row data and if it is a class override equals and gethashcode

9894757
put	get	jcomponent	bufferedimage
create a bufferedimage call getgraphics on it to get its graphics object draw to it using the graphics 2d api then call graphics.dispose not strictly necessary but a good habit and as the previous poster suggested either create an imageicon with it and put in a jlabel using seticon or subclass jpanel jcomponent and draw it in paintcomponent

9894874
ienumerable	iqueryable
when you use ienumerable you are generating the enumerable at that point whereas iqueryable allows you to defer the generation of the enumerable until a control point of execution

9895449
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade it to php versioning 5.3.10 thread safe versioning

9895463
ant	maven
in fact it s a matter of compiling with ant or maven because they order the files differently

9895463
ant	maven
how can i generate an idempotent compilation process in ant and maven where the order of the source files passed to the compiler doesn t matter

9895465

i tried to use jquery for show hide toggle etc but for example i couldnt find how to keep those big divs unvisible within my html i tried css display none

9895479
put	get
ok i m trying to put my asp.net website onto my university s web server but when visiting my webpage i get the following problem

9895495
folder	directory
because your ror-related plugins only work in a rails folder and you are not in a rails folder -- you are probably in check pwd to know what the working directory is -- those plugins don t work

9895608
next	except
this code works great in theory except that once the dynamically loaded content on the next page is appended to the document the .on routine is being run on every single element a second time rather than just the newly added elements

9895695
int	chars
said getchar returns an int code of the chars not the number the chars represents usually it is the ascii value but it is platform dependent

9895711
sorting	grouping
in this example notice that i have a grouping header as well for which i can disable sorting

9895738
mvvm	delegatecommand
normally i would use delegatecommand from prism or relaycommand from mvvm light

myapp thingy 4 for twitter i had to disable the bit.ly url shortening because it didn t recognize it as a link and facebook wouldn t take the url share with the url saying it was an invalid url so i had to send it as just a text share

9895949
width	height
you could even use this to store up to 4 layers in a single image cutting max texture width height

9895964
mouse	keyboard
the strange thing is that using osk for entering characters by sending mouse presses on the osk keyboard buttons from robot is working fine

9895983
bash	subshell
so in shells such as bash and the classic bourne shell derivatives the suprocess subshell is on the right of the pipe reading from the current shell and that process ends after its read at the semicolon in this example

9895983
zsh	subshell
korn shell at least as far back as 93 and zsh put their subshell on the other side of the pipe and are reading data from those into the current process

9896082
post	get
really if you re doing something other than fetching data like a search your form should be using a http post not a get

9896097
int	double
most arithmetic and logical instructions of the jvm work only with int long float and double other data types have to be cast to usually int s in order for these instructions to be executed on them

9896097
int	double
the default type of number literals is int for integral and double for floating point numbers

9896121
post	get
if this isn t clear enough to get you there i ll try and post some actual code later

9896148
mouseleave	mouseenter
it is basically the same but with use of .hover which is the combined function of mouseenter and mouseleave

9896149
jruby	rubinius
there are alternative ruby implementations like jruby or rubinius that provide native threads without a global interpreter lock and thus allow your app to use more than one core but you d probably need to adapt your app a bit

9896166
opensplice	opendds
at the most recent omg meeting opendds demonstrated inter-operability with both rti and opensplice among other dds implementations

9896302
width	height
if you don t want a textarea i mean keeping the text on a single line you can use the width and height attributes

9896320
versioning	upgrade
this is my first versioning upgrade on sql server so i m new to this problem

9896339
unsigned	short
when you want to convert the signed short int -3 to unsigned short int you get just 65533

9896353
post	get
using post in this case may not be necessary but you need to be aware that using get will encode the form parameters in the url as in and some of this information may be sensitive and therefore desirable to be submitted to the server in the body of the http request as opposed to transmitted encoded in the url

9896375
integer	unsigned
you used c++ to interpret a signed integer and represent it as an unsigned 2 byte integer

9896384
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter and mouseleave events are specifically designed to handle this situation correctly

9896425
pull	push
i made the modifications however when i make backend controller library model patches updates and i push these updates to origin and pull down from origin on the server i need a way to avoid overwriting those changes in the views

9896439
post	put
you will be able to put any number of galleries into 1 post

9896451
google-chrome	firefox
i have a delphi vcl application which i m using to show some pictures and i would like to know if there is any possibility to transform it into a browser plugin like firefox google-chrome etc in order to load it remotely like a java applet

9896494
int	double
i have done double there but you may use float int etc

9896558
folder	directory
i place the otainstall and standardinstall folder from the output directory on my server and download and install the app

9896567
post	get
you could also trying to use post only get are cached

so to consume restful service you send the data in get or post to that method via url

9896680
keyevent	onkeydown
as a consideration have you looked at the onkeydown int keycode keyevent event

9896716
width	height
the width and height are very important as they determine the actual clickable region within the button div

9896726
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i would try viewdidappear instead of viewdidload depending on your viewcontroller

9896727
put	get
i have some code where i m trying to reuse a curl context to do put requests and get requests

9896727
put	get
after each put request the get request fails with this php warning

9896742
accessor	properties
a small improvement is to move your uidisplaycontroller instantiation to a lazily loaded accessor method for the searchdisplaycontroller properties

9896774
hide	show
hide it before changing the html then show it

9896786
listview	gridview
another approach is to use a listview gridview and have cost as another column

9896805
keydown	keyup
thinking about it the events fire in this order keydown keyup keypress

9896805
keydown	keyup
then the keydown event will finish it will later fire the keyup event on the now-focused field and should write the character into the field and then fire the keypress event that other events if any tied to the field can use

9896826
width	height
page.clientscript.registerstartupscript this.gettype open window.open + redirect + setup width 500 height 200 0 status 0

9896832

9896853
put	get
if i put the attached property binding after window.resources but still as a direct member of window and before the grid i get the following error at compile time

9896928
google-chrome	firefox
note the fact that google-chrome and firefox don t display errors dosn t mean that errors are not there

9896943
mouseup	mousedown
i ve tried numerous nib configurations various properties of nsbutton and nsbuttoncell overriding mousedown and mouseup

9896979

i m developing a site d6 that runs geocode lookups every time a node is inserted or updated the node has an address textfield and hidden fields for a lat lng pair and during hook_nodeapi i want to call this geocoding function

9897012
onresume	onpause
if you are requesting locationupdates don t forget to unregister the updates by overriding the onpause and onstop and re-registering in the onresume otherwise it will be a huge battery drain

9897023
hash	hmac
validation of hmac generated hash requires the key to be known to the validator

9897023
hash	md5
as i want the signature be smaller like an md5 hash

9897025
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop the null arrays are being instantiated into ever increasing arrays sizes

9897065
width	height
as the descriptions state screenheight and screenwidth provide the actual screen height width

9897089
mamp	wamp
basically you need to run a local host using something like wamp mamp xampp

9897148
google-chrome	firefox
when the jquery function returns false the code works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

9897148
google-chrome	firefox
when the jquery function returns true the code works in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome

9897214
onmouseover	onload
such as onload and onmouseover

9897240
put	get
you probably want to put in there some id you get from somewhere of the record you want to update a long number right now you re doing

9897270
rss	feed
where i work we wrote a background processor as part of a content management system a windows service that monitors directories e-mail addresses and rss feed and every time something new shows up execute a task on it - typically to import the data

9897277
qstring	qbytearray	qbytearray	qnetworkreply
i would like to be able to save the qnetworkreply to a qstring qbytearray

9897283
cassini	iis
a console application can not provide asp.net compatibility mode only a real web server like iis or cassini or iis express can provide that

9897287
post	get
to get the latest plugin when a new version of firefox comes out check out the google groups for gwt as alan leung a gwt dev will post the latest builds within a day or so of release

9897304
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tried firefox instead of google-chrome without a noticeable difference

9897404
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
qnetworkreply inherits from qiodevice which is a stream

9897430
getter	setter
so the solution would be to save the mysqli object in a different field and add getter and setter for it or delegate the methods to it

9897433
thin	webrick
if you re using webrick to run your application on heroku you should switch to using thin see

9897445
implements	extends
i m working on a mvc application in which the model is implements using an abstract base class that all actual models have to extends

9897488
children	parent
only identification for children are id and oid attributes from parent

9897531
google-chrome	firefox
i keep getting an unresponsive script error on firefox in google-chrome the page just freezes

9897531
submit	submission
i m using this on wordpress where the goal is to send some data through to wordpress via ajax upon form submission and then force the form to submit

9897579
getter	setter
it s up to the event exactly what it does but i think of events as like properties - except instead of a getter and a setter you have add and remove actions each of which take the delegate to subscribe or unsubscribe to from the event

9897606
std	ostream
error 1 error c2995 std ostream operator std ostream

9897612
jtree	jtable
it works automatically if your model fires the correct events similar to the standard jtree and jtable

9897664
folder	dir
but dir b s ad will give a concise listing of an entire hierarchy with the full path included for each folder

9897677
post	get
i then thought that in my create get post actions the view should probably just have the courseid but i still need to display it as a dropdown and populate it and i was unsure as how to do that correctly

9897687
put	get
assuming you re talking about designing a restful api yes it makes sense to return a 404 status when you receive a request get put delete to operate on a nonexistent entity

9897693
pop-up	dialog
i m writing a driver which needs to immediately pop-up a dialog to notify the user of an event

9897772
folder	directory
i need it to successfully find the exact directory of the plugin folder so that it copies the file process.php to the exact root directory no matter the location of the wordpress install

9897789
public	protected
what is the difference between public private protected and nothing

9897790
inherited	properties
when i create an instance of this class i assign to the instance some properties inherited from its ancestor listviewitem

9897791
fflush	gets
using fflush it gets rid of the second line output

9897806
versioning	upgrade
you can also keep multiple server versioning for the duration of the upgrade

9897808
width	height
the view needs to have 3 columns like pinterest with individual images having constant width but variable height

9897816
oncreate	ondestroy
with a service you have a well-defined lifecycle with appropriate lifecycle callbacks oncreate ondestroy etc. just as you do with an activity

9897817
hash	salt
if i store the salt in the db within the same row as the hash password isn t it just like i am handing the hacker the secret code

9897824
onresume	onpause
on my logic file i have onpause and onresume events as follows

9897825
integer	unsigned
c++11 3.9.1p4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

9897825
integer	unsigned
46 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type.

9897825
integer	unsigned
because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

9897864
ready	each
onreadystatechange script to be run each time the ready state changes the ready state tracks the state of the media data

9897894
hash	salt
combining the salt with the original password into the password hash protects against the attacker using rainbow tables of millions of known and well-known password hash to obtain the passwords of some of the stolen user ids

9897894
hash	salt
having hash the password and salt together makes it many orders of magnitude more difficult to crack even a single password on the basis that the salt invalidates the password hash known in the rainbow table

9897894
hash	salt
an attacker could for example target a small subset of your users with the hash and salt in hand and that s another reason to encourage strong passwords which are less likely to appear in a rainbow table

9897911
hash	salt
making the salt available should not degrade the security of the hash password

9897921
inherited	properties
using reflection i load all types except base classes not abstract ones into a combobox and expect the user to select a type book food medicine other all inherited from productbase class and set its properties and add into a global order object that contains a list of productbase

9897921
inherited	properties
ps this is actually a known interview question but i want this reflection approach in order to support all kinds of future messings with the inherited structure and moving adding removing of properties

9897954
width	height
and depending on resize argument image can be automatically resized after uploading and width height fields are correctly updated without saving object twice

9898044
versioning	upgrade
i guess i could do a general import __future__ but then i would get different behavior when i upgrade to a higher versioning v2.7 might have more features in __future__ and my scripts might stop working then

9898076
for-loop	arrays
in addition to the answer previously posted use instead of and in the for-loop you should cache the length of the arrays with var mems

9898091
isnull	nullif
so i thought to myself - obviously i should be using nullif and not isnull so i reversed them

9898097
super	extends
i also have another class sub that extends super

9898107
rss	feed
ideally by an rss feed

9898139
inherited	subclassing
if i use the table per subclassing inherited strategy i don t see a possibility for defining a unique constraint on multiple attributes that belong to different classes and then in the db to different tables

9898150
rspec	capybara
i use rspec 2.6.0 and capybara 1.1.1 for acceptance testing

9898157
width	height
other times you can use a frame with defined width and height attributes

9898157
width	height
this approach works when the element that needs to have a width and height does not have that feature

9898178
versioning	upgrade
i d like to upgrade my tortoisesvn to versioning 1.7

9898180
dependency-injection	service-locator
you tagged your question dependency-injection so i m assuming you re indeed using dependency injection as opposed to the service-locator pattern

9898188
nullpointerexception	invocationtargetexception
this nullpointerexception propagates up until it reaches the reflective call at which point the it is wrapped in an invocationtargetexception

9898217
hash	salt
i would opt for storing salt along with hashing algorithm s identifier and the hash itself

9898217
crypt	hash
if you are using crypt function for creating hash with good algorithms recommended would be crypt_blowfish then cracking even a single password can be exceedingly long in the scale of years

9898251
swing	windowbuilder
i ve already created new project windowbuilder - swing designer - application window

9898356
set	bag
the problem was that my remote client did not included necessary hibernate libraries which were necessary since hibernate internally casts properties of an entity like set bag to its own counterparts like persistentset

9898367
post	get
maybe the ploblem is that the parameters in this form j_username user j_password user submit send are parameters for http get not post you can try get the parameters on this way

9898396
fiddler	charles
in order to try to troubleshoot this problem i cranked up a program named charles similar to fiddler

9898396
ssl	https
however as soon as charles is shutdown or its ssl proxying is tuned off the https requests fail

9898405
for-loop	loops
i find this solution incorrect due to the fact that the second for-loop now has its correctness coupled to that of the first loops -- if i remove the first loops the second loops has to change

9898431
put	get
so far my applet runs smoothly when invoked within eclipse but when i try to put it on a server i get a null pointer on the xml files

9898442

anyone have an idea why only one way works in ie7 but either is fine in ie8+ firefox google-chrome and safari

9898476
public	protected
initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the

9898498
cpu	affinity
the linux kernel attempts to provide very strong cpu affinity with executing processes and threads to increase the ratio of cache hits to cache misses -- if a task always executes on the same core it ll more likely have pre-populated cache lines

9898528
int	double
your variable could have an int or double value and math.floor variable always has an int value so if your variable is equal to math.floor variable then it must have an int value

9898548
imei	udid
could also be linked to your imei udid unique id code for your phone

9898558
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it using google-chrome 17 safari 5.0.1 and firefox

9898567
docx	xlsx
for open xml docx xlsx try

9898607
floating-point	integer
the problem is that 11 as an integer is not the same as 11 in floating-point

9898613
ceil	floor
rint is measurably faster than floor or ceil

9898624
versioning	upgrade
also it might be a good idea to upgrade to a new versioning of codeigniter - beware of the new parent controller name though

9898648
width	height
the code is a very simple video tag with src poster width and height attributes

9898670
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so far tested in google-chrome ie safari and firefox with 0 errors don t have opera installed yet

9898676
nsmanagedobject	uimanageddocument
the objects are instances of an nsmanagedobject subclass and i m using the undo manager that comes with the managedobjectcontext you get when you create a uimanageddocument

9898687
opera	safari
opera and safari retrieve all the data but don t display it

9898702
put	get
the problem i am having is that no matter what i put when i want to create a circle or rectangle or anything like that i always get

9898731
loops	if-statement
in the foodselect loops you have an before the if-statement and one immediately at the beginning of the do-while loops so that clears the input buffer

9898780
snmp	mib
i copied my mib file to usr local share snmp mibs folder

9898825
hide	show
also i am wanting the show information hide information only to change for the div that is being toggled

9898839
rss	feed
each k2 item supports an image that also shows up in rss feed links

9898845
jqxhr	deferred
.get returns a jqxhr object that implements the deferred interface - those objects can be combined like this

9898846
getter	setter
if you use jquery then use the .val getter and setter on either input

9898918
implements	extends
