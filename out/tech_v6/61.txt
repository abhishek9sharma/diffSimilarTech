for a non-type pointer or reference you are only allowed to pass the value of another template parameter or the directly obtained address of the function or object without storing it first in a const constexpr variable

8501903
folder	dir
it is a good idea to choose 6 digits numbers and create the number string with the pattern 06.d as this will let you create much more than 100 000 different files in one dir and when you reach this number of files you will need to save them in separate folder to decrease filesystem seek times thus you will never need more than that

8501951
folder	directory
once you ve got this sorted you should be able to use your editortemplate as a partial view though that d probably mean moving it out of the editortemplates directory and into the appropriate views folder or shared

but in c++ std ostringstream is better and typesafe as joachim explained in his answer

8502344
width	height
so i want to fix width and height of fancybox as 470x290

apache	nginx
as vahur roosimaa said node.js is on the server-side think of it as nginx apache + php combination

opera	safari
server sent events also has broader web browser support as of today with support in safari only support older drafts of web sockets and opera has web sockets disabled by default and uses an older draft

8502560
sudo	passwd
actually i think sudo doesn t accept passwd from stdin you need to specify -s parameter to enable this

8502567
versioning	upgrade
an upgrade operation means installing a new versioning of a package and removing all previous versioning of the same package

8503347
accessor	properties
since the _attributes properties of braintree_customer is protected you will need to define an accessor method

8503347
accessor	properties
the other _attributes properties of braintree_creditcard also looks like it s supposed to be protected so i ve assumed an identical accessor should exist

8503347

8503390
maven	m2e
eclipse has a nice maven integration through the m2e plugin

8503408

int	chars
however all compilers i ve seen for such architectures just defined chars short and int to be 32-bit types

8504259
subtract	add
the best solution would be not to add and subtract when doing these kinds of animations and preferrably getting your css values from the elements themselves or at least setting the css values explicitly like so but then you would have to construct a way of finding the right values for each subsequent click

8504279
button	checkbox
i am trying to set the checkbox to enabled with the enable button

8504479
superfish	hoverintent

i mean you should make a casting form chars to int

8505915

when you need to switch connections based on some conditions such as having one website with live and demo mode each with different connection string then itâ s probably best to implement a class inherited from driverconnectionprovider and set this class as value of the connection.provider configuration properties in your config file

it seems that min and max are both 3d vectors as well as functions or macros

8506849
min	max
in the c# version you have min and max for the vectors and math.min and math.max for the function

8506849
min	max
my guess is that your vector class has an operator with two args so that you don t get compilation errors but this is not the same as the usual min .. max .. function

8506862
decoder	encoder
you just need to define the protocol write the encoder decoder and add them with the sslhandler in the pipeline

8507479
websphere	ibm

button	checkbox
what i think is happening is that when you click the button the page is reloaded and the repeater gets filled with your data overwriting the checkbox choices you have made

8508013

int	chars
use unsigned chars rather than chars this gets promoted to unsigned int so no leading ones

8508760
int	chars
explicitly convert each of your chars s to int and then mask

8508772
apache	nginx
say on a sub-domain using a more traditional server such as apache nginx etc

8508816
stdout	stderr
the usual convention followed by gfortran is that stderr 0 stdin 5 stdout 6

8508851
int	chars
you re passing chars s and having them read as unsigned int s you re lucky it works at all

8508861
pull	push
i got the whole pull and push system down somewhat now i have a question

8508873
int	chars
string literals are just chars arrays and chars are just 8-bit int so it s completely legal to perform arithmetic with them

8508873
int	chars
if the o8 th chars in this string literal has int value then .

8508987
google-chrome	firefox
is ie more like google-chrome or firefox in this

8509021
int	chars
also performing addition here has the side effect of changing the expression s type to int but it doesn t matter whether 130 is inside the range of chars

8509026
many-to-one	one-to-many
consider a structure where you have a many-to-one or one-to-many relationship with a condition where order by etc. on both tables

8509068
gridview	sqldatasource
the scenario is an aspx page with a gridview displaying data from a sqldatasource configured to select rows from a database view that is based on a sub-optimal query which i don t have time to fix at the current moment

8509082
int	double
you d probably be fine except for the trailing .0 of course in this case because you d have 52 bits of mantissa and that means that the double would act like a 52 bit int until your values got large enough to require the exponent

8509104
erlang	ocaml
i love both ocaml and erlang and use them regularly

8509104
erlang	ocaml
by the time i started using erlang i had years of experience with ocaml

8509124
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if this weren t happening i would simply add the titleview back in viewwillappear viewdidappear

8509127
unsigned	short
i have a class staticdisplaylayer and the constructor takes 2 parameters - an int and a pointer to an array of 3 unsigned short ints

8509138
maven	pom.xml
i found a maven plugin for automatically importing the eclipse jars and creating pom.xml files in my local repository but i have not succeed making it work

8509169
unsigned	short
to make a pointer to an array use which is a pointer to array of size 3 to unsigned short

8509180
multiplying	modulo
i considered multiplying the input by a big prime number and taking the modulo 2 64 something like a linear congruent generator but there are obvious dependencies between the outputs in the lower bits

8509187
inherited	properties
because your class implements idbtransaction you would successfully be able to assign to any properties that expects this interface but because it does not inherited sqltransaction you may not assign it to any properties or parameter that expects sqltransaction

8509190
unsigned	short
your constructor on the other hand expects which is array of three pointers to unsigned short

8509190
unsigned	short
as a matter of fact as a function parameter type it s a pointer to pointer to unsigned short - the dimension is ignored completely

8509190
unsigned	short
i think what you meant was for your constructor to take just a pointer to unsigned short and pass layercolor

8509194
unsigned	short
unsigned short displaycolor 3 is saying an array of unsigned short pointers or unsigned short essentially

8509194
unsigned	short
unsigned short layercolor 3 is an array of unsigned shorts not an array of unsigned short pointers

8509208
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports

rjava	jri
check out the jri rjava project which provides a java r interface

8509290
identifier	ambiguous
i m not really an expert with th but what you want is pretty simple with one catch neither ambiguous identifier nor module names can be captured or quoted in any way as far as i know so you ll have to put them in strings given as arguments to the th function

8509299
versioning	upgrade
upgrade it to a newer versioning

8509316
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is that the hover event over the icons and headers of the datatable only works in firefox in google-chrome or ie the event is not triggered

8509352
hide	show
i have a drop down menu that is a simple show and hide on hover

8509395
hide	show
if you want to only show this dialogbox when a specific tab is selected you need to hide the dialog box when another tab is selected

8509395
hide	show
you can do this by adding a tablistener on the tabpanel and implement the onbeforetabselected method and check which tab is selected and hide or show the dialogbox

8509421
getter	setter
oh i don t know my classes are quite simple at the moment if you could take a look through the two of them see whats the same mostly getter setter a draw method and an update method and suggest how i should be going about moving code to my sprite class it d be much appreciated

if you really need to deserialise more complex data types then you should consider using jackson or gson

8509818
fitnesse	jbehave
maybe using an automated framework like jbehave or fitnesse if you use java but there are alternatives for every language i suppose

8509858
portrait	landscape
for tablets this could be landscape or portrait

8509906
free	malloc
if you want to write an wrapper function over an free function like say malloc without modifying each and every instance in your code where the function is called then a simple macro shall suffice

8509906
free	malloc
though the example is for malloc it can be re-used for any free standing function really

8509907
google-chrome	safari
below is the client side js code i am invoking to make a connection and the safari header tags vs the google-chrome header tags

8509967
put	get
however we can definitely put that call after the definition and get the result you want

8510042
post	get
you only get updates post facto

8510054
tolower	toupper
even though this assumes that the code behind the datatable is doing a toupper instead of tolower for case-insensitive comparison it seemed unlikely that this code will change its behavior which would break all the code that uses datatable with case-insensitive comparison

8510064
nexus	artifactory
i ve tried using both nexus and artifactory as repository managers

8510076
put	get
i hope i get an answer to my question this time i already posted a question on this but i guess people overlooked it since it was not put properly here is a link to my previous question how do i know the id #39

8510097
post	get
curl is a way of sending http requests in php such as get and post

width	height
when loading a texture i tell my game what size the frames will be therefore i can divide the frame size by the texture width height and get my number of rows and collumns

8510188
hide	show
personally i like the show hide way much better with the onresize fix but you can try the alternative if you want

8510212
dns	spf
you should include all relevant dns information mx a txt spf in your question

8510215
post	get
yes it will be possible for them to view the get variables but they would also be able to see the post variables as well

8510216
folder	directory
in the directory block you are missing the current folder

8510220
folder	directory
so i make separate branches which contains identical filenames and directory structure except for the src folder name which must be changed to match the package name

8510225
rss	feed
i ve used this class as a base and then parsed it based upon russell beattie s python code from the original appspot rss feed application

all delimiter are spaces

8510464
public	protected
that is is this considered public protected or private

8510525
put	get
i am able to get it working just fine from a console winforms or wpf application but when i try to put the same code into a service

centos	linux
how can i install and use lxc or other light weight linux virtualization tools on centos 5 2.6.18 kernel without modify the kernel

8510576
hide	show
so the solution then is to hide the real upload and show the user some other element that looks how you want

8510587
division	subtract
you find the precision after division by subtract the precision of the numerator from the denominator so a straight divide would give 4.28 - 4.28 0 -- no significant bits

8510588
for-loop	arrays
to set the whole arrays to zero you have to iterate with a for-loop and set each one to 0 manually type it out like 0 0 0 26 times .

8510637
width	height
then if rotate is set to 90 or 270 i reverse width and height

8510641

portrait	landscape
if you want to create a totally different view like music app shows cover flow on landscape and song on portrait you should create two nibs

8510673
hash	md5	nsstring	nsdata
here is how to create a md5 hash from nsstring nsdata or a file

8510703
inherited	properties
what i am looking to do is not include those inherited properties and build a json string out of only the 3 properties in inheritingclass

8510707
hash	md5
you can use the md5 hash that s the best option

8510707
hash	md5	nsstring	nsdata
here is how to create a md5 hash from nsstring nsdata or a file

8510708
filtering	grouping
one way to supply the right conditions to your custom fetchxml is to duplicate the type region and budget fields in the customeraccount form so that when the lookup dialog is opened it filtering the existing grouping based on the values you ve selected in the customeraccount form

8510728
opera	firefox
side note firefox and opera use the same html in an in-page popup which embeds the pdf

8510734
inherited	properties
with this you can do the following in your inherited class to stop a properties from the base class from being serialized

8510763
inherited	properties
however there is no way to implicity ignore the properties of the base class the inheriting class is the base class that s how inherited works

8510794
mvp	presenter
the main thing to remember is that if you are adopting mvp you want to keep the view part as simple as possible because views are more difficult to test than presenter

8510815
writetofile	nsdata
is it â œcorrectâ in the sense that itâ s guaranteed to yield the exact same permission under all circumstances as nsdata â s regular writetofile methods

8510816
inherited	properties
this code return properties type of propertyinfo that inherited members are not considered

8510817
post	get
but how do i get the corresponding post comment

8510833
width	height
height and width functions to calculate button dimmension

8510858
post	get
no it doesn t depend on de http verb but you sure can have different actions to handle get and post or it can be the same and you ll get params a in both cases

8510870
melt	reshape
as you may guess i am new to melt cast reshape

8510911
spweb	spsite
try to remove using keyword from your code .you should not dispose your spsite and spweb when you use spcontext because disposing of that object might actually break the workflow as it may still need a reference to that object for later use

8510932
width	height
have a figure window with a given position x y width and height with a plot inside

8510932
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
make the plot as height and width to have the tightinset plus a margin in each direction of a certain px-size tightinset + 10px as big as the figure window

8510939
inherited	properties
i know there are several way to avoid this situation not using inherited using a stored procedure to insert a new derived entity calling the id-generating db-function before inserting and set the id properties myself on the entity but at the moment the above-described behavior would be the most preferable so i want to make sure not to overlook something before deciding for any plan b

8510949
udp	tcp
udp and jms are different in many ways and fundamentally since jms typically relies on the features inherent to tcp see this comparison of udp and tcp to get an idea of the differences of the two underlying protocols

8510955
crypt	hash
with crypt you can generate 13 character long hash

8511041
ant	maven
if you are already going to migrate to maven i would suggest to check out the aether ant tasks which are the replacement for the old and now pretty much deprecated maven ant tasks

8511045
post	put	post	get	put	get
i figured this out when declaring get put post etcc.

8511046
ivar	subclassing
you make a subclassing and you muck about with the ivar there

8511046
ivar	subclassing
when the compiler processes the subclassing it cannot see the synthesize line so it would have no idea that you just changed the name of the ivar

8511046
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
in fact it cannot even tell if the properties is backed by an ivar at all or if it s implemented with custom-written accessor methods

8511046
ivar	subclassing
i hope it s obvious why this means that the subclassing cannot possibly access the ivar and neither can any other class

8511062
post	get
but when i would try to create edit or update post i would get the errors

8511064
hash	md5
hashing is one way and is used for verification of passwords content and the like where you want to make sure subsequent md5 or similar hash from that content is identical

8511111
width	height
s if you got the width and height of the imagens you could simple do since you don t need to mess with the context state stack it may be faster

8511129
websphere	ibm
this question is in regard to jsf 1.1 under ibm websphere

8511216
width	height
did you try to specify the width and height properties for your ul and li elements yet

8511221
google-chrome	firefox
form looks properly under firefox and google-chrome but not ie

8511229
translation	localization
these translation are supplied directly by rails date localization which you can learn more about in the i18n rails guide

8511267
put	get
when you want get information on a resource the server knows about or to delete one or put a new state then define a uri that refers to it

8511280
range	min	range	max	min	max
in the range min 2 max 2 and then take its square root as your r.v

8511330
ssl	https
you don t seem to need ssl certificates etc since the url is http not https .

8511344
submit	submission
i think you need to stop the submit button for submission the form to do this add return false

8511356
division	modulo
if you remember your maths from school you can use the modulo to get the remainder of a division operation

8511367
getter	setter
use the following to get a basic entity class definition from your mapping complete with getter setter functions for each property

8511367
getter	setter
you re still responsible for modifying each getter setter to ensure that they are the proper datatype as the getter setter methods generated for the entity don t do any type casting converting

8511368
getter	setter
property creates the getter and setter for your variable but is often confused for a variable itself

8511372
for-loop	loops
you need to remove that from the for-loop and make it an if statement inside loops

8511392
for-loop	loops
the conditional in the for-loop indicates when loops should stop

8511414
folder	directory
common part will be stored in src main resources and other configs will be in appropriate folder in config directory

8511438
move	drag
but it seems that the sortable property is not taken and in addition once i move a blue box i can t drag it anymore

8511452
for-loop	loops
well it should loops once you see in a your for-loop works like this it checks the conditions 1 and 2 and if this condition is true it steps inside the for-loop braces

8511472
dictionary	map
you are usually better to use a dictionary to map keys to values that s what they are for and you avoid the use of exec and eval

8511473
hide	show
the user must first select from 2 radio buttons what type of user he is employee or management and from the selection i change the ui and display show hide certain div s

8511475
itext	jpedal
not sure how your ocr software creates the pdf but could you use a third-party library jpedal or tool such as itext or xpdf to extract the text from the resulting pdf

8511521
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
everything works as expected in google-chrome firefox safari but the images don t show up at all in ie

8511541
hash	md5
if you are looking at the file contents you can use the md5 hash to determine if the file contents match or don t match

8511541
hash	md5
this way files that have matching md5 hash and thus matching contents would be in the same hash list

8511564
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
however java.util.calendar is generally accepted as the replacement for java.util.date as it provides more functionality especially regarding extraction of individual date elements like year month etc

8511578
src	attr
to set the src attribute with jquery since 1.6 you need to use .prop not attr

8511589
google-chrome	firefox
the following works in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie

8511595
getter	setter
you ll have to make it public or use a setter or getter and you ll need to use main.integer since it s static

8511641
persistent	transient
normally all properties that are not specifically marked with the column attribute are treated as transient part of your application logic and are not persistent or retrieved from the database

8511658
profiling	debugging
then i debugging it via sql profiling and execute the result from the profiling to a query window this means i run the storedprocedure with the necessary parameters basing from the profiling to a query window and surprisingly its working just fine

8511692
clgeocoder	mkreversegeocoder
well now we ll have to use clgeocoder but if you want still to use mkreversegeocoder you must not call geocoder start twice even if the geocode object is a fresh new one

8511723
int	chars
to be safe i d go with with a byte array unsigned chars rather than an int to hold the value

8511737
versioning	upgrade
the recompiling meant to recompile the code with jdk versioning same as the upgrade one on the servers

8511738
implements	extends
i m looking for a way to extends java syntax basically i want to implements lispish macro system where i can have a preprocessor that will modify ast in compile-time

8511747
width	height
can you reduce the size pixel height width i mean of the images or drop the color depth

8511842
try-catch	exception-handling
i d recommend wrapping anything you are using that requires the permissions in a try-catch block and throw a meaningful exception-handling if the commands fail because of a lack of superuser permissions

8511848
switching	screens
when you switching to a different tab you get a smaller photo artifact for a couple of seconds in the right corner of the slideshow screens i have a feeling this will go away when #1 is resolved

8511848
width	height
it s really a general issue with javascript dom-manipulation when an element is set as display none - like the hidden tabs - nodes inside of them have no height width

8511849
sorting	filtering
doing too much in ruby that could be done at the db level sorting filtering join data etc

8511849
heroku	engineyard
in the end i think you ll find that it is not an issue specific to heroku and if you had your app deployed on amazon engineyard etc you d have the same performance

8511849
profiling	benchmarking
the good news is i think that your problems are common and shouldn t be too hard to fix once you ve done some benchmarking and profiling

8511856
rational-numbers	base
additionally rational-numbers that are exactly representable as floating point numbers in base 10 like 0.1 or 0.7 do not have an exact representation as floating point numbers in base 2 which is used internally no matter the size of the mantissa

8511952
range	minimum
fix the maximum value of the range slider so that the user can only select a minimum

8511995
post	get
it comes with some good working example pages that go through the oauth dance and provides you with a simple twitteroauth object that has methods like get and post

8512032
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

8512044
children	parent
i had to seed a counter_cache value recently and before doing it as a bunch of ruby code loading the parent and counting their children i gave this query a shot

8512051
cdr	cons
push cons cdr x car x res

8512061
public	protected
and nsgod is right that normal instance variables are protected by default rather than public fixed that

8512068
put	get
you could send the put requests to a random server and then send all of the get request to all of the servers and wait for all of the responses

8512106
octal	hex
hex 0x1b6 is octal 0666

8512122
mouse	keyboard
native client provides accesses to browser-side resources through the pepper plugin api ppapi so that untrusted code could safely access audio 2d and 3d graphics mouse and keyboard events etc

8512156
accessor	superclass
they don t provided you actually declare an instance variable in the superclass rather than rely on the new runtime s ability to synthesize the instance variable in addition to synthesizing the accessor methods

8512156
public	protected
protected ivars differ from public ivars in that you can t access them using

8512167
post	get
i realize i will probably get flamed for being so vague but it is an awful lot of code to post

8512170
magento	concrete
deep dive on the magento internals here not looking for a solution to a concrete problem just trying to understand some implementation details

8512186
pop-up	dialog
i click it but no authenticated referral dialog pop-up

8512199
getter	setter
automatically generates getter and setter but it looks like it is also changing my own classes

8512238
getter	setter
other classes know only about the property a property means a getter and a setter method but they don t know anything about the inner implementation of its methods

8512238
public	protected
note that the access specifiers public private protected in obj-c are only a hint to the compiler that even if something appears in the header file it can t be accessed

8512252
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase announced changes to couchdb distribution

8512252
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase single server has geocouch integration is there an alternative to get geocouch support on couchdb

8512254
hide	show
i am trying to figure out how to show hide a navigation link based on the users role

8512276
post	get
when i tried this in a sample code what i was able to see was that query parameters get are given precedence than the post body

8512276
post	get
so according to the code for params the get parameters should get overridden by post parameters in case of identical keys

8512276
post	get
note that get method and post method were also overridden mainly to convert the hash returned to an object of hashwithindifferentaccess

8512276
post	get
so looking at the code here it becomes evident that post parameters are overridden by get parameters in case of identical keys in rails

8512276
post	get
or in other words get parameters are given precedence over post parameters

8512316
solaris	aix
if you change from linux to windows or even from systems like solaris or aix i would espacially make sure its working

8512326
move	drag
scroll down and try to move item q drag it by the gray bar on top of the box from the red list into the green list

8512376

super	extends
if your b class extends the a class then through the constructor of the b class you can set the properties of the a class that is the super class

8516346

yes the problem you have here is that you have a public member which the play magic is generating setter and getter for you

8516356
ubuntu	linux
i am using qt creator on ubuntu linux noob

8516361
getter	setter
to share a variable between two classes you can either make the variable static and put it in another class that both your classes extend in effect a global variable which is bad practice and not thread safe or have one of the classes have an instance of the other and call getter setter

this shows up in all browsers so it s not a google-chrome issue or safari issue or whatever-browser issue

8517116
int	chars
you d probably do best to use an int instead of chars while computing the new chars value

8517116
int	chars
since c - a generates an int because all chars values are promoted to int this avoid any overflows in chars

8517129
gif	png
also you said png but if you are using a gif which i suspect that only supports one transparent colour what you re seeing looks exactly like issues you get when you have a hard sprite with a solid back ground colour which is the transparent entry in the palette and then you resize the image

as you cannot get information out of that by all assumptions of cryptography although md5 in particular is not so secure anymore the only thing i could image doing with it is comparing it to another given hash to see if the underlying email addresses urls whatever are equal

8517309
put	get
but actually what happens is that while you are assigning value to sharedpreference using put get function at that time you reading writting value in string object ..so the limit becomes to store value at one time equal to size limit of string object of java

if you want to ensure a certain format then you could extends an xmlwriter implementation and override its but that way you would also not preserve the input format rather you would then write out any empty elements as or whatever format you implements in your method

8517429
super	extends
you could extends the bordercontainer class in flash builder put in bordercontainer in the super class text field

8517496

addition	multiplication
ta 2+tb 2 requires 2 multiplication and an addition which means that ta-tb ta+tb ta 2+tb 2 requires 4 multiplication and 3 additions

8517740
addition	multiplication
on the other hand i guess that ta 4-tb 4 is done like this ta 2 2 - tb 2 2 which means 1 addition and 4 multiplication

8517779
int	boolean
the problem is that i get an error message that says type mismatch -cannot convert from int to boolean

addition	multiplication
the same identities hold for matrices as well since matrix addition and multiplication can be expressed through scalar addition and multiplication

my problem is the form is submission when the user clicks submit

8518251
url.action	actionlink
how to put span element inside actionlink but not with url.action

8518320
free	malloc
instead you should use malloc to allocate the space for themessage and then subsequently free it later on outside of the function when you re finished with it â â however this can often lead to memory leaks if you re not diligent about cleaning up after yourself

8518334
button	checkbox
to be able to select multiple checkbox just set autopostback to false and then create a button near the checkboxlist on which to click to do the asynchronous postback after you selected all the required checkbox

8518336
postgresql	mysql
so basically for all other dbms mysql postgresql mongo i m using the following algorithm

8518388

for single selection from multiple options we use radio button not checkbox

8518394

google-chrome	firefox
what i found is that the outerwidth for h2 in ie 7 is shorter than in ie8 firefox google-chrome etc

8518586
width	height
what i am doing is i just display webpage in webview and disable scroll then i can find the max height of webview and device screen size height and width now i have put two buttons for next and previous pages which just scroll page according to height of device size

8518589
width	height
so you need to double triple your width and height to receive a better resolution

8518608
glassfish	weblogic
for example lets say we have a web project which needs a specific jar a to run on glassfish server while the same project needs additional jar b to run on weblogic in its web-inf lib folder

8518608

8518700
width	height
the viewbox controls the coordinate system of the objects it contains and the height and width attributes control how big it looks

8518722
fflush	gets
without more code i d say you need to fflush your dao so the instance gets persisted

8518722
fflush	gets
refresh is only object level while fflush does an actual transaction on database level hence the so it gets rolled back after the test

8518758
int	chars
now why chat to int works because every chars is represented as unicode in java so you can think of it as at backend chars is a smaller version of int

8518758
int	chars
int is 32 bits and chars is 16 bits

8518769
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc

8518788
for-loop	loops
if you just want to have a single loops you can use a for-loop and use the same index value for both collections

8518797
free	malloc
the c standard mandates that the same address returned by malloc be passed to free to deallocate the dynamic memory so it is clear that malloc maintains some kind of table or mapping for each allocated address mind you exact details are unspecefied where it stores the size of the allocated memory against the address and so it knows exactly how much memory was allocated for every address it returned back to its callers

8518805
portrait	landscape
we have disabled user zooming and have used a media query to tell users to keep their device landscape for the best experience it s a web based presentation but if they have the device portrait at all it messes up the scaling when it switches back to landscape and they can t get back to the original state

8518823
ienumerable	ienumerator
instead of the foreach you can access the ienumerator from the ienumerable of both collections using the getenumerator method and then call movenext on the collection when you need to move on to the next element in that collection

8518827
int	chars
what you can do is to first cast the chars to int - this cast is okay since both are primitive types - and then the int can be boxed

8518827
int	chars
of course chars - int boxing could have been made working

8518907
post	get
for example if you post a form the controller will get the form data validate it load the model update the data in the model with the post data and save the model

8518937

8519239
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
im working on image preview before uploading with jquery it s working in google-chrome and opera but it s not working in firefox

8519280
width	height
probably width and height are properties so you must do something like

8519286

and in my test method i put the object in session before calling the service but the service throws an exception when trying to get the object from the session i guess that this is because the facescontext is not available what do you think

8519515
persistent	transient
if you need only strategydata to be persistent you can declare the other two variables as transient

8519518
button	checkbox
when designing say a windows form application it is possible to drag controls directly onto the form button checkbox etc

8519526
persistent	transient
if the variable is declared as transient then it will not be persistent

8519526
persistent	transient
so all those variables which you do not need to store in the persistent state of the object can be declared as transient

8519529
put	get
in the code above if first thread tries to get data and queue is empty i put in wait via wait 0 until other thread add data to queue an release from waiting via notify

8519541
instances	transient
if it would run simultaneously on several jvms a distributed server for instances than no the variables that represent the state of your object must not be transient

8519548
hide	show
i wrote code to hide show the iteminfo when the mouse is over out of myitem

i need primarily free pascal example or failing that delphi

8519678

calloc	malloc
3 never typecast the result of malloc calloc in the c language

8520027
ant	maven
the order of execution of test classes within a suite is guaranteed if you re using suite but the order of execution if the test classes are found by reflection isn t for instance if you re running a package in eclipse or a set of tests from maven or ant

int	chars
btw the whole const chars to int looks highly suspicious

8520350

8524110
for-loop	arrays
when i add this simple for-loop around the second insert statement it hangs even if the arrays only has one item

8524137
put	get
i just thought of a reason why postandasyncreply might be necessary in the blockingqueueagent example scan is used to find get messages when the queue is full so you don t want to put and then get before the previous put has completed

8524172
carrierwave	paperclip
try carrierwave carrierwave railscasts instead of paperclip as i prefer the added helpers that come onboard plus there a number of great plugins like carrierwave_direct for uploading large files to s3 which integrate nicely with carrierwave

8524174
portrait	landscape
for landscape and portrait i need 2 xib

8524192
monkeyrunner	adb

8524229
screens	tablet
apps written with this framework run in a reduced screens mode on the touchpad tablet or you can make them run full screens if you want but in most cases it is hard to make them look good since the framework was designed for the phone form factor

google-chrome	safari
except that it performs atrociously in google-chrome and safari

8524241
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

8524345
versioning	upgrade
when the application is upgrade it compares the old versioning on the disk with the application versioning and if they re different it deletes old data

calloc	malloc
also casting the return value from malloc or calloc is at best redundant and may hide an error the compiler would have caught if the cast wasn t there

8524397
google-chrome	safari
but this only works in google-chrome and safari and is a bit buggy

8524409

when i assign the to jquery .noconflict as follows it still shuts down the scriptaculous functions

8524700
jquery	scriptaculous
i know that i am assigning the to jquery in .noconflict mode and i assume that scriptaculous which loads via a widget in the main body therefore after jquery is trying to re-assign the back to scriptaculous

8524700
jquery	scriptaculous
how can i assign the to jquery in a way that the later-loaded scriptaculous library won t conflict

there is lot of show hide logic goes around in the jquery

8525157
gif	png
the script works great and is quite fast for png gif and jpeg inputs even at fairly large 4000x5000 resolutions

8525157
gif	png
that would either enable imagemagick to convert these high resolution jpeg-2000 images on-the-fly like it does with png gif or jpeg.

8525166
textview	imageview
the idea is a horizontal scroll that addimagviews to it if a variable is somethin and if you click the imageview the imageview will settext to an textview

8525167
hide	show
instead you can hide your view in your xml layout and show it when your button is clicked

8525177
folder	directory
i am sure it is not a coincidence that this is the same file that i dragged from my root directory for the project to the classes folder because the .mm file was there and i wanted them to be together

8525184
jobs	cron
the server runs very slowly several of these cron jobs run in parallel and it s making the cpu go to 100

gridview	rowdatabound
i ve debugged the gridview s rowdatabound event and confirmed that every row being bound has exactly the same content each time

8525518
min	max
max and min both require lists or other iterable things - so instead you have to add number to a list like so

8525614
put	get
to get the links inside the unsorted list html structure you mention you need to put anchors inside the list items like this

8525657
folder	directory

mouseover	mouseout
i ve tried to fix this using settimeout in both the mouseover argument s function and in the mouseout argument s function

8525825
x86	64bit
when i log into the server ubuntu gives me a greeting string that says among other things x86_64 which i take to mean an x86 chip and a 64bit architecture

8525825
x86	64bit
i don t see a 64bit version for x86 chips so i guess i have to use 32-bit

8525827
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box is the best way to do this

8525827

all of those are the same architecture namely the 64bit extensions to x86

8525908
move	drag
then the user can move his picture drag drop style so he can choose which area of it is visible through the blank hole

8525909
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box

like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller uisplitviewcontroller is a container view controller and it shapes it s subviews to fit it s purposes

you need to add a width and height

8526174
lxml	beautifulsoup
you can also do this with lxml instead of beautifulsoup

8526174
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
i switched over to using lxml.html instead of beautifulsoup because of the cssselect method

8526199
children	parent
note that this is something i wrote in 2 minutes and it is problery not good in production but the 2 main things is that you have a parent node and many children

8526210
profiling	debugging
you can use a simple and to a debugging file or another profiling tool

8526218

i know that those last declarations haven t sense the int i instead of chars i and an added pointer that isn t even needed

8526351
post	get
when i get to that point in my problem i ll post another question

8526371
button	checkbox
this functionality would be similar to selecting several checkbox next to unread emails in gmail and hitting the mark as read button

8526381
getter	setter
i think i can figure this out if i change my model so that the nsmutablearray contains a custom class having a setter and getter to a declared property following lucas youtubtorial on nstableview bindings but i would think that there might be a simpler way one that allows me to use my array of nsnumbers

8526430
int	chars
regarding the last portion of your question the number of bits of int is always more than chars so it won t cause a problem

8526483
gridview	rowdatabound
as i understand this is because a postback is occurring however the rowdatabound events will not occur for the other gridview rather they will just reload their data from the viewstate which does not contain the totals

8526508
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
this is a common pattern in the javascriptmvc framework that i m more used to that backbone.js

post	get
can anyone explain or point to some documentation on the get post requests together with the message bodies + parameters + headers needed for authenticating a consumer with each of the following providers facebook linkedin google twitter

8526556
mouseleave	mouseenter
your problem is that hover is not a javascript event it is jquery shorthand for the mouseenter and mouseleave events so it can t be used in the live method like that

8526616
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in ie using ie9 and not in firefox or google-chrome

8526616
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome handled the error but ie9 is much harder on bad programmers

8526632
int	chars
f2py is complaining about my variable declarations trying to change chars to int and appending

8526674
folder	directory
if you just want to move the physical directory where your domain is located to the primarydomain.com folder the rules below should work

8526678
junit	mockito
i need to do some junit mock preferably using mockito testing in my managed beans

8526689
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need to explicitly check for the mouseenter and mouseleave events using the event.type

8526800
int	chars
what s probably happening is that scanf treats the address of the int object i as if it were a pointer to a chars

8526800
int	chars
if you had called your chars variable c and your int variable i rather than vice versa it would have been easier to keep track of which is which

8526800
int	chars
but c is a reasonable name for an int variable used to hold input chars values -- not for scanf but for getchar as in

8526804
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
now what s weird is that the uiviewcontroller which houses the uiwebview is in a uitabbarcontroller and when i click on another tab the uiwebview finally gets its shouldstartloadwithrequest called

8526814

8526853
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the image creation works fine in google-chrome firefox and safari but using the images in three.js as a texture doesn t show up in firefox

8527101
textview	imageview
each item in the listview has sub items such as imageview and textview

8527202
textview	imageview
since you have only an imageview and a textview you can change your imageview to imagebutton

8527206
jar	war
project is compiled built using ant with various targets one target to generate classes from xsd another to generate client jar another to generate server war ear

8527206
jar	war
so my main question really is - how do i approach this project architecture using maven so that i only use single instance of any source file xsd java etc and i am able to conveniently generate classes from xsd build client jar and server war ear

8527222
int	double
arrays are always passed by reference in c so passing the address of an array of int to a function in main is like passing a double pointer

8527263
ienumerable	iqueryable
note that if you do this with linq to entities instead of linq to objects this might not work as well or you ll at least have to return iqueryable instead of ienumerable

8527265
submit	submission
when i press the submit button nothing happens no submission no error messages nothing at all the page gets stuck

8527305
post	get
i think i generally agree with your summary - it makes sense that postandasyncreply is slower than post so if the caller doesn t need to get a notification from the agent when the operation such as putting value into the queue completes it should definitely expose a way to do that using just post

8527315
settings.bundle	plist
im trying to open the url i saved in the iphone settings settings.bundle plist and it saves but now i m trying to open the url in safari with the url i saved in the key

8527347
getter	setter
you will need to create getter and setter for page

8527354
yacc	bison
you can simulate them with extra actions but unfortunately yacc and bison don t give you a way to do them more directly btyacc provides syntacic sugar to make this much easier.

8527354
yacc	bison
in yacc or bison this becomes something like

8527360
pop-up	dialog
i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window

8527360
pop-up	dialog
use firebug and track the html changes and you should see the pop-up being created just behind the dialog

8527366
ready	each
they are used to ensure each element has fully loaded and is ready for manipulation use

8527372
gdal	ogr
i would recommend looking at gdal ogr as a starting point

the problem is whenever the user drag the cell up so that it move out of view and then it falls back down again the text field resigns its first responder status because the cell is being reloaded

8527549
subtraction	addition
one way to translate bitshift and addition operations from javascript to java is to isolate the operands of a bit shift operation with int casts and isolate operands of an addition subtraction operation with long casts since java will cast an addition operation exceeding 2 bil to an int without them and javascript automatically casts longs in bitshifts to ints while java doesn t

8527559
post	get
you send it as a form field called access_token your data can be set by either get or post

8527566
terminate	timeout
when the query is killed if you ve set your while loop to check for a timeout response it can then terminate the loop and you ll have an array with all of the records returned in 5 minutes

8527573
for-loop	loops
instead of using a foreach loops in your second loops can you instead use a for-loop like so to iterate over all cells

8527598
children	parent
instead of using .closest you could use the parent function to find the owner then use the other tree traversal functions to find the children that match certain selectors

8527609
integer	unsigned
java s int type is 32-bit signed whereas javascript s operator returns a 32-bit unsigned integer value so the following

8527625
filtering	grouping
the only way i can get it to filtering by date of checkdate is to grouping by empchecks.checkdate and use having checkdate whatever

8527661
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout or setinterval instead of your while loop

8527678
src	attr
so i would set the attr data-src and at the end set it to the src

8527694
post	put
some of my backbone models should always use post instead of post for create and put for update

8527698

so what you should use instead is bitmap.createscaledbitmap srcbitmap width height false

8527754
profiling	benchmarking
you ll have to benchmarking profiling to find out but it s entirely possible that secret.exe just wastes time

8527763
versioning	upgrade
if you re able to upgrade to versioning 3 you ll find some other nice improvements as well

8527774
integer	unsigned
if you want to treat that as a number the safest is to chose an unsigned integer of fixed width most probably uint32_t

8527825
libc	newlib
when i run nm usr arm-elf lib thumb libc.a which i believe is the newlib version of libc it shows

8527872
mouseover	mouseout
you should move your buttons into a different hierarchy level than the graphics you are changing - even if the buttons disappear or are covered with graphics for just a very short moment both mouseover and mouseout events will be fired the mouse has left and reentered the button - and that probably causes your loop

8527879
width	height
mask width and height should be your mouseover region and give it alpha 0

8527899
post	get
uhm first of all i m seeing your form action is post instead of get so it s natural you don t appen the service input to the url.

8527941
pop-up	dialog
i don t really care what the ant script or eclipse fails for -- that s what logging is for -- but the dialog box that pop-up along with it is unacceptable because it hangs our continuous integration system while it waits for the invisible user to come click on it

8528109
accessor	properties
rather than sending -release to the object returned by the properties accessor method set the properties itself to nil

8528109
accessor	properties
synthesizing a properties declared with retain semantics is effectively equivalent to writing the following accessor methods

8528122
opera	google-chrome

8528156
post	get
i am using redis brukva pub sub mesaaging for realtime chat but i cant decide which mesaaging queue system should i use for private messaging part since its not realistic to send and process messages in a single post get request

8528170
maven	pom.xml
the idea is that users would be able to install the application using the pom.xml and a single maven command

8528183
lme4	nlme
some of the other answers are workable but i claim that the best answer is to use the accessor method that is designed for this -- varcorr this is the same as in lme4 s predecessor the nlme package

8528239
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i have a subclassing inherited from the superclass extends and also overrides the 2 superclass methods to add improved functionality that was lacking in the superclass.the subclassing has 1 instance variable that is a unique id

8528239
superclass	subclassing
i wanted to show the overriding of the equals and hashcode method for both the superclass and subclassing

8528239
superclass	subclassing
can i do equality checks in both superclass equals and subclassing equals methods or is is a bit pointless

8528239
superclass	subclassing
i did not want to use the default memory reference check but wanted to show equality or uniqueness using my 2 mutable int variables superclass and 1 unique id subclassing

8528239
superclass	subclassing
do i or can i still need to test for equality if i override superclass equals and subclassing equals knowing that the equality rules are broken

8528255
onresume	onpause
yes by using a combination of lifecycles see onpause and onresume methods and startactivityforresult and onactivityresult ..

8528289

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs	fat	hfs+
for a file itself it s easy but for a directory you can t as far as i know do it through java because it s dependent on the filesystems fat ntfs hfs+ ext4 etc.

8528352
post	get
now my plan is to write a service or a batch file that will get the wall post of the page for my company on facebook and store the results in the sql database

8528352
post	get
3 i was using the open graph api explorer and it only gives me some resultsets post and in the end the xml has a paging which you could use to navigate to more older posts.but what if i want to get certain wall post between some date time could this be done

8528361
jobs	cron
i want to know if it s possible to restrict the number of jobs launched each time the cron trigger fires

8528363

opera	firefox
graphic files have there own headers with caching information witch in your case tells opera it s ok to use cached files - you can check headers using for example firebug for firefox

8528440
pthreads	epoll
it is meant to replace the older pthreads select 2 and poll 2 system calls to achieve better performance in more demanding applications where the number of watched file descriptors is large unlike the older system calls which operate at o n epoll operates in o 1 2

8528463
for-loop	loops
my algorithm would be a for-loop that loops through each index of the abs fft to look for a peak

8528465
typhoeus	curb
i d recommend and typhoeus curb for starting points

8528479
super	extends
a sub extends super so sub.equals and sub.hashcode both delegate to super.equals and super.hashcode

8528495
loops	if-statement
just write it all out and you don t need any loops or if-statement

8528544
keydown	keyup
i tried using commands as well as attaching events to keyup to the window but commands intercept keys before the textbox gets a chance to view them keydown bubbles to the window level even if textbox used the key

8528552
hash	md5
this will internally take an md5 hash of the path add a potential prefix and also take the current locale language into account

8528584
decltype	auto
it s auto + decltype

8528588
for-loop	arrays
the first example a for-loop will iterate through the elements of an arrays and is the preferred method of looping through an arrays

8528610
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works just fine in google-chrome safari no errors in console but when i try to use it in firefox it doesn t

8528614
memcpy	memset
this applies to both memset and memcpy

8528614
memcpy	memset
misalignment in some cases when you re dealing with misaligned data on a processor that doesn t support misaligned accesses memset and memcpy may be the only clean solution

8528614
memcpy	memset
although memset and memcpy are usually compiler intrinsics with special handling by the compiler they are still generic functions

8528614
sse	avx
a common example is when using sse avx intrinsics

8528614
sse	avx
if you simply write a loop using sse avx aligned load store intrinsics you can probably do better

8528645
daemon	cron
if you re looking for something easy to just run a specific script when new files arrive the incron daemon provides a very handy combination of inotify 7 and cron 8 -like support for executing programs on demand

8528655
google-chrome	safari
when first loading the show page the listners are created at least i can trace them in google-chrome safari

8528659
int	chars
the problem is i m actually doing some compression so i generate int between 0 and 255 and i want to write the chars who s ascii value is equal to that int

8528685
stdout	stderr
if you are redirecting stdout or writing to any other handle like stderr it will not show up in its output

8528706
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

8528715
outputstream	inputstream
when you are processing byte-oriented data as distinct from character-oriented data you should be using inputstream and outputstream classes and not reader and writer classes

8528715
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
in this case you should use fileinputstream fileoutputstream and wrap with a bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream if you are doing byte-at-a-time reads and writes

8528734
outputstream	inputstream
byte i o is handled by subclasses of inputstream and outputstream while character i o is handled by subclasses of reader and writer

8528759
width	height
so if you define width and height of the canvas to 100 it will always show the map covering whole screen

8528804
hash	salt
if you are choosing a hashing system yourself rather than building an app using an existing database which already contains hash passwords then you should make sure your hashing algorithm also uses a salt

8528804
hash	salt
this automatically generates a salt and concatenates it with the hash value in a single string

8528823
hide	show
i m trying to add a button that show and hide a div at the bottom of my website

8528836
button	checkbox
i want to check all checkbox when click on the button

8528837

8528918
post	get
i am using ajax functions to get and post various forms via an api.php file

8528918
post	get
so how do i get it to redirect on a successful post without changing the api

8528939
bash	subshell
another solution is to define the function to run in a subshell but still within the same instance of bash and then cancel the set -f within that function by using set +f

8528979
superclass	subclassing
the pointer is declared to be of some superclass which is extended by several subclassing

8529000
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tried this in safari google-chrome and firefox and i ve cleared my history and cache

8529022
post	get
is there some kind of system in place now to limit the amount of clicks out you can get from a post

8529025
width	height
cgbitmapcontextcreate returns nil because the width and height parameters were set as floats not ints

8529029
memcpy	memset
as already answered the compiler often has hand optimized routines for memset memcpy and other string functions

8529029
memcpy	memset
now the amount of code number of instructions that a fast memcpy or memset from the compiler is usually much larger than the loop solution you suggested

8529029
memcpy	memset
if possible and it is with some processors and memory systems the memset or the write part of a memcpy can be single instructions with a whole cache line or whole ddr location and there is no read required instantly doubled speed

8529029
memcpy	memset
at a minimum the compiler memset and memcpy routines are going to perform a byte operation if the start address is odd then a 16 bit if not aligned on 32 bits

8529030
centos	linux
not sure about this behavior in other centos version or linux distros but in centos 6.1 etc udev rules.d 70-persistant-net.rules is automatically generated by the os and after a couple of reboots it will be regenerated based on the mac addresses in the ifcfg-eth files

8529192
post	get
one of the answers below has me on a better track i ll post some better code when i get it to work

8529193
createfile	getlasterror
i have written a class to handle named pipe connections and if i create an instance close it and then try to create another instance the call to createfile returns invalid_handle_value and getlasterror returns error_pipe_busy

8529211
getter	setter
so in summary the new technique creates a getter and setter for you property and allows you to also specify the name to be used for the instance variable used for encapsulation

8529233

jar	war
if coreproject also has web stuff in it stuff the belongs in a war not a jar then you could make it a war project and have the other two war projects incorporate it using war file overlaying

8529312
width	height
the #framecont div is like a container with a set width and height

8529325
overwrite	preserve
as you re using -p to preserve full-path info you ll really need to be careful not to overwrite your working system with old files

8529338
superclass	subclassing
so superclass reference variable can hold reference of subclassing object without cast but when you assign reference from the superclass reference variable to the subclassing reference variable you must have to cast

8529348
jboss	glassfish
jboss 6.1.0 final and glassfish 3.1

8529601
int	chars	int	double
they are not actual types in the c++ sense in that they are neither pod plain old data like int double chars etc. nor classes

8529609
put	get
like you said you could draw a curve and plot those points then put them into some equation solver to get an equation that could describe the curve you re looking for

8529636
stdout	stderr
subprocess.call also accept stdin stdout stderr redirections

8529657
getter	setter
remember properties are basically just shorthand for the underlying setter and getter methods so you can also conform by having the appropriate setter and getters.

8529659
width	height
more generally top left should be at w-w 2 h-h 2 where w and h are the width and height of the canvas and w and h are the width and height of the image to be drawn

8529709
decimal	ieee
the size of a float is platform-dependent although a maximum of 1.8e308 with a precision of roughly 14 decimal digits is a common value the 64 bit ieee format

8529713
udp	rtp
and there is no other broadcast form of traffic than sending rtp udp packets over two different ip addresses

8529722
int	double
the totalseconds property is a floating point value - perhaps it s a rounding problem in the double to int conversion

8529776
post	get
you may want to look into the post redirect get design pattern where a post is only used for sending data to the db or to the server for processing and all data displayed comes from a get that the post calls

8529846
google-chrome	firefox
just tested something that works perfect on firefox and google-chrome doesn t makes anyhing with font-weight bold bolder property

if you don t like swing you may try swt

8530123
many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-one	one-to-many
consequently the direct many-to-many association disappears and is replaced by one-to-many many-to-one associations between the 3 participating classes

8530127
min	max
of course if you wanted to avoid having to code on every case you could define your own isinrange num min max type function to return a boolean and then say

8530144
decoder	encoder
i used google protocol buffers as encoder decoder over http s

8530147
super	abstract
while there are others which refer to attributes of the class in which case i think it makes more sense to make it as an abstract super class

getter	setter
your struct needs to have getter and setter

8531754
getter	setter
you will also need to write corresponding setter and getter methods

8531765
width	height
the height will allow the height and width declaration it will draw like a box 102px by 102px still

then you need to issue two queries one to find the minimum and maximum latitude the other to find min and max longitude

8532611
getter	setter
additionally you should provide getter setter there so that you can change user password at runtime if one testcase needs different values

8532614

if you have no android configchanges in manifest and you have different sets of layout for landscape and portrait then when you change orientation your control will come to oncreate inside that method you can write your logic

8533359
width	height
try to add a div or span tag and mention the width and height in it

8533451
google-chrome	firefox
my big problem is that i don t think this can be done in ie as easy as it would be done in firefox or google-chrome

it s worth adding that properties set at project level are not automatically inherited from the different configurations targets of your project in order to inherited properties that are set at project level you need to set the value in the fields where you actually want to inherited such properties

8533673

textview	imageview
i have a relative layout that has an imageview and and a textview aligned to right of the imageview

8533806
textview	imageview
initially textview s visiblity is set to gone hence the size of the view is just that of the imageview

8533806
textview	imageview
now when the view receives focus i set the visibility of textview to visible and set an animation to incrementally resize the view from imageview s width to approximately imageview+textview width i am actually giving hard coded value in the program

8533806
textview	imageview
hence for my solution i kept the parent layout relative layout set to fill_parent for the width had another child layout background whose size i could control through program and then on top of this i have my imageview parent left aligned + textview right of imageview fill_parent

8533806
textview	imageview
so when the view is created for the first time parent layout is always fill_parent background layout has size of the imageview only and set textview s visiblity to invisible

8533890
mouse	keyboard
i saw this article in code project writing a macro recorder player using win32 journal hooks that does hooking to mouse and keyboard how does one do that in .net

maven	pom.xml
the project structure in svn each one is a maven project with pom.xml in the project root

8533953

8534034
post	get
when using the get form post method nothing is printed out

8534039
puts	gets
after lot of testing however i ve come into some light about the problem it seems that when you pass the enddate to the script it transform it to string to later again transform it to a date object when doing this the script seems to ignore the hour and it simple puts 00 00 00 00 but when checking the max selectable date it gets 12 00 00 00 since the date i m givin is greater than today it becomes not selectable

8534048

to handle both post and get with your code you can just remove the .form replace with

8534148
for-loop	arrays
same applies to your mutable arrays but i suppose you are releasing it after the for-loop somewhere since it seems you posted code after omitting some of it

8534222

changes include a an additional cross-browser function to get the window inner width and height from and b changes to the movehandler method inside the zdrag method to check and enforce limits

8534369
copying	overwrite
turns out i was soft copying part of my custom object while hard copying the rest which lead me to believe the arraylist was being overwrite

8534382
portrait	landscape
use this code to restrict your application in same orientation until the application finished use this code once createinstance called then use appropriate layout in corresponding resource folder for portrait res layout and for landscape use res layout-land.

8534450
getter	setter
now i want to prepare a readonly class a which make sure that class newa will have only the getter of classa and not the setter

i assume so that button presses result in post requests which is more semantic than a get and to prevent very long urls with the viewdata in the querystring

8534454
mdpi	hdpi
also a doubt here is that is it ok if i create hdpi ldpi and mdpi drawable folder or i need to create xhdpi also

8534476
puts	fflush	fputs	fflush
this way every printf and fputs putc puts etc... would have an implicit fflush

8534493
redhat	fedora
the server admin copy the script run.sh to etc init.d but we saw that there s another script named jboss_init_redhat.sh that i think is optimized for redhat fedora systems so we used this script to copy to etc init.d and it works

8534730
spaces	delimiter
from what you are saying you want to do there are other ways to split the string keeping the delimiter and then if you only want to remove leading or trailing spaces from your string then i wouuld suggest that you use .trim method convertsource.trim

width	height
how could i modify height and width in my sample they are 20 and 20 of ellipse from thumb

8535104
pop-up	dialog
so if you haven t already gotten permission to use the user s location and you can t really justify throwing a pop-up dialog in the user s face or they already rejected that pop-up and you need a fallback then this is probably the api you want to use

8535119
width	height
alternately change the width and height properties to read from a resource or binding and then modify that

8535140
pop-up	dialog
i would like to read the text of a dialog box pop-up window and then compare the text of that window to some value

with gmap api v3 i am using the directions service to generate a route for the user but once the route is rendered on the map the target infowindow i placed becomes cropped as the map is centered on the route not the target

8535185
ienumerable	iqueryable
but this doesn t work because the type can t be inferred correctly because iqueryable inherits from ienumerable i guess

8535185
ienumerable	iqueryable
in the previous case iqueryable was used if it suited or else ienumerable

8535205
post	get
how do i get the translated sourcetext value from the google sample rest from javascript into the formfield so i can post the value to another destination

8535245
ienumerable	iqueryable
also iqueryable inherits from ienumerable so first you can pass an iqueryable to this method and second the result is actually an ienumerable as well as an iqueryable

8535299
tunnel	vpn
you may find that using windows azure connect -- which in essence creates a secure vpn connection from your pc to the azure instances -- allows you to access the azure host directly tunnel across your corporate firewall

8535542
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works in all other browsers i ve tested firefox opera google-chrome chromium

8535554
comparator	comparable
treeset has a constructor that takes a comparator meaning even if the objects you store aren t comparable objects by themselves you can provide a custom comparator

8535623
superclass	subclassing
the only way to do what you are talking about is to subclassing the object and write a new hashcode and equals and this would only really make sense to do if the subclassing had a defining variable that should be added in addition to the superclass hashcode and equals

8535626
folder	directory
having read that there are several issues with the drawable folder i copied it verbatim into the directory

8535627

opensuse	mint	opensuse	linux	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse
what is an alternative to opensuse etc config.sys on linux mint or ubuntu

8535649
getter	setter
if you want a generic solution to the problem you would have to extract getter and setter into an interface and then use a proxy to either intercept all methods starting with set or have them annotated and process annotations in your handler and then either do nothing or preferrably throw an unsupportedoperationexception

8535662
int	chars
my question is how do i iterate through two arguments in the tuple in order to save the int to a list maybe and then get the chars from the string

8535671
google-chrome	safari
if the user right-clicks and selects download linked file as or its equivalent the file is presented with a .pdf.png extension in google-chrome and safari

8535671
google-chrome	firefox
i want firefox and google-chrome to know that it is a pdf

8535673
google-chrome	safari
so it s doing a sync xhr in google-chrome safari and an async one in everything else by default because it passes options.sync as the value for the async argument to xmlhttprequest.open which is backwards but whatever

8535673
google-chrome	firefox
and since you don t specify whether you want sync or async you get sync in google-chrome and async in firefox

8535695
g++	gcc
in reality scons simply directs to the gcc g++ compilers in the sdk build directories

8535696

comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator

8535746
equals	compareto
compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals

8535775
getter	setter
with hibernate you can have private setter or have hibernate only operate on the fields and ignore the getter setter completely

8535775
getter	setter
with field-access hibernate doesn t need there to be any getter or setter for a property but it also goes around any logic you may have had to do other things like set transient non-persisted properties on your objects

8535784
int	boolean
row then you can use jtable # changeselection int rowindex int columnindex boolean toggle boolean extend for example

8535825
jboss	glassfish
that are for example at least tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 websphere as 8 jetty 8 etc

8535826
submit	submission
in your form to stop the form submission you just added a .click fn to the submit button

8535863

8535874
uitapgesturerecognizer	uicontrol
if you decide not to use a button or not to use the uicontrol methods you can attach a uitapgesturerecognizer to the same view with a different target action

8535880
for-loop	loops
in this case where foo and baa are only used within the for-loop it s best practice to declare them inside loops

8535882
google-chrome	safari	hash	md5
the sha1 and md5 hash obtained this way match the fingerprints displayed by safari and google-chrome for an untrusted certificate

8535890

i need set a s columns showing on the graph by default but i need a filtering or action that will allow the user to switch the grouping without having to select the companies individually such as a single-select radio-button style filtering with the following

8535959
filtering	grouping
currently i have an exclude single-select filtering on which will exclude the selected grouping

8535959
toolbar	tabs
toolbar no tabs no

8536053
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so i have a uitabbarcontroller with an uinavigationcontroller in it

8536068
websocket	pusher
hosted websocket services such as pusher - who i work for

8536090
pull	push
create a git repository populate it with a pull from the svn repository via git-svn and push that to github

8536094
post	get
following on from this post where do i get an access token from to post to my facebook page using fbgraph gem in rails 3

8536190
maven	pom.xml
it seems you have changed something maven does not find the parent pom.xml referenced by relativepath attribute

8536221
put	get
when you get to session type information i would want to carefully analyze those requirements and put the relevant pieces in the message schema itself

8536226
put	get
put this in a subquery and we can get the maximum

8536232
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox safari google-chrome internet explorer 6 7 8 9 opera 11

8536257
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the layout does not display correctly in google-chrome 16.0 or safari 5.1.1 but does display correctly in firefox 8

8536261
switching	screens
to start simple a switching case in the ondraw checks the screens and then calls the right thing to draw

8536287
google-chrome	safari
safari just connects google-chrome however prompts for the user pass

8536315
min	max
if bin_range is not given then use min of all data max of all data as the bin_range

8536315
min	max
that means that the bins are ultimately determined in your first example of two sets of input data by calling numpy s histogram with bins 10 and bin_range min of all data max of all data on the first set of data

8536330
gridview	objectdatasource
when i connect a gridview to the objectdatasource it wants to count the rows in the eventlog

8536350
firefox	safari
however when i uploaded the website to adobe browserlab and when i looked at safari and firefox on a os x the footer is a bit off from safari and firefox on a windows operating system

8536350
firefox	safari
is there a way to target only safari and firefox on os x and not touching those on a windows

8536383
google-chrome	firefox
you can target browsers specifically normally firefox google-chrome etc work roughly the same and ie may work slightly differently

8536393
keydown	keyup
you have to keep track of keydown keyup events and keep a list of all the keys that are currently down

8536396
webkit	gecko
especially gecko and webkit rendering engines behave almost exactly the same on each platform bugs should be easy to squash

8536416
for-loop	loops
how do i use a for-loop to loops through every single form in the arraylist to check if the forms are disposed through the isdisposed property

8536478
firefox	safari
it works on internet explorer to some extent but fails when i call try to run it on safari or firefox

8536535
firefox	safari
you can find out yourself by using a javascript debugger such as firebug for firefox or the built-in web inspector for safari

8536544
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
if you want to specify a grammar and have ocaml generate lexers and parsers for you check out these ocamllex and ocamlyacc tutorials

8536553
cos	sin
if your space is not euclidean then the transformation you want may not actually be affine or if it is affine the matrix for the rotation might not be as simple as what i wrote above with sin and cos

8536565
width	height
be prepared to keep track of a lot of x y positions and the width and height of each object

8536576
width	height
the solution was as commented before to display the swf files in a separate php page in which you set the the height width of the swf via swfobject and then using the iframe source setting of fancybox

8536579
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is specific to internet explorer at least in version 6 as other major browsers firefox and google-chrome do not present this behavior

8536583
for-loop	loops
dude the best way from performance point of view is to iterate using for-loop and the first time you encounter the desired value update it and use the break to terminate loops

8536589
gif	png
according to the msdn documentation by default the fileextensionsattribute .net 4.5 should allow me to only upload only jpg jpeg gif and png files - which is what i want

8536597
opera	google-chrome
in ie7 8 9 google-chrome opera - all as expected pop-up open form don t

8536597
opera	google-chrome
ie7 8 9 google-chrome opera - hit bp on line 1 then bp on line 2

8536597
jquery	jqmodal
jqmshow - command from jqmodal this is a plugin for jquery

8536613
division	multiplication
this could be more efficient than the division because e.g the two multiplication can be pipelined in paralle

8536635
folder	directory
the value r sort of did the trick but then the application couldn t find its template files even if i moved them out of the polls directory and into the root of the templates folder

8536638
n-gram	words
as your data is machine generated use also words bigrams and tigrams even higher order n-gram

8536662
installation	upgrade
we have developed a somewhat diffuse system for handling component installation and upgrade across server environments in an automated manner

8536669
versioning	upgrade
your web.xml which is syntactically invalid by the way specifies the old servlet 2.4 versioning which was upgrade over 5 years ago already

8536694
sproutcore	cappuccino
because it is the most popular client-side framework relative to others sproutcore amber.js spine knockout.js cappuccino etc. there is plenty of documentation

8536703
width	height
both width and height must be sufficiently large

8536714

post	get
precision i really want to set these properties within the post treatment not in a get

8536819
post	get
post username and password and get set-cookie

8536819
post	get
use to post username and password and get set-cookie

8536842
post	get
i can achieve that by using js and get method but my goal now is to use js probably with submit and post method

8536890
children	parent
however i need some help with my css because it applies the arrows to all child elements if the parent has children

8536931
width	height
so the only mode that will change the stage width height values is noscale

8536988
children	parent
each parent has an id each child object has a property parentid that identifies a unique parent like child.parentid parent.id each parent object has property children

8536988
children	parent
this methd attaches to each parent children property the children that matches on parent.id child.parentid

8536988
children	parent
i actually do not have objects with the property names parent children rather i have all kinds of properties that manifest the child parent relationship

8536997
zoo	xts	zoo	chron	xts	chron
note that r has lots of date formats so it s worth checking to see whether you are currently using posixct or date or chron or zoo or xts or one of the other formats

8537018
superclass	subclassing
making an override method in subclassing less accessible than it was in superclass would violate the contract of the superclass .

8537033
width	height
mode resizebyminsize croptosize cropposition topleft width 64 height 64esizebyminsize croptosize cropposition topleft width 64 height 64

8537035
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
alternatively if possible it would be much simpler to educate the users to have 2 or 3 different browsers for instance firefox opera google-chrome safari to mention the good ones

8537039
multibyte	substr
substr instead is multibyte save and doesn t count the bytes but the chars

8537046
int	double
i have a table including the columns int id pkey int group double sortorder where sortorder implements a user-specified sort order within one group

8537070
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer

8537075
put	get
then if you want the background to show through in the gutter put a border-right on the main-content area so that you get a sort of artificial gutter

8537079
width	height
copy from sx sy width sw and height sh to destination image dx dy

8537123
textview	imageview
my xml has several nested linearlayout s textview s and imageview s

8537129
for-loop	arrays
it would like to use a for-loop that would make it easier since i would like it to output all arrays until max is reached automatically

8537137
put	get
i guess what would be really good would be to build a database put some data in it and then get a tool that can create an in memory representation of it

8537138
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
inspect the generated dom tree instead with firebug firefox or the developer tools google-chrome safari

8537139
apache	nginx
you really should do it with nginx or apache conf if it s for all items in subdomain

8537150
ant	maven
if not maven or ant you can just run through the browser

8537150
junit	cactus
but unfortunately you might have to stick to cargo cactus based testing with junit 3

8537153
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
for example you have operator class which has add subtract multiplying divide static methods in it

8537156
draggable	droppable
using jquery ui draggable droppable i drag the items from the first column pick into the second one drop

8537158
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
depending on the browser i like google-chrome firefox safari for this you want to look at developer tools

8537158
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox you can use firebug in google-chrome it s developer tools and in safari you have to turn on developer menu through preferences

8537182
pull	push
anyway i have some code that was working yesterday but after i did a pull push with git something went a bit wrong with my validation

8537187
lisp	scheme
enforced in contrast to languages such as common lisp scheme or

8537201
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
how can i do this in a way so that i can easily uninstall mercurial again and upgrade it when new versioning are released

8537260
post	get
in general it would be a good idea to post an explain plan with your query to get a better answer

8537312
folder	directory
i then was told to go to localhost where i should have a directory view of the htpdocs folder

8537349
versioning	upgrade
futureproof this so i can always add columns checking in iteration as i upgrade different versioning of the software

8537371
rss	feed
is there any way of getting the rss feed of a linkedin group like this to show on a webpage

8537400
put	get
edit my question is can i say get that value of the image and put it in a database value later to retrieve it

8537403
bids	ssis
i am using ssis in bids 2008 and i am trying to get a count of an object variable containing a list of files

8537450
vlookup	sumifs
my excel knowledge doesn t get far past sumifs vlookup and pivottables

8537456
gridview	onclientclick
the program itself is using c# microsoft visual studio 2010 ajax sql server from godaddy -- stored procedures that are linked to sql datasources the tickets are stored in a gridview and onclientclick will display the ticket info the error message pops up when the ticket is associated with more than one productid

8537456
post	get
i will be active on this page so i will get back to questions fast and post things that are needed

8537492
portrait	landscape
i want to be able to detect and get notification when the user is rotate to landscape or portrait mode

8537498
ssl	https
i am only using ssl https as well on wls found under your server general configuration page specifically ssl listen port enabled

8537513
unix	bsd
i m not an expert of berkeley system distribution bsd unix filesystems so i can t really promise that it would work on any mac but this approach works on mine

8537525
kobold2d	cocos2d-iphone
kobold2d uses the latest stable versions of cocos2d-iphone 1.x and 2.x

8537534
pull	push
this way user x and i can push our local changes to our own public repos and then pull changes from each other s public repos

8537537
width	height
in order to override the attributes of the layout you re including you must also override both the layout width and layout height

8537542
apache	nginx
defaults to true but in the production environment is turned off as the server software nginx or apache used to run the application should serve static assets instead

8537567
ssl	ntlm	kerberos	ntlm
in terms of the client to the database there are several authentication models user pass ntlm kerberos and i think some more and you can use ssl and ipsec on the connection between the webserver and the database server

8537572
google-chrome	firefox
but on the test server it is working fine in google-chrome firefox etc

8537590
rss	feed
i would set up rss feed for each item you wanted to let people use

8537590
rss	feed
not sure what sort of system you re running but wordpress allows you to make custom rss feed based on almost anything you want

8537649
rss	feed
if your news articles are stored in a database table then you can easily extract them using php and populate an rss feed with them

8537682
accessor	properties
that s a safe habit to get into when working with properties to ensure you don t run into memory leaks because when you are dealing with pointers the accessor generated will release and retain for you

8537711
cells	tablecell
if i pass a center param into tablecell template i would want to create a table cells that has it s text centered and of course left would get it s contents left justified

8537716
min	max
parallelising at a min max node would be wasteful because you already have better choice so continuing down the path of lesser value is less likely to yield the best result

8537723
pull	push
assume that right now we have only one master branch and whenever we want to push anything to staging or production we have to git pull making all changes live even the unwanted ones

8537747
atof	strtod
atof could crash on this so use strtod instead

8537797
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql sqlite or even leveldb if you want simple key value store

8537813
rss	feed
there is no rss feed for linkedin groups as they all require the viewer to be a linkedin member to join at a minimum

8537813
post	get
you could use the groups api and the recommended php wrapper simple-linkedin to get the recent post from a given group but the catch as with all linkedin api integrations is thta the viewer must be authenticated against the api

8537871
org.json	gson
i d say use crest and ignore all these red-eye nerds who say that you should reinvent your own bicycle by using httpclient and gson org.json

8537872
inherited	properties
so thinking back on your original issue if there for some reason is some inherited of the z-index going on which can be checked in the chrome dev tools it might just be easier to explicitly set the z-index of each radmenu or the containing element as this will guarantee the desired behavior regardless of inherited since properties set on item itself with higher specificity should prevail

8537873
oncreate	onstart
that s because all service s lifecycle callback functions like oncreate and onstart are called from main ui thread

8537918
post	put
i have also retrieved all images from post and put them in a zip

8537933
stdout	fflush
maybe your stdout is not fflush immediately because it is not attached to a terminal

8537941
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
just test the code maybe you need to set the navigationcontroller as property if you need do sth like pushviewcontroller animated

8537975
integer	unsigned
i specifically want an integer or unsigned integer for this

8537994
mouse	keyboard
my goal is to make a program that will run transparently in the background minimized or in the quicklaunch area and have that program artificially implant keyboard and mouse input for a third party full screen application

8538006
hash	md5
using hashing algorithms like md5 we suffer from a limited entropy which means that very long passwords might result in hash that can be regenerated by a shorter password

8538044
portrait	landscape
i basically want to proportionally resize them so that for example a column which takes up 1 3 of the grid width in portrait orientation will still take up 1 3 of the width when switched to landscape

8538044
portrait	landscape
i basically just hard code the ipad and iphone landscape to portrait ratio

8538111
ssl	https
this is provided that your api is over ssl https

8538117
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested with firefox 8 google-chrome 16 and safari 5 on os x lion

8538124
children	parent
the advantage of a many-to-many table is that it can be indexed so that retrieval of both all children of a parent or all parent of a child can be rapid

8538124
children	parent
putting the data in a single string means you can only find quickly all children of a parent

8538136
hash	whirlpool
if you need more bits use a hash with a bigger internal state sha-512 whirlpool etc...

8538166
button	checkbox
when in edit mode the user also has the ability to click another edit button to enable a set of checkbox and then click update

8538174
client-side	server-side
others suggestions of standardizing on utf-8 is good practice but if you didn t want to just make sure you are using an encoding schema that works with your chars and is used both client-side and server-side

8538186
google-chrome	firefox
i was having the same issue in firefox and google-chrome

8538186
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox google-chrome and safari

8538212
post	get
i want the same navigation for my single post view but i can t get it to work i made the changes for php functions but in codex i only found a vay to display post from the same category

8538270
hide	show
i tried to implement that using jquery hide and show

8538302
pull	push
whenever a change has to go live you simply merge the feature into the staging branch and push it to the server - the staging env then pull that branch and deploys

8538309
maven	pom.xml
you can publish a maven artifact which users of your framework can then use without having to include the dependencies yourself--your pom.xml is enough

8538319
post	get
if i perform a post without the headers i m getting the expected error but when i add the headers i get a 404 error instead of what i actually need

8538334
javap	package-private
really javap reports that innerprotected is compiled as public whereas other member classes are package-private

8538345
pthreads	fork
if you want to execute an executable file directly and you are on pthreads you can also look at the -family of functions in conjuction with fork since exec replaces the current process

8538356
portrait	landscape
but anyway if anyone s interested to know what i did was create a landscape app and compose the ui so it appeared portrait user input was a drag but overall it worked

8538407
stdout	stderr
exec d processes inherit most open file descriptors including stdin stdout and stderr so you can hook input and output up to whatever you like...plus there are fewer security implications

8538409
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the bannerslider works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari but in ie i get a blank slide after each good slide

8538412
vbscript	vb6
well com activex classic asp and vb6 vbscript is now much less used than it was so it can be said to have been replaced by .net

8538412
vbscript	vb6
as well as vb6 vbscript a considerable number who were writing in c++ and java with windows as a sole or primary target platform are now at least partly using .net instead

8538430
portrait	landscape
if the device is in landscape orientation it works fine but if the device is physically held in portrait orientation it does not display the way i would like

8538430
portrait	landscape
the device is physically held in portrait orientation but i want to display the view as if it was held in landscape

8538430
portrait	landscape
i want to always display the modal view in a landscape orientation even when the device is held in portrait

8538462
width	height
not sure if this is exactly what you re looking for but you could define the layout_ width and height as wrap_content in the xml measure it in your constructor or oncreate and then resize the layout to your desired size

8538468
rss	feed
i m working on an rss reader so i am pulling in html from rss feed

8538468
google-chrome	firefox
if you shrink the output frame it doesn t break in google-chrome but in firefox the images will break out of the box instead of resizing

8538491
free	malloc
malloc not counting the virtual memory via the mmu is the other way around allocating a number of linear chunks of those fractions to meed the alloc need and having an alloc free scheme that attempts to keep as many large chunks available just in case a bad malloc system is one where you have half of your memory free but the maximum malloc that works without an out of memory error is a malloc of a small fraction of that memory say you have a gig free and can only allocate 4096 bytes

8538539
post	get
there is more on this at android 4.0 turns get into post

8538544
hash	md5
i have a production problem where two md5 hash don t match between a server version of an excel 2003 binary file generated by syncfusion .net library and a local one

8538544
hash	md5
when i upload a local excel file that was only opened by double clicking via windows explorer the server finds that md5 hash are not the same and won t let file upload

8538544
hash	md5
the affected bytes are at offset 0000046c 2 bytes and at 0000046e 4 bytes that change upon every opening of the file which obviously changes md5 hash

8538556
hash	md5
you re better off using the indy md5 hash class

8538556
hash	md5
it s too bad the version of indy that comes with xe doesn t include encryption because their md5 hash class is flawless and easy to use

8538566
folder	directory
inside your flash cs5 install directory there should be a folder called air2.6

8538566
put	get
the other thing you ll want to do is to put an updated airglobal.swc in your install folders so that you get air3.1 code hinting

8538631
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
on object a3 you can only call methods that are avaible on object equals gethashcode tostring gettype

8538635
uiview	subviews
it is a subclass of uiview that has a staging area that has a bunch of subviews placed in a grid-like manner

8538646
m2e	pom.xml
itâ s just m2e trying to be clever because the version element like group id sometimes can be redundant and be can be inherited from the parent pom.xml so it would be safe to remove this element from your child pom.xml

8538683
hide	show
i can hide the main div and show it at the end of but as it happens depending on the page i have more than one javascript page loaded for each html page and each of these javascript pages has a document .ready function

8538689
google-chrome	firefox
it is not working in firefox an google-chrome

8538695
hive	hdfs
have started looking at hive hdfs as an option

8538732
fadein	fadeout
building on simplifying what publicjorn wrote here s a way to add fadein fadeout effect on sliding

8538766
hash	salt
simply setting the security realms digest algorithm to none and then hashing the password before passing it the login method wouldn t work because i don t have the generated salt jbcrypt originally used when creating the hash

8538794
for-loop	loops
don t use foreach as the message says convert loops to a regular for-loop

8538796
min	max
the contents of the min and max calls is what is called a generator and is responsible for generating a mapping of the original data to the filtered data

8538806
for-loop	loops
in pl sql a cursor for-loop implicitly declares loops variable to be a record type matching a row of the cursor

8538810
button	checkbox
so i created a small app in c#.net where i open this website and fill in all the controls radio button text boxes checkbox etc with the values from my database

8538849
serializable	deserialization
this would prevent you from having mismatched serializable and deserialization implementations since you d have only one copy of each and be using it on both platforms

8538850
post	get
there re some usful method to make get and post requests

8538917
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
except the browser s whether firefox google-chrome or safari memory usage increases with each image and never goes down

8538917
google-chrome	firefox
after that i have no more memory problems with firefox and google-chrome

8538917
google-chrome	firefox
i got this all working and google-chrome and firefox display the images correctly

8538924
dictionary	map
of the word search each permutation in a dictionary a prefix tree map with o m if it is in the dictionary put o 1 it into the hash table so that all permutated words are put into the list with the same key

8538934
udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
android media player only supports video playback from file or rtsp but i need to stream rtp video the comes from udp network socket so i am thinking to use ffmpeg but i do not have have any knowledge how to use ffmpeg api and i do not know if it is an easy task or not i know ffmpeg is written in c and i know how to compile it and how to use ndk but i need more information how to use ffmpeg to stream from socket any one knows good tutorial example code or open source project do the same job how should i start

8538966
post	get
the jquery function takes a type parameter in the options which sets whether the request should be done via post or get

8538966
post	get
on the other hand if you set it to post which is probably what you want you can get to it via

8538998
tablet	galaxy
some tablet show up as a mobile device galaxy tab and some don t ipad playbook

8539040
int	boolean
the exception can be a string int boolean or an object

8539055
bash	subshell
but let s say you know you re in bash but perl is run from a subshell

8539066
folder	directory
i d suggest looking into using an apache alias instead to create a virtual apache folder that maps to your development directory

8539104
addition	multiplication
the code below do the addition not multiplication

8539128
comparator	comparable
if the colum types are not comparable i would implement separate comparator and make the column class a factory for the correct comparator that should be used

8539139
setinterval	settimeout
please don t pass strings to settimeout and setinterval

8539142
zoo	xts
you probably have an xts or zoo object and need to use the write.zoo function

8539142
zoo	xts
if i m right about the structure of the esh2 object then the data that you are calling the first column is actually the rownames which in zoo xts parlance is the index while the data can be accessed with coredata and is a matrix object

8539161
submit	submission
i have a form that submit using post and i want to covert it to an ajax submission of the form

google-chrome	firefox
if forced to pick a required browser i d prefer firefox or google-chrome

8539492
pull	push
since you already have a sql server session you will be making sp calls to pull push the data already and adding a small object to that should have minimal perf issues compared to other options like persisting it down to the client and sending it back on every request

clang	llvm
on the other hand clang is a collection of libraries for dealing with the c language family that notably contains a compiler clang which acts as a front-end for c c++ objective-c and objective-c++ on top of the llvm libraries

8547074
clang	llvm	llvm	clang++
so in your case you will want to use clang and clang++ to compile c and c++ respectively and don t worry about the fact that llvm is used behind the scenes to optimize your code and deal with generation of machine instructions adapted to your architecture

8547084
g++	gcc
i d recommend to just use clang and clang++ directly which can be used as drop-in replacements for gcc and g++

the solution needs to be universal for most databases mysql h2 postgresql oracle db2 mssql hsql derby

8547882
primefaces	richfaces
almost all other jsf component libraries also offer similar functionality primefaces and richfaces

8547903
cpu	hyperthreading
with a query that doesn t end up blocking on resources on a 4-core machine you theoretically get a 4-times speed up 4 hyper-threaded might give you more or even less but probably not 8-times since hyperthreading s doubling of some parts of the cpu doesn t give a clear two-times increase

8547903
affinity	processors
with the same query on a single-core or with processors affinity meaning only one core is available a webserver in web-garden mode then there s no speed-up

8547905
zipalign	jarsigner
i developed a android app and could sign it with the eclipse plugin but i wanted to sign it manually with jarsigner and zipalign so that i can choose the algorithm and the keysize by my self

8547910
adium	ichat
i setup an ejabberd server on my macbook successfully and tested it with ichat and adium

8547975
width	height
as a sanity check you could check the height and width of vector_header something like

8547975
width	height
i might have that backwards in terms of height and width

8548017
pull	push
okay so this is what my process might look like this i ve excluded pull push merge-theirs steps

8548027
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

width	height
i need to generate new dimensions for an image to match a ratio of a given width and height ...but without increasing the size of the original

8548265
icmp	udp
besides that ping doesn t use udp but icmp so the results mean nothing

8548265
udp	mtu	vlan	packets
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500

8548282
width	height
try this let s say your image is and the desired aspect ratio of width to height is r

8548282
width	height
using the width and the aspect ratio calculate the target height

width	height
using the height and the aspect ratio calculate the target width

8548331
salt	md5
instead of trying to validate a user s account on a domain that my pc was not connected to i ended up caching my domain credentials in the database and just built a salt md5 type encrypt function so it would make it hard

8548434
pull	push
when feature is finished you have to push to parent | pull from clone in order to return changes back

8548454
sorting	grouping
in my experience hashing is always faster than sorting for joining and for grouping

8548466
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
you can use the stock uinavigationcontroller and hide the uinavigationbar

i m dynamically creating divs in my application and wants through parameters in a function to choose the width and height of the divs

8548499
width	height
note the height and width is retrieved from a json-file through ajax and can differ

8548516
width	height
you would need to define the height and width in a css file and add the appropriate class to your new element

how to pull push changes from the remote svn repo

8548585
google-chrome	firefox
i m fine if it works in the latest firefox google-chrome safari.

8548674
width	height
the only other way i can see this happening is by returning in your json result a style element with some auto-generated class containing the new width and height

8548684
put	get
i browsed through the regex library but if i put inside my script i get a syntax error.

8548716

i suggest you put the calculation into a function of it s own with parameters so you don t get irritated so much by the rest of the code you have in that batch

8548828
fadein	fadeout
i am using the jquery fadein and fadeout to display my contact form avoiding my visitors to access temporarily the main page

8548828

fadein	fadeout
the good news is when the contact form disappears fadeout the main page fadein

8548828
opera	google-chrome
or differently said i have tried observing the css attributes for possible positions movements with firebug google-chrome inspector and opera inspector but no luck i just don t get it

i have a site that is working perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 8 haven t tried 7 yet some of the .on delegates aren t working

8548840
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine in google-chrome and firefox

8548861
strtol	getline
you need to first read whatever the user enters â i recommend using std getline â and then try to parse that with strtol sscanf or std istringstream

8548872

run the program under gdb set breakpoints on dlopen dlmopen dlsym and dlvsym and observe that one of them is called after your call to dlopen above and before your call to dlerror

8548900
postgresql	mysql
leap will also allow you to switch between database dialects since the module has drivers for db2 firebird mariadb ms sql mysql oracle postgresql and sqlite

8548906
identifier	ambiguous
in ie the usage of foo.prototype is ambiguous because nfe identifier are leaked to the containing scope

8548914
for-loop	loops
if i change the initializer in the for-loop to int e... then the code inside loops doesn t work because it calls the other and wt methods on the e object

8548942

bitmap string filename int width int height or even bitmap image size but it s not supported on mobile framework

8548950
qtcore	qtgui
2 pyinstaller does not support import pyqt4.qtcore pyqt4.qtgui and from pyqt4 import qtcore qtgui is the only supported way according to here

8549009
inherited	subclassing
i have made taglistview inherited from homepageview so that it includes the same context data - if that s not important you could subclassing archiveindexview instead

i originally implements a system similar to codeigniter s whereby my main controller class is basically a super object and loads all the classes into class variables which are then accessed by extends the controller and doing like

8549046
post	put
just put it into a console application which will generate a message definition list file to be read by your application and set it up as a post build activity in your project

8549049
width	height
in the end i looped through the images doing getimagesize until both height and width were over a certain size and then broke the loop

8549108
comparator	icomparer
you need to implement comparator instead of icomparer

8549108
comparator	icomparer
icomparer would be implemented by the class performing the sorting such as a list class while comparator would be implemented by the class being sorted

8549150
innodb	myisam
experiment with a few different engines such as myisam and innodb

8549165
hash	md5
if you re doing a lot of these queries consider saving the md5 hash in a column or index

8549182
ubuntu	debian
if you are using ubuntu or debian this will make junit and some other libs always available for ant

8549221
hash	md5
it s also inefficient to use an md5 hash digest as a primary key

8549229
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
note this problem only happens on internet explorer i have tested on google-chrome firefox opera and safari

8549239
ant	maven
it can be a little intimidating at first to figure out how it works which is quite a different approach from ant or maven but it s worth getting your head around if you ll be using it

8549240
disk	ram
when the second loop starts c1 and d1 would then be loaded from disk into ram and operated on

8549240
put	get
assuming a fairly dumb caching policy of if the byte is not in the cache put it there and get the following byte too while we are at it you will get a scenario something like this

8549254
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome ie don t have problem but firefox render it like this

8549258
multiplying	add
when i play them together should i add them together and multiplying the resultant wave to keep within the range

8549299
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu lts lucid with the debian package and openjdk minus any hadoop packages installed as a vm running inside virtualbox with 2gb ram

8549329
implements	extends
at compile time information about this method is known that it is required and that this class and any other classes this class may may extends do not implements it

8549346
mp3	wav
ive been trying to interface with the lame_enc.dll using python ctypes and encode wav to mp3

8549346
mp3	wav
i think that i am quite close as i have an mp3 output in which i can hear some words recorded to wav at 22050 hz mono

8549346
mp3	wav
the assumption of a 44 byte header for wav is not always correct which is why i had the click - it was encoding data from the wav header into the first mp3 chunk

8549354
typedef	struct
when declaring an enum you specify the name of it right after the word enum it s not like using typedef to create an alias for a struct

8549381
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
i don t know specifically why the message is logged but integration between uiwindow and uiviewcontroller has been increasing over the last several iterations of ios

8549382
google-chrome	firefox
assuming the code is the same load the page with the master page non-working version and open either firebug in firefox or the google-chrome debugger

8549472
integer	fractions
to determine whether a floating point number has a fractions part as well as an integer part you could use the modf or modff function - the latter since your adj is a float

8549522
folder	directory
after some debugging i tried deleting the following folder from my eclipse directory

8549553
strstr	strtok
see strtok or strstr with third parameter

8549578

8549607
super	implements
implements all uitextviewdelegate methods and call originaltextviewdelegate kind of like calling super on a subclass

8549691
folder	directory
i have ndk-modules directory in root of my android project and i have following in my android.mk of jni folder

8549692
int	chars
i thought that chars and int were two distinct data types in java and that i would have had to cast the chars to an int for this to give the ascii equivelent

8549715
int	chars
chars and int are two distinct types but this works because an int has more precision than a chars

8549715
int	chars
that is every value of chars can be represented as an int so no data is lost in the cast

8549716
int	chars
a chars can be automatically converted to an int

8549716
int	chars	int	double
chars to int long float or double

8549723
typedef	struct
the advantage of anonymous namespaces is you can also define types classes struct enums typedef as well as static variables and functions

8549724
hex	binary
now if i go back to my javascript code and change my hmac code to .digest hex instead of the default binary and log the base64 encoding of the result i get.

8549724
hex	binary
so how come the digest method outputs the correct result when using hex but the wrong answer when using binary

8549737
udp	tcp
for the communication problem here s a simple approach have the server periodically send each player updates whether through a constantly connected tcp connection or just periodic plain old unreliable udp packets

8549737
udp	tcp
read about the difference between tcp and udp -- there are many many places including on so just search that discuss the tradeoffs

8549743
google-chrome	safari
if you use google-chrome or safari and open the element inspector you ll see their body gets the when the page is loaded

8549761
google-chrome	firefox
i would do fresh conversions with squirrel and perhaps use script to detect browser agent and load the most ie compatible font-faces when necessary and then the nice ones for google-chrome firefox and other webkit browsers

8549795
profiling	instrumentation
your first step in speeding up your app should be to profiling the app using instrumentation

8549795
profiling	instrumentation
build your app for profiling and run it in instrumentation using the time profiling tool

8549814
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i have an action-filter and i want to look at that viewmodel in onactionexecuting but viewdata.model is null

8549827

subtract	add
user add subtract them together and type the answer into an input

8550047
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the mysql connection works the for-loop returns an arrays of numbers that exist only once so that i don t show the same post all the time and i ve added the die because if we need more posts than we have number it ges stuck in an infinite loops

8550062

8550155
google-chrome	firefox
however it doesn t work in google-chrome but it does work in firefox

8550157
inherited	properties
if you create class that inherited from an abstract base class and instantiate it it will have properties of the abstract class as well as its own properties

8550252
disk	ram
when the image is first uploaded cache it in ram and don t write it to disk until the user subsequently clicks the submit button

8550263
width	height
as the iframe is generated dynamically with the javascript it should be possible to pass in a height parameter like you do width if that is the case then this would fix it

8550274
wordpress	joomla
second in order to keep the client happy out-source this to another freelancer that knows what they re doing with both php and wordpress joomla or especially drupal

8550329
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
for example see sqldependency sqlcachedependency and response.addcacheitemdependency

8550351
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	ondestroy
so at the point where you would decide to stop your asynctask in onstop or ondestroy most likely you could for example check if the configuration is changing and if so stick it in a static sparsearray under the fragment s identifier and then in your oncreate or onstart look to see if you have an asynctask in the sparse array available

8550376
post	get
with that mode enabled any variable that comes from the outside world env vars get post data etc. is tainted and any variable that touches a tainted variable is also tainted

8550395
stdout	stderr
you would be aware that 0 1 and 2 descriptors are used by stdin stdout and stderr

8550428
erlang	scheme
and erlang also uses a simple cookie scheme for remote system access and access to executing underlying file io commands on remote nodes aren t locked down

8550428
xen	openvz
i d trust something more like qemu+kvm vmware xen more or openvz vservers or a mandatory access control tool such as apparmor selinux tomoyo or smack

8550457
post	get
was actually able to get it working by doing a combination of all three things i mentioned at the end of my post

uiview	subviews
just add a subclass of uiview as a subviews and do all the logic there

8555121
width	height
the jqgrid is wrapped by a dragable div that sets the width height of the grid

8555132
children	parent
my first idea was to make parent propagate all the touchessomething calls to its children but a i suspect there might be an easier solution and b i don t know which child sent the event to parent and sending touchessomething messages twice to the same view might cause shenanigans

8555140
jobs	cron
so once again the pdo calls were failing but this time only for cron jobs

8555140
jobs	cron
my cron jobs are running smoothly and my main site is good and everyone is happily on 5.3.8 but that last bit of trouble-shooting totally lost me and i d like someone to explain to me how the includes can fail for a cron but not for a public_html script why we re chdir and so on

button	checkbox
however rather than showing a mere checkbox i d like to display a particular showing either a green selected or red not selected button based on the state of the database value

8555210
folder	directory
the problem is that the cron job which uses the command-line php executable is running with the current directory as the location of the php executable or the home folder of whichever account is running the job

8555229
apache	nginx
nginx does not run php directly as apache does and simply hands php requests to another separate process

8555234
hash	salt
i am trying to set up a php members area on my web server which has hash and salt passwords

8555234
hash	salt
register.php should take the username hash the password with a salt store all 3 to db works

8555258
versioning	upgrade
additional testing showed that this was last working in ee sp3 5.2.7 but became an issue in ee sp4 5.2.8. we urgently need to upgrade to the latest 5.2 service pack ee sp5 to address other issues - but upgrading to liferay 6 is also a possible option as long as we can find a combination of a solution and versioning that works

8555300
getter	setter
but i don t recommend to change getter setter

8555305
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
placing a uitabbarcontroller inside another container view controller like uinavigationcontroller can lead to undefined behavior

8555319
ivar	subclassing
the compiler explicitly disallows any other class even subclassing from accessing that ivar

8555319
public	protected	ivar	subclassing
public means anyone can access the ivar and protected means subclassing can access it but other classes can t

8555322
public	protected
implementations of the derived type will include all fields including private ones of the base type and can access any and all public or protected members of the base type as if it were its own

8555322
ienumerable	icollection
an object representing a database table may for example allow itself to be passed to a routine that wants a thing that can enumerate contents which are of type t ienumerable t in .net or a routine that wants a thing that can have things of type t added to it icollection t in .net or a thing that wants a thing that wants to know when it s no longer needed idisposable in .net

8555332
hash	hmac
if you assume no one else has access to your secret key a crc hash or hmac would all suffice to ensure you detected changes

8555391
width	height
or just remove the float height and width

8555395
inherited	properties	getter	setter
if properties getter and setter were independent entities an interface that defined a properties setter and inherited from one that defined a properties getter would allow read-write semantics

8555395
getter	setter
instead getter are read-only properties and setter are write-only properties

8555395
inherited	properties
if a type defines a write-only properties but inherited a read-only properties vb.net and c# will only see the write-only properties

8555395
inherited	properties
if an interface inherited an interface which exposes a read-only properties and an interface which exposes a write-only properties neither properties will be usable on the interface because neither vb.net nor c# is willing to use the fact that a properties is being read or written to determine whether to use the read-only or write-only properties

8555395
inherited	properties
as noted the solution is to have an interface which inherited one with a read-only properties and implements a read-write properties

8555440
lisp	racket
since both of them are in the lisp family i am curious about the the advantage of arc over racket or what is the motivation of creating arc given that racket is available

8555466
super	implements
it will only work if the class implements the interface directly as opposed to inherting the interface from a super class and specifies a concrete type for the type parameter as opposed to using a type parameter as in the following example

8555478
pop-up	dialog
note that these mechanisms ask the browser to pop-up a dialog box for authentication

8555556
portrait	landscape
for example lets say i m writing to pdf in portrait orientation 8.5in wide x 11 in height and at some point i want a page in landscape orientation 11in wide x 8.5 in high

8555583
for-loop	loops
using a for-loop we will loops over each fields

8555583
for-loop	loops
using an if loops we would do substitution to the fields when the for-loop parses over second and third fields

8555595
rss	feed
in my app i have created a uitableview which retrieves the xml of the apple hot news rss feed

8555595
put	get
i am not so sure how i can present this how can i edit the uitableview so it can sort itself and put labels in the middle and so on i think you get the point

8555640
folder	directory
if it works in visual studio and when you invoke the .exe in the bin directory i would guess that you have the requisite permissions in those folder and therefore it functions correctly

8555706
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as for internet explorer 9 it along with google-chrome safari and firefox of course supports the history api which you should be using instead

8555775
daemon	cron
for such games you d usually have a cron job daemon running every minute or so that recalculates all amounts of all users in this way

8555802
postgresql	mysql
or rather what is the best way to do this in a non database driver specific manner as i ll be using sqlite mysql and postgresql in my development testing

8555822
getter	setter
since properties can have public and private getter setter is there still a use for fields

8555832
getter	setter
sometimes a property getter setter does more work then just hold a value

8555835
public	protected
the primary reason people use properties for protected and public fields is so you can add behavior without breaking binary compatibility

8555843
getter	setter
this si a complete list of browsers and their support for getter and setter

8555852
getter	setter
in most cases you can use autogen getter and setter instead of a field but there is a subtle difference a getter and a setter are a function call even if inlined - thus a backing variable is always adresses as if it were volatile

8555864
typedef	struct
personally i would just use the types as they are instead of extra typedef to avoid typing struct but whatever

8555865
ienumerable	ilist
is there empty immutable ienumerable ilist singleton in c# .net

8555947
getter	setter
in general direct public access to instance variables is frowned upon instead they d be accessed through getter and setter

8555984
integer	unsigned
nsindexset stores unsigned integer primitive types whereas nsset stores objects

8555991
vmware	virtualbox
you can easily try bochs or dosbox on ubuntu just apt-get one or the other or both if you just want to run some old x86 dos programs that wont run in qemu or virtualbox vmware because they dont emulate dos

restrict	shared
most commercial shared hosts run php in safe mode which disallows exec or at least restrict it to special directories

8556082

you don t have to do anything in your folder there is no relationships between that code and the directory hierarchy

8556088

bazaar	svn	bazaar	fossil	bazaar	git	fossil	git
i say strong no-no for git as first vcs but you have wide choice even without it - svn poor branch|merge comparing to dvcs bazaar not a tool of my dream but who knows mercurial fossil scm monotone

8556100
getter	setter
xmlencode will use getter setter methods to properly convert objects into xml

8556128
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing asd.qwe.mycollection

8556152

postgresql	mysql
i had been hoping for a mysql equivalent to postgresql s table functions

8556325
put	get
what i want to do is to get a number of strings in an arraylist of objects and then put them on a printable report

8556332
width	height
at the moment i am scaling my graphics by setting their width height as some fraction of the window height

8556332
width	height
but is it dangerous to assume that while working in landscape mode the window height will always be less than window width and therefore making it the main constraining factor

8556360
client-side	server-side
on that note i find it hassle some to keep the client-side validation code and server-side validation code in sync especially if they are written in different languages which is always the case if you are not using node.js or gwt

8556360
client-side	server-side
however if there are certain validation that can only be performed on server-side database uniqueness constraint for instance then it is important to show user that their client-side actions have failed

8556361
postgresql	mysql
anton s answer would be the preferred solution if we were talking about mysql but as you pointed out it causes errors in postgresql since postgresql is a bit more restrictive in its select grouping functions

8556406
getter	setter
i m trying to generate getter setter for my doctrine mongo document class

8556406
getter	setter
however when i attempt to generate the getter and setter using the cli command php app console doctrine mongodb generate documents sitegamebundle i get the following back

8556452
int	chars
you re comparing a a pointer to the start of a string to a single chars q - you re comparing a pointer and an int value as your compiler warnings will tell you

i am trying to create a gridview listview that displays an imageview and textview in the same grid list row and the image and text are being dynamically updated on the row during scroll

8556608
return-value-optimization	nrvo
i know some compilers implement some optimizations even in debug vs uses return-value-optimization in debug but not nrvo - what s the situation for inlining

8556635
client-side	server-side
i know there s an ajax library in there but i don t use that. we have to understand the difference between server-side and client-side

8556668
multiplying	add
a smart compiler will figure out to just add as precomputed to a for each iteration through the loop vs doing the more expensive multiplying on each iteration

8556692
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that is bound to a sqldatasource

8556749
post	get
start with one of those and then post a follow-up question if you get stuck on something

8556761
width	height
each element will have a set width but will have a variable height determined automatically by the content inside that element

8556807
public	protected
i m a bit confused about the difference between public private and protected

8556830
devise	cancan
ensure the user is authorized to view the data in my rails app i use devise and cancan

8556851
post	get
i guess in simpler terms what i am trying to do is get the post value of a disabled textbox to use in a sql insert statement when the form is posted

8556869
gridview	sqldatasource
for meeting your requirement i think you shouldn t use sqldatasource to bind gridview instead of manual binding the datasource to gridview

8556898
width	height
i am using sizetofit in a piece of code where i want it to ignore the width but just size to fit based on height

8556910
uiview	subviews
you may be better off writing your own subviews of uiview that can handle multiple lines of text each with its own label

8556944
post	get
if your form requested by post method you can get the value of form control by syntax

8556946
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
in the spritesheet constructor you specify the image which has all the tiles and the width height of the tiles in the sheet along with any spacing and margin if you have need that

8556955
int	chars
hi i have made this code but here something unusual is happening i am printing the addresses when i increase the address of all then from my view increment in int would be 2 float would be 4 and chars would be 1 but i got the following

8556955
int	chars
for float and chars i think its correct but for int i don t know why it is giving so

8556995
width	height
judging by these i would assume that in landscape orientation the window height will be less than window width

8556995
width	height
if the width were lower it would amount to portrait orientation and if the width and height are equal it should be treated as square

8557009
submit	submission
this is because the submit button is only included in the form submission traditionally when said submit button is clicked

8557012
int	chars
you can make life easier for yourself by using the fixed-width types by using unsigned types unless being able to represent negative numbers is absolutely required and by not using int when chars arrays will do

8557015
getter	setter
you can make speedpref fuelcapacity and fuel public member variables however a better approach would be to make them properties on the class with appropriate getter and setter

8557046
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure how it affects the other browsers especially opera but for google-chrome and firefox adding this rule seems to help.

8557117
post	get
how to get the data into the controller which has http post controller like

8557184
inherited	properties
what entails from this is that when you are actually creating a new object that inherited from person object by calling object.create then what happens in its implementation is a new object will be freshly created and then it will return that new object which will override the prototype properties that javascript assumed you have created by doing that person.prototype assignment previously earlier in your code

if i remove the link to reset.css things change again google-chrome becomes dead-level ie puts the label 1px higher than the input text firefox 1px lower than the input text

8557419
onresume	onpause
the best solution will be to save the current time and stop the timer in onpause then restart the timer in onresume adding to it the saved time

8557432
for-loop	loops
i heard a rumor that for large list items a for-loop will work faster than a foreach loops

8557443
int	chars
in order to have an array where each element has a int float and chars element you would do something like this

8557443
int	chars
you would then reference your elements as a i int a i floats a i chars

8557554
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my js fb connect to oauth versioning when i am trying to logout from fb programatically using fb.logout method i am getting error like

8557570
subtract	add
any packages previously installed and in the wrong place can be moved to the usr local lib r site-library directory assuming you are sudo ing it just by moving the directories thanks tommy but as usr lib r is controlled by apt - best not add or subtract anything from there.

8557599
nsmutablestring	nsstring	nsmutablestring	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
also with a nsstring also nsdata nsset etc. property it is better to define them as a copy since it would be perfectly valid to pass in a nsmutablestring instead since it is a subclass of nsstring which then the contents could be altered externally of this object

8557611
put	get
the only way to get it working would be to create a table with say 3 columns put the respective content in the three columns and then style the each td of the table giving the inline-css

i m using jquery ui dialog control to display a pop-up on hover of a span

8557966
mouseover	mouseout
i understand jquery is firing mouseout mouseover rapidly even though the pointer is still within the span

8557972
client-side	server-side
the question as to whether they should be client-side templates or server-side is the crux of the issue

8557995

what id like to be able to do however is allow users that have javascript disabled to still get a basic show hide hover effect via css only

8558066
post	get
the only way to pass a javascript variable to php would be through a get or post request this could be via ajax or a synchronous page load

8558067

innodb	myisam
as i know myisam doesn t supports foreign keys compare the features offered by innodb vs the features of myisam

8558417

make sure that you know the exact algorithm including the use of any salt before you attempt to reverse an md5 hash through brute force

if there was no salt used i think there are probably rainbow tables available for md5 on the web already where you can just do a search

this in javascript is a bit tricky so using it in functions especially with settimeout or setinterval is risky

8566099

possible duplicate when do you use post and when do you use get

8566523
post	get
some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request

8566523

get can be quicker compared to post as it is a one step request post sends headers first then the body of the request

as you have found out the httpcontext is not persisted across requests and hence neither are iprincipal and iidentity - the httpcontext is constructed at the start of each request by the framework and the iprincipal and iidentity are constructed from the authentication ticket deserialised from the authentication cookie

8572661

in this scenario the service will authenticate the user and send back an authentication cookie in the response to the calling application and that application will then use the cookie to construct the iprincipal and iidentity on each subsequent request

you can override the iprincipal and iidentity when the application.postauthenticaterequest event is raised

client-side	server-side
when i click the button it only validates server-side but not client-side

8577098
getter	setter
note this doesn t implement any setter or getter but as pointed out already by the comments this is not really needed when using classes

8577117
width	height
typically i would wish for it to constrain itself to 1 1 so that if the relativelayout.layoutparams contain a width of 200 and a height of 100 the custom relativelayout would constrain itself to 100 x 100

8577117
width	height
what actually happens when i do this is that bizarrely the height is properly restricted as i intended but the width is not

8577117
width	height
specifying a height of 200 and width of 100 in the relativelayout.layoutparams results in my custom relativelayout having a height of 100 and width of 100

8577117
width	height
specifying a height of 100 and width of 200 in the relativelayout.layoutparams results in my custom relativelayout having a height of 100 and width of 200

8577637
installation	upgrade
you will have to upgrade your xcode installation

8577663
put	get
yeah actually codeblocks has this error what you have to do is get the classes namely the .cpp and the .h out of the folder and get them in the root of the project so cut them and paste them where the main.cpp is and it should work also what you can do is put #include source theclass.cpp and u can also solve it that way also do the same for the .h

the current working directory when you start your script is not the location of the script it s whatever folder you happened to be in when you ran it

8578117

the cd then changes the working directory to the folder containing that and the exec is just for a tiny efficiency it replaces your script s executable process with the java vm rather than starting it as a child process

8578493
hash	salt
so the way to improve on the hash is to add in a salt value

8578533
hash	md5
i aways use the session approach but if you want to be very secure prevent sessions hijacking you could save the current ip and some other characteristics of the user in a md5 hash in the database along with the session id

inherited	subclassing
inherited class is a subclassing of qobject

8578951
width	height
the problem is that the textbox in the 3rd column of the usercontrol used as a listbox item should not automatically increase its width when i type into it some long text it should just wrap increasing its height up to a maximum height

8578964
bash	zsh
any caveats or gotchas to aliasing cc to refer to clang within my default shell - zsh presumably by editing my .zshrc file while leaving cc aliased to gcc in another shell bash

8578984
width	height
if you add a second element that has no width but is the height of the container your single element will move to vertically center with this no-width element thus vertically centering it

8579103
equals	gethashcode
update to use it in linq map all columns as compositeid and mutable false then override equals and gethashcode with default implementation

8579110
google-chrome	firefox
untested in anything except google-chrome and firefox but you could try using a combination of float left and margin-left

8579136
post	get
been banging my head for 2 days now i am a newbie to zend but not jquery i am trying to post a form using zend framework but all i seem to get is the page refreshing like a normal post request

8579141
post	put
i have a wordpress multisite network and it has 6 blogs who s post i want to extract and put into 6 different pages on a separate website this separate website is not wordpress based but it is php based

8579151
post	get
i might be completely wrong but doesn t facebook access your canvas content by a post instead of a get request

8579153
portrait	landscape
building a good app that runs on all kind of devices requires effort in making multiple sets of drawables and probably multiple sets of layouts landscape portrait small large screens etc

8579181
post	get
a typical scenario is the following post redirect get model

8579186
udp	tcp
finally if you want to use udp you should probably try to use udp instead of wierd tcp

8579189
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 10.04 lts

8579200
post	get
just post fix the feed to each blog main url to get post

8579200
post	get
in your own site you will get post in xml format you then can parse it with php simplexml

8579239
prepare	execute
use dynamic sql to create the statement prepare and execute

8579265
google-chrome	firefox
prior one week everything was working ok but now it doesnt want to redirect in ie but it redirects in google-chrome or firefox

8579280
jboss	glassfish
if jboss or glassfish support source as a parameter or return type in a normal sei then that s a proprietary extension

8579314
floating-point	integer
note that floating-point to integer conversions are always considered narrowing -- even 7.0 to 7

8579424
google-chrome	firefox
i was only apple to play .ogg files in both firefox 8 and google-chrome 15 from the local file system

8579435
versioning	upgrade
since this is the first time you will have to run a database upgrade i would be tempted to add an extra table to the schema that will hold the versioning information

8579435
versioning	upgrade
that should allow you to upgrade from any previous versioning to the current without maintaining several code paths since a 1.0 to 1.2 upgrade will never change and you should have a known start position for each cumulative step

8579480
mp3	ogg
i had a similar issue for some reason it would not load local mp3 files the solution for me was to use ogg files and all worked

8579480
google-chrome	firefox
my local dev system is linux apache2 and i tested with firefox 8 and google-chrome 15

8579480
mp3	ogg
the audio tag did work with remote mp3 and ogg files though i don t know why they were not working locally again ogg worked locally

8579486
unsigned	short
it gets treated as an array of short because of the unsigned of the type which makes the largest value too large to fit in a signed byte or char

8579489
put	get
please note that i ve used the interposed class so if you put this code into your unit only those web browsers on the form or those created in this unit dynamically will get this behavior

8579524
csla	.net
csla .net is a framework that my company uses heavily in most of our projects so some of these constraints are forced by the framework itself and can t be changed

8579555
width	height
images on firefox at least have a naturalwidth height property so you can use img.naturalwidth to get the original width

8579590
touchesbegan	touchesended
are you implementing touchesbegan and touchesended in your scrollview

8579632
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work fine in google-chrome but not firefox 8 or ie 9

8579647
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the developers of the html app have lots of work making sure it works on ie9 google-chrome firefox safari etc

8579661
http.sys	httplistener
msdn says httplistener is based on http.sys and http.sys provides connection management bandwidth throttling and web server logging.

8579737
dictionary	map
in order to save bandwidth i want to use a dictionary to map the bloomberg ticker to its last price so instead of getting multiple results for the same ticker i have the same ticker in multiple times the program will do a lookup in the dictionary

8579742
inherited	properties
in this case user is a properties on the system.web.webpages.webpagerenderingbase abstract class which is used by the view engine when rendering views as they inherited from it

8579754
post	get
you can prefix the get variables with get_ and the post variable with post_ for example

8579755
post	get
this code basically does what does just in a worse way get having priority over post

8579755
post	get
you should completely remove this code and update the script to use the appropriate variable or to access post get data instead of just using

8579776
post	get
it ll handle get and post transparently and decode the uri-encoded strings for you

8579787
int	boolean
there are several ways the easier is probably to create a boolean preference or an int if you want to handle more than two layouts and if it is set to true then you load a specific layout and if not you load the other one

8579803
getter	setter
i fully understand the concept of using the syntesize directive to create getter and setter methods if i had property int width and synthesize width i am inadvertently creating a getter method of width and a setter method of setwidth

8579803
getter	setter
it seems to me it only works correctly when my getter and setter are both named in the x setx naming convention

8579803
getter	setter
a if i create an instance variable that happens to be an object like origin in this case must i create getter and setter methods for it

8579803
getter	setter
b can i create a getter method but not a setter method or vice versa

8579803
getter	setter
c is it mandatory that if i do create both a getter and setter method for origin that they both be named in the x setx manner

8579803
getter	setter
as in if i change the name of the getter i must change the name of the setter accordingly

8579821
superclass	subclassing
it s part of the is-a relationship of subclassing instances to their superclass

8579821
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
that s part of the contract for implementation inherited each subclassing instance must be able to act like any other members of their superclass

8579840
children	parent
only the parent surrounding the hovered children should change color

8579911
content-disposition	content-type
in theory the filename parameter should be set on content-disposition not content-type

8579915
folder	directory
i ve gone into the project properties and went to the java build path and imported the .jar from the mainactivity libs folder that didn t work and then i tried to import it from my sdk directory and that didn t work

8579923
width	height
for the moment i just increase the height and width of the canvas to zoom in

8579923
width	height
initially the canvas has width 100 and height 100 so no scrollbars are needed but when i enlarge this i need those scrollbars

8579957
post	get
i think that to get a definitive answer you may need to post on the cmake mailing list and if you get a good answer post it here

8579976
post	get
you should better use datatype json and mtype post to get the data directly from the server without needs to make separate call

8580004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in order to find this you can right click on the element on the page when you are viewing the actual page - and click inspect element. this is in google-chrome firefox safari

8580023
ready	each
i do a lot of stuff in each of these ready functions to prepare the site

8580029
put	get
you just put your work code in one function doinbackground and your ui code in another onpostexecute and asynctask makes sure they get called on the right threads and in order

8580065
hash	md5
you should store passwords with a one way hash function md5 sha1 sha256

8580078
post	get
fortunately we re targeting browsers that all support postmessage but the dialog javascript doesn t appear to be getting a value for window.opener so i don t think it can get a reference to the window so it can post a message

8580088
children	parent
if you want the same distance between every element the easiest way is to float the children set a negative margin on the parent element that has the same size as the margin on the children and make the parent x times as wide as the children + x times the margin where x is 3 if you want 3 elements next to each other like this

8580121
width	height
then for the size divide your document width by 109 ppi and your height by 109 again ppi and enter the resulting values in their respective locations making sure inches is selected

8580167
post	put
i want to know if there s a way to put all these steps in one page this page will have input boxes for media background post type and add new post

8580169
bash	zsh
everything i ve read says that zsh uses zero offset just like bash so how on earth can

8580249
getter	setter
these lines don t actually create getter and setter they just inform the compiler that your class has these properties

8580249
getter	setter
the compiler will then expect getter and setter if you don t use readonly named -origin1 and -setorigin1

8580249
getter	setter
the names of the setter getter are important see apple s documentation on key-value coding for details

8580263
setinterval	settimeout
to try my suggestion just call settimeout instead of setinterval then at the end of your mycode you call settimeout again

8580276
getter	setter
origin in this case must i create getter and setter methods for it

8580276
accessor	properties
if you declare a properties you ll need to either provide your own accessor or use the synthesize directive to create them

8580276
getter	setter
b can i create a getter method but not a setter method or vice versa

8580276
getter	setter
c is it mandatory that if i do create both a getter and setter method

8580276
accessor	properties
you can provide your own names for the accessor but you should stick with the usual convention if you want your class to be key value coding compliant for the properties in question

8580288
jobs	cron
server load grows quadratically with increased use per license due to large amounts of processing that occurs through scheduled cron jobs

8580292
gridview	repeater
a repeater will only render what you tell it to render it doesn t add additional html to the page like a gridview or a dataview would

8580302
width	height
setting the width and height of canvas using css is not a good idea

8580302
width	height
to achieve what you required you should not give width and height of canvas in css

8580324
post	get
when i add the canvasauthorize permissions extendedpermissions attribute to both the create methods and a link from another page calls this create method normally the get method should get called but in this case the post method gets called

8580324
post	get
but if i comment the post method then it goes to the get method

8580325
getter	setter
then create bean setter getter method for each enum and then you can simply access these all enum like as normal variable

8580355
google-chrome	firefox
i know that google-chrome and firefox can both open data uri images

8580363
put	get
i have a query and i want the result to be the cookie if i try this each time i get the result -1 if i put the anwser in a gridview i get the good result

8580368
ready	each
using jquery deferred you could build promises for each ready function and combine them with jquery.when to trigger a final action

8580392
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome

8580397
draggable	droppable
i recommend you to use jquery ui s draggable and droppable interactions

8580407
width	height
i have a list of content items each with a set width but different variable height

8580418
profiling	debugging
my only guess is that some of the sql-clr debugging stuff is trimmed out of the client profiling

8580442
rational-numbers	radix	rational-numbers	base
if you want to get fancier you can define the base and the radix as rational-numbers with two integers as described above or make them themselves irrational numbers

8580455
button	checkbox
all of the forms are just displays text_fields instead of select boxes radio button checkbox etc

8580465
width	height
you will have to make the overlay taller than the container for the images but the same width and float it overtop if it is the same height the shadow will appear from all sides

8580476
maven	pom.xml
maven debug logs show the following message for a missing pom.xml file

8580499
installation	upgrade
i ve done some reading on the installation but it s not clear to me whether i will be upgrade to the sql server developers edition or whether the install will create another instance

8580540
children	parent
or more generally when an object child object inherits from another object parent object how should children methods use helper functions and is it possible to make these private

8580544
children	parent
it just pulls the parent userstory with a particular id and all of it s children

8580559
bash	tcsh
this is a ksh script launch it though ksh or any shell like bash sh csh or tcsh which understand the #

8580563
post	get
since sitefinity uses a custom sitefinity skin for the admin ui is it not possible to get the memory gains mentioned in ivan zhekov s blog post

8580575
avro	thrift
this is reinforced with modern serialization frameworks like protobuf thrift avro which will generate the code behind these serialized objects for you anyway and expect you not to muck with the internals of those classes through inheritance

8580584
implements	extends
i am thinking a good way to extends this object is composition but the problem that my superclass must implements the primary object s interface which would be about 600 lines of stub code

8580612
children	parent
when an object child object inherits from another object parent object how should children methods use helper functions and is it possible to make these private

8580619
children	parent
i want the windowstate behaviour of the mdi children to be different in a parent

8580700
mouse	keyboard
i suppose one thing you could try would be to set some application-level or parent-level tunneling events so you can toggle a flag indicating it was mouse clicked or keyboard pressed previewmousedown and previewkeydown

8580703
gif	png
i am wondering how do you convert jpg gif and png images into real .ico s

8580703
gif	ico	gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	png	ico
from all i ve read and found so far php handles gif jpg and png very well but when it comes to bmp the format you need to get to before porting over to ico - only wbmp is natively supported wmpb is a crappy monochrome format which is nothing like the real bmp

8580707
listview	gridview
for example if this is a property of a business object and you use data binding to show your data in some control like gridview or listview independent from the actual framework it might be that this property will be recognized as updateable now and the user might change some values you and some other assemblies considered immutable so far

8580727
implements	extends
myview extends glsurfaceview and myrenderer implements glsurfaceview.renderer

8580731
postgresql	mysql
i ve seen similar questions but they had to do with using mysql whereas this kind of broken transaction is not supposed to happen with postgresql

8580752
hide	show
also if you fade-out-in the div elements rather than show hide ing them they will still occupy their spot on the document

8580752
hide	show
if you use show hide then the element will no longer be in the flow of the page and you won t be able to mouse-over any hidden elements to make them show again

8580778
post	get
so im working on a rails app where users can comment on photos or videos another user has uploaded and so far everything is great except i am not able to get the current user_id associated with the person who has commented on the post

8580810
bmp	png
if you have massive resources on the page such as bmp or png files that are several hundred k see if you can convert them to other formats or resize them on the server to the size they render at

8580817
folder	directory
i put all files in a common directory called ajax and put this in an .htaccess file in the same folder

8580885
children	parent
the children inherit the opacity setting from there parent

8580889
hide	show
hello i am doing a simple toggle that hide and show certain blocks of text when i click on a navigation option

8580889
hide	show
i am doing this by running a for-loop and using length.div to determine the exact div that i want to show or hide

8580897
pull	push
if it passes qa will pull from webdev - merge - push to webdev and if its a big change can review again there to make sure it is fine

8580918
submit	submission
it sounds like the jquery mobile framework is still hi-jacking the submit event and running its own ajax submission of the form

8580940
width	height
remember the image is dynamically resizable vertically and horizontally so i had to strip the image width and height

8580946
profiling	debugging
many tool-chains include an instruction level simulator that will perform trace code-coverage and profiling but you may have to create debugging scripts or code stubs to simulate hardware to coerce the execution of all paths

8580959
textview	imageview
if i understand your question correctly you re looking to apply some padding to an imageview that you display to the right of the titlebar textview

8580969
post	get
so i get a can t verify csrf authenticity warning which resets the session then i can t update the post

8581011
getter	setter
if you want to implement the getter setter that way you ll need to use a private member variable

8581019
accessor	properties
some languages do not allow you to override a properties without overriding all visible accessor

8581054
post	get
and that by using method post not method get

8581066
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
because getelementsbytagname returns a collection or alternatively give the element an id and use getelementbyid instead

8581069
inherited	properties
i think the only way to override the inherited properties is to do something like this

8581094
post	get
and i am trying to get the post filtering by this custom field the problem is that the value its an array and my code its not working

8581155
for-loop	loops
then i can t loops through the for-loop a second time and still keep what i wrote in the previous iteration which is something i want to do as creating the new writer to the existing file erases the existing content

8581175
post	get
there is a good description in this post about why it is better to fix bugs in a stable branch and push them back to dev while using a dev branch for features which get pushed back to the stable branch as well.

8581200
pascal	delphi

8581236
int	double
all you need to do is type-cast the double to an int like so

8581287
outputstream	inputstream
i m already able to get the generated file as an outputstream now i m just looking for an implementor to use to keep things in memory which implements inputstream as well

8581287
outputstream	inputstream
what class can i use which functions as both an outputstream and an inputstream on in-memory data

8581289
superclass	subclassing
because the logic for performing an action is contained in the superclass all you have to do to make a subclassing is register what events it responds to and create an actionobject that contains the logic for its response

8581292
google-chrome	firefox
i have a javascript file where no matter where i place it in the includes the file below it is not being run in both google-chrome and firefox - probably other browsers as well - just haven t tested them

8581311
inherited	subclassing
the supportseventvalidation attribute is not inherited for subclassing so if you create a subclassing of dropdownlist don t apply that attribute to the subclassing and use the subclassing on your page you will have a control that doesn t trigger event validation even if event validation is enabled on the page

8581359
stdout	stderr
i have a very simple script that output some text to stderr and stdout with println

8581364
width	height
if the download is successful clicking on a row with the intended image leads to the uiimageview expanding to the height of the row and the width increases at scale

8581386
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox google-chrome and safari this link does not do anything when you click it

8581427
width	height
attach an event on the image load or show or resize using jquery just google it and in the event handler find the width and height of the image and set the width and height of your parent div

8581450
width	height
and the height and width properties set to match the container

8581454
int	boolean
the nullable type in this case nullable int has a property of hasvalue which is boolean

8581474
post	get
that should mean only post get requests can be made to external places and only to places listed in the manifest requiredpermissions list

8581476
getter	setter
i m sure there s more to it particularly in the getter and setter but that s it in a nutshell

8581518
post	get
there is some limits for number of users you can request info for i m not sure on the numbers but 50 users works ok and on url length which can be worked around issuing post request and specifying method parameter equal to get to graph api

8581524
innodb	myisam
if you are having slow query times perhaps take a look to see if you are doing any intensive updates to the database as myisam does lock the table rather than the row like innodb on updates

8581531
innodb	myisam
not only for its support for row-level locking actually mvcc which is better than row-level locking but also innodb is superior to myisam in terms of resistance against data corruption

8581552
folder	directory
when the web application is run from vs2008 it retrives the image files and display them.how ever when i deploy the same project in iis using virtual directory the application couldn t access the files on the shared folder it says access denied

8581625
m2e	pom.xml
i understand that the new m2e within eclipse has pluggable connectors which help configure the eclipse project based on what they see in the pom.xml when the project is imported

8581629
extjs	qooxdoo
some large project like extjs or qooxdoo have build in loaders to load only required code but here is a lot of libs which simplify this and you can use in your project head.js lab.js

8581641
folder	directory
you will need to set up an account one that has access to the remote folder in your iis virtual directory

8581658
spaces	delimiter
edit to make this clearer all words in the entered text are potential keywords so basically all words delimiter by spaces should be considered

8581672
pop-up	dialog
how do i retrieve the data from the search modal dialog that pop-up when i click on the search button

8581694
hide	show
initially the style for the text editor hide it but if the list item class is set to editor then the textarea is show and the list text is not

8581724
post	get
you have to look for binding collection to view and later when you post form all collection get collected in actionresult

8581734
fontfamily	font-size
in this case i give them the same font-size fontfamily and height

8581766
switching	screens
i m completely new to ios and storyboards i read quite a few tutorials but haven t been able to figure out how to do the checking of input and switching to new screens properly

8581800
packets	multicast
your environment might not support multicast so ec2 is out for starters or your network admin might prevent multicast packets within your production environment

8581804
itertools	functools
i skimmed itertools and functools but didn t find anything quite like what i want to do

8581809
google-chrome	safari
however it seems that google-chrome and safari doesn t support what i m trying to achieve here.

8581809

i wonder how i could fix that on google-chrome and safari

8581814
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

maybe std ostream_iterator and std ostringstream

8581910
post	get
i m using the post redirect get pattern in my asp.net mvc 3 web application

8581910
post	get
typically if you submit a post that triggers validation you get a 302 redirect back to the original page so the user can correct their form input and resubmit

8581910
post	get
if the user refreshes the page they will get that the browser needs to resend the information you previously submitted prompt which is the whole point of doing post redirect get

8581923
for-loop	arrays
is there an easier way using arrays or a for-loop to do this function

8581931
put	get
however when i put it together and attempt to start the remote service rather than local service i always get the error cannot open service on computer

8581944
post	get
will get several parameters regardless of the action type being sent get or post

8581998
width	height	portrait	landscape
where you can switch the orientation between portrait and landscape but i can t think of anything to put between the two orientations as the width and height both need to stay 100 for each correct

8582005
udp	tcp
you could use udp but from the sounds of it you d end up emulating tcp over udp

8582031

everything i ve read says that zsh uses zero offset just like bash so how on earth can 1 0 1 1 1 1

8582152
getter	setter
if the attribute exists in the document mongoid will provide you with your standard getter and setter methods

8582152
getter	setter
if the attribute does not already exist on the document mongoid will not provide you with the getter and setter and will enforce normal method_missing behavior

8582184
width	height
with jquery i could copy the src height and width of the image and manipulate the markup into something like this

8582202
getter	setter
in terms of memory management this just means that the specific setter and getter are invoked whereas

8582280
implements	extends
the customview extends a view and implements mygesturelistener interface

8582294
junit	testng
you can indeed use plain junit or testng with a mock framework to test your sessionejb and individual spring beans in isolation proper unit testing

typedef declarations paired to those struct fit in naturally there and are often expected to be there by someone looking at the code

8582515

8598172
udp	tcp
unix-domain sockets don t use udp or tcp since they never go across the network

8598172
udp	tcp
they do use sock_stream and sock_dgram though which behave similarly in most respects to using tcp and udp sockets to localhost

8598182
processors	hyperthreading
especially because many processors support hyperthreading

8598182
affinity	processors
be careful when you start multiple workers the linux kernel really prefers to keep processes executing on the same processors for their entire lifetime to provide for strong cache affinity

8598182
cpu	affinity
to combat this you might want to start your workers with an explicitly limited cpu affinity

8598189
hide	show
the thing is i cannot append to it show or hide it use .empty

8598234
post	get
jsonp only supports the get http action ie not post

8598261
width	height
keep your canvas s width and height the exact size of your original image size it ll be ok

8598280
switching	screens
in this example i d like the switching to occur on a touch event that happens anywhere on the screens

8598289
h.264	webm
flash supports h.264 not webm

8598297
versioning	upgrade
now the challenge is i need to be able to know the versioning of bbm running on the user s device so i can display an appropriate message telling the user to upgrade if the user does not meet the bbm platform requirement

8598315
uiview	uiwindow	portrait	landscape
in other words the uiview has its coordinates swapped to landscape as expected but its parent uiwindow still claims to be in portrait mode.

8598358
jlist	jtable
a jlist would probably be better than a jtable

8598401
pascal	delphi
how do i check - using the ttcpblocksocket socket from the synapse library with delphi pascal - how much data the server is returning to me

8598431
hash	salt
they both work by using bcrypt to generate a salt hash of the password the only difference is that devise by default uses a higher cost for the hash it would take more cpu cycles to brute force it but of course you could easily add that to the railscast code so roughly equivalent in that respect

8598448
post	put
2 put the button in a form post that form to your plugin and add some code to handle the post d form if you do this make sure you include a nonce for security and also make sure that the user trying to click the button has the right privileges to do so

8598468
free	realloc
so you end up calling realloc free with a random garbage pointer that corrupts the heap and causes a later crash.

8598494
getter	setter
.attr name value is a setter .attr name is a getter

8598511
calloc	malloc
however calling it with a non-null pointer that was not obtained using malloc or calloc causes undefined behavior

8598514
for-loop	loops
this for-loop is the main loops which do the most of the computing

8598524
hide	show
the code in general would be more robust against these types of issues if you put a class in the div tag that you want to hide show and then you d have more robust ways to find it rather than relying on there being one and only one div tag in exactly the right place

8598532
dictionary	map
the other way to do it could be adding you own implementation of map dictionary which extends arraylist and in fact is a list of kvpair where kvpair looks like

8598536
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
also you can only have memory leaks when you use malloc or calloc without a corresponding free including equivalent use of realloc

8598553
min	max
i have set the number input field to have a min value of 1 and max of 7 but a user can still manually type in whatever number they want 0 or 8

8598570
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
also getelementsbytagname returns a nodelist so you need to get off of it or use getelementbyid instead when writing the cookie - this is why the cookie result is undefined

8598595
width	height
you could make it visibility hidden and set width and height to 0

8598602
width	height
how does one create this chart in r such that the height of the bar is the density and the width and beginning end of the bar is determined by the breaks vector

8598602
width	height
the second bar has height 0 and the x-axis has a bar width ranging from -4.4 to -4.2 on the x-axis an so on

8598602
range	infinity
the last bar has a density of 0 and range from 2.6 to infinity

8598602
min	max
naturally we would set the xlim of the plot object to min and max of the breaks so that the first and last bars of 0 density are not plotted

8598635
int	chars
for example enum fruit might be compatible with int with chars or even with unsigned long long if the implementation chooses as long as the chosen type can represent all the values

8598653
range	median
you actually need the full ranked data to plot a proper boxplot because the quantities are median quartiles and the actual value of the closes data point within 1.5 times irq plus all data points that are outside that range outliers

8598656
disk	ram
you only need the working set of data to fit in ram because the non-used pages are not loaded and just kept on disk

8598660
system.in	system.out
even when i run it through the command line however it does not display output nor prompt for input when i use system.out system.in respectively

8598693
qgraphicsview	qvboxlayout
i am having trouble getting a qgraphicsview to show up in a qvboxlayout object and i have no idea what is wrong

8598744

the wsimport is inside the maven plugin named jaxws-maven-plugin

8598745
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this can be done even on a system that is inherently case-insensitive windows because the repository itself is still case-sensitive

8598758
children	parent
meaning it has a parent child relationship with infinite children

8598759
google-chrome	firefox
so in firefox and google-chrome the second method is multiple times faster - just as i expected

8598772
google-chrome	firefox

if they need to be accessed write a getter and or setter

8602131
getter	setter
only members that are part of the interface which need to be visible should have getter setter

8602131
getter	setter
don t start writing a getter setter pair for every member in your class and call it encapsulation cause it s not

8602131
getter	setter
if you need a setter or a getter for a variable it doesn t automatically mean you need the other as well

8602131
getter	setter
in general here s how getter and setter work in c++

8602131
getter	setter
edit as you can see in c++ getter and setter are just like any other method there s absolutely nothing special about them

8602401
lsp	principles
can i violate lsp liskov substitution principles in this case

create methods which internally get user s id and put them in queries

8602728
lsp	principles
more formally the liskov substitution principles lsp is a particular definition of a subtyping relation called strong behavioral subtyping

8602728
width	height	getter	setter
a typical example that violates lsp is a square class that derives from a rectangle class assuming getter and setter methods exist for both width and height

8602728
width	height
the square class always assumes that the width is equal with the height

8602782
jax-ws	jax-rs
if you mean xml binding in terms of jax-ws soap or jax-rs restful web services you may find the following links useful

8603063
innodb	myisam
second after i ll decide which engine to choose let s say myisam if in the future i ll need to use the table in a transaction i ts a good practice to temporary change the engine of the table to innodb in order to execute the transaction and after to come back to the first selected choice

8603066

instead what i wanted to do was keep a button on the side of the jtextfield and only if the person clicks on the button would the dialog pop-up

8604398
width	height
fairly hard-coded values for the width and height of each cell

8604398
width	height
g.measurestring will give me the width but not the height if it wraps to multiple lines

8604400
free	malloc
each time when you do a malloc think of the place where you re going to call free

8604411
free	malloc
as a rule of thumb you want to call free for every malloc call

8604425
unix	aix
i am using aix unix in which grep -ow a-za-z_ filename is not working as for aix -o switch is not present

8604444
button	checkbox
having defined selenium actions click a button check a checkbox type in text into input field what would be the rspec expectations for these actions in rspec tests

8604450
hide	show
i have a div.expander which is the button to show hide all the table rows tr in the next following table

8604485
bash	subshell
when you do this instead of running the script in a subshell bash will execute each command in the script as if it were typed at the prompt

8604531

the problem is that heroku does not use a mysql database in production but a postgresql database

8604571
excel	listobject
the data is edited using a excel table which tranlates to an listobject inside vsto

8604576

the problem i m having is getting is being able to access the height and width of the original display object i am replacing with the new one loaded via the loader class

8604599
put	get
you ll have to roll your sleeves up and write your own loop to put things into your groups but the above approach should get you started

8604601
folder	directory
can t i just delete the obj folder or empty the bin directory or clean solution or something

8604605
jboss	glassfish
i deploy my application on jboss 6 or glassfish 3 so the solution must be standard

8604767
versioning	upgrade
so why netbeans tells me that i have to upgrade the svn client as i already have the newest versioning

8604802
folder	directory
check if you have this folder in your wp-content plugins directory - even if it is not activated in wordpress the very presence of it there is a potential security threat as the attacker can use the direct url of the plugin faulty file to access it

8604808
post	get
i am not sure how to do this though do i just issue a key and have them send it in a post or with get on each api request

8604809

linux i686 applewebkit 535.7 khtml like gecko google-chrome 16.0.912.63 safari 535

8604834
hide	show
when show hide is used

8604846
getter	setter
you could simply write your own getter and setter to expose the instance variable

8604860
min	max
at first it catches the first line of the file to set min and max

8604860
min	max
if a new min or max was found

8604863
min	max
or you can get the value min and max like this

8604876
haskell	agda
sweirich ssgip main.pdf has introductory examples for type-level computations in agda but those can be applied to haskell as well

simple don t bother and just salt you hash and please don t use md5 go for sha1 or better for win

8604967
serializable	deserialization
how does the serializable deserialization actually work

8605017
min	max
min and max are worksheet functions

8605017
min	max
i cannot tell the location of the values that are parameters to min and max

8605017
min	max
it is possible to use the min and max functions on an array but i know of no way of selecting a portion of an array

8605024
persistent	transient
if you don t want to persistent the data but you want it to be bound as part of the automatic binding then you can use the transient annotation.

8605045
boost	stl
could this be thought of as the c++ stl or possibly boost equivalent for c

8605104
hash	salt
to make it harder for brute force attacks on a hash use a salt and compress the salt data before hashing it

8605116
width	height
if you want to move the div out of visible area or hide it make the width and height 0px

8605167
width	height
i want all the imageview s size in my application to be resized depending on device s screen width and height

8605210
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
all of the above is happening only on safari browser whereas it s working fine as it should on ie opera firefox google-chrome

8605246
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
also when talking about third-party solutions there are a lot of mvc frameworks for php like kohana codeigniter cakephp zend of course .

8605289

so i am new to wcf and i have managed to get a custom servicehostfactory working in wcf and when i put a break point in the createservicehost method and look at the call stack it says it was called by external code

8605300
packets	multicast
keep in mind that firewalls installed on pc can sometime silently kill packets i ve see that under windows especially if you use multicast or loop back addresses

8605310
try-catch	exception-handling
remove the second try-catch to let the exception-handling get caught in your first catch block

8605312
try-catch	exception-handling
let the exception-handling that occurs inside datacontext.savechanges bubble up to your try-catch inside the first section of code

8605320
try-catch	exception-handling
you don t throw the exception-handling so you aren t going to catch it in the try-catch of the first method

8605329
ceylon	kotlin
both kotlin and ceylon supports reified generics so its definitely possible to do so on top of the jvm

8605329
ceylon	kotlin
if scala 2.10 s reification turns out to be more limited than kotlin and ceylon

8605348
try-catch	exception-handling
you shouldn t catch the exception-handling in acceptchanges then and let first try-catch block handle it

8605352
mouse	keyboard
it works if you use keyboard but i ve got problem with the mouse

8605370
post	get
then with each api access require that id to be included in request either in get or post on in the header

entitydatasource	detailsview
i m using detailsview with entitydatasource and binding entitydatasource directly with entity model

8605464

1 if i want to use the application x-www-form-urlencoded request header i need to create a standard post string of so that when php gets it it can put it in the _post associative array

8605470
maven	pom.xml
i think this is more convenient solution because when you add a new xsd you do not need to change maven pom.xml just add a new xjb binding file to the same directory

8605499
vsto	add-in
i have implemented a vsto word add-in when the user install the setup file my add-in control does not appear until adding it from â œcom add-inâ dialog in the word option

8605557
ubuntu	linux
i have no knowledge about ubuntu linux and java environment

8605563
mktime	strtotime	mktime	strftime	strftime	strtotime
the datetime class sure has some handy methods and seems overall superior to the native php date functions like strtotime mktime and strftime and more

8605592
hide	show
i have the code below that grabs some html from an ajax request and then hide one row of a table and show another but even though the var that i create to hold the html quick_edit_html is available after the ajax function has run tested by putting it in an alert box firebug tells me that it does not exist when i try and use it in the next function which is not running until the ajax request is done

8605600
subtract	add
i want to add one to the w3c version instead of subtract one in the ie version to ease my conversion effort

google-chrome	firefox
however the browsers rendering for all google-chrome firefox and ie seems to be inconsistent

8605895
anydac	mydac
update i intend to purchaser anydac unidac mydac the choice of which will be another question

8605898
put	get
the method calls get and put are safe - several threads can try to put at the same time and nothing bad will happen but that doesn t protect you from problems which arise when you call several methods in succession and the state of the map must not change between them

8605902
children	parent
that simply traverses the dom up to the parent element #5 #2 whatever and then back down to all the children the images you want to change

8605923
google-chrome	firefox
those are firefox 5 firefox 9 and google-chrome respectively

8605941
inherited	subclassing
if you wanted to save even more code you could make all the classes you wanted to have this behavior inherited from a common subclassing of nsmanagedobject and then apply this to that common class and all your subclassing would inherited the behavior

8605941
put	get
i ve put in checks to prevent this from being used on classes that already have their own custom implementations of valueforundefinedkey because if someone put that method in their class there s going to be an expectation that it will continue to get called

8605941
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
also note that there may be appkit code that expects the exceptions from the nsobject nsmanagedobject implementations to be thrown

8605949
many-to-many	one-to-many
one-to-one self-referential and bi-directional association is surprisingly a bit more complex that one-to-many or even many-to-many self-referential and bi-directional association

8605975
post	put
and oh ye if i use post instead of put in my edit - the this- data gets set but i cannot save the data

8605992

8605999
getter	setter
no normally not unless you declare the getter and the setter synchronized

8605999
getter	setter
if the setter is being called from one thread and another thread wants to access the getter it has to wait for the other thread to end his task first

8606016
cpu	processors
however what complicates this and does in fact cause a slowdown is processors caches in order for two threads running on different cpus to access the same piece of memory and see each other s changes the cpu caches have to be synchronized which can completely negate the massive speed advantages of these caches if it happens a lot

8606026
freetype	libpng
in some cases you may need to install additional non-python dependencies libpng and freetype through your system s package manager

8606026
freetype	libpng
the other dependencies libpng freetype are system libraries and if you can build matplotlib for python2 you already have them

8606032
width	height
every time i set the width height of the .swf to 100 or auto the movie gets cut off at the top and bottom under the div containers

8606046

8607936
postgresql	mysql
if your database is small enough which it will have to be since the heroku postgresql db is also 5mb and you would prefer to remain on mysql then you could use the cleardb mysql addon - - their entry level db is free and is the same size as the heroku shared postgresql db that you get by default but be careful that the number of connections is limited so don t be going crazy with your web dyno counts

unless you are adding the uinavigationcontroller to another uiviewcontroller that is utilized for a different method of navigation uisplitviewcontroller or uitabbarcontroller i would recommend adding the uinavigationcontroller to your application window in the appdelegate then add the uiviewcontroller that has your view in it

opentype	woff
personally i would recommend placing the svg version first in your css and for browsers that don t recognize this format suggest truetype ttf second then woff then eot for browsers that don t support any of the aforementioned some older versions of ie appear to support opentype exculsively

post	get
do i have to make sure that my post and get variables never conflict in all layers of my view models in this case the company and employee classes

8610660

it might be a good idea to hash the email addresses since there s a big chance that the links might be posted to a forum or similar and the post might then get crawled by an email address crawler

8610660
hash	md5
i think that just a simple hash md5 of the address would almost solve this

8610663

i have tried every conceivable solution and it works fine in ie safari google-chrome and opera but not in firefox 3.6.25 the latest

8610668
int	chars
since you are accessing a string using it would convert the index to an int in that case x would convert to 0 so it would extract the first chars 1

8610681
pbkdf2	hash
a pretty strong hash function would be like this this hash function is a pbkdf2 hash

8610687

google-chrome	firefox
it works like a charm on google-chrome clientwidth is 0 until the image is loaded but on firefox it instantly goes some tiny number in my case 24 instead of 700 so the actual shrinking part happens before the images is loaded so it stays at the same size

8611198
free	malloc
these first couple programs do not use malloc or free i just wanted to see how memory is allocated and de-allocated for standard arrays local to a function

8611213
portrait	landscape
for portrait layouts use the layout-port folder for landscape use layout-land

8611216
munin	cacti
typically for monitoring the server you will want to use a tool like zabbix or cacti or munin

8611219
free	malloc
you shouldn t be allocating such large arrays on the stack use malloc and free to allocate and deallocate the memory on the heap there s no way to get around malloc for such sizes of arrays

8611228

you should also read secure hash and salt for php passwords

rss	feed
im trying to retrieve the rss feed from new.google.com im using working with the top stories feed right now topic h output rss

8611366

do not pass these pointers to free 3 . also you should probably not being doing dir dirname dir as you ve then lost the pointer to the memory allocated by strdup strdup allocated memory should be passed to free

8611368
public	protected
make a protected virtual abstract function returning boost any and a non-virtual non-abstract public template function to hide it from the users of your interface

8611392
google-chrome	firefox
when i use the url address it shows different in the google-chrome firefox and ie 9

8611416
public	protected
one way would be to make a public or protected method that simply returns the array but that could provide too much access

8611429
oncreate	setcontentview
if i don t setup the rest of the code in oncreate past setcontentview i don t have an issue

8611433
free	malloc
i ve created a simple program to help myself understand memory allocation malloc and free

8611449

i m aware this is what it should do given the above however how can i make it concatenate the result of each column into one result whilst also only including de.projectcode when the result it not null this can be chars or int values

8611453
post	get
i have read the many post out there regarding what to do for this error and as far as i can tell i have the correct web.config values but i still get the error

8611454
hide	show
update orders return true or false it show or hide edit button depending on that condition only

8611461
post	get
it should effectively work like a post as it is an ajax call just make sure the backend can receive the get variables

8611491
interpolation	splines
what is the r equivalent of the simple matlab cubic splines interpolation in 2d space shown here

8611496
floating-point	integer
in other words sqrt returns a floating-point number while truncate returns an integer

8611508
projectile	angle
i ve seen a few examples that move a projectile in an arc from point a to point b but what i need is for the cannonball to first move along the axis of the cannon itself it s no good if the ball leaves the end of the cannon at a different angle to which the cannon is pointing

8611510
post	get
i can t post everything on here though here should give some in site what i did to get this to work

8611522

8611588
google-chrome	safari
also my other issue is that when users click on links in google-chrome and safari they turn white.

8611686
uiview	subviews
i ve also tried setting all the uiview s backgrounds by iterating through the subviews but to no avail

8611723
width	height
loadfromdata expects the buffer you are passing to have all the necessary information about the image...including its width and height

8611723
int	chars
in fact i m surprised that line compiled as written...because loadfromdata expects a chars for it s specification of the format and you re passing an int

8611723
width	height
if what you have is a raw byte array of data and know the width and height from some other source you probably want to use the appropriate qimage constructor for that

8611759
ant	maven
i m trying to build a new web app using eclipse i want to use spring web services and hibernate so i thought i d try using maven instead of ant so i don t have to track down all the jar files manually

8611759
getter	setter
for example i can t generate getter setter or use the refactoring tool to rename eclipse gives me an error like the resource is not in the build path of a java project

8611759
maven	pom.xml
now i want to add the spring libraries as a maven dependency and be able to build the project with maven so i figure i need a pom.xml file

8611759
maven	pom.xml
doesn t not seem to help me create a maven pom.xml file and i figure if i just create the file manually that probably won t work

8611771
ant	maven
my guess is that maven isn t mapping environment variables into system properties which is what ant is expecting with isset

8611772
width	height
but i expect you can just drawsquare x y width height color

8611784
width	height
why does this animation result in the window moving across left to right in the original position first then jumping to the other position even though i set the width and height properties before the animation started

8611784
width	height
it seems to reset the height value when it starts to show the width and then changes it back when doing the second animation

8611790
maven	m2e
in any case make sure you re using the latest version of eclipse indigo 3.7.1 m2e the latest and best version formerly known as m2e and the maven integration for wtp from the eclipse marketplace

8611811
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
for the second approach you need the m2e plugin to add maven support and auto creation of pom.xml file if there isn t any

8611825
jboss	glassfish
that are at least tomcat 6 glassfish 2 jboss 4.1 etcetera

8611825
versioning	upgrade
if you can t upgrade tomcat then you d need to downgrade spring to a servlet 2.4 compatible versioning

8611839
int	chars
the reason why won t do what you want is because a will simply hold the int value that represents a specific chars

8611845
int	chars
chars are just int so you can actually do a straight comparison of your chars against literals

8611905
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation is suppose to replace shark and opengl profiling comes preinstalled with xcode

8611915
hash	salt
also if you re storing passwords you should hash them up and salt them up and store the hash passwords

8611973
put	get
if i put that on i get this

8611988
accessor	properties
you should be able to view an edit all properties such as strings or boolean values as long as those properties are public and have a get set accessor

8612077

then i need to get the response of the post in html

8612102

if that was the exact phrasing of the question i would ask a clarifying question probably expected - following arkadiy s comment - server-side client-side or both

8612137
idictionary	icollection
instead of looking for the sortedlist as the type you can also look for interfaces such as idictionary icollection which sortedlist derives from

8612171
margin	height
then give the middle column a margin to the left and fit it in the middle and give it a height

8612184
versioning	upgrade
also should i wait for heroku to upgrade the node versioning

8612196
post	get
it works but the problem is i don t know how to get the post featured image there instead

8612197
pop-up	dialog
vsto is always gonna take its time the best tip i can share with you is disable sheet refresh when you populate data one way to do this is pop-up a modal progress dialog box and refresh your sheet in background this will give you 50-70 better performance

8612244
hide	show
then just show hide them so i will have static references to all controllers with getcontroller in application

8612245
rss	feed
if you don t feel like parsing the xml in your code you can try the touchrss which i used to parse the youtube rss feed

8612245
rss	feed
the rss feed version should be in version 2 so the url you provide should change to alt rss v 2

8612265
uiview	subviews
i defined a uiview object as a subviews when i change the subview.bounds.size.height the subview.frame.origin.y changed is there something wrong in my code

8612266
gdi	directwrite
i already know that sub-pixel positioning causes directwrite text rendering to be blurry compared to gdi

8612266
gdi	directwrite
however my question is a bit more fundamental why can t directwrite and related methods be made to render text as sharply as gdi

8612266
gdi	directwrite
what prevents directwrite from being able to snap text to the nearest pixel the way gdi can

8612266
gdi	direct2d
direct2d classic gdi

8612266
gdi	direct2d
direct2d natural gdi

8612275
mdpi	hdpi

8612353
put	get
i hope you get my point if need any more clarification from my requirement i can edit my question just put a comment below

8612364
post	get
is it possible to make get post requests in java or another language such that you don t care about what is returned

8612379
ivar	subclassing
another option is in your uilabel subclassing you create an ivar to store the pattern image and you archived the ivar

8612379
ivar	subclassing
when you unarchive your uilabel subclassing you recreate the pattern image with the image ivar

8612384
move	drag
in our mobile application the requirement in line chart is that when user tap and drag on line it should display update respective marker values on a slider kind of control which move on top of line chart along with user s finger

8612384
move	drag
how can i keep track of line chart marker values when user move drag his finger on a line in line chart

8612410
google-chrome	firefox
it will work in pretty much any version of firefox or google-chrome

8612441

the site-packages folder which is the folder in your python installation directory which contains pre-installed modules like say django etc

8612442
width	height
fill parent values for layout width and height

8612459
hide	show
you could show hide sections like this or toggle between two different versions of content with something like this

8612479
int	chars
regarding the + 0 since n 10 produces an int result and in putchar you are printing a chars you need to convert the int to a chars

8612496
post	put
the blog post applies to unity but its pretty much the same for ninject implement a dependancy resolver to wrap ninject and put it into the global.ascx file

8612529

8612532

8612546

im new to mvcs and im starting to get the hang of them but one thing im unsure about is if 1 controller is suppose to load a entire profile that has multiple components i.e a notification beacon a friend feed a list of friends that displays thumbnails a place to post statuses ect... for the purposes of this post assume im asking if alll the loading for a entire facebook profile should be done in one controller

8612622
google-chrome	firefox
i am pretty new to geb myself and if memory serves i had some weird errors trying to use the google-chrome driver so i fell back to the firefox driver which worked immediately

8612638
margin	height
this works great for fixed margin between icon circle and label rectangle but for height maintenance linearlayout is not much usable as icon overlaps above icons label area

8612660
ssl	https
actually https proxy can be used to tunnel any traffic not necessarily ssl

8612693
client-side	server-side
existingvalues exists on the client-side the users browser so you would need to pass it to the server-side somehow

8612707
sorting	filtering
on the up side you get all the sorting and filtering power of a database anything you ll need like and sqlite is fast easily enough to store game data in and very possibly faster than your own code

8612730
children	parent
i m looking for a way to configure nhibernate so that orphan children entities are deleted automatically but if a parent is deleted and a child exists a delete query on the parent is executed but not for the children

8612730
children	parent
the all-delete-orphan doesn t work for me because it deletes the children automatically when the parent is deleted

8612730
children	parent
when i explicitly delete the parent i don t want the children deleted

8612740
bitblt	gdi	gdi	stretchblt	stretchblt	bitblt

getter	setter
i ve created several private properties rank displayname and score and change them from withing the documentclass with the getter and setter in mcleaderboarditem

8612818
textview	imageview
a viewgroup has every bit as much reason to inherit from a view as a textview and imageview or .

8612840
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this with firefox as well as google-chrome and it is working fine in both cases

8612963
hide	show
i am trying to animate a div what i need is when click a button i want to hide a div and show another div that is next child

8612973
equals	gethashcode
i came to this site searching for object comparison in dictionary and i came to know that overriding gethashcode and equals are a must for doing object comparison in c#

8612982
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing should still be able to use its superclass s initialization methods and return its own type instead of the super type and returning id allows it to do that

8613017
post	get
unlike what a lot of people are saying online you do not do a get curl call but you still do a post call

8613017
post	get
every time i went to the url in a browser it was fine and every time i tried to run a get curl command or a post command where all the variables were still in the url and not specified in postfields it failed

8613032
post	get
my suspicion is that your signature isn t getting generated correctly - frequently when people have oauth signature 401 errors when moving from get to post it s because the signature isn t getting generated correctly

8613032
put	get
if you put the specific variables for your call into the form you should get an identical signature - if you don t it means your signature is getting generated incorrectly

8613035
dictionary	map
i was thinking that map could store the function in a dictionary of type and then call could do the casting to the appropriate type but i m unable to get that to work

8613037
carrierwave	fog
backend carrierwave + fog to store on amazon s3

8613038
hash	md5
better hash functions md5 are slower

8613057
mp4	h.264
if it s still not working here s what may certainly be a solution encode the mp4 with compression format h.264

8613079
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine when opened in google-chrome but not working well in firefox 3.6

8613100
inherited	properties
viewgroup inherited properties of views and does more with other views and viewgroup

8613103

8613170
x86	64bit
i am working with 64bit windows 7 but compiled for x86 detours 3.0

8613191
free	malloc
here s a small example of how you would allocate malloc and deallocate free a dynamic struct myelement array in a struct myarray

8613326

to show the loading icon i ve created an updateprogress control client id m_c_upr i ve written following javascript code that show hide loading icon on every asynchronous post back

8613328
folder	directory
when i building my war file using ant tool the particular properties file wasn t pack inside web-inf classes folder and it was right under the root directory of the war file if you unwar it

8613344
implements	extends
also recommend that you implements runnable interface rather than extends the thread class to create your worker class

8613351
free	malloc
you need to use malloc and free functions to dynamically allocate and free the memory

8613351
free	malloc
for every malloc there should be a free

8613356
equals	compareto
because objects that are different may share the same hash-code just comparing the hash-code is not a replacement for equals or or compareto

8613356
equals	gethashcode
this will only work if manager has a valid equals and gethashcode implementation

8613412
hide	show
my second question is that when i click on the same button or anywhere else on the view then the popover should get hide and if i click on another menu button popover should get hide from previous button and should be show on other button.

8613415
equals	gethashcode
when you override equals you should also override gethashcode this is used when you put your instances in a dictionary to calculate the bucket

8623047
min	max
i would like to aggregate data by grouping on id and taking either the max or the min

8623049
keydown	keyup
the current structure of your loop function means that if it worked only one sound would be played at a time so why are you keeping track of which keys are pressed simultaneously with the keyup and keydown handlers

8623049
keydown	keyup
you could probably just use keyup to stop all sounds and then in keydown start the sound that goes with whatever key was just pressed - i m assuming your intention is for the sound to keep going only as long as the key is held down

8623058
min	max
i can set max date and min date programmatically using this link

8623058

8623117
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
whereas in google-chrome firefox and opera it looks fine

8623120
for-loop	arrays
by then the arrays index has advanced to the end of your for-loop thus it points off the end of the arrays to an undefined value

8623164
google-chrome	firefox
if the code is a short snippet then as yoshi has pointed out earlier - modern browsers like google-chrome and firefox with firebug my favorite allow you directly run js snippets on the browser javascript console

8623303
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the speciï ed size

8623303
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise ifptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undeï ned

8623303
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
note that in your case the pointer being passed to realloc is not null ans also was not received by calling calloc malloc or realloc which breaks the requirements mandated by the standard hence the undefined behavior

8623304
width	height
that s cuz the layout height and width take integer values

8623304
width	height
so in a way it s possible to do what you re trying to but only with weight and not with height or width

fadein	fadeout
you cannot have one object fadeout and fadein at the same time - the object can only have one state at a time it s either fading in or fading out but not both

8623850
fadein	fadeout
if you re willing to do them sequentially so the old dialog fades out and then the new one fades in the two fades are one after the another rather than at the same time then you can use the type of code that vitaly proposed where you do the fadeout and then in the completion function for that fadeout you change the contents of the dialog and then do a fadein

8623850
fadein	fadeout
if you had reasons to only want one dialog and want the simultaneous fades then you could fadeout one block of content in the dialog and fadein another block of content

8625061
put	get
if that does not work put the location.href in a callback function of the ajax call so it will load a new page after you get a response from the server so you can be certain that the data has been sent

8625062
put	get
how can i put them into an asynctask in order to get a progress bar until the images download

8625110
hash-function	rabin-karp
cryptographic hash-function bloom filters data fingerprinting the rabin-karp substring-search algorithm should i go on

8625125
put	get
simply put it won t get in your way

8625125
backbone.js	sammy.js
you may consider using backbone.js sammy.js or spine if you find your communication between the server client getting too hard to manage or your client side behavior getting very complex

8625126
graphics2d	jcomponent
rectangle implements the shape interface and can be painted directly with a graphics2d object -- and this is passed into the jcomponent s paintcomponent method and also the paint method but i don t recommend that you use this

8625144
xstream	jackson
this is the code and i use restlet extension json xml jackson xstream

8625144
xstream	jackson
and i try to remove jackson extension in my local machine it will output as version 1 so i guess version 1 is using xstream extension and version 2 is using jackson extension but why restlet use different extension to handle same method output

8625200
onresume	onpause
you will have to implement onpause and onresume for it to work reliably

8625207
jar	war
can you check if the spring-web jar is inside the war you have created

integer	unsigned
a bit-ï eld is interpreted as a signed or unsigned integer type consisting of the speciï ed

8625234
google-chrome	firefox
we spent lot of hours doing trial and error but this will work 100 for ie 7 8 9 and firefox and google-chrome

8625264
int	double
you are using bit field for double which is an error.you should use int instead

8625352
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to make sense out of the executable code that gcc 4.4.3 is generating for an x86_64 machine running under ubuntu linux

8625381
for-loop	arrays
use a normal for-loop to iterate over an arrays

8625387
getter	setter
also it s not generally a good practice to leave public the properties a better approach is to make the property private and create some methods to access it it s call getter and setter example

8625387
getter	setter
using getter and setter you have a better control over the data to be noted that in your example the setter won t be needed

8625408
folder	directory
what i want is if i click on file name column i want the parent folder always on top then ascending descending folder names and then ascending descending file names and if i click on file type i want directory to remain untouched and then i want normal files in ascending descending order by their size

8625428
g++	gcc
here s a comparison the size of a binary produced by g++ for your code on linux using gcc 4.6.1

8625428
g++	gcc
the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger

8625431
int	double
you d probably want to replace the casting of double to int with a union since the former violates strict aliasing although even use of a union to access something different than what is stored is technically illegal

8625443
stdout	stderr
i ve spent a lot of time researching various ways to read stdout one with asynchronous reads and listening for events and the other method was with separate threads polling stdout and stderr and raising events to the ui thread which is updating the textbox

8625510
codeigniter	kohana
i am trying to re-write a pet project from codeigniter 2.x to kohana 3.2.x

8625577

how do i install thin and eventmachine i guess only on heroku and keep webrick for all my localhost needs

8625648
folder	directory
i have the linx setup script and the main android.mk file in the top directory and then we have the source files in separate folder and the include files in the include folder

8625690
min	max
this will give you 1000 random integers between min and max including min but not including max

8625703
accessor	properties
i tried to see the value of but i think it is magic accessor __get and __set so i could not see the value of this properties before calling that method

8625724
width	height
you have to hard code your width height in an inline style

8625724
width	height
the reason is it uses the width height to create the other elements within the map

8625729
ring	counterclockwise
for exterior ring this means that the ring is defined in counterclockwise order

8625751
openfire	ejabberd
as far as i can tell openfire and ejabberd are the most popular choices but i m concerned they won t scale well on ec2 instances

8625785
setinterval	settimeout
basically if you run typeof on the first parameter of whatever you re passing to settimeout or setinterval it should return function

8625797
versioning	upgrade
upgradeclrheader upgrade the clr header versioning to 2.5

8625802

hash md5 sha1 sha128 sha256

8625818
swt	swing
ibm built swt as a native-peer based competitor to swing

8625930
getter	setter
the one structural change this approach requires from the code you posted is that it requires a same-named property or equivalent getter setter methods to be defined in the base class

8625930
getter	setter
again the catch minor difference is that in order for this to work the base class must define a property of the same name or equivalent getter setter methods

8625941
typedef	struct
by the way in c++ you don t need the typedef trick for struct s

8625957
width	height
as far as i know they both offer you the same information one as a rectangle with his width and height and the other just the origin point

8625961
stdout	stderr
most likely you will see that only stdin stdout and stderr descriptors 0 1 and 2 are open but if you see your socket descriptors open i would try setting f 2 and see if that helps

8625997
uninstall	upgrade
you ll probably also would like to have an undeployment solution so you can uninstall it and upgrade it in the future

8626012
jwindow	jdialog
both jwindow and jdialog have a getrootpane method

8626065
16-bit	64bit
as you can tell the code fails miserably on a system with 16-bit int but works fine with ints of 32 or 64bit

8626104
width	height
a nice to have feature would be that it aims to a specific given width height ratio but it s not mandatory

8626185
hash	salt
storing the information in a file with a strange filename together with a hash algorithm + salt is also a possibility

8626186
grizzly	netty
netty apache mina grizzly immediately come to mind

8626281
hash	md5
there are different types of hash i would suggest not to use md5 especially if your password is not very complex

8626281
hash	md5
sites like this hold databases of md5 hash so your hash could easily be cracked

8626285
wordpress	phpbb
i m using wordpress and phpbb this time

internationalization	localization
internationalization i18n localization l10n standards and amusements - also known as i18nguy the web site where you can find more links tutorials and stuff

8626330
int	boolean	int	double
since all of the relevant variables are int double strings or boolean as a last resort i can switch on the type and use the corresponding totype method but i bet there is a more elegant solution

8626354
equals	compareto
ofc you need to implement equals and hashcode so that class behaves consistently in each set implementation but for treeset this should work as is since treeset relies on compareto method while performing add remove or contains operations instead of equals like hashset

8626411
docx	xlsx
i m building an application that needs to programmatically extract all embedded files images and text from docx xlsx and pptx files

8626411
docx	xlsx
like i mentioned i need to extract all embedded files images and text from docx xlsx and pptx files

also is it possible that the packets i send are going further than just my router even though they are addressed to a host in the same subnet

8626606
udp	tcp
i understand that udp can be used as well and i will also be making a solution using it but i want tcp to work first

8626606
subnet	packets
i am testing on my local subnet bouncing all packets through my router which should have a throughput of 54 mbps

8626618
getter	setter
classes that don t cause problems that throw return useful errors that provide genuinely useful methods that you can call to get things done vs lots of getter and setter

8626653
put	get
in my custom module i have managed to get the node id which the user wants and i now want to get the url of each node to put into my email

tabcontrol	tabitem
for a tabcontrol addeditems should normally have a length of 1 and the single element should be an instance of headeredcontentcontrol the tabitem

8627212
children	parent
afik java stores the object as object-graphs graphs of objects where the parent object has the subobjects as its children for garbage collection

8627258
mouseover	mouseout
it works fine on the mouseover event but it fails on the mouseout any ideas

8627270
int	chars
since filename is declared as an array of one wchar you would think that only one chars would be copied but the compiler pads the struct to be an extra two bytes long so that its length is an int multiple of the size of an int which is why a second wchar is copied as well

8627324
hash	md5
if you want an extra long or seemingly more random id you can sha1 or md5 the uniqid to create a hash

8627325

an approach that i have used is to create background images to represent all display-text and then use css to hide the actual text and show only the image

8627569
client-side	server-side
the iframes consist of both client-side rendering only pages server-side rendering only pages including static html and mixed

8627602
width	height
but the thing i am interested to get is points each n pixels during the statement period as x0 y0 0 0 and x1 y1 width height and that is the problem

8627602
width	height
so in my case there just two added points which are connected by polygon but what about all the rest points which stay between these points x0 y0 0 0 and x1 y1 width height

8627625

is it possible to make such a declaration that my function would accept variable of type int bool or chars and can output these data types

8627628
children	parent
the node has children and a parent all other nodes

8627646
int	chars
might be an overkill for int chars bool but useful for more complex class types

right-click on the custom actions menu and in the pop-up dialog select the new installer dll

8627741
prepare	execute
for sqlite with the methods that work with bind_params or you can use named placeholders name for both postgresql and sqlite if you re happy using the longer prepare bind_param execute fetch sequence of methods and you ll have to be careful if you use postgresql arrays in your queries

8627774
int	double
i don t understand why subtracting an int from a double would cause such a result

8627823
inherited	properties
alternatively if your entities inherited from a common interface you can override the savechanges method on the dbcontext and set or update properties at that point great for created date and last changed date

8628015
phong	shading
i ve cast rays that have hit the spheres in my scene applied phong shading to them and it looks normal

8628112
google-chrome	firefox
look at it in ie9 or google-chrome then in firefox to see what i mean

8628116
inherited	subclassing
the __construct function is not inherited to subclassing so there is no reason for to be set in the second child class

8628118
integer	radix
if the elements in the actual code are integers you can use a special-purpose integer sorting algorithm such as radix sort for an overall o max s t time complexity though if the bags are small the built-in array.sort will likely run faster than a custom integer sort

8628130
hide	show
and show hide left right button if inner-container is left 0 else..

8628162
for-loop	loops
each iteration of loops has another inner for-loop

8628442
children	parent
what i want to do is associate certain users with another user where one user is the parent of the other children users

8628442
children	parent
think parental controls - there is one parent that has an account and then all of their children are associated with the parent account

8628442
children	parent
the parent account then has a special parent role which gives them parental control or administrative rights over their children

8628442
children	parent
the first solution i thought of was to embed the children in the parent account

x86	64bit
i ve installed both python 3.2.2 for x64 and python 2.7 for x86 on my 64bit windows machine

8631264
google-chrome	safari
looks like it not really directly related to xfbml rendering but to some character in one of filenames passed to onload function which prevents fb.xfbml for loading on page and this is why any xfmbl tags not rendered at all wired it happens only on google-chrome chromium but not of safari tested both

8631277
fgets	strtok
i m thinking use fgets to read each line and then use strtok to get info through and pass to struct

8631301
put	get
to make it short you can carefully put the following code or an improved version of it into some kind of on click event and get the real-time info into a log or a toast message

8631303
mouseover	mouseout
i created this script for scrolling up with jquery but when you mouseover and mouseout multiple times the script goes into the loop until it finishes for every time you mouse over it

8631314
srp	principles
indeed this breaks srp single responsibility principles because adding and reading are two actions so two responsibilities

8631317
slideup	slidedown
you need to add stop before each animation slideup and slidedown

8631367
range	min
the min timestamp in the above grabs the first timestamp in the range - i want to grab the first timestamp regardless of range

8631378

i thought about using md5 sums for the original file because they can be generated quickly but when i update exif information sometimes the timezone is off it changes the sum and the hash changes

8631378
hash	md5
maybe there s a way to create an md5 hash of the image excluding the exif part i believe it s written at the beginning of the file

8631425
class-method	eigenclass
with instance_eval you actually define class-method - it s as if you were inside the body of the singleton eigenclass class of the given object nota bene that classes are objects too in ruby

8631462
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox ie8

8631478
keydown	keyup
in that case use keydown or keyup events to show the dropdown instead

8631489
post	get
you want to use get not post

8631490
post	get
http post headers only get send when using a form alternatively you can use an ajax load to post the variables to another document

8631490
post	get
however i suggest using get and not post as this is easier to maintain in such a simple application

8631537

in python you could use image.tostring to compute the md5 hash for the image data only without the metadata

8631617
keydown	keyup
not that you cant handle the same using keydown and keyup you can but more code

8631644

hash	md5
in python given a really large file 700mb how can i create an md5 hash only from the last 4096kb of that file

8631757
oncreate	setcontentview
you can keep the variable declaration but move the search part into oncreate after you call setcontentview for example like this

8631757
oncreate	findviewbyid
i d suggest moving these two blocks into oncreate as well after the findviewbyid calls

8631831
exif	jfif
strictly speaking the jfif and exif standards are incompatible because they each specify that their marker segment app0 or app1 respectively appears first

8631831
exif	jfif
in practice most jpeg files contain a jfif marker segment that precedes the exif header

8631831
exif	jfif
this allows older readers to correctly handle the older format jfif segment while newer readers also decode the following exif segment being less strict about requiring it to appear first

8631897
strcpy	strncpy
ive looked at many ways like using strncpy and strcpy but found no way yet

8631969

during deserialization the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class

8632250
width	height
i ve added a negative margins to compensat for the box height and border width

8632255

8632262
google-chrome	firefox
below is a snapshot of a project as it appears in ie9 and below that in google-chrome it looks the same in firefox as well

i m trying to code a program which will watch a directory disk and move deleted files folder to recycle bin when they are deleted from network shared folder

8632365
rss	feed
and cause there are many different rss standards and not every standard force the feed to contain its own url its not possible to select a field in the feed that will return the url in every case

8632387
keydown	keyup
the trick is to use the winapi functions called postmessage to send up keydown or keyup message to the process which does the same thing

8632388
for-loop	loops
if you want to code a loops where each iteration is spaced out by 10 seconds rather than using a conventional for-loop you write a function that uses settimeout to call itself

8632401
springboard	tweak
i m currently working on a rewrite of a tweak runs inside springboard itself and so of cause smoothness speed and efficiency are some of the most important things for me as even the slightest bit of unnecessary lag will take away from the ux

8632470
move	drag
additionally you need to manually perform a connector.update while your dnd components are being dragged in your drag listener for the connection to move with the endpoint while you are dragging

8632513
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade mysql connector net 6.0.4.0 to versioning 6.4.4.0

8632560
range	min	range	max	min	max
if i would use rnd.next min max then the result would be in range and that s because random.next method int32 int32 returns a 32-bit signed integer greater than or equal to minvalue and less than maxvalue

8632560
range	min	range	max	min	max
and last thing if you re using rnd.nextdouble method and you have to generate huge amount of random numbers within a range min max and you re doing it in a loop you might want to consider taking max_value - min_value out of the loop or embedded loops

8632599
public	protected
object.clone which is protected with a public method

8632681
width	height
the model never threw an error until i tried to access the width height attributes

8638061
mockito	scalamock
i was going to answer this with a suggestion that you should try scalamock instead of mockito because i wrongly assumed that the problem you were having was caused by mockito not really understanding scala whereas scalamock has been created in scala from the ground up

8638068
thin	webrick
from there i use option 2 above but i type script rails server thin in the terminal so that it starts up the thin web server rather than the default of webrick

8638101
client-side	server-side
if you don t want to keep the information in either then you want to use session_destroy to destroy the session info on the server-side and setcookie to manually unset the session id cookie on the client-side

8638101
client-side	server-side
session_destroy alone won t remove the client-side cookie so the next time the user visits they ll still have the same session id set but their server-side session info will have been destroyed

8638147
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.2+ versions do not support afaik because there is some security issue if the file input is hidden google-chrome and ie support that i guess

note that for a dialog to pop-up you will need some additional javascript but if you are already using dialog that should not be that hard just use the output of the php script

8638230
switching	screens
if you want to adjust the rendering resolution switching the screens resolution and let the display do the proper scaling

8638284
put	get
edit what i mean by changes to the website is that i get these things called shares and tickets for information that i put on the website

8638326
fadein	fadeout
i managed to get around using if else logic about what is visible by just blanketing the script with fadein and fadeout so jquery will decide for itself what is visible maybe this is a problem

8638327
children	parent
i am trying to check a max-heap to see whether a parent has children or not

the types are general string dates longs int boolean

8638454
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller will display the title of the uiviewcontroller it s currently displaying that is why you are not able to set it directly

8638454

usually the uitabbarcontroller is the root viewcontroller and if you need uinavigationcontroller they are place inside the tab that need to have navigation capability

8638551
google-chrome	firefox
are the major modern browsers google-chrome firefox ie etc. consistent in the order of execution or does it vary

allocating mem with malloc calloc etc..

8638902
gam	mgcv
chambers in soda uses the example of the function gam which is found in both the gam and mgcv packages

8638902
gam	mgcv
if two other packages were loaded one of them depending on gam and one depending on mgcv the function found by calls to gam would depend on the order in which they those two packages were attached

8638909
children	parent
second question is i allow users to create their own menus categories with parent and children categories for example

8638909
children	parent
i call a function within the loop to get the children categories by parent id

8638984
post	get
i could do it with get but i would rather use post as it looks cleaner

8638987
put	get
this is the correct long lat pair but when i try to put the individual longitude or latitude i get the following output from alert longitude

8638997
spaces	delimiter
docs for that and a spaces as delimiter

8639008
width	height
but if you re going to save attributes of the files that have to do with what kind of file they are frame rate of a video file height and width of an image file author of a pdf for example then you will also need some ancillary tables to store that information

8639015
post	put
it would be better to have an author class and thusnan author property in the post class and put the url and image properties in the author class indeed

8639026
puts	gets
it is needed to use scanf gets and puts

8639029
jboss	glassfish
if you want to deploy your app on jboss application server instead of glassfish you should first download it from official site and install

8639079
width	margin
as long as you specify any width you can center by adding margin auto

8639101

the main gui in p2 starts and stops the variable on the oncreate ondestroy for all views in my app

8639229
solaris	bsd
and of course linux bsd and solaris

8639239

so there s a pthreads implementation on linux on bsd on solaris etc. and while the interface the header files and the meaning of the calls is the same the implementation of each is different

8639247
x86	64bit
assemblies compiled with x86 will run i wow64 on 64bit systems but assemblies copiled with anycpu will run natively regardless of ngen

8639247
x86	64bit
assemblies compiled for x86 can load 32-bit assemblies on 64bit systems and code compiled for anycpu will not load 32-bit dlls

8639256

you can do get and post requests with jquery .ajax

8639263
nstableview	nsviewcontroller
i have a nsviewcontroller managing a nstableview and noticed that nsviewcontroller has a representedobject property however it isn t an iboutlet and i m not able to bound the datasource of nstableview to the representedobject property of nsviewcontroller in interface builder

8639277

8639282
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 8 and google-chrome

8639328
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that when i press the add button to add a new element a dialog pop-up that is empty

8639359
post	put	post	get	put	get
each time we try to construct this related resource we mark the request as a get since we expect it to be matched to a select query rather than an update which matches to put or post

8639416
libstdc++	libc++
the alternative is to use libc++ instead of libstdc++

8639446
children	parent
this can be done with javascript however which can even give you the ability to select other elements with no immediate relationship parent children or adjacent siblings

8639457
width	height
p.s. i m trying to capture snapshot of a web page i just need sizes of the web page as width and height after navigating the page via webkit browser control the rest is easy

8639461
width	height
no need to try and specify height and width for tablerow within tablelayout because it will always be height wrap_content and width match_parent

8639461
width	height
no need to try and specify height and widget for children of tablerow because they will always be height wrap_content and width match_parent

8639470
pull	push
such a bundle is a compressed file that contains what mercurial would normally send over the network in a push or pull operation

8639508

8639547
ubuntu	debian
1 cvs should be installable and should work fine on any version of ubuntu and debian and fedora etc etc

8639633
freebsd	linux
sadly on linux you can t write and read to a popened file at the same time you can on freebsd

8639667

so the point is why do i get a imageview with id r.id.tuxtview2 and a textview with id r.id.imageview1

8639676
mouseover	mouseout
btw .hover provides both mouseover and mouseout

8639704
getter	setter
q what is the chance that a getter setter method will get inlined by the compiler in java

8639704
getter	setter
extra i understand there is always a chance the compiler standard and jit will decide to make a method inline and when it comes to getter and setter this is usually what the programmer wants

8639705
postgresql	mysql
this is the syntax for mysql and postgresql but the exact syntax may vary depending on which database you are using

8639715
put	get
when i try and put the following code into my onreceive method i get errors that the action cannot be resolved to a variable

8639718
inherited	properties
the return properties from the base class would be the interface and this wouldn t necessarily need to be overridden in the inherited class

8639731
range	max
you random range is out the max integer is the result of count and remember the count of an array is one higher than its highest index in an ordinal 0-based array and your code looks far too verbose

8639744
getter	setter
as of the jit yes it will probably inline either sooner or later.depending on how heavily the code is used so a function call overhead may be seen at first but when the getter setter has been called sufficiently often then it is inlined

8639771
switching	screens
the problem is that at the end of an edit update action set the action type on screens gets stuck in update mode and i can t switching to create mode again

8639796
post	get
should i do this in javascript such that after the page loads i get a list of every post id on the page then ajaxly hit another controller which increments the views counter for all those post

8639843
prepare	execute
next to these probably smaller issues which aren t any for a very good programmer who knows what to do the syntax is actually correct and as long as the code execute like you want it to execute then the syntax is correct for executing a prepare statement

8639869
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
if you synthesize accessor for the properties an ivar will also be created for it if you haven t created one

8639931
ssl	https
this is roughly how ssl https works

8639943
folder	directory
i m pretty new to eclipse and android and i m trying to add some files to the assets folder but certain files and directory are not being included in the .apk file

8639964
sorting	grouping
you can set up grouping before you start a trace that including some sorting but they re a bit klunky

8639976
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
or not in viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear

8639982
folder	directory
we used to register dlls to an application directory located in c and not within the source code folder and we referenced them from there and grabbed them from that directory for the install package

8640011
onresume	onpause
when the device goes into sleep mode and is waken up the activity only goes through the onpause and onresume cycle

8640116
quicksort	heapsort
well there is the selection sort insertion sort merge sort quicksort heapsort etc

8640117
min	max
i have this code about binary search tree i want calculated efficancy for insert delete and find max and min value in bst

8640117
put	get
i have this delete code and want modify it be suitable for my insert code but i can not get out put

8640172
children	parent
it works if i set a defined width but as one of the children divs needs to have a variable width i simply want the parent div to just stretch to fit the children divs

8640211
abstract-class	superclass
it can t return an instance of the superclass ability since that s an abstract-class

8640236
mouse	keyboard
considering that all inter-windows communications are through windows messaging keyboard events mouse events pretty much all events you can imagine there isn t a lower level way to access the keyboard events unless you write your own keyboard driver that i know of

8640238
superclass	subclassing
the vectors can be of either type superclass or type subclassing and i want the addall methods to support both

8640255
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
one approach would be to use a dataoutputstream and it s writeint method wrapped around a bytearrayoutputstream

8640295
memcpy	memset
you mention they memcpy which i assume you refer to memcpy but all i see is a bunch of memset 0

8640295
memcpy	strcpy
the proper way to copy strings is using strcpy or strcpy_s on windows the difference is memcpy is faster and used in other situations such as pointers buffer management

8640311
calloc	malloc
it would call malloc and calloc twice is that bad

8640363
archetypes	dexterity
just use the plone.uuid support instead the broken-out archetypes uid functionality which is a dependency for dexterity 1.1 and up

8640397
free	malloc
running such application under valgrind doubly so valgrind will not be able to intercept malloc free calls and will effectively catch only uninitialized memory reads and not heap buffer overflows or other heap corruption bugs that it is usually good at

8640404
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome you should have a modal popup appear that says the username is not available

8640444
spaces	delimiter
however - when possible - it s usually nicer to do it with spaces instead of comma since in many languages the split function will use them as a default delimiter if no arguments are specified

8640499
multiplying	add
for the moving up for example it s just a matter of checking if the spot above the current location is clear and if it is add one to the array and multiplying that by 21 for new position

8640510
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
site works fine in ie firefox safari google-chrome ipad iphone etc

8640548

post	get
see the section called classifier efficiency at the bottom of my post on part of speech tagging with nltk to get an idea of processing speed for different tagging algorithms

8640642
g++	gcc
note that i use -lstdc++ to link the c++ module in so that i can use gcc instead of g++

8640642
g++	gcc
i cannot use g++ to link only gcc -- that is why i am doing the -lstdc++ trick above rather than simply linking with g++

8640676
setcontentview	findviewbyid
the reason is that you can t call findviewbyid before you called setcontentview

8640676
setcontentview	findviewbyid
my solution for you just use setcontentview r.layout.register than use findviewbyid r.id.layout_id and finally create and add your button

8640677
width	height
how do you effect a repaint repaint 20l x y width height restricted to changed area being able to collect several changes over time

8640677
graphics2d	bufferedimage
a bufferedimage can be written on get a graphics2d so can draw sprites on it

8640702

8640748
children	parent
i ve got a parent viewmodel with a collection of children and the parent viewmodel has a selectedchild observable

8640751
mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	mp3	speex	flac	asf	flac	ogg	flac	speex	speex	ogg
it supports asf flac m4a monkey s audio mp3 musepack ogg flac ogg speex ogg theora ogg vorbis true audio wavpack and optimfrog audio files

8640753
put	get
the method that i can find out is use a nested for-loop to get all the photos put it into a list and sort it using the id number which implies the time order

8640759
screens	tablet
the only way i can think of is to check the size of the screens to guess if it is a tablet or at least big enough to not ruin the layout and then check the orientation

8640803
hex	binary
i would like to convert a hex string to a binary string

8640832
folder	directory
in my jsf web app in the root directory i have a folder named resources which contains the sub folder images css and js for javascript

8640855
width	margin
if you know what width your main content will be the you can use margin auto

8640892
sorting	filtering
i am using the jquery plugin datatables for sorting filtering paginating large amounts of data from a mysql database using php

8640929
solaris	sunos
both bash and ksh recognize the notation but the basic bourne shell bin sh on solaris 10 sunos 5.10 and earlier i ve not laid hands on solaris 11 does not recognize .

8640962
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
to nest the uitableviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller before put it in a uitabbarcontroller doesn t fix the issue for me.

8641001
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
sqldataadapter is helper class which implicitly uses sqlcommand sqlconnection and sqldatareader

8641029
fast-forward	merge
in your example that s not the case since git indicates that it was a fast-forward merge and then git only applies the commits already present on the branch sequentially

8641038
centos	linux
i ve also verified this on a centos linux box too

8641047
post	get
i changed the method as post but not request not supported then it changed again in to get

8641058
single-quotes	double-quotes
informix treats both single-quotes and double-quotes are string delimiters unless you force it to treat double quotes as marking delimited identifiers by setting the delimident environment variable

8641075
min	max
in this example it would require input with max of 50 char and min of 10

8641087
width	height
is there any plugin which helps to list all images with height and width

8641110
prepare	pdostatement
this means a pdo object in your example has a method prepare which returns a pdostatement object

8641111
pop-up	dialog
this div contains the clickable link that i need to press to pop-up a dialog input form as demonstrated on the jquery ui sample site

8641117
inherited	subclassing
for example in a much bigger project where you need to handle 100 images you could just create a class for animation and subclassing them accordingly and either reference them or inherited them so that your approach is logical and time-saving

8641138
submit	submission
if you cancel the default form submission and then submit it yourself from the callback function of the geocode call it should do the trick

8641138
submit	submission
rather than handling the click of the button handle the submit event of the form making sure to return false to cancel default submission in this case i m returning the result of the function so make sure the function returns false

8641147
portrait	landscape
i have designed two layouts for each tab as one for landscape and the other for portrait

8641147
portrait	landscape
currently i am working on with the on restore instance here when the user rotates the app to either landscape from portrait or viceversa the asynchronous task is been called again and the data get loaded from the first process

8641147
portrait	landscape
i tried using the onconfig method in this method when rotating from portrait to landscape the portrait layout is shown in the landscape mode whereas i have designed some changes in landscape layout compared to the portrait one

8641147
portrait	landscape
as i have different layouts for landscape and portrait i am unable to use the onconfig

8641175
vmware	virtualbox
if you do decide to do this make sure you test your gina in a virtual machine you can use virtualbox if you don t want to spend on vmware and take snapshots of it before installing the gina

8641221
google-chrome	safari
i ve tried putting these text onto safari google-chrome browser and ran through the various encoding options but to no avail

if i run the same code for ie every thing is fine i am getting the value of selectedid where as for firefox and google-chrome it is giving values undefine

8641498
bonjour	avahi
avahi and bonjour interact perfectly being two implementations of the same protocol

8641515

to elaborate the for-loop in the second snippet loops through each character in the character arrays until it hits the null terminator

8641670
addclass	removeclass
based on the clarification of your question i think you just need to remove the periods in front of the class name in addclass and removeclass so the code looks like this

8641696
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
when i did sort by title for a set of array values it gives me 3 different results in safari google-chrome and firefox

8641730

this checks if both the width and height of the frame is greater than the maximum set

8641730
width	height
it is however still possible that either the width or height is greater than the maximum set

8641740
post	get
typically the back button will use all of the same get and post variables as was used on the previous locations page load

8641740
put	get
there are two ways to redirect using javascript window.location which will put your previous location into the browser history and therefore the back button will work and location.replace which will not put a link in your history and therefore not allow you to use the back button to get to the previous page

hash	md5
now you use md5 or whatever to hash this answer

8641853
hash	salt
when it comes to using hash one-way encryption it is a good practice to salt your hash

folder	directory	ready	each
i want to be able to keep this wordpress site in subversion and keep the plugins directory updated so that i can eventually do an export when i m ready to move the site to my server but this is proving to be exceptionally difficult i can re-checkout and replace the .svn directory for each of the wordpress folder that are missing them but there are a lot of folder and is very tedious

8646614
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
if for instance you determine that a view has a height of 400dip it will represent 400px in a mdpi screens 300px in a ldpi screens and 600px in a hdpi screens

8646647
textarea	autogrow
it doesn t matter how the new textarea are added to the dom manually or by ajax callback method it is necessary to use jquery selectors to assign the autogrow functionality

8646658
implements	extends
my idea is create an user defined item which extends from customitem for dialog.but it is difficult to code the complete implementation.better u search for any third pary jar file which already implements dialog box

8646687
std	ostream
include the fstream header file and using std ostream

8646707
memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strtok

this works but when i put it inside a div the div doesn t adopt the size of the contents meaning the red color in the example goes over the entire width of the page if the page can contain the whole text and if i get a horizontal scroll-bar it doesn t go over the initial field of vision

8646832
width	height
also the shrink-wrap works if i leave out the height and colunm-with and instead put just a fixed width

8646876

it s pretty simple i take what i get from the server through post and add them to nsstrings or uiimage in the case of the images for use in a uitableview

you should keep range min and perhaps set max 160 and min -5 to make the slider render nicely

8646904

for-loop	loops
if so the expression is either false and then it will go to the next in the for-loop or it is true and it will end up in an infinite loops

to work around this you can create your own custom subclasses that extends path and paint and implements serializable

8647108
min	max
so you get insert delete and look for a specific element in o 1 and max min delete in o n

8647108
min	max
you can also make max min o 1 and delete o n instead

8647108
min	max
if you are keeping your array sorted it will cause insert delete to be o n but you will gain o logn find and o 1 min max

8647108
min	max
you can get o 1 min max any how for both

8647111
poptoviewcontroller	dealloc

post	get
if you use a button submit when you do the click it s going to look for all the elements in the form and send it to the url of the attribute action of the form in the format get or post and that s it s automatic so if you need to send a lot of elements you need to consider of use submit

8648947
post	get
it was doing a get before then suddenly when browse to an action with canvasauthorize permissions extendedpermissions attribute it s doing a post instead of a get

8649343
updatepanel	scriptmanager
what i have already tried is reading updatepanel scriptmanager and scriptmanagerproxy classes codes nothing found

8649343

i know there is an tag for the channel rss feed but how do i get a preview image for each article

8649522

there s nothing wrong with your for-loop but a while loops is the wrong thing to be using here

8649564
chown	chmod	777	tmp
rather than permitting everyone access to all files and folders within tmp chmod 777 -r tmp you may want to consider ensuring that var www episodecalendar staging is recursively chown d chown -r user group var www episodecalendar staging by whatever user requires access to run the web server

pull	push
it allows you to do push pull work from an svn remote but still uses git locally and thus to make local commits without pushing to svn repository

if your assets folder is changing a lot and it would be a pain to manually update the list you could probably put a script into your build process than would make this directory listing file automatically for you on build

8649944
mouseover	mouseout
one kind-of-hackish solution would be to create named functions to pass to hoverintent for the mouseover and mouseout behaviors instead of anonymous inline functions as i m doing now

8649992
google-chrome	firefox
but i only tested in ie7 + and it works in 3.6+ firefox and google-chrome

it s called by a jsf page that uses getposts to fill a datatable and a form to insert the post posttext is another property that has getter and setter

8650004

mine s customizing the serializable behavior instead of deserialization but you can implement your own code in the deserialize method to do that

8650054
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t work in the firefox or google-chrome console it did work in ff3.x

8650087
width	height
you can also finagle html block elements to look like triangles by giving them a width and height of zero and applying special border properties to three of the element s sides

8650088

my news.java file contains only field declarations no getter or setter

8650142
mouse	keyboard
it supports windowless rendering so there s no window handle to take focus which means it s not going to accept any keyboard or mouse input unless you manually direct them its way

jboss	glassfish
hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto for hibernate as used in jboss and eclipselink.ddl-generation for eclipselink as used in glassfish

8650207
setinterval	settimeout
i have a problem with javascript functions settimeout and setinterval functions

8650541
put	get
edit by the way if you put the items in the list in reverse and then sort it you get

8650546
int	chars	getchar	fgetc
the getchar getc and fgetc functions or macros return an int not a chars

8650546
for-loop	loops
you can use a while loops or a for-loop but you don t need both

8650562

i donâ t think you need to make the setter and getter synchronized since they should only be accessed from edt

8650596
width	height
i ve got a situation where i would like to be able to know a jframe s height and width as the user drags their mouse to resize the frame

8650596

8650596
implements	extends
this is a code excerpt from my hsframe class extends jframe implements mousemotionlistener

8650596
width	height
the height width x and y values all repaint perfectly

8650596
width	height
in the canvaspanel class itself i extended componentlistener and added a listener to an hsframe object there--it does not update in real-time which was fine but it does repaint the height and width after the mouse is released regardless of which corner the hsframe was resized with

8650622
uwsgi	cherokee
i am running web2py 1.99.4 on debian 6.0 sqlite 3.7.3 cherokee 1.2.101 uwsgi 0.9.9.3

8650771
disk	ram
actually prefer ram not disk since it s temporary for a period anyway and recreating it only costs much time

8650773
getter	setter
apparently one interesting side effect pardon the pun of the way that f# handles the syntactical sugar of properties as opposed to the c# way is that the getter and setter of a property may return accept different types

8650804
content-length	content-type
it issues an http command like get image.jpg and receives an http response whose content-type is something like image jpg whose content-length is the number of bytes in the image and whose body is the raw binary image data itself

8650804
put	get
writing restful resources has trained me to expect symmetry between http get and put so that for example a url that delivers json data when i do a get will then accept json data when it is presented with a put

8650804
put	get	content-length	content-type
in both cases there is simply a content-length giving the number of bytes in the payload a content-type header declaring that the payload is json in some character set and then the character data sits alone and unadorned as the body of the get or put

8650804
put	get
i had expected that i could design a restful interface for this that supports symmetric get and put â so that put commands involve no special encoding nor involve any idea of a character set but simply have a content-type of image jpg and then a mass of binary jpg data as their payload

8650812
getter	setter
from section 8.13.1 of the spec if a property member has both a getter and a setter and neither is an indexer then the signatures of both getter and setter must imply the same property type

8650822
super	extends
anything you want public just extends super controller

8650838
post	get

if you re using the formview or detailsview control in your asp.net webpage then you can use the oldvalues property of the forms s itemupdating event to compare the values before posting to your database

8651363
hash	md5
the problem is as both of the worker processes run their task functions getdigest they seem to be using the same hash object md5

8651369
setinterval	clearinterval
you can use setinterval to change the images every x miliseconds and then use clearinterval to stop it

8651380
for-loop	loops
by the way you use i as loops counter in the for-loop as well as for the strlen inside that loops that s generally a bad idea

8651400

the lefthandside also may not be a reference to a data properties with the attribute value writable false to an accessor properties with the attribute value set undefined nor to a non-existent properties of an object whose extensible internal properties has the value false

8651504
accessor	properties
arguments objects for strict mode functions define non-configurable accessor properties named caller and callee which throw a typeerror exception on access 10.6

8651605
yslow	pagespeed
the performance rules best practices for yslow and pagespeed are complementary but there are some differences so running both is a good idea

looking at the script that launches the java process i see that stdout and stderr are redirected to dev null

8659181
stdout	stderr
should i try redirecting stdout stderr to a normal file

8659184
temp	tmp
for example you may need chdir into the parent folder of the folder you wish to zip and then get a temp file name in tmp and then create the command to zip to that temp file name

8659197
stdout	stderr
redirecting stdout stderr to dev null means you re throwing away valuable info

8659197
stdout	stderr
it s probably easier to redirect stderr to stdout so you can interleave the results

8659249
post	get
i ve read the java ee tutorial jim driscoll s blog post and all over the internet and still can t get my head around it

8659250
width	height
bitmapdata object can have maximum 8191 pixels width or height and total number of pixels cannot exceed 16777215

8659257
boost	allocator
consider using boost ptr_vector and dynamic allocator

8659259
gson	jackson
using an arbitrary json processor of my choice jackson or gson e.t.c

8659259
freemarker	velocity
5 some set of template systems freemarker velocity e.t.c

8659286
bmp	png
and must accept png input though the exe must work on xp so according to wikipedia should embed bmp format

8659290
vim	kate
i could do so in vim and kate but not in qt creator and i have to use it

8659346
post	get
so the crux of the problem as you re asking it seems to be that you re correctly using a post request on your register form but your tutorials all want to use get

8659346
post	get
the first parameter of that function is a request method--change it to post rather than get and the request will be treated like a post which register.php expects

8659354
clang	icc
gcc decided not to warn as does clang but icc intel compiler would warn in this situation

8659359
coalesce	isnull
if feels like i should use coalesce or isnull to find the records where the discharge date is null but i m not a programmer and would appreciate your help

8659366
put	get
the challenging part isï¼œ i can t put the mutex on all 3 methods because iterate will call get and put which will cause a dead lock

8659369
cpython	pypy
cpython 2.7 + pypy 1.7 not working

8659369
cpython	pypy
cpython 2.7 + pypy nightly pypy-c-jit-50911-94e9969b5f00-linux64 working

8659380
post	get
i ll post the solution here once i get it working

8659386
vala	genie
you could use valac --dump-tree to convert from genie to vala

8659386
vala	genie
converting from vala to genie is a bit more complicated since the vala.codewriter class in libvala only outputs vala not genie

8659386
vala	genie
you can freely mix genie and vala files within the same valac invocation

8659424
put	get
there are more ways to skin a cat the classic one being to use unprotected private get put methods from iterate the public get set methods wrap that in a mutex lock

8659438
put	get
the mutex that s acquired when you use the synchronized keyword are reentrant so if iterate already owns the mutex then it can reacquire the same when calling get and put

8659438
put	get
similarly locking for both get and put will be handled for you by concurrenthashmap

8659463
super	implements
this is super annoying since clearly a resize should count as a history step and i don t want to rewrite the script to implements multiple open close operations on the original file

8659468
objectcontext	transactionscope
suppose you do create a new objectcontext each time a method is called on your repository the below snippet would still give you transaction support by using the transactionscope class

8659478
mp3	wav
samples are in raw wav linear pcm 16 bit little-endian signed integer 2 channels 44100 hz which should be the fastest to process as far as i understand opposed to something compressed like mp3

8659500
actionscript	mxml
i tried using rendereriseditor but that only seems to be on the mxml instantiation of the gridcolumn as there s only rendereriseditable in the actionscript and it doesn t seem to work or i don t know how to use it as intended

8659512
strsplit	substr
strsplit will do for this no need to go into substr

8659526

sparql and rdf are case sensitive and the correct predicate is owl sameas

8659600
mp3	wav
i ve used all types of file format wav mp3 and it s the same with any file format

8659607
keydown	keyup
on the keydown event you set it to true on the keyup event you set it to false.

8659607
keydown	keyup
note this works for any key you will have to specify which you want in the keydown function but you can leave it generic in the keyup function

8659628
uicontrol	uibutton
to prevent the user from going anywhere while you re working in the background you should either set the enabled property on each uicontrol uibutton uitextfield etc or perhaps overlay a transparent uiview over the whole ui to block touch events

8659660
persistent	transient
it looks like hibernate will not persistent a field with the transient keyword regardless of what other annotations you have

8659660
persistent	transient
the separate transient annotation will allow you to direct hibernate to ignore a non-transient field for persistent but i don t think it s possible to do the opposite of having hibernate persistent a transient field

8659668
super	implements
the moment you override a class method you can decide to implements it with the help of the super implementation or without it

8659679
range	min	range	max	min	max

i use node.js - express

8659702
move	drag
i ve a nsoutlineview used as file path drag source it supports copy and move operations and are defined as shown below

8659702
move	drag
when i drag filenames to finder to move them i must refresh the ui to remove from outlineview the items but how can i detect user has move instead of copied eg hold down alt key

8659748
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as simon pointed out i m using google-chrome 16 and i ve tested the example with firefox 4 and the latest safari and the bug is there

8659872
width	height
containts string valu t use with html image tag height yyy width xxx conatins numeric value of width

8659990
puts	gets
this just gets the playlists for the users and puts them on the sidebar

8660006
filesystems	ntfs

when you mark a field as transient it will not be persistent by java

8660258
concave	convex
your problem is not enough defined with a given set of points you may end up with many different polygons if you do not add a constraint other than create a nice concave or convex polygon

8660258
distance	polygons
- for example if you call avgd the average distance beetween points you could add the constraint that no segment of your outer polygons should be longer than 1.2 avgd or better alpha avgd and you try your algorithm with different alpha

filtering	grouping
multiple-record view checkbook style possibly grouping or filtering by supply type

8661527
case-sensitive	case-insensitive

8661531
profiling	instrumentation
when using zlib 1.25 in an ios project i ve noticed in my profiling instrumentation that the function zerror is being called repeatedly and is occupying 50 of the overall inflate time

8661564
int	double
when you re programming in java the operator is generally used for comparing primitive data types int double etc.

8661566
int	double
not really sure what you want to accomplish but your array will hold references to the objects if you use int double etc but the values itself if you use int double etc

8661566
int	double
however since int double etc are immutable i don t really know what you will gain by only having references to the objects

8661601
width	height
whenever i google how to disable paging everyone points to this thread which i have followed - both interative height and width are at 0

8661628
hide	show
when you click on a tab jquery simply hide all tab contents div s and show the selected div

8661688
min	max
if you need the min max experience bracket frequently i d recommend making the current_level next_level join a view

8661746

you can prevent the text from going into the other columns by using overflow hidden however you would probably be better off just making the column have a minimum width and making the font-size smaller

8661871
oncreate	setcontentview
you need to define it as a variable and then assign it in oncreate after you ve called setcontentview

implements	extends
so in a nutshell have a class extends or implements a jframe or whatever interface or class and or have one doing the same thing with actionlistener

8662161
superclass	subclassing
think about it you don t need an explicit object reference to call a superclass method from a subclassing

8662441
inherited	properties
the autosize properties is there just inherited from textbox and you can get to the properties

8662470
width	height
since css does not allow percentage values to generate border widths which would be ideal in this situation i think your only solution is to dynamically write css rules adding a style tag to the head element via jquery that then builds the width and height of your triangles based off of the widths of your nav tags at runtime

8662493
division	multiplication
if you really concern about speed sometimes you can approximate multiplication or division

8662493
addition	multiplication
and in that case multiplication becomes addition

8662496
hash	salt
as explained there bcrypt automatically generates a random salt which it stores in the same string as the hash password

this seems like it can be a recent problem since there are new versions out for both node.js and nowjs

8662544
zoo	xts
i have been trying to stay away from rep seq 5 or 7 kind of solutions since there may be some observations that i may need to filter from the data later on so i would like to have a solution that doesn t depend on the particular vector of my data but rather i would prefer the solution to be more general that is to depend on the date class i.e posicxt xts or zoo class

while it is technically the case that you can separate your implementation from your interface the syntax for templates gets so annoying to type repeatedly i would strongly recommend that you just hold your nose and put the implementation in your class until you get over the smell

8665642
children	parent
i ll probably have to program some logic of using some maximum number of children and block the parent when that number is reached - but that should be not necessary because most of the children terminate quickly

8665642
children	parent
the other solution that i can think of creating a two-tiered parent process that spawns concurrent children which in turn concurrently spawn and wait for grandchildren is too complicated for me right now

8665642
children	parent
if the answer is that parent processes need to have a way to find out what happened to their children then for god s sake there is no reason to count zombies as normal processes and forbid the creation of non-zombie processes just because there are too many zombies

8665902
crossover	mutation
given the f and your score aka fitness function all you need to do is construct a population of possible metabolite combinations run them all through f score all the resulting spectrums and then use crossover and mutation to produce a new population that combines the best candidates

8665902
crossover	mutation
choosing how to do the crossover and mutation is generally domain specific because you can speed the process greatly by avoiding the creation of nonsense genomes

8665902
crossover	mutation
without knowing about your domain i can t say what a single member of your population should look like but it could simply be a list of metabolites which allows for ordering and duplicates if that s interesting or a string of boolean values over all possible metabolites which has the advantage of being order invariant and yielding obvious possibilities for crossover and mutation

8665939
firefox	safari
if when i play it in firefox before then safari works

if all you need is a standalone java application you should use a canvas or even better not use awt at all and use swing instead

8666138

vim	notepad++
if you don t want to write the script you can alternatively use a text editor like notepad++ or vim gvim

in notepad++ you would use the replace with search mode as regular expression and with vim you would use the confirm flag of the substitute command s foo bar gc

8666336

hide	show
the portlets in plone are quite handy but i d like to be able to provide some method to users to be able to temporarily hide show the portlets column

i m not sure what you mean by how to open div #hidden in current clicked td but to show and hide the #hidden div you could do like this

8668944

if you inspect the anchor tag firebug or other inspector it shows as the same width and height as the image which to me is correct but the full div is clickable

8668974
happy	lemon
i saw a representation of lemon where they claim to be better then bgl on that aspect but i didn t find any benchmarks that include igraph and since igraph has much more functions that are relevant to me compared to bgl and lemon this is a library that i would be happy to use in case that it is efficient enough

implements	extends
this item renderer extends a checkbox and implements igriditemrenderer

8669246
udp	tcp
if you re looking to build it from the ground up i would recommend using udp rather than tcp because the messaging is lightweight and it is trivial to implement automatic peer discovery using udp broadcast if needed

8669263
accessor	properties
also change your combodata from a field no get set accessor methods to a properties see dmitriy s answer for an example

8669303
gentoo	linux
now the problem is default configure s prefix seems to be usr local i can control that default in my configure.ac and at least gentoo linux s default is --prefix usr that s a problem because it overrides any defaults i put in my configure.ac

8669310

it could be dojo is using proper error handling methods try-catch blocks which prevents the exception-handling from bubbling up and reaching the window container on which you have registered the error handler

8669315

passwords are meant to be stored as hash not md5 it s too weak

8669359

8669418
hash	salt
conventionally you should only store a salt hash of the password in your database

8669418

to detect whether a user s password matches the one you have stored you only need to hash their password with the same salt you used to hash the value in the database

8669421
client-side	server-side
both server-side and client-side the answer is yes

8669466
nscountedset	nsmutableset
for example if you just need to keep a running count of the number of each type of object you have you could just use the nscountedset directly it descends from nsmutableset so it is already mutable and not bother with creating the arrays

8669491
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to find a jquery solution that seems to work in firefox and ie but unfortunately not in google-chrome

8669551
onresume	onpause
you will only need to save your offset in onresume and set it to 0 when the activity is going to be destroyed which you can tell by using isfinishing in onpause like the following

8669562
submit	submission
you will need to combine the two forms into one you don t even necessarily need the form tags use javascript or jquery to capture the submit button click evaluate the input value based on your validation rules that route the form submission and then post the values to a form likely through ajax

8669578
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it is just that firebug in firefox and the web inspector in safari and google-chrome all each show four errors related to this

8669604
hash	salt
basically this is what you do when you salt password hash although for slightly different reasons

8669604
hash	salt
it doesn t prevent collision attacks entirely if you have a hash function mapping arbitrary-length input to a fixed-length output hash can always collide but using a secret salt should make such attacks harder

8669625

not only that but even if it ends up in a valid state the ancestor class may still be confused about the state its in if it s been mutated outside the class public protected interface

8669625

8669830
unix	bsd
syslog names an event notification system which originated with bsd unix

8669846
int	double
the major driving force behind the need to do compile-time validation of the sort int are ok double are not ok was that you could access operations implicitly a+b would succeed if the types of a and b supplied at template expansion allowed the + operation

8669846
int	double
it is not the same in c# if you want an operation to be done on a value passed to a generic you must either stipulate the existence of that operation explicitly through a type constraint or provide an explicit way to perform that operation a delegate an interface etc. either way telling the compiler that your template works for int nut not for double does not buy you absolutely anything

8669885
int	double
two int divisions result in an int not a float or double

8669888
integer	fractions
integer division has no fractions so 500 1000 0.5 that is no integer

8669918
int	double
finally long short int double and float are not class types

8669928
post	put
put does not mean update any more than post means insert

8669959
setinterval	clearinterval
my setinterval function works fine but i cannot for the life of me work out why the clearinterval function isn t working

8669978
setinterval	clearinterval
you need to save the value that s returned from setinterval and pass that into your call to clearinterval

8669978
setinterval	settimeout
also it s usually considered evil to call settimeout or setinterval with a string

8669983
setinterval	clearinterval
the clearinterval function should receive an id that is generated by setinterval

8669987
setinterval	clearinterval
pass id of setinterval in clearinterval

my understanding is that reference primitive values types assignments are atomic however interlocked will guarantee the change is propagated to all threads

8670311
intersect	contains
the first call to refreshfilter ... works just fine and returns a filterparams object with a .items property that contains an intersect list

8670336
hive	hdfs
in order to implement search on these logs i have thought of this design there is a process running on web servers which creates an inverted-index of logs and cache it in-memory on web servers itself and push to hdfs via flume to be stored in hive when the cache is full this is much like an lru cache

8670358
for-loop	arrays
then you will need a functor which captures your arrays and executes the body of the for-loop

8670374

8670796
folder	directory
most filesystems get cranky or slow when you have 10k files in a folder directory etc

hide	show
you should probably hide the .guns in the second function or if you only want to show them and never hide them you can just use mouseover instead of hover

8670870
super	extends
then i will have to relink all references manually which on the long run will invite bugs when other people extends the code of the super class and forget the copy constructur in the sub class

8670873
mouseover	mouseout
in hover there are two events bounded mouseover and mouseout

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you have embedded your uiviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller then in viewdidload of the view controller you could for example make the title a uisearchbar that you dragged to the uiviewcontroller in xcode ib and put 2 buttons on the right like this

8670939
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem

superclass	subclassing
you shouldn t copy all the references from the superclass instance to the subclassing instance

8670950
superclass	subclassing
btw all these references should not even be accessible from the subclassing if they are declared as private fields in the superclass as they should be generally

8670950
implements	extends
fooadapter could extends foo or better theyr should implements a common interface but that s not necessarily needed

8671002
bayesian	cross-validation
another approach is to impose a prior for your model parameters based on earlier data - one of the simplest ways to do that which does not require full bayesian learning is to add a quadratic penalty to your loss function that penalizes for deviating from the older parameter values with the penalty coefficient tuned using cross-validation backtesting some care should be taken to make sure that the variance-covariance matrix of the older model parameters is taken into account when constructing the penalty

client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8671120
post	put
if i put an absolute url for a post like

8671149
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
your application should receive that password hash it not using md5 but a legitimate salt hash or bcrypt which is the best solution there and then compare it to the stored salt hash

8671149
hash	salt
therefore your application never stores user passwords so if your password file database got compromised noone s password would be exposed and if you use a strong salt hash bcrypt algorithm noone should be able to brute force the hash to recover the actual password

8671149
hash	salt
if you hash the password on the client and send the actual salt hash to the application you re opening yourself up to a different attack

8671149
hash	salt
instead you want the client to send the password itself and have the server generate the hash based on it so the attacker would not know what to send in an attempt to log in as a user since you cannot take a salt hash and recover the password from it assuming a strong salt hash implementation

8671159
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd	g-wan	lighttpd
the benchmarks i have seen indicate that nginx lighttpd g-wan in particular and friends blow away apache in terms of performance but this blowing away appears to manifest more in high-load scenarios where the web server is handling many simultaneous connections

8671159
apache	nginx
so if i roll with nginx or other apache alternative will there be any difference whatsoever in terms of visible performance

8671298
put	get
when upgrading to rails 3 i assumed the file resolver would put engines plugins in styles but no they all get combined into one virtual path

8671312
tinyint	boolean
so why mysql interprets boolean as tinyint 1 but not bit 1

8671312
tinyint	boolean
is there any advantage of using tinyint 1 over bit 1 in handling boolean values

8671357
decoder	encoder
if you want to deal with the message before it s decoder you ll need a custom message encoder for that that s the component which converts between the bytes in the wire and the message object

8671366
pow	floor
i m trying to make a simple fibonacci calculator in c but when compiling gcc tells me that i m missing the pow and floor functions

8671369
innodb	myisam
bit is supported properly in 5.05+ with myisam and innodb

8671386
pow	floor
add -lm to your link options since pow and floor are part of the math library

8671394
hide	show
if you need to show something different depending on the value create all the objects and then hide the one you don t want to show .visible false

so far i can get it to delete post however i can not find a way to skip over images or post that were published via techcrunch for example

8671554
int	double
for example if we want to define a template function which we can use int floats double but not strings

8671583
int	double
both int or both long or both double etc...

8671583
equals	compareto
turns out the only fully reliable way to compare two numbers of unknown type at runtime is to convert both to strings and both to bigdecimal and then to use the method compareto and not equals

8671624
int	double
since a short can be implicitly converted to int long float double or decimal

8671631
width	height
later in the application i add a uiview and i need the uiview to take the height and width of the scrollview

8671631
width	height
it only shows part of the screen width 320 and height 460

8671645
min	max
notes min max vs order by and limit

8671667
int	double
it just so happens that 4 and 5 are represented as double in such a way that 32 out of the 64 bits are zeros and these zero bits are the ones that the printf function interprets as an int since you told it to print an int

8671688
int	chars
chars is just an int

8671688
int	chars
to access a single bit in a chars you can do it the same way as any other int

8671703
postgresql	mysql
however for sql server 2012 yes next release postgresql and mysql you can do this

8671726
sorting	filtering
so the paging sorting and filtering of data works locally

8671726
sorting	filtering
if you look exactly what is paging sorting and filtering you will see that it s mot more as changing of some parameters of jqgrid and reloading of the grid locally

8671726
sorting	filtering
so the paging sorting and filtering work locally only because the reload of the grid works locally

8671727
post	get
i would suggest passing in a post or get variable in your ajax call that indicates to the script that the request is from ajax

8671732
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
in the example below i have a jpanel with boxlayout which contains another jpanel with gridbaglayout

8671793
put	get
i know if we don t put bracket it will show error but want i want is to get the explanation why bracket is needed

8671863
int	double
an abstract class extended by all classes that represent numeric primitive types such as byte short int long float and double

8671866
post	get
i ve read several post on so on similar subjects but was unable to dissect and get my code to function the way i want it too

8671889
integer	unsigned
therefore i have chosen the data type to be an unsigned integer

8671902
octal	decimal
if so is the machine able to store the decimal and scientific-notation representations as fast as it does the octal

8671907
pull	push
also not that the multi device interaction of the android maven plugin also works for push pull install and running tests

8671913
int	chars
since a chars is an int type it would be stored in the same way as a regular int would be

8671949
vb6	vba
to sum up it works fine with the vb6 client but not in the vba actctx client

8671956
for-loop	loops
return false breaks from each loops in jquery just like break in for-loop in plain javascript

8671966
nsindexpath	nsindexset
then just follow the normal pattern for updating rows but using nsindexset instead of nsindexpath and insertitematindicies deleteitematindicies instead of insertrowatindexpath deleterowatindexpath

8672012
firefox	safari
i have following script and it works fine with firefox and safari

8672021

when you are ready to commit you run another script that creates a template for your commit message which includes all the done issues -- then you fill in the blanks for each issue

8672074
union	distinct
2 if you don t do #1 union causes a distinct

8672101
switching	screens
our web site does nothing with the actual browser window size like switching browser into full screens mode

8672175
google-chrome	firefox
my attempt to use html comments in a non-standard way worked in google-chrome but failed in firefox

8672175
opera	firefox
both browsers parse the html correctly not sure if ie and opera would too but firefox downloads the nojs.css in all cases without actually applying it when js is enabled

8672205
hex	binary
it seems it s a configurable setting show binary contents as hex

8672205
hash	salt
it s not clear to me how you build the hash to match do you retrieve the salt in some other query

8672236
margin	text-align
if you want it to be symmetrically in the center use text-align center for the body and margin auto for the top section and disable the position absolute

8672272
mdpi	hdpi
i need to make drawables for different layout but i don t know what means mdpi ldpi hdpi - which range of resolution values should i use for each drawables

8672279
setinterval	settimeout
instead of repeatedly calling settimeout with slightly-different values you could setup a global variable to track the current iteration and use one call to setinterval instead

8672279
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is like settimeout except it will keep running indefinitely - you don t have to call it over and over again

8672281
width	height
i ve tried setting the height property in my mainwindow but this doesn t work changing the width property of the horizontal slider works though

8672313

8672339
pop-up	dialog
so in my aspx page currently i have the jquery that shows the dialog in the center of the page it masks the aspx page into whole white and then displays the the actual content as a pop-up window but i would like to show the pop-up closer to the mousehover without masking the aspx page

8672362
setinterval	settimeout
other than that if you want to not block other js from running then you need to use the settimeout setinterval method of implementing this loop

8672376
gif	png
jpg gif png and tiff.

8672444
client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8672453
width	height
i also agree with mrtsherman if you set a width or height to a specific pixel it is going to limit you to those constraints

8672467
mouse	keyboard
i ve had problems with keyboard mouse doing different things with comboboxes before but that had to do with certain events not firing

8672471
hide	show
i know that it may be difficult to see the actual problem without looking throughout the whole script but i m curious if its a little buggy for anybody who has done a hover function and use show and hide

this allows you to use one buffer for many possible cases and still gives you the advantage of fast serializable deserialization no reflection required

8672622
windows	wow64
in windows 7 64bit these 32-bit applications will run i assume using the wow64 emulation layer in windows

8672636
post	get
if you get it working make sure you post the answer to your own question

8672652
hide	show
you should use classes or unique ids to find the elements you want to show hide and you should make your hover event more specific

8672662
setinterval	clearinterval
use setinterval to start and clearinterval when you reach your max

8672686
set	bag
i think that the bag product has been created with a specific attribute set then someone changed the attribute set to another and another again

8672711

8672799
maven	pom.xml
if the project you re building is using the android-maven-plugin you want to set the dex mojo configuration in the maven pom.xml file eg

8672809
decoder	encoder
i can see that srt codec is supported as decoder and encoder however i am not sure what is used for mp4 and mkv subs encoding and whether i need to switch it on or compile separately

8672832
typemock	moles
the only option is to use some more advanced technology which will allow you redirect method call to some other this is provided only by commercial typemock isolator and ms moles but that would lead to the same problem as you are trying to do at the moment testing assumption about code you don t own

8672880
google-chrome	firefox
it works with ie 8.0 google-chrome and firefox and tablets

8672881
ready	each
when you re ready add each folder to the project and set the target membership to the appropriate target

8672909
post	get
if you get this working i d encourage you to write a technical blog post on your experiences

8672962
width	height
in that case you may need to calculate the width and height of the container div which holds the image and then divide it by two to locate the center and place your image there

8672964
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a website which works fine in google-chrome and firefox but doesn t display right in internet explorer all versions

8672964
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox

8672992
post	get
create a page template and use the following code to get a random post

8673015
integer	unsigned
again it makes sense to have a way to clearly and concisely specify that this literal is intended to be treated as an unsigned integer

8673015
integer	unsigned
the next most likely cases are that the user intends it to be a long integer or an unsigned int or unsigned long

8673032
put	get
to get the first five elements that were put onto the stack then i would do the following

8673145
width	height
with your current code you are creating caps of half of the image height and width - this leaves you with a stretchable area of 0x0 pixels - so you get nothing in the middle

8673155
versioning	upgrade
i think the new versioning may use a writeable bitmap just speculation for the page that is transitioning out - there was atleast 2x speed increase with the upgrade toolkit and memory issues were all but eliminated

8673198
maven	pom.xml
logging section of maven pom.xml usually looks like this

8673263
post	get
i have it working to get to the show page of the user but i am also trying to nest the resources so that i can see his post and comments using the same syntax

8673356
width	height
i have some images with height auto because sometimes they are different height whereas they are always the same width

8673364
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this on my iphone and google-chrome firefox relevant version numbers above

8673370
post	get
make request via get http method not post

8673378
g++	gcc
i do not get the same results using mingw and g++ which is weird isn t it as wingw is a port of gcc

8673389
width	margin
this will reduce the left position property by 50 and reduce the width of the margin auto

8673451
width	height
if your 4 blocks are identical in height and width you could do this

8673470
put	get
however i cannot get eclipse to use the -noaudio value i put in the default emulator options field

8673506
put	get
does anyone has an idea that why delete and put are not working with portal application jsr 286 and how to get rid of that

8673541
google-chrome	firefox
that works in google-chrome but firefox throws an error

8673551
maven	pom.xml
then per the other answer when they deploy to maven central you can just change the version in your own project pom.xml

8673561
solaris	sunos
based on my experience with redhat rel version 5 and solaris sunos 5.9 5.10 linux process memory footprint doesn t increase gradually instead it seems it grabs a large chunk memory when it needs extra memory and use them for a long run

8673591
melt	reshape
i have a data.frame that looks like this i used reshape melt to get data from wide to long format

8673599
getter	setter
if an explicit getter and setter are required in the future public int foo

8673610
getter	setter
future-proofing your api - if you later need logic in the getter or setter your public api doesn t change

8673624
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you can t just cast an nsstring as an nsmutablestring and expect it to be mutable

8673652
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization only works on public properties not public fields

8673684
boost	stl
but i would like to use stl and boost as much as possible to build my own expression evaluator

8673700
post	get
i get these errors in the log when trying to post to album_id photos

8673716
getchar	strtok
lex and yacc are nice if the format is rather complex but otherwise either strtok or getchar + switch is probably the way to go

8673746
yacc	bison
the unhelpful answer is don t do that write a parser properly maybe using lex and or yacc or bison

8673762
post	get
use post redirect get

8673768
put	get
when clicking div1 -div1 will get focus and put to front setting div5 back one step

8673797
folder	directory
when you have a local web server you could set the workspace to a new folder in the servers directory or web root when the project should be in the main directory

8673800
lisp	scheme
certainly a function subroutine could be written to replicate the if behaviour i think it is actually a function in lisp scheme

8673820
lisp	scheme
in programming languages of the lisp family scheme comes to mind if is an expression meaning that it returns a value and is implemented as a special form

8673865
hide	show
however if you go to that url after about 5 seconds the content finally hide and show the correct content

8673879
selecteditem	selectedindex
usually the problem when the aspxcombobox s selecteditem selectedindex is incorrect occurs when the aspxcombobox.valuetype property is specified incorrectly

8673907
put	get
ruby has some stuff that makes dealing with yaml files super easy i need to write a blog posting on this so you can put something at the top of your script that calls a method to get the config info and then set the browser type accordingly

8673921
client-side	server-side
this is really nice if your development style is mostly server-side and you are happy not to have to bother with the details of making it all work client-side

8673927
zlib	quazip
at least some people here want to build quazip which requires zlib

8674018
pbkdf2	hash
i m trying to securely store a password in a database and for that i chose to store its hash generated using the pbkdf2 function

8674018
hmac	pbkdf2
i know that pbkdf2 is implemented using hmac sha1 so that is why i chose as algorithm in the last method the pbewithhmacsha1 which i took from the bouncy castle java docs

8674038
post	get
what i notice right away is that it is sending a get rather than a post although i specified a post on the ajax request

8674038
post	get
however am not sure why it is doing a get rather than a post

8674061
filesystems	ntfs
basically you can enter any descriptive fields normally into your database but the actual blob is stored in ntfs governed by the sql engine and limited in size only by your ntfs filesystems

8674073
ftp	telnet
if your server serves a crossdomain suitable for sockets then swf can implement telnet ftp ssh and lots of other protocols based on tcp

8674074
folder	directory
it will recursively search folder executing a user defined function on each directory

8674120
int	chars
since i can t make an array mixed int and chars i have to convert the gender to 0 and 1

8674142
int	boolean
some kind of method on any that tests if a string instance is equal to an int - to 0 a float - to 0f a boolean - to false a list contains no items and so on for other types

8674158

8674196
put	get
where to put generated images such that the front end can get them

8674218
std	ostream
while maybe your classes are too complex for this i found the easy thing to do is use the std ostream and just write out standard compliant xml this way

8674226
decoder	encoder
in directshow you choose new unique video subtype identifier which is guid so you can really get a unique one you create encoder and decoder filters you register them properly with directshow intelligent connect and you are good to go

8674226
decoder	encoder
encoder and decoder filters are com objects registered to do certain transformation of video data

8674226
decoder	encoder
as you are interested in video encoder decoder fitlers only you might want to prefer writing a directx media object dmo instead

8674260
post	get
basically it calls a javascript function that does an ajax post to get the dropdown values from php

8674279

8674317
width	height
i want them lined up in an organized fashion so i was giving them an auto width and a specified height

8674346
trojan	botnet	trojan	virus	virus	botnet
many botnet are propagated by a worm virus trojan so it s only a bit simpler to find the originating host as it is to find the first guy with influenza

8674429
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
now i added reference of second asp.net-mvc 3 site to the first and added html.actionlink linktosecondsite index second link in my index page so that when i will run first site i would like to have link to my second site

8674459
post	get
is there some other way to somehow make it little more difficult to get the api of my php server so people cannot post via pc to my server

8674460
width	height
to get background image height or width is a real pain something like this should work

8674487
inherited	properties
the method will assign the instance of evilproperty to the myclass instance s someproperty but that properties expects a myproperty and evilproperty doesn t inherited from myproperty

8674515
profiling	instrumentation
profiling it with the zombies instrumentation can also help as it provides detailed feedback on what it is that is throwing up the error

8674546
clang	llvm
on my version of mac osx lion 10.7.1 xcode 4.1 there is llvm 3.0svn and clang 2.1

8674546
clang	llvm
the current versions are llvm 3.0 and clang 3.0

8674546
clang	llvm
do you know if installing the latest xcode i will get a more recent version of llvm clang

8674583
zero	decimal-point
if you d just like to trim the trailing decimal-point zero from a string you could use a regular expression such as the below

8674633
put	get
however you can postpone writing of the element and attributes put them in a field until you get to the next element comment etc

8674654
hide	show
how do i hide the entire kpi goal or make it show the exact value instead of #value

8674687
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
therefore the method will always use the superclass field even if a subclassing inherited it and shadows that field

8674687
inherited	subclassing
note that none of this is relevant to inherited methods which always use the original variables regardless of whether a subclassing shadows them

8674696
opera	firefox
this won t work without some tweaking hacking in anything but firefox though maybe opera as well - not sure

8674701
post	put
actually to follow the rails conventions since you are calling an extra method on the existing report even though the side effect may be to create things i would change the routing to use put instead of post and leave the form alone

8674722
spaces	delimiter
you can t have spaces or it causes the delimiter finder in the script to fail

8674753
int	chars
there are five standard signed int types signed chars short int int long int and long long int

8674759
ubuntu	debian
although i m on ubuntu not debian

8674765
unsigned	short
the long and short modifiers are not exactly like signed and unsigned

8674765
int	chars
the latter two can be put on any int type but if you leave them off then signed is the default for each int type except chars

8674765
unsigned	short
the int after long short signed and unsigned is optional signed int and signed are the same type

8674775

edit when revisiting this question i understood that the question is actually why use dependency injection when you can do the same with getter and setter

8678369
getter	setter
in my opinion the important thing to realize is that you cannot do anymore with dependency injection than you can with getter and setter but the only place you can use getter and setter is in the code that creates the new object

8678380
int	double
double it.error 1 int it.d 2

8678420
width	height
although after adding this the it stopped autoresizing you can work around by adding height and width parameters

8678434
stateless	stateful
as a rule use the prototype scope for all stateful beans and the singleton scope for stateless beans

8678441
ftp	telnet
which is best for doing telnet and ftp automation in windows

8678457

8678478
ciimage	cifilter
try to find some apis from ciimage or cifilter or cicontext to lower the video frame quality

8678560

i have a server size image stream where you pass fileid width and height to and it streams an image to client

8678560
width	height
i m using ckeditor and would like to add jquery function that changes it s url when height or width changes in the textboxes

8678560
width	height
content image digit width height rest is optional in string

8678560
width	height
lets say id s of them textboxes are txtwidth and txtheight how would you add jquery functionality to it that replaces width and height in url textbox and only if it matches string starting with content image digit width height

8678570
mef	prism
when developping rather large applications using prism and mef unity i always reach a point where i should choose between using events a service or maybe both

i want to hide a specified struct in my c module so struct declaration is in the .c file and the header contains a typedef

8678684
qtabwidget	qplaintextedit
i have a qtabwidget where each tab has a qplaintextedit as its widget

8678709
alarmmanager	timertask
you can use timertask for this.but when your device goes sleep it will not working so i think you can use alarmmanager for this

8678712
fast-forward	merge
merge it with your local master branch fast-forward merge

8678715
prepare	execute
you can also use prepare statements to execute query but the baisc logic remains same

8678738
keydown	keyup
try keyup rather than keydown or build a timer

8678755
mouseleave	mouseenter
since jquery s hover function internally uses mouseenter and mouseleave elements with both hover and click registrations requires two taps to trigger the latter 2

8678772
free	strdup
in the first case i suggest you use strdup to copy the strings but remember to free them when done

8678779
groovy	gsp
i am iterating a array list in gsp of groovy with grails if any sub string present in the existing list don t display them on browser other wise display them

8678829
folder	directory
if you put an object with no content 0 bytes and the key name ends with a and the content-type binary octet-stream it will be treated by s3 as a directory folder

8678829
folder	directory
however the console will treat it as a directory folder and many sdk clients will treat it as a directory folder

8678863
width	height
further more we adjust the height so that it s the width

8678863
width	height
make sure the minimum enclosing rectangle has height width

8678913
subtract	add
one way to think of this is that working mod m you are free to add or subtract m as much as you like since m is equivalent to 0 mod m

8678913
multiplying	add
when we see the next character we multiplying that by d and do the other stuff i am trying to explain and then add on the new character - say y

8678913
multiplying	subtract
so we can remove the influence of x on the hash value by subtract x d m-1 before multiplying by d

8678919
post	get
once xml is constructed you can use the same tutorial to send the data back to server using ajax use post instead of get

8678931
folder	directory
basically you only need to create a virtual directory which is mapped to a folder on your hard-disk

8678962
spaces	delimiter
it was not the query i mentioned spaces to be one of the delimiter and so it was taking it to be a new word on a whole after spaces

8678964
ssl	https
i had the ssl error on my windows desktop with a php script that accessed a https resource

8678993
width	height
the calculations for width and height are similar i will only explain the height calculation the detailled explanation is just an example of function logic

8678993
width	height
this can be done by using the offset height and width methods

8679016
post	put	post	get	put	get
my web-service must get this data from post json variable but i don t know how can i put my jsonobject object into json field for post query

validate the contents of the width and height fields

8679396
implements	extends
you have not implements the setcontentview method after extends your class to activity

8679396
implements	extends
if you don t need any ui there is no need to extends activity and you can implements other basic component like service

8679407
dxcore	coderush
if you re really opposed to installing the whole of coderush devexpress also provides its visual studio plugin technology on which it s built dxcore for free

8679499
hide	show
like if i want to show asia map in my application then map kit hide remaining part of the map

8679544
put	get

8679560
glut	sdl
we recently ported bitfighter from glut to sdl

8679577
put	get
hi if you put it into session you cannot see it in querystring because you use the response.redirect without adding anything to get method querystring

8679596
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it looks fine but google-chrome has a 1px spacing on the right and bottom

8679609
width	height
and in your style sheet just add the background and its properties height and width and what ever positioning you had in mind

8679612
sse	avx
otherwise i think it s just better to execute the algorithm on cpu using simd instruction set like mmx sse avx

8679642
put	get
index.jsp 8 40 file struts-tags not found.where to put jar to make it work also while learning struts sometime i get http 404 error but when i restart eclipse i tried restarting server but it didnt help the error is gone all of a sudden.why this is happening.eclipse is so confusing

8679698
ubuntu	linux
on linux with gnome 3 ubuntu 11.04+ the situation is a bit different relying on an exampleapp.desktop file placed in the usr share applications folder followed by sudo update-desktop-database

8679716
mvp	presenter
ideally you should have 2 buttons that fire different events and call out the main logic to a presenter in the mvp pattern

8679718
groupbox	panel
use control containers such as panel and groupbox

8679722
integer	fractions
you could also use math.round with midpointrounding.awayfromzero using a decimal number otherwise integer division will truncate fractions

8679735
public	protected
i want to enumerate all properties private protected public etc

8679736
google-chrome	safari
i read in many places that google-chrome and safari allows cross domain requests as long as server responds with the followin header in the response

8679736
google-chrome	safari
i am having problems with google-chrome and safari doing cross-domain ajax requests even though i am sending the necessary header back from the server

8679736
google-chrome	safari
2 more importantly can i someone please tell me whether cross-domain functionality is allowed in google-chrome and safari by default as long as server responds with the header or do i have to make sure that

8679761
pop-up	dialog
i am unsure of which way to do it as the dialog that pop-up is looking for a primary key table and a foreign key table

8679791
google-chrome	firefox
i am able to see titles in google-chrome and ie but firefox works mystically in the sense that it only shows the title to once you move in to jqgrid container and no tooltip after that

8679860
box-sizing	border-box
the select element has a box-sizing of border-box whereas the input element has that of content-box

8679874
strtol	atoi
i suggest also to check the return value of all your function calls and to use strtol function instead of atoi because atoi cannot detect errors

8679892
portrait	landscape
the setrequestedorientation call solves the issue when you are using your app in portrait mode but when camera is launched you put the mobile in landscape and then shoot the photo

8679904
getter	setter
create getter and setter

8679911
width	margin
if you want center an element width margin 0 auto you need to set the width

8679914
uiview	calayer
it s not an easy thing you ll have to recode at least some of your classes view hierarchy and hit tests are the first things that come to my mind but it s worth a try and it s rather painless process because calayer is very similar to uiview

8679975
qtableview	qstackedwidget
i have two pages subclassed qwidgets inserted in a qstackedwidget with a qtableview bound to a model

8680003
autocomplete	typeahead
i used now.js autocomplete with couchdb typeahead search and the results were very good

8680031
stdout	stderr
by default stdout is line buffered on most platforms and stderr is unbuffered

8680031
stdout	stderr
dr when debugging print to stderr not stdout other people might suggest logging to a file instead and or allowing runtime options like enabling disabling printing file style threshold ect

8680062
cout	cin
what i was thinking that above code will set cin s buffer to cout s buffer so when i will input some number it ll will be outputted also

8680068
google-chrome	safari
safari + google-chrome are working as expected

8680082
move	drag
i want to enable drag drop for this widget so that i can freely move this widget in the panel

8680093
ubuntu	linux
for information i m using a standard ubuntu linux installation

8680101
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
but here is an example of using an expandablelistview without defining your own expandablelistadapter rather just using the simpleexpandablelistadapter class

8680152
google-chrome	firefox
now the problem is in ie7 browser the abs element is covered by the next rela element but it displays well in other browsers like firefox google-chrome ie8

8680195
cout	cin
i am thinking but am not sure that the reason that foo is not being inputted is because after you set cin s buffer to cout the line

8680200
cout	cin
so with std cin.rdbuf std cout.rdbuf you are asking to cin to do its input using the streambuf of cout which probably is not ready for doing input

8680218
width	height
note that i ve set the width and height to 100px in the above code and you should change it as appropriate

8680234
inherited	properties
i then want to be able to access an errors properties the they both inherited from the doc class

8680299
disk	ram
unfortunately you can t check things like ram hard disk space without running on the client machine so your installation package would need to verify these requirements

however since ios introduced multitasking i ve been running into a problem where the scroll view frame gets changed when the app resumes from the backgrounding

8680344

8680390
ant	maven
i know ant and i work with eclipse but this is not a problem i can learn maven or other build tools

8680472
awt	swing
for more examples and explanations on swing and awt you can look at the official java tutorials here

8680473
inherited	properties
mfmailcomposeviewcontroller class inherited from uinavigationcontroller and so its delegate properties is delegate for navigation controller part of the class

is there a way in gwt to check whether obj s type implements extends baseclass

8680542
jobs	cron
i have several cron jobs and i d like to perform some calculations on them so i know the next time the cron jobs are executed

8680542
jobs	cron
doing these calculations by hand seems too hard especially when the cron jobs become more complex

8680548
client-side	server-side
i have both server-side and client-side validation to check that this date is in range

8680548
client-side	server-side
the server-side validation works fine with parsing the datetime string and validating it but i am having a problem with client-side validation for browsers which natively support the datetime picker

8680548
opera	safari
as per the comment in the above code this works in opera 11 desktop but not in safari on the ipad

8680548
opera	safari
opera is returning a date in the format 2011-12-01t12 00 but safari appears to be doing something else seems to be 2012-01-01 00 00

8680623
apache	nginx
i understand it s better to allow apache or nginx to serve them but this works if you are using a rails standalone server or at least it works with thin

8680640
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop over an arrays

8680686
put	get
when i put into my application.rb and restart the rails server i get an error that looks like

8680688
ssl	https
also if you are worried about dealing with sensitive user data first of all you should always use ssl https

8680722
ubuntu	linux
neither of these services are supported on linux and i wouldn t want to deal with all the associated vnc x setup and network config on ubuntu

8680733
udp	tcp
i m looking to share the factor counter var with a udp server so on each connect it will inc the value for both tcp and udp

8680733
udp	tcp
so if i connect first with tcp it will be 2 then if i connect to the port on udp

8680801
width	height
changing the height and width

8680801
width	height
i only do this once because changing the height width of a canvas actually erases all drawing

8680811
folder	directory	children	parent
a is the parent directory and has two parallel children folder b and

8680832
viewdidload	viewdidappear
in some cases viewdidload or viewdidappear might get triggered but you really shouldn t rely on it

8680841
vb6	vba
continue for isn t valid in vba or vb6

8680858
int	chars
thirdly you can test the chars without using their int equivalents

8680860
wordpress	joomla
i m used to trying not to hack the core using joomla wordpress etc

8680898
int	double
is it possible to check if a variable the variable can be a float double or int is approaching a certain number

8680906
folder	directory
i know that i m hitting the right directory and that the update does work with a manual copy and paste of the folder

8680927
implements	extends
programmatically you could extends the datatable or abstractdatatable class and implements the missing features and functions via jsni addcolumn type role etc

8680937
width	margin
so i tried to get around it by setting the width to 100 and using margin 0 8em 0 8em to center the gallery and the contents of #other and #footer

8680937
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried firefox google-chrome and ie9

8681006
post	get
i have pages that send post get requests to php scripts on the server

8681066
folder	directory
also should i make the projectbase folder also a virtual directory

8681132
post	get
check out this post for the exact behavior i am trying to get around

8681138
getter	setter
i also think it would be better not to have a setter for it at all but have some more calculations in the getter

8681151
versioning	upgrade
when i want to upgrade my sqlite datatbase from versioning 1 to 2 i got this error

8681151
versioning	upgrade
sqliteexception can t upgrade read-only database from versioning x to y

8681215
width	margin
jason mccreary s answer is good if you have a fixed width container but if you want to fix the margin size then your current idea of setting a px or em unit for your margins is just fine for centering

8681218
folder	directory
your development machine however is serving up pages locally and has a different directory structure for mapping to files and folder

8681218
folder	directory
the initial in your link css styles.css tells the server to go to the root directory of the server and start looking for the folder and files from that point .

8681218
folder	directory
but there is no css folder in the local server s root directory

8681227
put	get
but then allow a put on that same synchronized uri to replace the redirect with the transferred entity which would then be returned in subsequent get responses

8681276
radiobuttonlist	datalist
i want to display a polls on the web application so i created a datalist that displays the question and a template field radiobuttonlist to display each question answers but the radiobuttonlist only display one answer so how i make the radiobuttonlist display choices depending on the number of choices in the sql source

8681279
nsstatusbar	nsstatusitem
i m trying to find notification way to check if nsstatusitem from nsstatusbar system wide bar was clicked

8681296
jtextfield	jlabel
i am trying to bind the visibility of a jlabel to whether the text of a jtextfield is empty or not

8681329
filesystems	ntfs
if you want to strictly speaking read files from a partition you will have to implement filesystems recognition is that partition ext3 reiserfs ntfs ..

8681329
folder	directory
we don t care if the directory passed is the root of a filesystem or just a folder in any depth-level of a filesystem

8681333
internationalization	globalization	internationalization	localization	globalization	localization
the .net framework supports internationalization api which is known as globalization and localization

8681333
globalization	localization
globalization localization includes the country region calendars number format currency format date format resources text encoding etc

8681333
globalization	localization
have a look at msdn article on asp.net globalization and localization

8681368
min	max
i have a procedure to find the first last max and min prices for a series of transactions in a very large table which is organized by date object name and a code

8681369
children	parent
also i believe the fields i am trying to hide are not parent of the label field but are children of the label field

8681407
post	get
personally i prefer to get a signed request of the javascript sdk send this to the backend as a post var and then decode this signed request there to validate the call.

8681416
for-loop	loops
how about if you loops through it with a classical for-loop

8681423
width	height
you can limit it by width or height property

8681423
width	height
in this case width and height will automatically adjust by situation but not great than you specify

8681439
hide	show
then i just got the closest element that is a parent of the current input element and hide show the elements with class anon nut maybe you need something different

8681441
children	parent
that way you should be able to detect the parent li and then just get all of it s children to reorder

8681455
disk	ram
however building a compiler be it gcc or clang requires a lot of resources disk space several gigabytes and also ram cpu time and some of your time and efforts

8681482
mouseup	mousedown
how can i do an event to handle dragging since mousedown and mouseup have already been registered to other event handlers

8681579
mouseup	mousedown
if you create a isdragging boolean instance field which you set to true in the mousedown and false in mouseup then you can use the mouse move event to detect whether the object should be moved or not

8681587
disk	ram
it tries hard to avoid doing that swapping pages to disk is very slow because the disk access time is in dozens of milliseconds while the ram access time is in tenth of microsecond

8681593
for-loop	arrays
i am wondering if javascript has an enhanced for-loop syntax that allows you to iterate over arrays

8681602
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you ll need to use a combination of mousedown mousemove and mouseup events

8681602
move	drag
in mousemove you check to see if the button is still down and the cursor has move further than systeminformation.dragsize which indicates that the user is dragging rather than clicking and start the drag operation if needed

8681629
submit	submission
i know the php works because the correct alert pops up when a username is taken or not but i cannot get it to submit the form when the response is yes without it submission when the response is also no

8681645
versioning	upgrade
because of new wxwidget upgrade i prefer to put the compiled versioning of wxwidgets in my home folder to keep an eye on all files

8681664
int	chars
you can save the int as chars literal with an array

8681684
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
using nsjsonserialization on a returned nsdata from a network call i get back a nested structure of nsdictionaries and nsarrays

8681703
serializable	deserialization
the serializable code comes from restart and the deserialization code comes from xmonad

8681775
google-chrome	firefox
if you use other browsers like google-chrome and firefox they might not allow you to run a web app from a file url

8681792

8681819
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and ie9 the new tab window closes as it should

couchbase mobile couchdb on server couchdb on device

8681889
mongodb	bson
well i still have not found a function that bson field of mongodb appear dynamically according to the query given by user

8681903
google-chrome	firefox
one thing that i ve noticed is that my browser window in google-chrome won t resize below 400px it just gets stuck there and in firefox as i scale down it it just stops at around 400px and then pops a horizontal scroll bar

8681903
opera	google-chrome
so it works with opera and not in google-chrome or ff.

8681928
disk	ram
by the way there is a difference between keeping a cleartext password in memory and erasing it from there as soon as possible or better locking that region in ram or having encrypted swap and writing that cleartext password to disk

8681943
put	get
when i put this method on the base class and call it through a concrete class transaction.getlatest i get an error

8681948
temporary	tablespace
they sometimes require more resources like more temporary tablespace but your distinct cursor is probably already sorting the entire table on disk anyway

8681950
min	max
also see array_count_values or alternatively compute the min and max inside the counting loop

8681967
struts	xwork
following are the my struts and xwork jar versions

8681975
hide	show
what you can do is set the rootviewcontroller as a tabbarcontroller and add a tab for your login screen but make sure to hide the tabbar initially after the user login you can remove the tab programatically and show the tabbar

8681999
put	get
basically this allows you to put your response into a contain that has all of these nice methods that you want and if you simply want to get the wrapped response you can just call the wrapper s get method

8682033
opera	firefox
the following js code works fine on ie9 firefox opera

8682222
hide	show
basic logic question about show and hide

8682245
children	parent
why adding a comment to member function resets the collection of parent class children syntax nodes

8682249
put	get
what i m looking for a is a nice fast simple way to store at most a gig of data or tens of millions of entries on disk that can be get and put by multiple processes

8682249
versioning	upgrade
it needs to be upgrade to the new queue versioning

8682289
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie opera and google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox

8682305

your document body is height 0 and width 0 if you try to give it some height or width the image should be displayed

8682325
post	get
i can t seem to figure out how to get it to post to a fan page as the fan page

8682330
stdout	stderr
i am using nstask and verified that i was able to capture both stdout and stderr error and print the output to a uitextfield

8682341
onresume	onpause
basically you need to save state in an onpause function and restore it with an onresume function

8682345

i have a uniformgrid object in my wpf project that has 2 rows and 3 cols and its width and height are set to auto with both alignments set to stretch

8682348
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uitabbarcontroller is set by giving it an nsarray of uiviewcontroller s or even uinavigationcontroller s

8682348
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller is set by giving it a uiviewcontroller that will be the root

8682351
vbscript	vb6
however older com vb6 vbscript dictionaries don t work like that

8682357
int	chars
the form above chars p hello tells the compiler i ve got an array of values coming up please allocate as much space as is needed for them. it also works with int for example

8682363
button	checkbox
i want to do this with the checkbox and a button that gets all the checked rows

8682369
google-chrome	safari
apparently webkit used by safari and google-chrome applies a negative outline-offset to focused form inputs

8682386
atof	strtod
you can use strtod instead of atof

8682413
jobs	cron
but since cron jobs often start a few seconds after they re scheduled to run you shouldn t be testing for equality with 06 00 00

to do that you would then need to write a loops that uses strtok or even just a simple for-loop evaluating each character in the string and swapping it for whatever character you prefer

8685864
put	get
i ve created an android app and i m ready to put it on the android market but i get this error when trying to export to an apk

8685893
put	get
you probably will need to monitor that it doesn t get put back too

8685907
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your intl extension with a newer icu versioning 4+

8685968
apache	nginx
run your node.js service behind a web-proxy like nginx or apache - something that can do connection throttling unless you want overload conditions to bring the box down completely rewrite urls serve static content and proxy other sub-services

8685985
jar	war
all i need to do is load the application context from jar file which is being included in war file s lib folder

8686024
int	chars
if you re writing the two-byte int to standard out and treating it as two ascii chars or utf-8 chars chances are good it ll just look like garbage

8686049
ubuntu	linux
when i tried to use mkbundle on linux virtual machine i successfully obtained linux executable but get the following error whenever i run the program under ubuntu linux vm by oracle vm virtual box

8686061

mouse	keyboard
how do i set a low level mouse hook and keyboard hook in c#

8686123
switching	screens
i known i can t switching desktop while the screens is locked but is there a grace period after the desktop is unlocked in which i can t call switchdesktop

8686141
installation	upgrade
this is a major upgrade to your codeigniter installation release date july 12 2007.

8686152
postgresql	mysql
in fact some people use sqlite for prototyping and then switch to mysql postgresql in production

8686152
hash	md5
oh and one last thing store password hash md5 or sha1 not the raw passwords

8686153
postgresql	mysql
other dbmss like mysql postgresql oracle etc. have a central location for the databases a server to manage them and a client that connects to the server and handles all the database access

8686188
google-chrome	firefox
i have my web browser firefox 10 and google-chrome 16 set so that when a new page opens it is opened within the same window in a new tab

8686234
for-loop	loops
if you must remove items as you go it is easy with a conventional for-loop that iterates backwards such that removing items won t screw up loops counter

8686249
width	height
are you looking to build a fluid height and width layout

8686282
put	get
i get a success message that its been put in but when i start my activity that pulls the data it crashes

8686296
uninstall	upgrade
the easiest way is to uninstall 4.2 and then install 4.1 then upgrade to 4.2

8686298
post	put
the challenge is that the number of post is variable so all of the post need to be uniquely identified so that when the data is put into the database i know which post it relates to

8686395
rss	feed
i don t know for example what to do a google search for or whether i really need to set up a media rss feed - as cooliris requires

8686411
rss	feed
the stories or rss feed items are displayed in a row that scrolls

8686425
rss	feed
i m guessing since this is an rss feed this data is loaded dynamically

8686453
subtract	add
if you subtract x last time add it this time

8686503
post	get
you can always send along some data from your javascript with your request via post or get

8686509
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
basically all you need to do is give your modal a fixed position top margin 50 left margin 50 and then offset top left by 50 of your modal height width repectively

8686514
width	height
i am trying to set the size of my image using getlayoutparams height width but the problem is all my numbers are store in values folder

8686571
opera	firefox
but firefox 3.5 and above opera 10 and above i haven t tested below 10 and internet explorer 8 and above render it like this

8686615
submit	submission
you should write your form submission to submit both user ids to your controller with an indication of the winning user

8686628
width	height
everything was going fine until i added some divs that were positioned relatively and had width and height to the absolute div pop-up

8686645
chunked	transfer-encoding
after hours of struggling reading every possible related article i came across this restlet discussion and noticed that indeed i do have transfer-encoding chunked on the http header of the response

8686645
chunked	transfer-encoding
i tried the proposed solutions override clientresource.torepresentation didn t do any good so i tried restlet 2.1 as susggested with clientresource.setreâ questentitybufferingâ true no luck there either but i am not convinced my issue is related to transfer-encoding chunked at all

8686651
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy
i overheard sometime ago a discussion about how when creating a templated string class that you should not use strcmp strcpy and strlen for a templated string class that can make use of utf8 and utf16

8686651
unsigned	short
this is where utf8 will be a unsigned char and utf16 is an unsigned short

8686656
background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-image	background-image	background-position
do background-image background-repeat and background-position are lost

8686661
background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-image	background-image	background-position
background-image background-repeat and background-position among other things will be implicitly set to their default values when you leave them out in the shorthand property

8686674
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy
the reason you can t use strcmp strcpy or strlen is that they operate on strings whose length is indicate by a terminating zero byte

8686675
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy
strcmp strcpy and strlen will return incorrect results for strings like that because they operate under the assumption that strings are zero-terminated

8686678
post	get
for some reason whenever i run my code i get a nullpointerexception i will post the logcat

8686726
post	get
i am trying to submit a simple post form to a website to get past the form screen and download data from the site

8686744
submit	submission
try to do your ajax handling after clicking the submit button instead of doing with jquery form submission perhaps you re submission the form data through ajax only

8686744
submit	submission
i seems you ve to submit the form from the validate function s submit callback handler submithandler to avoid the redirection after submission

8686746
google-chrome	firefox
nevertheless the code works fine in google-chrome and browsers powered by webkit engines but it doesn t work in firefox i haven t tested other browsers yet

8686746
google-chrome	firefox
is there any alternative for onfocusout attribute which is supported at least by firefox and google-chrome

8686777
versioning	upgrade
they are actually improving this to look more like wpf however with syncfusion one issue is when you upgrade to a new versioning it always breaks previous versioning based code

8686795
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
there is no way short of an activex control of some sort which won t work in firefox google-chrome safari opera etc.. to render the iamge people see

8686804
octal	hex
does anyone have a function awk bash perl.etc that could scan each line and then output in octal hex or ascii - either is fine a distinct list of the control characters for simplicity control characters being those above ascii char 126 found

8686836
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that has a subviews

8686836
uiview	subviews
then when i use i need it to go back to the uiview with the subviews not just the subviews that presents the modal view

8686848
cos	sin
x r sin q cos f

8686853
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy
with that said the reason you can t use strcmp strcpy and strlen for your templated string type is that they all operate on null terminated byte sequences

8686853
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy
so strcmp strcpy and strlen are all specialized versions of algorithms that can be implemented more generally

8686882
switching	screens
switching firefox into full screens mode it seems that the top bar is the cause for the offset so when it s not visible there is no offset

8686925
post	get
however today i found if the request which cause exception is get it works if it is a post then nothing rendered it just return 404 to browser

8686936
versioning	upgrade
btw you are using the old versioning now deprecated of google maps api ...you should upgrade to v3

8686939
mvp	presenter
as i understand it mvp is a derivative of mvc where the model and the view are loosely or completely decoupled and the presenter replaces the controller and acts as the bridge between the view and the model

8686949
hide	show
but when i modify properties of this record and hide the form window the grid does not show updated values

8686981
put	get
also when i go to my form page directly and not as a link through the parent window if i manually put a get variable into the url it still gives me the same errors which leads me to believe i m just missing something basic

8686999
post	get
should i have post request to push ids to appointment form or should i use get request to create a new form

8687023
google-chrome	firefox
it works on my pc with google-chrome and firefox but doesn t work on ipad 2 with ios 5.0.1 i did as

8687084
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
additionally using java.util.date is not good practice at all since most of its method are deprecated so i suggest you to use java.util.calendar which is more flexible

8687148
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm i7 cpu 870 2.93ghz

8687148
opensuse	linux
each os windows xp 32 bit and linux opensuse 11.4 32 bit are installed on same machines

8687276
prng	random
periodically add new random material to the prng seed by making a call to

8687293
children	parent
in this case you can also read more data given a parent read all the children to fill up the cache faster

8687295
int	double
i think i have read somewhere once that an intermediate long double type is used but this still wouldn t clarify why the converted value is dirty because a conversion from int to double for doesn t have any similar effects i think

8687305
implements	extends
below servicebound is a callback that i have implements in the connectedactivity class so that classes that are extends the conntectedactivity can take action once the service is bound

8687312
hlsl	glsl
on a side note i m adding in vector property syntax similar to hlsl glsl vec1.yxz + vec2.xyz

8687325
google-chrome	firefox
this will also modify the trusted sites used by firefox and google-chrome so you don t get the warnings on them either

8687335
width	height
this is a bit of a shot in the dark but i d assume that you could parse the png header to retrieve the width height of the image take a look at this rfc for png details

8687379
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
and i try to backspace for remove mylink html tag it doesn t work in firefox but it works in google-chrome opera safari and explorer

8687480
swt	nebula
one place to look for swt widgets that are new or experimental is the nebula project but i don t see it there either

8687492
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i have placed clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml files in wwwroot folder

8687506
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think most probably you have a uinavigationcontroller in your main window it can be a uitabbarcontroller etc but if you have a uinavigationcontroller in your main window then you can check the top view controller of your uinavigationcontroller by using or you can also check for uinavigationcontroller s viewcontrollers stack that returns an array of all view controller s you pushed in uinavigationcontroller and can get the last object of that array which is your top view by using

8687506
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you have a uitabbarcontroller in your main window then you can get the instance of uinavigationcontroller if its there by using and can do the above steps to get the top view

8687523
google-chrome	safari
check it in a google-chrome or safari

8687586
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome firefox 3.6 explorer 8 oper and it works fine

8687594
migrate	staging
i did bundle exec rake --trace db migrate on the staging server and got the following error messages

8687626
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox ie 8 and google-chrome and was able to remove with backspace but the user experiance is different in firefox and other browsers

8687637
opencv	cimg
i m working on robot vision system and its main purpose is to detect objects i want to choose one of these libraries cimg opencv and i have knowledge about both of them

8687641
portrait	landscape
you can use separate xml for portrait and landscape mode

8687653
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
and how do we set it to a text editor qplaintextedit qtextedit etc

8687706
width	height
i have one parent container which has 100 width and 100 height

8687735
post	get
gordonm s post is a good one to get you started

8687746
setinterval	settimeout
or change setinterval to settimeout which will fire itself unless exception is thrown like for example cannot send data to disconnected client

8687749
free	strncpy	strlen	strncpy
when you need storage for a new string strncpy it to free and increase free with the strlen

8687802
int	chars
int instead of chars

8687803
width	height
on each device the camera will scale itself to fit the resolution as good possible while keeping the ratio between width height

8687803
width	height
then it will be scaled by the camera-to-device-screen scaling which changes from one device to another but the ratio will remain constant - the game will not look like a bad scaled image on devices with a different resoltuion that the camera width height ratio

8687817
int	chars
assuming 32bit int 8bit chars and a litte-endian environment say x86 arr will be like this in memory

8687838
int	chars
this is because an int is 4 bytes long whereas a chars is only 1 byte long

8687838
int	chars
so when the int array is cast to chars you iterate over it byte by byte or chars by chars not by four bytes int by int

8687856
min	max
we return a full set of data from all columns in table2 as well as the additional newmin and newmax which are populated by the min and max functions on the subquery column price that has the limits applied

8687856
min	max
this now gives a final result of item count totalavg min max for each item

8687867
superclass	subclassing
so i have done a superclass that i call account and then two subclassing that i call savingsaccount and creditaccount

8687889
try-catch	exception-handling
exception-handling plus try-catch program cannot complete computation due to some error in the application not related to the input

8687913
accelerometer	gyroscope
accelerometer gyroscope set it so that your app receives maximum updates keep the update intervals shortest possible move the phone around

8687917
children	parent
assuming that your parent array will always return bunch of children arrays.

8687973
teamcity	jenkins	cruisecontrol	jenkins	cruisecontrol	teamcity	hudson	bamboo
if you didn t use continuous integration before and do not where to start there are plenty of choices cruisecontrol also cruisecontrol.net and cruisecontrol.rb hudson jenkins bamboo teamcity continuum etc

8688038
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly on internet explorer and firefox but does nothing in google-chrome

8688059
post	get
it sounds like you ll want to get rather than post because you re presenting a form rather than immediately creating the record

8688076
bugsense	acra
if you can t get it reproduced i suggest you take a look at acra and bugsense

8688085
free	malloc
instead i ve used malloc and i free the memory in the caller function once it s no longer needed

8688087
for-loop	arrays
but i think this algorithm would not be very efficient when the number of curves increases because i have to store all the points in the arrays and i have to run for-loop to draw each curve every time i go for modification

8688123
super	self
super parent2 self .__init__ x y would call object.__init__ x y

8688127
bash	zsh
your current shell should support this kind of substitution bash and zsh do

8688147
d3.js	protovis
so you can then write r server pages that return json-encoded data that you can feed to protovis - or if you want to get right up to date to d3.js which is protovis++ and made of win

8688158
children	parent
unspecified - meaning that it will make whatever decision it makes according to the parameters of the parent children device size etc.

8688166
children	parent
eventually all the children were updating the file at the same time and i had to restart the parent

8688170
dbcontext	objectcontext
this is fed into dynamic data which as i discovered uses the dbcontext s internal objectcontext to which i have access when casting to iobjectcontextadapter

8688170
dbcontext	objectcontext
the dbcontext s savechanges is not called the objectcontext s savechanges is used instead

8688183
integer	unsigned
check the type of n is not of an unsigned integer type

8688183
integer	unsigned
the result of an object of unsigned integer type when checked if greater or equal to 0 is always 1 true

8688204
public	protected
but if the class is public and the readonly member is public protected or protected internal then no warning for you

8688204
public	protected
edit for a moment you might think that the compiler refrains from issuing the warning in the case of public and protected members because it is reasonable to expect that derived classes might initialize the field

8688204
public	protected
edit2 if my memory serves me well java gives all the proper warnings in all cases regardless of whether the uninitialized final member is public protected or private and regardless of whether the class containing it is public or visible only within its package

8688214
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
more of that we read about such options like gwt-rpc an older version of requestfactory and restygwt

8688284
memcpy	calloc
only that it would be not possible to check the return of calloc before doing the memcpy

8688316
google-chrome	firefox
this page works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but at the beforesend function in ie8 i always get all fields are required no matter what i do

8688323
google-chrome	firefox
in 50ms google-chrome has still begun the redirection while firefox and ie not

8688333
versioning	upgrade
this is long for such an upgrade but i ve also done a lot of clean up work as the 1.3.x versioning was not very well built by another web agency

8688344
libjpeg	libexif
i get the x-resolution and y-resolution using libexif because libjpeg doesn t support this says 72 dpi and i use tiffsetfield to set the corresponding field of the tiff to be generated with no error occurred

8688359
jqxhr	deferred
however if you can guarantee running with jquery 1.5 or later then a better method is to just have gettweets return the jqxhr object and then you can use deferred methods in the client code

8688361
width	height
there you can choose width and height for your applet

8688363
hide	show
i call hide function when document ready on a specific that has display block and visibility visible by default we show it by default and we try to hide it with jquery

8688378
hide	show
oh and you don t need to use visibility at all - show and hide will only use the display property anyway

8688378
hide	show
in case the element you want to hide is a please enable javascript warning consider using - then it will never show up unless js is disabled

8688417
passenger	unicorn
and uninstall those seperatly passenger unicorn mongrel etc

8688434
textview	imageview
and created a customadapter by using another layout which which have one imageview and textview

8688447
cashapelayer	uibezierpath
you can represent individual curves as uibezierpath s and draw them separately by creating one cashapelayer per curve and assigning the shape layer s path property to the corresponding cgpath property of the bezier path

8688480
requestfactory	gwt
originally requestfactory was created for gwt

8688480
requestfactory	gwt
the upside of requestfactory is that is seamlessly works with gwt and android

8688491
comparator	comparable
string implements interface comparable so overrides comparator method thus you can compare two strings

8688502
public	protected
public and protected member can be accessed outside the assembly scope and by the class consumer and the developer might actually want the value of the variable to be its default

8688521
fontfamily	font-size
but you can make text in span and input elements look the same with the usual css caveats of course by explicitly setting their fontfamily and font-size

8688587
put	get
e.g if i comment out the json_encode 1 and put random html code instead of data in my success part i get results displayed in my browser

8688602
ant	maven	ant	cruisecontrol
use build tool ant maven whatever and continuous integration tool cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.rb hudson etc

8688602
ant	cruisecontrol
i would recommend spending some time to learn basics of build management ant and continuous integration cruisecontrol to perform deployment in a most appropriate fashion

8688629

8688694
int	chars
binary arithmetic operations on chars and byte and short promote to int -- jls 5.6.2

8688701
int	double
according to the binary promotion rules if neither of the operands is double float or long both are promoted to int

8688706
freemarker	velocity
jsp velocity and freemarker are not template engines with your meaning of a template engine

8688708
int	chars
the result of adding java chars shorts or bytes is an int

8688708
int	double
for example for adding there are instructions iadd for int ladd for longs fadd for floats dadd for double and that s it

8688708
int	chars
to simulate with the smaller types the compiler will use iadd and then zero the upper bytes of the int using an instruction like i2c int to chars

8688739
int	chars
an implicit conversion is performed a primitive narrowing conversion from int to chars

8688766
post	get
i changed my code to post the objectid for the edittextview i get in a textview and i get unique object ids

8688864
post	get
which works except for repetition such as get get or post post post and absent whitespace such as getpost or postputdelete

8688864
post	put	post	get	put	get
thankfully this list is for the time being fixed to the four usual transport methods get post put and delete so i figured

8688869
exif	xmp
allows reading writing and display of the following jpeg metadata formats exif 2.2 xmp rdf iptc-naa iim 4.1 ect

8688869
exif	xmp
itâ s basically got it all â exif iptc and xmp support read write and support for manufacturer extensions

8688873
stdout	stderr
such an app would need to capture stdout and stderr and report the results to the user compile errors

my main suspicion is that i m not mapping the textures correctly - my textures are not powers of 2 nor are they square - their width is in the field mwidth and their height in mrowheight

8689016
innodb	myisam
this is why you can have the same partitioning support for innodb myisam etc .

8689027
client-side	server-side
what i need is an easy way to say increment the model by 1 server-side instead of increment the model by 1 client-side and hope there will be no conflict

8689050
mouse	keyboard
dragon speech dictation software is popular in the medical and legal industries and among those with rsi and other movement disabilities and for technophile adopters who enjoy it for continuous speech to text transcription and command and control of system guis to replace using a keyboard and mouse

8689061
min	max
i want to get the usage value for both the max and min logtimes

8689061
min	max
this seems like a messy way to do it as i m basically running the same query twice once with max and once with min

8689061
min	max
i can get both logtime columns in one query by doing select usage max logtime min logtime from .

8689077
int	chars
while you have the correct answer already referenced in the jls here s a bit of code to verify that you get an int when adding two chars s

8689087
uiview	subviews
the first page contains two subviews a kind of canvas uiview subclass that the user can paint on with touches and a control panel uiview subclass full of uicontrols

int	chars
basically i get a signed chars output from the variable rssi and want to convert it to an int and a string the string for outputting to the log and the int for further calculation

8689146
public	protected
the problem is that interfaces by design only specify the signature for public functions whereas the function in checkbox is set as protected

8689153
post	get

google-chrome	firefox
this is how it looks in firefox google-chrome the expected display

8692026
int	chars
you re trying to display chars as if they were int

either change your chars array to an int array very easy or every time you display the data cast it to int tedious

8692030
free	malloc
given just a pointer value there is no portable reliable way to determine if it was allocated by new by malloc or if it even points to something on the free store as your first method shows the pointer passed may actually point to an object on automatic storage

8692042

after running this query how can i memcache entities that match each prop separately

8692072

dlsym	dlopen
for example the dlopen and dlsym on unix-like systems allow you to load a shared object library and resolve functions in that library by name

8692204
salt	md5
it is not as though there could be made with current knowledge any brute-force decryption tables for aes and even a 16 bit salt pains the creation of md5 tables

8692215
onfocus	onblur
in general testing the onfocus and onblur events in selenium is very difficult

you generally do not have to put anything to the pool or get anything from the pool

8692383
oncreate	setcontentview
requestwindowfeature must be called before you call setcontentview view in your activity s oncreate

8692386
try-catch	exception-handling
the first thing that comes to mind is to wrap the entire thing in a try-catch statement and throw exception-handling instead of using the if else blocks

8692392
try-catch	exception-handling
with this approach you will find that you do not need to add many try-catch blocks you will tend to use them at the point of integration with services such as filesystem network etc ... but your business logic is almost always free of exception-handling handling mechanisms

8692411
ubuntu	linux
now we started a new project on linux ubuntu and for that we use svn tortoise

8692413
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
you will need to use avfoundation probably avaudioplayer to play the song

8692435
jtextfield	jlabel
as discussed in how to use tables concepts editors and renderers a table s default renderer is a jlabel and the default editor is a jtextfield

8692438
valgrind	memcheck
if you can compile your code on a supported platform you should certainly give valgrind memcheck tool a try

8692451
free	malloc
it s interesting that majority preference was to insert custom hooks into malloc free and then add even more code for custom hooks into operators new delete

8692451
free	malloc
it already has full reporting and aggregation of statistics which is something you d have to write on top of just intercepting malloc free

8692451
free	malloc
detecting malloc free leaks which occurred in someone else s code not specifically the dll under your control

8692455
getter	setter
shouldn t the getter setter be defined something like

8692461
post	put
should i use post on the resources uri and return the uri to the newly created resource in the response or should i use put on the resources id uri

8692461
put	get
a get request for resources id would surely return a 404 but should put return a 404 as well

8692479
realloc	malloc
i wrote my own mymalloc myrealloc and myfree and overloaded new and delete so that they would call my functions. then i wrote malloc and realloc macros which invoked mymalloc and myrealloc passing them __file__ and __line__

8692481
rss	feed
so i m putting together an rss parser which will process an rss feed filter it and then download the matched items

8692490
implements	extends
2nd way would be if you dont want to re-create the svg then i guess create a rectangle in your class which extends sprite keep the rectangle dimensions such that it wraps the sprite and then implements the collides with function with the rectangle instead of whole svg

8692513
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven project that was created from a pom.xml file as described in the following link

8692517
qgraphicsscene	qwidget

disk	ram
i am actually interested to know the api used to create a ram disk

8692521
disk	ram
i wish to extract the archive into a ram disk and pass the third party the path to the respective directory on that ram disk

8692539
hide	show
then you can just hide the grid element or show it

8692541
rar	zip
any way to disable that and disable showing its contents when opened using zip rar egg jar

8692567
disk	ram
there is no api to create a ram disk per se

8692567
disk	ram
now if for some reason you cannot rely on the presence of a ramdisk on a system and you absolutely need the fastest performance possible then i see no option but to install a third-party perhaps freely downloadable perhaps even open source ram disk use it temporarily and then uninstall it

8692582
disk	ram
that is i ve never been able to do what you might want to bring the database into ram from disk and then point mysql at it and expect mysql to understand it for example i don t believe that mysql can grok an idx file that used to be on disk and is now in ram

8692591
put	get
at this moment when user calls create record action i save new record get its database id generate record number using this id then put it to the edit form

8692596
hash	md5
say that your outdated hash method is md5 and you want to replace it with the more secure sha1 this is what you do

8692596
hash	salt
a user logs in you hash its password with the new method sha1 and salt

8692596
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
1 you hash with the old method md5 and salt

8692596
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
a if a match is found corresponding username and password and method md5 you hash the password with the new method sha1 and salt and update the database accordingly

8692636
nsstring	nsdata
convert utf-8 encoded nsdata to nsstring

8692669
width	height
it is now agreed that percent for border-radius means the radius should be a percent of the element s box height and box width

8692669
google-chrome	safari
are not supported in older google-chrome and safari versions it was fixed in sepember 2010

8692670
versioning	upgrade
only when you are ready need you pay to upgrade to a fuller versioning

8692752
ienumerable	icollection
if the signature return type of get is not an icollection then the first will not work if it is not ienumerable then the second will not work

8692765
post	get
to get round this you could just select the data from the post table and then distinct it

8692768
udp	tcp
i tried looking into proc net tcp and proc net udp but they don t have the process name or process identifier like netstat displays it

8692805
int	boolean
in the mvertical is true condition of the onlayout boolean changed int l int t int r int b method of slidingdrawer or whatever variant of slidingdrawer you re using you should find the following line of code.

8692805
int	boolean
likewise if the sliding drawer is set to slide horizontal right-to-left or right-to-left in the mvertical is false condition of the onlayout boolean changed int l int t int r int b method find the following line of code.

8692822
opera	firefox
it works in firefox browsers but not in opera and ie

8692831

8692872
google-chrome	firefox
this function shows my body resolution in google-chrome my 1350x651 in firefox 1509x20 and in internet explorer nothing

8692902
width	height
for example a device of size 480 x 800 of high density will results in screen of 320 x 533 it divides by 1.5 both screen width and height and for screen of size 240x320 of low density it gives 320x426 again it divides by 0.75 both width and height

8692902
width	height
using a timer to query the screen s width and height prior to applying some css is unacceptable since on different devices different time intervals are needed 300ms 500ms - how can i apply css with different screen sizes

8692911
hash	md5
the platform has built-in functions for hashing md5 sha1 etc but not encryption so what i thought i d do is simply hash the data concatenated with some secret data to ensure that it was generated by my system and not an attacker

8692927
ienumerable	ilist
thanks for help with explaining to me about ilist and ienumerable

8692927
ienumerable	ilist
does the foreach need an ilist or and ienumerable

8692966
ienumerable	ienumerator
count extension method works for all objects that support ienumerable and since ienumerable itself does not have any means of reporting item count it may have to iterate over ienumerable instance using it s ienumerator which can be a real performance hit if called many times

8692966
ilist	icollection
however if you look into count implementation you ll see that it is optimized for icollection types both generic and non-generic at least in fw4.0 meaning ilist and are also optimized and if your object implements icollection which reports item count in count property count method returns item count without iterating through collection

8692966
ilist	icollection
nevertheless if you know that you have icollection or ilist instance why not get count property directly and be independent of count method implementation

8693025
post	get
i would like to get the id of a class that is created in a while loop the id of the class being the id of the user who made that post and then send the id to php

8693062
hide	show
on click for example button1 textcontainer1 should be show and hide any that was show before

8693062
hide	show
now it works only if i click button1 it hide textcontainer1 i know it should show it this here is just to see if the button works and that s good

8693080

i know that it is possible to just move the files outside of the protected directory but to make a long story short the folder needs to stay inside the protected folder but be accessible to all

8697751
getter	setter
other option is you can create a class that extends application and you can use a getter setter for the arraylist there in the application class

8697753
getter	setter
you can try getter setter method for transferring values between two classes

8697789

each report is generated by executing a sweave script and then compiling a pdf out of the resulting tex file

8698314

for instance if there is an error when executing r cmd sweave weekly.rnw it exits but still generates a tex file which i have checked cannot be stopped and this tex file would not compile correctly in pdflatex pdflatex weekly.tex command would hang and the shell script will not move to the next r cmd sweave daily.rnw

but if you are allowed to store whole tree into memory you can use lxml.html which is faster than beautifulsoup

8698365
portrait	landscape
i am a little confused about your question but what i think you are trying to ask is how to change your view if the screen is in landscape or portrait orientation

8698365
portrait	landscape
without seeing your code it is hard to tell you exactly how to do it but the general idea at least how i do it in my code is that you want to split your code into two parts one that is in landscape orientation and one that is in portrait orientation

8698365
width	height
you can tell the difference by seeing if the screen height is greater than the screen width

qobject	qwidget
while good advise for c++ in general answer 1 is actually wrong for a big part in qt qobject and with it all widgets since qwidget derives from qobject

if you express width and height in fixed units such as pixels you will achieve what i m thinking you need
