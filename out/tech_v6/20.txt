serializable	deserialization
this is a place from where serializable and deserialization starts

1000004
serializable	deserialization
however if serializable will be implemented with usage of java s classes converted with ikvm then there will be classnotfound exception thrown during deserialization

1000062
versioning	upgrade
ssis sql server integration services is an upgrade of dts data transformation services which is a feature of the previous versioning of sql server

1000062
bids	ssis
ssis packages can be created in bids business intelligence development studio

1000141
hide	show
with a dummy button btnloader to allow me to access the show and hide from code behind

1000163
client-side	server-side
for my data model i have typical objects like user etc. that are basically the same in the database the server-side java code and the client-side as code

1000204
merb	ruby-on-rails
forget about both and use j2ee ruby-on-rails merb django etc

1000218
awt	swing	swt	swing
any case where a method is deprecated because of defective design think anything dealing with date s in java or because a better way is now supported think awt to swing or swt requires far to much thought to be automated

1000281
hash	hmac
the subject of how to store web site users passwords in tables has come up several times on so and the general advice is to store a hash of the password eventually an hmac hash

1000299
put	get
i m currently building an app for my work it work perfectly on my pc but one i put the compile code on to the 2008 server with sqlserver 2005 and run it i get an sql error truncat data

1000402
disk	ram
it uses the magic of dma direct memory access allowing the data to go from disk to nic without ever going through ram or the cpu

1000484
submit	submission
i am trying to use this approach in a bug submission system where a form submit symptoms of a bug and i would like a screenshot of the error for debugging

1000489
hide	show
use say jquery to show hide each group

1000493
put	get
to the excellent points that have already been made here i would add that there is something about the high speed in which flash projects are put together and the fact that most will not need to be maintained that encourages people to just get things done as quickly as possible and singletons are a good way to make that happen and you can use getinstance rather than passing around references dependancy injection etc

1000589
int	chars
causes fprintf to pad the output until it is n chars wide where n is an int value stored in the a function argument just preceding that represented by the modified type

1000593
webkit	gecko
there is only a handful of browsers you need to test as some share a common rendering engine gecko or webkit

1000593
opera	firefox
build your site using firefox or opera on any platform

1000593
versioning	upgrade
test in ie 7 if you like and do the same or use conditional comments to ask users politely to upgrade their versioning of ie

1000593
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
finally try enlarging the text in firefox opera ie and safari

1000593
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
in practice i find that if a site has valid code and works in firefox safari and opera it ll probably be okay in ie7 up

1000643
cairngorm	flex
i am in the process of writing an application in flex 3.3 using the cairngorm framework for deployment as an air application

1000666
mouse	keyboard
in glade the fake-window that allows you to drag-and-drop components handles your mouse keyboard events and makes the backend calls to put the gui elements in place

1000681
children	parent
with a parent class foo and children bar baz bazza

1000742
rsa	aes
asymmetric encryption such as rsa have the notion of key pairs where each key in the pair can decrypt data encrypted with the other key in contrast to symmetric encryption such as aes where the same key works for both encryption and decryption

1000755
post	put
here is a way without cursors using the link that tekblues put in his post

1000774
inherited	properties
the list inherited all of the properties from all supertypes all types in the hiearchy contain the entire list for the hiearchy to make accessing the list as quick as possible

1000791
rsa	aes
the most practical use of assymmetric encryption like rsa is to encrypt the symmetric keys for aes or similar algorithm that were used to encrypt the data and also to sign a secure hash of the message digest sha-256 etc

1000803
postgresql	mysql
one of the team actually rewrote the database layer to use oracle or postgresql or mysql but it was slightly slower than the original

1000815
portrait	landscape
if i push another controller on top in the usual manner and then pop back to the portrait view it displays correctly - this only occurs when rotating back from landscape

1000844
many-to-many	many-to-one
an item is associated many-to-many to category and a category is mapped many-to-one to customer

1000886
erd	diagram
if it doesn t have to be an erd and can be say a uml class diagram you have a bit more scope because you can high level entities that effectively encompass multiple tables so you can have diagram at different levels

1000898
gif	png
using imagemagick ghostscript you can convert the pdf to some bitmap format gif png or jpg

1000908
public	protected
but a base class should have a destructor that is public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

1000915
entity-relationship	diagram
an entity-relationship diagram of 500 tables cannot be useful

1001006
gcov	lcov
i would suggest using gcov in conjunction with lcov

1001017
onchange	onkeyup
use onchange instead of onkeyup in this case

1001127
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i m a websphere esb consultant for ibm

1001127
websphere	ibm
in practice you will need websphere integration developer wid to do that - it would be a lot of work to create the mediations manually it s not documented and it s not supported by ibm either

1001172
content-length	content-type
when you re posting at minimun you need to define the content-type and content-length

1001196
datamapper	activerecord
between activerecord and datamapper i d chose the latter

1001196
datamapper	activerecord
both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

1001250
gcov	lcov
this should result in only the targeted areas emitting gcov artifacts which are blindly consumed by the lcov scripts

1001271
post	get
you may get a more complete answer if you post some code

1001323
entity-relationship	diagram
while not primarily a database tool it can reverse-engineer a database into an entity-relationship model then you can create one or more diagram from that model

1001327
int	chars
this requires sizeof int sizeof chars but it s definitely true for the discussed platforms

1001373
powerpc	i386
this is also much better than fixing the endianness at compile time - for os which support multi-architecture fat binary on mac os x for example this will work for both powerpc i386 whereas it is very easy to mess things up otherwise

1001394
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this solution works on ie7 firefox safari google-chrome and opera

1001459
jdom	xom
if you need to keep the tree in memory to navigate xom or jdom are good choices

1001459
xslt	xquery
for example the saxon xslt xquery engine works with dom sax or stax but builds internally a tinytree default or dom optional

1001531
folder	directory
you can set up individual sites in iis that point to the a shared directory or use a virtual directory in each where all the logic sits but you can t share the app_code folder

1001535
g++	gcc
hi all quick question i m in a situation where it would be useful to generate my c++ executable using only gcc without g++

1001535
submit	submission
reason for this is that i have to submit the code to an automatic submission server which doesn t recognize the g++ or c++ for that matter command

1001535
g++	gcc
now based on what i understood from the gcc man page i may be way off so tell me if i am g++ is basically gcc but it links the c++ library

1001562
fileoutputstream	filewriter
instead of using filewriter create a fileoutputstream

1001575
maven	pom.xml
the resolved pom.xml is output to the output directory target with the name resolved-pom.xml by default these two properties can be overridden with the usual maven plugin configuration approach by setting the outputdir and or pomfilename properties

1001590
xslt	xquery
you can then use xslt or xquery to create versions in specific languages on-demand or at least enable the reader to do so

1001590
xslt	xquery
that s harder to do if you use but if you use the above your xslt or xquery could actually generate another file with the comments in the target language

1001609
extjs	qooxdoo
when i have to build rich browser-side applications i d always switch to the big solutions extjs yui qooxdoo that offer a variety of ready to use widgets

1001710
centos	linux
as i make the full switch from windows to linux centos 5 i m in search of the best free gui sql client tool for mssql mysql oracle etc.

1001725
versioning	upgrade
if it s an older versioning then upgrade it to the newer versioning and things should work

1001732
gentoo	linux
p the question is - what system call does the php flock function call boil down to on a gentoo linux system

1001751
width	height
in your stylesheet give them absolute positioning your png as a background image with background-repeat set to no-repeat and an explicit height and width that s the exact size of your rounded corner

1001751
width	height
edit you ll probably still run into problems with div#corners having an explicit height and width and acting as a layer

1001806
ant	maven
we use maven ant s big brother for all our java projects and it has a very nifty war plugin

1001806
ant	maven
it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure

1001813
post	get
to get progress information on an upload process the server would have to provide the information which would require a means of communication between the server and the client during the operation which isn t there for a regular http post operation

1001827
jar	war
a war file is simply a jar file with a war extension but what makes it work is how the contents is actually structured

1001847
gridview	radgrid
i have problems binding both a telerik radgrid and a plain vanilla asp.net gridview to the results of the following linq to entities query

1001855
vbscript	vba
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that

1001906
vim	emacs
certainly vim and emacs will

1001910
client-side	server-side
this allows you to do things like format a javascript regular expression as a python string so your server-side python script can feed a regex into client-side javascript code

1001916
translation	localization
you re probably not going to do automatic localization but you can probably automate the process as far as gathering together the changed comments sending them off to be localized then incorporating the translation documents into your documentation once they return from being translation

1001919
multiplying	add
however if you can add then multiplying then you can t check only add and multiplying individually you must check them in all their possible permutations

1001953
oncreate	setcontentview
the next thing that you will need to do is let your activity know that you are using a custom layout by calling setcontentview in your activities oncreate

1002004
mouse	keyboard
in this small class i have widgets which are supposed to react to mouse or keyboard event

1002054
bufferedreader	printwriter
i m using bufferedreader and printwriter to go through each line of an input file make a change to some lines and output the result

1002078
fileoutputstream	printwriter
where do you flush close your printwriter or fileoutputstream

1002178
folder	directory
i d recommend you create a folder in that directory for your application and copy there

1002181
public	protected
btw this is slightly misleading a base class should have a destructor that is public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

1002189
installation	upgrade
.net 2.0 installation upgrade the script mappings to 2.0 and that doesn t work for all web applications

1002196
gridview	objectdatasource
i am working with a gridview and an objectdatasource

1002196
gridview	objectdatasource
using an objectdatasource with a gridview requires implementing a method called select that provides a sort expression the number of rows to return and the start row

1002211
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
how do i collect all the checkbox and dropdownlistfor items in jquery for saving

1002257
nunit	moq
i have been following some asp.net mvc tutorials that use nunit for testing and moq for mocking

1002265
hide	show
that will show the element with id mycontrol when the checkbox is checked and hide it after it has been unchecked

1002395
webkit	gecko
i tried setting wmode transparent but while it works in webkit browsers and ie it fails in gecko browsers

1002440
perl	tcl
i d like to add perl which much like tcl has interpreter-based threads

1002468
union	distinct
use a distinct with a subquery which contains a union

1002497
xmltype	clob
then take your clob or bfile and convert it to an xmltype column with the defined schema and you re done -- the shredding happens automatically the data is all there it s all relational it s all available to standard sql without the xquery or xml extensions

1002497
xmltype	clob
of course if you d rather use xquery then just take the clob or bfile convert it to an xmltype and go for it

1002523
waitpid	fork
why not use fork and exec and simply don t call waitpid

1002540
pentaho	olap
1 i only have experience creating olap cubes with mondrian pentaho which does allow you to revise the cube s schema which is just an xml file and rebuild them or in pentaho-speak publish

1002544
post	get
not sure if this is the best way but you could redirect to a reload page and use the values from post or get to reinput the existing fields

1002544
post	get
then the post or get will have all of the values the user filled in and the missing required fields will already be blank so you just loop through and load up the supplied info

1002549
post	get
i want to use the name of the input button to get the recordid to edit and post it to a new page using http post as opposed to an url param

1002584
folder	directory
i would probably write it to a folder contained within a directory of the application itself

1002585
stdout	stderr
redirecting stderr to stdout a couple of gotchas

1002593
button	checkbox
so you can use them very easily in the case of text-fields but a bit more work is required for select options checkbox and radio button

1002593
button	checkbox
for radio button select options and checkbox you instead have to check the value to see if it corresponds with the entry you are currently outputting and print selected selected

1002618
icmp	udp
the udp socket will recvfrom any host sending to this one with correct port unless you explicitly connect in which case you can just write and read and get errors upon received icmp messages

1002653
inherited	subclassing
since i strive to document the apis for my framework as completely as is reasonable i would like the documentation for my custom subclassing generated by doxygen to include descriptions of the most common methods of ns mutable dictionary so users don t have to look at another page just to the methods that a particular custom dictionary inherited unchanged

1002659
union	distinct
use distinct and union

1002667
ubuntu	linux
i am currently trying to compile and build qt for embedded linux on an ubuntu box for arm architecture

1002691
put	get
quite simply put code behind is hard to unit-test but can and usually does include logic that doesn t get tested

1002698
pull	push
if you are using a standard web server it will never push anything to you - your client will have to periodically pull from it instead

1002752
folder	directory
iâ ve checked the â œbinâ directory in my project folder

1002770
inline	inlining
note that if most widgets belong to classes that your container cannot possibly know about because they re in different libraries for example then you can t possibly have inlining unless your dynamic linker can inline

1002956
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so in your case if i understand correctly you simply have to override the viewwillappear or viewdidappear method on what you call the parent page which is presumably handled by a uiviewcontroller and put in code to update the appearance of the page to reflect the data just entered

1002983
hash	md5
it could be that the checksum is simply a crc or md5 or other hash appended to the end of the firmware or it could be in a header somewhere

1003023
dictionary	map
i have a dictionary to map a certain type to a certain generic object for that type

1003037
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview with an objectdatasource and i want to be able to sort it

1003074
post	get
i haven t had time to get this to work yet but there is code for a vs2003 2005 add-in to auto-sync here see the post marked answer

1003075
eiffel	spec#
not having ever used eiffel i can t comment on the comparison but i have messed around with spec# which has design by contract and is what is mostly being rolled into c# 4.0 and i can say this

1003097
swt	swing
for a quick demonstrator i m looking for a swt or swing component which can display geographical data

1003128
folder	directory
should i place my app cake and vendor folder as well as .htaccess and index.php files in the public_html directory

1003140
implements	extends
then extends observablecollection for each of your custom classes implements the itoggle interface

1003159
codeigniter	cakephp
in php cakephp and codeigniter do as well and i m sure most good frameworks do this as it falls under the category of common tasks that frameworks are supposed to abstract away

1003167
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
develop test interfaces in firefox safari opera google-chrome arora etc. first

1003195
vb6	vba
microsoft wrote a whitepaper many years ago detailing some best practices for writing dlls to use with vb5 vb6 which of course would also apply to vba

1003237
put	get
i was under the misguided impression up until a couple of years ago that i could get away with only synchronising the put and remove operations on a hashmap

1003238
maven	pom.xml
when configuring maven to look at internal repositories is it best to put that information in the project pom.xml or in a user s settings.xml

1003258
rss	feed
rss feed

1003262
maven	pom.xml	put	get
i encourage you to put the repository definition in the pom.xml this way any developer just grab a copy of the code and run maven to get it compiled without having to change things in his settings file

1003282
websphere	ibm
this is under jdk1.5 and ibm websphere 6.1 rad7

1003310
user-controls	elementhost
it appears as though i m going to need to do a user-controls for the actual content and then host that content via a winforms form with an elementhost since user-controls has no showdialog method

1003329
pylons	turbogears
turbogears is a recent framework based on pylons

1003329
pylons	turbogears
for turbogears and pylons the most suitable solution is sqlalchemy which is actually the most complete and rising orm for python

1003383
centos	linux
fonts such as arial and verdana which many web designers take for granted may not be present on linux browsers even firefox on centos from experience

1003392
postgresql	mysql
the sqllite concat is the same as postgresql || and not mysql or mssql concat

1003423
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
i prefer to use django myself but given your needs i d go with pylons or turbogears rather then shoe-horning a different orm into the system

1003443
implements	extends
it checks types to see if they implements or extends specific interfaces base classes inpc incc dependencyobject etc and so doesn t care if the interface is implements explicitly

1003483
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the page has some checkbox and dropdownlistfor at the top that are used as filters for the gridview right below

1003483
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
then there s the start of the wrapping div that starts with a table where the checkbox and dropdownlistfor are

1003483
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i ve got plenty going on in the page.load codebehind in vb but the animation simply does not come up when i click on one of the checkbox to make a long trip to the database or select something from a dropdownlistfor to filter the results i already have

1003490
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox safari or google-chrome this works fine but in ie 8 don t have an earlier version of ie to test and msft won t let me uninstall ie 8 and have a working ie 7 the only cookies it sees are the session cookies not any of the persistent cookies the ones found in the temporary internet files

1003528
folder	directory
in c# i d loop over the directory get the list of files in each folder then loop over them to run the commandlines

1003562
width	height
whenever you mix padding with ie you start to lose control over width height

1003609
tax	shipping
the project is being split into two parts the store front which includes displaying the items and taking the customer s shipping and billing information and the payment site which will collect the customers credit card compute tax and save the order into the company s system

1003611
post	get
i have seen other post indicating that the approach i am using see below should work yet at runtime i get the following exception thrown by imappingpart.positionondocument method of joinedsubclasspart

1003613
width	height
i ve done this by creating a 100 height width translucent black div which has its visibility toggled on off via javascript

1003641
awt	swing
use swing awt

1003651
getter	setter
but watch out when using getter and setter instead of public variables

1003657
mouse	joystick
i want to emulate a joystick using keypresses and or mouse input

1003657
mouse	joystick
so other programs games will think that user is using a joystick while he is using a mouse

1003714
x86	mips
once upon a time microsoft supported windowsnt on processors other than x86 such as mips powerpc and alpha

1003732
versioning	upgrade
and the 500 price tag is for a new copy of office not the upgrade versioning

1003751
apache	nginx
it s looking like apache might still be needed it works with php-fcgi but i would prefer a nginx solution

1003771
width	height
by setting all of top bottom left and right the height and width are automatically calculated

1003774
switching	screens
however this approach doesn t handle the device lost event happening due to lock screens ctrl+alt+delete remote desktop connections user switching or similar

1003786
profiling	debugging
if you re running the xcode debugging profiling you should get a stacktrace in the debugger when the app quits.

1003818
gcov	lcov
however if you really want to hit it out of the park with pretty reports using gcov in conjunction with lcov is the way to go

1003818
gcov	lcov
another approach is doing the gcov emit on windows and doing the lcov post processing on linux where it will surely work out of the box

1003883
children	parent
if you expand either the one or two parent nodes and click one of the children the child that was selected does not show up as selected after the focus method is called on the text box

1003895
children	parent
the objective of the query is to recurse through parent child relationships of product categories and return the number of products under each category this includes any products contained in children categories

1003895
children	parent
my big question is at this level parent 942 how can i make it count the products contained in the children below to show 13 as the productcount i m kinda thinking i may need one more recursion method

1003923
yacc	bison
i m looking for a way to get flex bison or lex yacc et

1003943
yacc	bison
engine like bison or yacc but it s

1003986
getter	setter
if you know what the option keys are going to be in advance you can declare special getter and setter for them like so

1003996
pull	push
but rather than deploying on push may i suggest that you ssh to the box and do a git pull

1004041
mouse	keyboard
between hot-keys shortcuts and keyboard navigation a user rarely needs to use the mouse

1004041
mouse	keyboard
itunes is on the other extreme -- it relies on the mouse almost exclusively as do most drag-drop dominated uis and using the keyboard only is next to impossible

1004046
maven	pom.xml
is there any other way for hudson or anyone else using the maven task to gain authorization to publish using maven without putting a username password in the pom.xml

1004068
maven	pom.xml
you could remove the scm section from your pom.xml and have hudson pass -dproject.scm.developerconnection scm type user pass foobase footron fooproj on to maven

1004070
width	height
and while a camera and a mobile phone have length width height in common most of the other measurements will not coincide the camera won t have any audio information and the mobile phone won t have any lens or viewport measurements

1004070
superclass	subclassing
is there a general rule that says you should always put common data together in a superclass even if it s a small percentage of the subclassing s descriptive data

1004124
pull	push
i pull push changes from the local repo on each machine to a transfer repo on usb stick and things still work out correctly

1004132
put	get
i need to get each of the numbers and put them in an array in this order 0 50 100 100 200 400 218 9.8

1004142
portrait	landscape
now with the orientation in landscape the scrollview is starting at the top left when i really want it to start at the original orientation point from when it was in portrait mode which would be bottom left

1004213
wan	lan
we ve done something similar to this on our internal lan wan only wan being for instance san francisco to london

1004225
disk	ram
the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron

1004252
jobs	cron
if your server can run cron jobs consider making a script that checks the api for a valid response every few minutes

1004272
children	parent
then do everything as usual update parent and then children

1004284
versioning	upgrade
the easiest fix may be to check to see whether the versioning of tomcat you are using has this error in any other versioning you may just need to upgrade revert tomcat

1004328
notepad++	gedit
notepad++ and pspad both do this on windows and i use gedit default gnome text editor when on fedora

1004380
freemarker	velocity
if you re looking at velocity you may also want to consider freemarker

1004432
versioning	upgrade
one way to work around this could be to create an intermediate dummy rpm versioning n+1 of the old package which contains no files upgrade to that and then update to your final new package

1004435
chown	chmod
all fine and well while i m in ssh i can always chmod +w the files or chown nobody

1004492
itertools	functools
many other common uses can be satisfied with some combination of the operator itertools and functools modules

1004570
onclick	onchange
onclick onchange onclose

1004577
children	parent
the same question goes for movieclip children in general how does one disable movieclips within a parent clip in as2 without hard coding instance names

1004579
django	turbogears
use python and django turbogears twisted plone wsgi modpython

1004592
ant	maven
otherwise if you want to use the ant method as suggested maven can run ant tasks.

width	height
the other problem with this approach is that afterwards i can t change the size of the rectangle that i m cropping the image with which i need to be able to do because i have to have the image be an exact number of pixels in width and height

1004641
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
my setup is hudson 1.310 running as a system service cvsnt latest version on the server tortoisecvs 1.10.10

sorting	grouping
update i need to do more testing on it but it appears my nasty query works out better if i don t do the grouping and sorting in the db but do it in ruby afterwards

1004697
versioning	upgrade
basically the fix is to upgrade to a newer versioning of mod_jk

yacc	bison
nor can many other widely available parser generators such as antlr javacc yacc or traditional bison or even peg-style parsers used in a pure way

1004780
implements	extends
if you actually have access to the source code of the class you could implements an inner class which allows you to extends it although if you could do that you could just make one of the constructors package private as well

1004826
google-chrome	firefox
update it appears firefox uses mouse stopped moving to trigger tooltips in the browser google-chrome eg back forward buttons

1004975
subtract	add
the first one compiles fine because you can subtract pointers in c c++ but not add pointers

1005004
put	get
we do this where i work ie put interface in one package and implementation in another and the main advantage we get out of this is we can easily swap between implementations

1005017
multiplication	modulo
the multiplication in mixcolumns is indeed reversible and it is not modulo 256

1005023
integer	fractions
it can be represented if you store the integral part 1 as an integer and the fractions part .1 as another integer and then you need to create the logic to deal with these structures

1005038
post	put
better might be to put a counter_cache on post

1005048
coalesce	isnull
just to clarify things since there seems to be a lot of discussion about coalesce isnull will still return null if no rows match try this query you can copy-and-paste into sql server directly as-is

1005048
sum	coalesce
note that the where clause excludes all the rows from sys.columns from consideration but the sum operator still results in a single row being returned that is null which coalesce fixes to be a single row with a 0

1005058
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
with this question i want to know how can i switch from nunit to mbunit xunit or even mstest

1005213
post	get
check out this blog post not mine for a very understandable description of a very understandable algorithm which seems to get good results for how simple it is

1005238
pylons	turbogears
i d go with werkzeug personally as the framework most suitable for highly complex projects requiring ridiculous amounts of flexibility and power -- though pylons and turbogears 2 on top of it may be acceptable as a fall-back if the team just doesn t have the web app experience and skill it takes to make truly beautiful music with a flexible framework such as werkzeug

1005241
goto	break
if you have ever used a break or a continue you ve used a goto

1005241
goto	break
whether implicit gotos like continue or break are used or explicit gotos using the actual keyword goto for whatever language

width	height
if the swf is set to 100 width height it will stretch to fit the wrapper whenever the wrapper is resized

1005287
post	get
as wikis were originally designed to work in a standard browser and most browsers did not support anything except get and post rest is not a concept used a lot on the wiki world

maven	pom.xml
actually maven is not as constrained as everybody thinks all the poms are extended of one super pom.xml in which is defined the name of the target folder

1005445
put	get
that way the scrollbar updates as the user types and if they type in an invalid value the scrollbar stays put and they ll get an error when they move to whatever the next stage is

1005456
folder	directory
one method that requires no programmatic setup and is quite secure is to mount a folder from the other server and use php to save to that directory like you would normally

1005503
getter	setter
or how to write setter and getter method for these arrays

1005505
hash	md5
in this case using an md5 hash of the page content as the etag will be a lot easier

i want to mount my external hard disk drive with the ntfs filesystems

1005658
filesystems	ntfs
i cannot mount it because it doesn t support ntfs filesystems

1005658
filesystems	ntfs
error msg mount unknown ntfs filesystems

1005661
children	parent
create an object node which contains a parent node and a list of children node

1005774
getter	setter
later i figured out i can use strings in my applicaiton which makes it easier to pass around nulls as the actual domain fields are nullable most of the time and only change those fields getter and setter to use getdomainvalue index and setdomainvalue index value method that will translate between the key and value to from the underlying feature object

1005780
public	protected
my understanding was when a type is inherited all protected and public members will be accessible from the derived class

1005835
strtol	atoi
same for atoi and strtol .

xrange	enumerate
this behaviour changes in python3 range is an iterator to which the python2 equivalent is xrange or even better for your case enumerate

1005891
int	double
it is present there so the compiler decides to call b f int converting double to int

1005891
int	double
now b class has two overloaded functions for int and for double

1005903
doc	rtf
doc rtf pdf html.

1005911
superclass	subclassing
i tend to prefer the use of override in this case so that the method gets flagged in the subclassing if the superclass changes either removing the method altogether or changing its signature etc.

1005986
post	put
and i also agree with the above post that say your reasoning around point 1 is off - if there are classes with incorrect implementations of equals and or hashcode that you want to put into a set you fix them and then use a set

1006055
sorting	filtering
there is a very good library called glazedlists that makes it a lot simpler to work with lists and tables including column sorting and row filtering

the problem that i have is that both functions throw the compiler warning function gethashcode or equals shadows an overridable method in the base class object

1006425
for-loop	arrays
if you re looping through an arrays it shouldn t matter - the enhanced for-loop uses arrays accesses anyway

1006468

1006708
setinterval	settimeout
any animation is going to rely on settimeout setinterval and the page won t wait for those to complete before leaving

1006726
profiling	debugging
the down side of course is that if you have to debugging or profiling optimized code be prepared to deal with call stacks that look like theyâ re missing a few frames

1006764
int	double
a read or write from int or any smaller type should be atomic but as robert noted longs and double may or may not depending on the implementation

1007017
rss	feed
i want to serve up specialized rss feed on a different subdomain from the rest of the site

1007107
innodb	myisam
the actual cause was that the main db table was in myisam and the innodb tables couldn t create a foreign key connecting to it

1007112
maven	pom.xml
if the local pom.xml definition takes precedence over the settings.xml definition then you could try omitting the default value at the cost of having every maven instance in your control developers build machines etc specify my.build.directory in its settings.xml

1007146
rank	percentile
since all this is sort of meaningless without a frame of reference i want to show users their percentile rank among all users

1007146
rank	percentile
that ll be user 1138 s percentile rank right

1007146
rank	percentile
i d also like to show percentile rank for the different time spans-- i may be 11th percentile overall but 50th percentile this month and 97th percentile today

1007158
width	height
obviously it doesn t have to match exactly due to ratios the width would be the key size so the height would be variable

1007182

i m sure of safari 4 firefox 3.5 from rc1 and maybe google-chrome 2

1007245
webkit	gecko
as far as i know it is supported either partially or fully in the gecko webkit and presto engines

1007267

as you mentioned total up the reputation points earned during the time range and calculate the percentile rank based on that

1007284
division	modulo
once you realize that the and are used for doing modulo und division calculation respectively you can write what you want as

1007340
google-chrome	firefox
i was just reading this question and wanted to try the alias method rather than the function-wrapper method but i couldn t seem to get it to work in either firefox 3 or 3.5beta4 or google-chrome both in their debug windows and in a test web page

1007342
folder	directory
to execute the script if saved to your user folder from root of your settings.bundle directory just use the syntax

1007381
daemon	cron
it s the cron daemon that makes that file

1007405
inherited	properties
could i just inherited the repeater class add a few controlstate viewstate properties and be able to use it exactly as a repeater dragged straight from the toolbox

1007413
integer	fractions
integer division expressions have the fractions portion truncated where in the past they would result in a floating point result

1007446
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
you can then set parameters to return data of a certain type and apply filtering sorting and grouping

1007446
post	get
this blog post by heather solomon is one of the best resources to help you get started with how to create your own transform and configure the cqwp

1007459
memcached	apc
you would probably be better off storing the object in memory with memcached or apc and don t forget that you may have issues with locks on the file is several people are hitting the site at once

1007483
inherited	properties
classes also defines from which other class or classes if multiple inherited is allowed this class inherited and which properties if selective inherited exists

1007571
public	protected
when i tried using the -p option with some c++ code however it usually returns the access specifier private public protected etc which isn t terribly handy

1007607
accessor	properties
should we use properties accessor in init and dealloc with modern runtime

1007607
accessor	ivar
if i need to override an accessor can i still access that ivar that will be defined at runtime or do i have to define an actual ivar that the runtime will then use

1007645
titlebar	window
i used a jframe got the content pane and set the background to red what ever color you want then set the frame undecorated which removes the titlebar and border of the window

1007672
versioning	upgrade
i did have some issues with the lack of any sort of discernable upgrade path between versioning though

1007698
int	double
in c# value types like int double byte and structs are passed by value by default

1007708
webkit	gecko
gecko webkit and presto engines are suppose to support it but i think only partly

1007708
opera	firefox
so firefox 3.5 and opera are your best bet

1007711
bids	ssis
bids is the sole environment to build ssis packages

1007736
bids	ssas	bids	ssis
bids is just visual studio with the vspackages for ssis ssrs and ssas development

1007806
accessor	properties
you should not use properties accessor in and dealloc methods for the same reasons that you should not use them in the legacy runtime it leaves you open to potential errors if you later override the properties methods and end up doing something that shouldn t be done in or dealloc

1007835
gridview	sqldatasource
if you are hooking up a databound element to a datasource a gridview or combobox to a sqldatasource make sure the datasource is assigned to one of your connection strings

1007870
vim	gedit
personally unless it is java development convoluted in itself i stay away from traditional ides and use a modular solution of vim gedit makefiles and other automations

1007908
firefox	safari
the css code works just fine in safari 3 on mac and windows but not in firefox 3 windows

1007908
firefox	safari
i m running the django dev web server and i can see the css file being called in the console when in safari but not when using firefox

1007914
button	checkbox
i like to keep all advanced options hidden under a more less button or advanced mode checkbox depending on the context and application

1007967
accessor	properties
should we use properties accessor in init and dealloc with modern runtime

1007967
accessor	properties
i can understand ejames argument against using properties accessor in init dealloc at all but the flipside is that if you change the properties behavior for example change from retain to copy or just assign without retaining and don t use it in init or vice versa the behavior can get out of sync too

1007967
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
if initializing and modifying an ivar should act the same use the properties accessor for both

1007967
accessor	ivar
if i need to override an accessor can i still access that ivar that will be defined at runtime or do i have to define an actual ivar that the runtime will then use

1007975
int	double
2 32 + 1 should be recognized as double even though it looks like int

1007987
children	parent
when i run the children page alone outside the parent the modalpopup and it s buttons works perfectly.

1008003
scatter	graphing
the post on calculating trend lines on a scatter plot how do i calculate a trendline for a graphing

1008027
put	get
you shouldn t put extra code in your settranslate since it won t get called

1008049
width	height
you can still set height and width on an element floated this way and since it can still accept the position relative

1008056
width	height
if contents inside the div might get bigger than the div s height width use the overflow style to decide what to do

1008103
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox and safari but when i tested it in ie7 it errors

1008113
for-loop	loops
here is the output when i run the script with jim s while loops replacing the for-loop

1008113
for-loop	loops
however i still don t get why i can t use jim s while style loops instead of the for-loop i am using

1008144
ceil	floor
there s really no need to multiply floor ceil anything the math.random function gives value which is larger than or equal to 0 and less than 1

1008173
vim	textmate
however i do occasionally use textmate or vim with rails.vim

1008182
post	get
this ensures they aren t included in the post and you don t get false positives

1008183
int	double
that is you can convert an int to a double but converting a pointer to an int to a pointer to double would make the compiler believe that there are 8 bytes of memory at the pointed address while in fact only 4 bytes are present assuming 32 or 64 bit architecture with 32 bit int and 64 bit double

1008235
width	height
you need set measurements on the div height width and once you define the image in the css you do not need to put it in the html as well

1008237
qtabwidget	qwidget	qtabwidget	qtabbar	qtabbar	qwidget
this is somewhat similar to how qt provides a qtabwidget class that inherits qwidget but has a private qtabbar that it uses internally

1008237
public	protected
one significant difference is that it provides a protected tabbar accessor rather than a public one

1008262
x86	64bit
this is because the x86 cpu calculates the value with 80bit while the value is stored as 64bit in memory so you end up comparing a truncated 64bit value with a full 80bit value

1008378
post	get
right click on the first packet that has your client calling out on it should be something like get service.svc or post service.svc and select follow tcp stream

1008415
children	parent
how to structure the hierarchy to make automatic changes to those parent nodes if their children s data changed

1008415
children	parent
if some of the children warning flag changed to true then the parent warning flag should change automatically set to true

1008415
children	parent
a node integer field is the sum of the children integer fields and if any of the children changes the parent integer field calculates the sum immediately

1008418
keydown	keyup
ok i got it its the keyup event not keydown thats causing this thanks for the help

1008432
width	margin
it is not a width margin problem because when all of the subreports are short it looks fine

bluetooth	usb
bluetooth usb token ring frame

1008509
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome the only two i have to test on at the moment neither the keydown nor the keypress events fire when the keyboard focus is on the location bar and the enter key is pressed

1008509
keydown	keyup
so i suppose you could stick with keydown and or keypress events or keep track of keydown events and ignore any keyup events that aren t preceded by a keydown

1008519
instances	transient
because the new container instances has a null identifier hibernate assumes it is an unsaved transient instances

1008519
persistent	transient
since the persistent and transient container objects have the same business key values what we really want is to issue an update

1008536
min	max
if you use min max you can aggregate any value since there is only one

1008543
setinterval	settimeout
also create threads to speed up ui using settimeout and setinterval

1008579
hash	salt
when the user visits this link mysite.com zneg8rjk it would set a session variable which is just a hash of album 5 plus a salt and then it redirects them to the full url

1008584
versioning	upgrade
engine.js is something that will never change unless you upgrade your dwr to a newer versioning

1008628
client-side	server-side
they are two vastly different creatures and performing client-side tasks from the server-side will not work

1008633
equals	gethashcode
these both produce a value of 3 for gethashcode causing equals to return true

1008654
int	double
it has more possible values than an int so it is impossible to have a unique int for each double

1008661
vb6	vba
it s a poor vb6 vba man s approach to polymorphism

1008666
equals	gethashcode
first off - do not implement equals only in terms of gethashcode - hashcodes will sometimes collide even when objects are not equals

1008671
post	get
post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted

1008675
post	get
a post can be sniffed just as easily as a get

1008689
uitableview	nsindexpath
- nsindexpath tableview uitableview tableview willselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath

1008693
post	get
the only difference between http get and http post is the manner in which the data is encoded

1008699
inherited	properties	children	parent
children inherited their parent properties so only define differences

1008704
post	get
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

1008725
google-chrome	firefox
it s perfect in firefox but google-chrome and ie are not showing radio buttons

1008733
stdout	stderr
it also captures any output after duplicating stderr onto stdout in a temp file

1008741
width	height
why do you have a height and width specified of 0 for them

1008745
width	height
you need a width and height

1008752
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
i have had no issue getting ruby on rails development environments up and running in os x linux opensuse ubuntu fedora and windows

1008762
post	get
i have a blog post that details what an http request looks like and how a get request compares to a post request

1008763
width	height
you can override this by telling the height and width to be auto which will reset them unless there s a rule which is more specific somewhere else in the stylesheet

1008779
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
then using a md5 function for javascript i hash and salt the password 4k times like linux does when it uses md5 for it s password hashing client side then i pass that hash to the server in plain text

1008781
ethernet	wireless
one is a statically defined ethernet interface and the other one is a dhcp configured wireless interface

1008807

if it is very important drop the ajax and pick up a ssl certificate and use the https layer

1008817
firefox	safari
supported natively by recent versions of firefox and safari

1008861
charindex	substr
you can use charindex and substr

1008889
put	get
could you resolve it in your controller and then put it in the viewmodel to get access to the resolved instance

1008925
portrait	landscape
presenting a portrait modal view over a landscape view and vice-versa

1008925
portrait	landscape
you could rotate to landscape for a pdf and get back the portrait view for the message when you dismissed the attachment view

1008945
super	extends
the rationale for calling super first during setup is that you want to make sure everything is in place before you extends functionality

1008945
superclass	subclassing
the corollary is that when you are deallocating you don t want any superclass ivars your subclassing depends on to be dealloced before you have a chance to handle them

1008986
children	parent
i can of course put the parent properties directly on the child datatable fill them w the results of a join between the underlying db tables but i d like to avoid that if it s possible my real app involves just a few parent each w many many children i d like not to be moving so much unnecessary data

1009015
firefox	safari
safari 3.1+ and firefox 3.5 both support the audio element

1009035
int	double
if you want int division to return an int and you ve imported from future use a double

1009095
filtering	grouping
having - combined with + group+ this can be used to filtering the records that a grouping by returns

getter	setter
makes a lot more sense to me to move the int currentlocation declaration to the top level inside your person class and provide getter setter methods

1009131
folder	directory
going to the app tmp cache directory and removing the files in the model and persistent folder

1009243
memcached	ncache
if you realy need a good performance you could also implement distributed cache like memcached o ncache

1009245
put	get
but the trick here is that you have to wait until server.exe exits to get the out put

1009268
width	height
well you could get the width and height of the browser and that d tell you if it was minimized

1009300
setinterval	settimeout
look up settimeout and setinterval for doing the timing

1009341
httphandler	httpmodule
this is really a job for a httpmodule not a httphandler

1009354
versioning	upgrade
1. in your gac ed dll upgrade the minor versioning number

1009365
firefox	safari
strangly enough in ie 6 7 8 it works fine but in firefox safari i m using mac but tested it in windows and they both give the same problems the map doesn t load entirely

1009365
firefox	safari
please take a look at the link below and click the third tab in firefox safari and ie and you will see the problem

1009383
width	height
most likley you have a div within a div and you need to set the inner div to width 100 and height 100

1009411
mouse	keyboard
in a nutshell idlemonitor is a class that observes mouse and keyboard events adjust accordingly for your needs

1009444
int	boolean
i have tried casting to boolean and int and haven t had any success

1009446
inherited	properties
they will all inherited from a base class that will have a companyid properties

1009529
width	height
do i have to calculate it by hand determining the height and width of the glyphs from the font size etc. or is there a more straightforward way

1009530
uiview	subviews
add them as subviews and set your uiview as the tableheaderview

1009531
hash	md5
to ensure uniqueness you ll have to also create a separate varchar column to store an md5 or sha1 hash and add a unique or primary index

1009538
keydown	keyup
other important items to note non-character keys including page down page up etc. do not raise a keypress event they only raise keydown and keyup keypress events are swallowed by the form if you set

1009598
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1009662
google-chrome	firefox
i am using 1.3.2 and using your code copy pasted i can successfully run this in firefox 3 ie 8 and google-chrome

1009705
elf	coff
the tool is available on solaris for elf which is an extension of coff and probably elsewhere

1009747
pop-up	dialog
it s probably right and there s nothing you can do to keep the os from disconnecting and turning off wifi except to pop-up a try again dialog if you really need a connection for the current operation

1009751
hide	show	stdout	stderr
this is probably not the problem but the console view in eclipse has some toggle buttons to show hide the console when output from either stdout or stderr changes

1009787
firefox	safari
some browsers originally only ie but firefox 3 and safari jumped on the wagon support the document.activeelement property which achieves what you want

1009792
put	get
for example i might need to send a short array of numbers and this could either be encoded in amf via netconnection.call or could be put into get parameters using sendtourl

1009808
google-chrome	firefox
so the real meat of this question is if anybody knows of a solution that works for firefox and google-chrome

1009832
mouseover	mouseout
another solution would be to run the binding code again after you add a new but that is not as clean as just using live which supports the mouseover and mouseout events you re going to need to do the hover

1009868
min	max
it took min 0.4sec average 0.5sec max 0.6sec

1009888
puts	gets
this puts the original stack trace in the _remotestacktracestring field of the exception which gets concatenated to the newly reset stack trace when the exception is re-thrown

1009915
portrait	landscape
but when i tap a filename while in landscape mode the image slides into view in the wrong orientation even if the second level view controller s shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation returns yes for only portrait modes

1009936
multiplying	add
it s just a shift by two and two adds or a multiplying by 5 and one add

1009942
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
using gtk on x windows linux freebsd solaris you can use the xembed protocol to embed widgets using gtk.socket

1009967
width	height
then you can reposition the buttons the x y values should be calculated as a of the width and height of the panel

1009967
width	height
you could even rescale the buttons so that the width height ratio is the same of the panels ratio

1010016
public	protected
i assume the loop is through each field in the object both public and non-public fields - and i ve read that protected fields are forbidden with reflection on medium trust

1010046
google-chrome	firefox
this works on firefox and google-chrome but fails in ie 8 and presumably other ie s as the focus call fails for some reason maybe the dom isn t ready

1010073
google-chrome	firefox
the following solution has been tested in google-chrome firefox ie8 and ie8 in ie7 compatibility mode

1010100
int	boolean
update the jet internal storage of a boolean is as an int go figure--but that s what they chose...

1010105
int	chars
memory used using 32 bit int would be 4 bytes per original chars

1010133
n-gram	words
you split a words into its constituent n-gram such as for the words hello you would get hel lo

1010133
n-gram	words
then you build an index with n-gram as keys and the words they come from as the values

1010133
n-gram	words
from that list you select the words that had the highest number of matched n-gram

1010137
put	get
myself i seem to resort to similar tricks like this more and more often simply because they work and they get the job done ... note also if you were using a separate viewmodel which i recommend for this you could put this code in there and leave your domain model nice and clean

1010183
children	parent
should the code within this repository attempt to save the parent employee as well as the child address objects or should separate repositories handle the parent and children objects

1010197
children	parent
the repository should handle the entire aggregate object parent and all children because that s what makes it a repository

1010222
x86	64bit
if on a 64bit machine make sure to set the cpu target to x86 rather than anycpu

1010257
min	max
nor do i believe that the sparkline images go in the view model what if my view wants to represent the data differently say as a grid row just showing min max average standard deviation etc

1010338
xsl-fo	xslt
if you have some money to spend on training ken holman has an excellent set of xml xslt xpath xsl-fo training courses

1010338
pull	push
then xslt templates and the distinction between push and pull really make sense

1010339
folder	directory
the working directory is . root the png file is in . root img test.png how do i have asp.net display my images and everything else in the folder

1010347
graphics2d	bufferedimage
the imageio.read method takes in a file to read in and returns a bufferedimage which can be used to manipulate the image via its graphics2d or the graphics its superclass context

1010349
inherited	subclassing
i was wondering if i have a couple of models which both include fields like meta_keywords or slug which have to do with the web page the model instance will be displayed on whether it would be advisable to break those page metadata elements out into their own class say pagemeta and have my other models subclassing those via multiple inherited

1010388
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

1010388
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

1010388
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

1010388
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

1010388
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

1010388
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

1010388
int	chars
in this case chars could be either a signed or unsigned int type -- its signedness is implementation-defined

1010388
int	chars
fortunately though an int can represent all possible values of a chars whether or not chars is signed assuming you re on a system where chars s are 8 bits and int s are at least 16 bits

1010388
int	chars
if chars is signed then the second paragraph above applies so both operands are converted to int the type with higher rank

1010388
int	chars
since 0x98 as a signed chars is negative it s converted to the int -104 which is then less than 7

1010388
int	chars
the unsigned chars would be converted to 152 as an int which is greater than 7

1010388
int	chars
if you need 8-bit int of a certain signedness explicitly use signed chars or unsigned chars or use the c99 types int8_t and uint8_t defined int

1010422
profiling	debugging
it would help to have a look at the code but if you want to debugging it yourself have a look at xdebug it ll help profiling your application

1010426
goto	break
you probably have a break or return or heaven forbid goto inside the loop

1010439
width	height
that will give you x y width and height for characters and or substrings in the document

1010440
post	put	post	get	put	get
returns the name of the http method with which this request was made for example get post or put

1010440
post	get
this method returns the parameter regardless of whether the request was sent via a get or a post

1010448
setinterval	settimeout
link for further reading timers with settimeout and setinterval

1010497
cassini	iis
the visual studio web server aka cassini won t accept remote connections - you need to use iis

1010498
folder	directory
if you have windows xp professional or vista with iis you can create a virtual directory that points to your publish folder

1010500
google-chrome	safari
interesting that webkit google-chrome and safari displayed the css even with the misspelling

1010505
put	get
hi i have a table with some some values ids and of course when i get the result i got just the int ids but i want to put it more user friendly for example when its the number 1 i want to put the string avaible when its 2 not avaible im on an n tiers enviroment and i need to get this done on the model whats the best way to accomplish this i have to declare another class to project the strings or must i use something like a dictionary key - value

1010509
redmine	trac
i have no experience migrating trac to redmine but i do see one solution

1010522
komodo	aptana
i believe komodo and aptana do as well

1010548
int	chars
the robot.keypress method takes in an int key code -- not an actual chars code

1010548
keyevent	keyrelease
also if one wants to use the keyevent s returned from a keylistener s events such as keypressed and keyrelease the keyevent object has a getkeycode method which will return the keycode of the event

1010582
post	put
anyway if you want to use put post request for uploading one file per request - is amazon s api restriction and it seems to me there s nothing to be done

1010588
bazaar	git
git and bazaar capabilities and wonder which one has more feature-rich code management

1010593
ant	maven
maven is a framework ant is a toolbox

1010593
ant	maven
maven is a pre-built road car whereas ant is a set of car parts

1010593
ant	maven
to put it another way maven is a framework whereas ant is a toolbox

1010593
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
he compared a simple maven pom.xml with a simple ant build file and he made mention of how maven projects can become more complex

1010593
ant	maven
which leads me to the point about how all this stuff has to be explicitly written in ant whereas it is declarative in maven

1010593
ant	maven
after my 2 year experiment with maven i pulled the old ant build file out of the closet dusted it off and put it back to work

1010593
ant	maven
when compared with ant the build guy on a maven project will spend more time

1010593
ant	maven
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

1010608
jboss	glassfish
another approach is to run your application in a java ee application server which supports jsr 196 eg glassfish or jboss

1010611
maven	cobertura
i m using the maven cobertura plugin to generate coverage reports but for some reason the instrument goal gets stuck in an infinite loop

1010616
submit	submission
editstoreaction and submit form to the same action i would know that the user has pressed the accept button for changes on submission

1010619
pull	push
you can quite easily manage code in bazaar with something like 4 commands add commit merge maybe push pull and log or qlog and you only need merge if you want multiple branches

1010623
bazaar	git
what are the relative strengths and weaknesses of git mercurial and bazaar

1010631
tstringlist	tlist
c the non-visual components like tlist tstringlist and so forth should be implemented.

1010811
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
when all else fails you can provide your own global operator new delete and malloc calloc realloc overloads -- how to do so will vary a bit depending on compiler and platform -- and this will be a bit of an investment -- but it may pay off over the long run

1010818
post	get
may be one for all get requests and another is for post requests

1010818
post	get
now your first action being get will go to editstore method of storecontroller whereas the second being post request will go to savestore method of storeformcontroller

1010844
nunit	mstest
given the fact that all three types of tests are built using mstest or nunit it is still code test

1010851
button	checkbox
when i click on of these button the properties on the objects are changed but the checkbox does not update

1010855
put	get
when you have another one to put in you take it put the comma and get the next name in the aux

1010875
int	chars
i want to hash a chars array in to an int or a long

1010879
put	get
but to add data to the arraylist i have to constantly use hashmap get key to get the arraylist add value to it then put it back to hashmap

1010977
minix	linux	netbsd	minix
though if your looking for good kernel source to read i wouldn t go with linux it s a beast of a hack about like saying the gcc sources are fun instead you may wish to try minix or one of the bsds darwin is basically a branch of netbsd iirc or even one of the many free dos clones if everything else is a little too scary

1010983
put	get
so basically you put similar things together so you can collapse everything to definition and get to your stuff really faster

1011047
gina	winlogon
i looked around and found gina and winlogon notification packages

1011051
integer	unsigned
when you take the value of x assuming implausibly for real life but sufficient for the purposes of exposition that ulong_ptr is an unsigned 16-bit integer is 0xbfab then

1011080
hex	binary
alternatively you could just display it in hex it d mean nothing to a human though and it would still be binary for all practical purposes

1011089
post	get
i used this blog post to get started

1011099
lisp	scheme
hmm self referential data structures in lisp scheme and sicp streams are not mentioned

1011197
qtcore	qtgui
but the release build still require qtgui qtcore dll for no apparent reasons i wonder if anyone has seen this kind of problems before

1011210
integer	fractions
convert the money type to an integer to get rid of the fractions

1011229
folder	directory
don t install the jde or simulators in the default c program files folder as they need to write to their own directory during runtime and vista does not like the user accounts writing to any subdirectory under c program files

1011345
stdout	stderr
you can have a custom snmpget utility download the source replace stderr with stdout then recompile

1011373
folder	directory
these folder are not copied in the bin directory of the webapps when the solution is built in msbuild but they are copied when it is built in visual studio

1011470
free	malloc	free	strncpy	strncpy	malloc	strlen	strncpy
use strncpy for copying the string strlen for detecting string length malloc and free for dynamically allocating a buffer for the new string

1011499
tinyint	boolean
also remember that mysql uses tinyint for boolean so true false are actually 1 0

1011545
free	malloc
whenever you allocate space using malloc remember to call free when you are finished with it read memory leak

1011554
put	get
you will probably get better results if you put a separate index on each of these columns

1011567
getter	setter
since this is the official representation of your data and you have data types and getter setter already there this validation captures user errors and programming errors from people extending your system

1011575
interpreted-language	compiled-language
pretty much any interpreted-language suffers in that way in comparison to most mainstream compiled-language

1011655
vsto	add-in
how can i attach an event handler for sendandreceive event of contact folders contact items in outlook 2007 using vsto add-in

1011748
inherited	subclassing
i would like to draw your attention to the fact that apple documentation does not document inherited methods in subclassing documentation

1011750
mvvm	delegatecommand
i currently have delegatecommand and attachedbehaviors in my basic mvvm template that i can use but i can t figure out how to get them to fire when combobox selects a new item

1011779
rss	feed
i can generate the rss for each individual resource but i m not getting how to synchronize into one rss feed for these multiple feed

1011779
rss	feed
currently i ve setup the articles feed via feedburner and even feedburner doesn t have this facility to merge different rss of the same app into one so that i users can subscribe to individual rss which i ve done already or to just a single main feed to get all the updates

1011794
hash	md5
if you create a md5 out of some data it is not possible to create the data out of the hash

1011823
versioning	upgrade
later on you upgrade this to use versioning 3.1

1011845
opensuse	linux
i ve installed qt creator in opensuse linux distro can i know if it is possible to create .exe of qt program which is perfectly executing in linux

1011849
mouse	keyboard
another option is the twapi tcl windows api extension which has facilities for sending keyboard and mouse input to another application see

1011941
superclass	subclassing
misspelling overridden method names in a superclass or subclassing

1011941
superclass	subclassing
the superclass misspelling mistake is worse because none of the subclassing override it correctly

1011950
bazaar	git
i have used bazaar extensively for personal projects for a couple of years since the 0.8 days but i have switched to git last year and never looked back at least for source code management

1011950
bazaar	git
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git

1011950
bazaar	git
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

1011951
implements	extends
edit 2 i am no longer extends the sqlmapclientdaosupport class instead my accountdao is a pojo which implements what little functionality was being provided by the support class

1011987
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari

1012008
nunit	typemock
at my company since we started unit testing with nunit and typemock we reach higher code coverage and release the software in a shorter time to market

1012021
hide	show
p.s i know that i could simply hide the div with the input-text and show the one with the x but i ll prefer to keep the html markup minimal and dont mess around with hidden divs

1012038
post	get
i then have this post method in my controller that is supposed to display an error message if the surname field is blank i realise there is no other logic in this function im just trying to get my head round validation

1012038
put	get
it runs fine if i put something in the surname textbox and the error does not get added

1012048
postgresql	mysql
also if structure correctly i see no reason why mysql or postgresql would not support 5000 rows per second provided the rows are not too fat

1012048
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and postgresql are a lot more forgiving to having a larger amount of transactions

1012097
hide	show
what i don t understand is this why you don t want to hide and show the div

1012106
put	get
i could put a fixed width in the border element but then a very long customer name might get cut off

1012135
richfaces	icefaces
originally i had planned to use icefaces but that didn t work too well either and also brings a lot of predefined styles with it so for now richfaces seems to be the best option

1012135
richfaces	tomahawk	richfaces	icefaces	icefaces	tomahawk
now i thought it would be nice to develop a clean tag library which provides some useful components found in richfaces icefaces or tomahawk not all of course

1012138
ant	maven
however i would definitely do a build clean first within eclipse and see if ant maven is affected you do have such build scripts i assume

1012152
hide	show
you can either use jquery s remove function on page unload or show and hide field

1012219
put	get
you aren t guaranteed to get data out of them in the same order you put it in

1012292
min	max
that function should generate a random number with the min as 0 and the max as the number of children of the #container element minus 1

1012328
post	get
you might also be able to get the same effect using an global ajaxerror handler and continuing to use post

1012337
ubuntu	linux
this is a linux box running ubuntu

1012365
post	get
also any groups in the regular expression you specify will be passed as arguments to the handler methods get post etc

1012420
spaces	delimiter
otherwise it reads the spaces as a delimiter and thinks the rest of the path is an argument

1012502
pop-up	dialog
i ve written a little batch file that will upload the 2 files via ftps.exe moveit freely but i get a dialog box that pop-up and requires me to click yes

1012559
mouseup	mousedown
you do not decide what delay setting between mousedown and mouseup results in a valid single click the operating system does

1012559
mouseup	mousedown
no sleep function can guarantee the timing between the mousedown and mouseup events you want

1012601
hide	show
i have a table which i want to show hide - linking it to a button using jquery

1012601
hide	show
the problem is that everytime i click on the button to show hide the table everything on the page shifts slightly left-right

1012620
nsstring	nsdata
this means the array and possible subcontainers can only contain objects of type nsarray nsdictionary nsstring nsdata nsdate and nsnumber

1012633
hide	show
it s possible that your show hide is adding an empty div somewhere which would explain the shift

1012645
spaces	delimiter
by default the scanner uses the white spaces as its delimiter

1012719
merb	ruby-on-rails
ultimately ruby-on-rails 3 and merb 2 will merge that might bring you the best of both worlds.

1012724
hash	salt
i was reading a few articles on salt and password hash and a few people were mentioning rainbow attacks

1012764
inherited	properties
just use a custom control that inherited from tablelayoutpanel and set the doublebuffered properties on true works great.

1012768
emacs	textmate
a friend of mine is considering switching to emacs from textmate

1012792
versioning	upgrade
p.s java versioning 1.4.2 can t upgrade

1012792
unix	aix
aix unix 5.3

1012832
salt	md5
instead of storing md5 password store md5 password + salt or even better md5 salt + md5 password

1012832
hash	salt
since even with rainbow tables it is going to be near impossible to store all possible salt hash

1012832
hash	salt
btw obviously you have to store your salt with your hash so that you can authenticate the user

1012834
mouse	keyboard
use qt s event filters they will allow your application to eat whichever events you specify keyboard and mouse events but still process other events such as paint events

1012836
freemarker	velocity
something akin to apache velocity or freemarker

1012841
sudo	passwd
you could use that to write the passwd followed by a new line and sudo or su should accept the passwd

1012847
keydown	keyup
i think you should somehow cancel the keydown keyup event for the character you want to remove before it is processed by the target window procedure notepad s

1012925
put	get
that should be enough to get you started basically take the current reference out of where it is in your normal project file and put it in its own itemgroup with an appropriate condition

1012939
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails and merb

1012939
merb	ruby-on-rails
and later on rails3 merging of ruby-on-rails and merb

1012945
wordpress	phpbb
the disadvantage of this is that each component of our portal the cms the blogging forums etc are not best-of-breed and to be quite honest they are pretty bad compared to their free and open source counterparts wordpress phpbb mediawiki are examples that come to mind

1012947
ant	maven
such a program are make ant maven

1012987
rss	feed
i want to expose those recordings mp3 files to the users as rss feed so that they can download them using their ipod itunes or zune

1013013
int	chars
you also needed to append the l chars at the end of your numbers to tell the java compiler that the number should be compiled as a long instead of an int

1013026
rss	feed
here is a link to the itunes rss technical spec itunes podcast rss technical spec there s also an example feed on that page to get you started

1013027
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and firefox they appear correctly but in google-chrome the 2nd floating div clears down below div a

1013027
google-chrome	firefox
when i remove float left in the css it goes to the correct position in google-chrome but clears down in ie and firefox as it should

1013039
hid	joystick
i am trying to modify my hid joystick events absolute x y so it may only move to the improved location which will be genarated by my application with some math functions like pow tan etc

1013101
postgresql	mysql
there is a django-popularity app on github that looks promising but only works with mysql i m using postgresql

1013115
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you are using a versioning of wordpress older than 2.1 then you can either remove the function call from your header.php file or upgrade your wordpress installation

1013215
sorting	grouping
i ve managed to get expand collapse and global sorting working sort by top level grouping then sort within each grouping but i want to add a feature where you can sort just within a top level grouping

1013235
udp	tcp
the only way you have is to do a tcp or udp ping

1013261
width	height
set the height to 4 the width to the width of your form and very important set the sizemode of the picturebox to stretchimage

1013261
width	height
with the borderstyle set to none changing the height width top and left properties will actually have a visible effect on the form although the form will be borderless

vim	emacs
i m seriously thinking about taking the opportunity to learn vim or emacs or whatever the windows ports are called but any other thoughts would be welcome.

1013280
mouse	keyboard
i need something like logmein free regarding its direct control of the mouse and keyboard but only working on local network and and not requiring an internet connection just like windows remote desktop connection

1013283
fflush	gets
you must fflush the response otherwise it gets partially transmitted

1013294
tcplistener	tcpclient
i m developing a simple application to send files over tcp using the tcplistener and tcpclient classes

1013306
tunnel	vpn
you could tunnel it over a vpn of some sort if you require more security

1013317
typedef	struct
either put the whole struct definition before the typedef or put this declaration before the typedef

1013355
redhat	fedora
our hosting is redhat enterprise linux-based so we have fedora vm s that we use for testing with apache and mysql or oracle and that whole technology stack

1013361
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails

1013417
put	get
i think that the header comment is probably the right way to do this but in order for it to be truly useful i need to figure out how to get xcode to put the comment in there when it s creating the file for me.

1013432
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in ie firefox but when it is tried in google-chrome it is as if the onclientclick is not kicking off the javascript

1013469
switching	screens
having one activity+view for each screens and then i make the screens switching by calling each activity

1013469
switching	screens
having one activity and many views and what i switching views in each screens change this helps me re-use more code but makes saving states a mess

1013489
pascal	delphi
i ve got a lot of older code that uses the old-style pascal object type that i m trying to get working in delphi 2009

1013529
multiplying	multiplication
something else to keep in mind is that the compiler statically knows the value of sizeof char is 1 and it also knows that multiplying a number by a static 1 implies the multiplication doesn t need to be done

1013553
dbf	dbase
dbf file is in c dbase clip53 prg stkmenu wpack3

1013561
folder	directory
instead you can put your browser definition files in your project under a separate folder or just under the project and change the build action to content or none and copy to output directory to copy always or copy if newer in the properties for each file you want to go to your bin folder

1013567
children	parent
if you don t need transactions and you only care about retrieving the direct children of an entity not all descendants use the approach outlined above but instead of a listproperty just use a referenceproperty to the parent entity

1013600
hash	salt
if they have the same hash on two sites they could have the same password this depends on the hash salt used by the sites what method etc

1013637
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in every browser i ve tested google-chrome firefox safari internet explorer it works great except in ie

1013644
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the output of this code looks pretty much identical in firefox google-chrome and safari on windows

1013673
nomethoderror	nameerror
basically just like when you call anobject.some_unknown_method ruby will call anobject.method_missing some_unknown_method before raising a nomethoderror using someunknownconstant triggers a const_missing someunknownconstant before raising a nameerror

1013702
rss	feed
with yahoo pipes using the create rss module it appears to use a hashed version of each entry s link to generate a guid which as you point out is necessary for most feed readers to detect new entries

1013702
rss	feed
i ve attempted to set the create rss module s guid field to a value that s unique for each entry however the guid in the resultant feed remains identical for each entry

1013752
gif	png
png or even gif

button	checkbox
i would like to make a checkbox that looks exactly like a button

1013801
integer	unsigned
a size_t is an unsigned integer type that is guaranteed to be big enough to store the size in bytes of any object in memory

1013885
range	max	range	min	min	max
for example if the set of ids is small relative to the total number in the table and you know that the ids are relatively close together perhaps they will usually be recent additions and therefore clustered at the high end of the range you could try and include the predicate and fieldw between 109 and 891 after determining the min max id in your set in the c# code

1013896
ssl	https
preferably the embedded web service could handle https ssl type connections

1013911
apache	nginx	passenger	thin
check the ec2onrails mailing list where there has been a lot of discussion of the various thin nginx passenger apache alternatives and permutations plus some hard data posted based on some decent tests

1013924
maven	pom.xml
because by adding a dependency to your pom.xml the maven dependency management automatically retrieves the artifact from the repositories you specified and installs it to the local repository

1013927
vim	notepad++
get a decent text editor like notepad++ or vim if you re already proficient with it

1013927
mouse	keyboard
it may be easier to navigate with your keyboard rather than a mouse

1013929
put	get
if i put a breakpoint on the line of control2 where the control1 delegate is assigned i can step through and watch it get set in the control1 object

1013962
ant	maven
i m not sure if there is a maven plugin to handle this but it is fairly simple to use the maven ant tasks for this purpose

1013962
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
you don t need to have maven or a pom.xml file just ant and this build file

1013990
ferret	sphinx
and use sphinx instead of ferret as well

1014005
for-loop	arrays
is there a built-in way to do this or do you just have to iterate through the arrays with a for-loop

1014019
division	modulo
division and modulo will get your answer in just a few lines of code

1014028
for-loop	arrays
but i m not sure if that s better than iterating through the original arrays in a for-loop and just changing the values

1014054
ubuntu	linux	vmware	virtualbox
you could install virtualbox vmware or some equivalent and run ubuntu or your preferred linux distribution of course that way gaining access to the full unix toolset

1014138
put	get
do i need to give credit where the results are from and put a link to the original - if i get them from many places

1014207
folder	directory
i have a vs2008 i want to copy certain files from a directory into my bin folder

1014228
folder	directory
thats not the case its in the folder configuration of the teamcity data directory .buildserver

1014238
pull	push
create a thread or threads to pull an item off the filename queue open and parse and process the file and push the results into a result queue

1014258
pull	push
have the cpu thread push completed data into a queue which the hard disk thread then pull from as data comes in

1014274
ienumerable	iqueryable
however since i ve been able to use linq in c# i ve found that it s often easier to just work with ienumerable and use the iqueryable extension methods to get the information i need

1014302
hash	salt
this ticket will either be encrypted with a secret key that the authorized servers share or will be stamped with a hash of the ticket contents salt with a secret key that the servers share

1014332
inherited	properties
when i have entity b inherited from entity a using table-per-type for storage and try to write a linq query that filters on a properties on b for example

1014356
hex	binary
i would imagine your database is really storing the data as binary but the query editor will show it using hex encoding

1014381
merb	ruby-on-rails
instead of t4toolkit it uses a ruby script to do the generation job just as with ruby-on-rails or merb

1014408
mouse	keyboard
you could use the windows api to add a low-level keyboard mouse hook then mark as away when there s been no activity for a while then mark as available when the activity begins again

1014410
perforce	cvs
i have used cvs subversion vss and perforce so far

1014498
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
also note that if i was 0 when it got tested in the condition then it will be 1 in loops body for the while example so if i is an index for an arrays or something and not just keeping track of loops iterations you d be better to stick with just a for-loop which increments i after each iteration

1014515
ironruby	ironpython
an ironpython or ironruby project can be compiled to a dll or executable just fine and will be real executables in every way with the proviso that the person running them must have the relevant .net framework and dependencies installed dependencies may be present in the same directory by default instead but the framework must be installed

1014539
hide	show
on some of my company page i want to use show and hide toggle details while click on links

1014601
min	max
the most useful feature of a treemap is when you want to quickly find the min or max key

1014601
min	max
and algorithmically can be done in o log n time as opposed to iterating over each key looking for a min max if the collection is unsorted

1014609
hide	show
you can hide and show elements with jquery hide and show functions there is also a slidedown function

1014664
getter	setter
the injected attributes of the class are final immutability the builder class contains setter but not getter it doesn t need to as we declare it as an inner class of the class that is being constructed and no setter need to be created just for spring

1014671
superclass	subclassing
the superclass if this is a subclassing

1014678
nant	cruisecontrol
i have set up cruisecontrol for .net with svn as my source control and using nant build script

1014688
richfaces	icefaces
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

1014695
versioning	upgrade
one last thing you should do is to add table valued parameters to your wish-list of reasons to upgrade to the next versioning of sql server

1014734
fiddler	charles
i would bust out an http debugger like fiddler or charles for the mac and make sure the problem is ie and not something else like iis dropping mis-handling requests etc.

1014781
stdout	stderr
if you re using the exec task to execute devenv.exe change it to execute devenv.com this should print warnings to stdout i think it s stdout might be stderr but warnings shouldn t stop the build

1014817
pop-up	dialog
creating a pop-up dialog in an iframe

1014873
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
edit this appears to be the case in safari 3.x mac and google-chrome 3 alpha mac not in firefox mac

1014905
folder	directory
the server would have its data root directory and you can store groups of files in folder with a root meta-data entry in each folder

1014928
scrollable	panels
i am trying to create a scrollable panels within a table cell

1015016

1015202
qtcore	qtgui
-i usr include qt4 qtcore -i usr include qt4 qtgui -i usr include qt4 -i

1015245
cvs	svn
create a legacy branch in svn cvs for 1.1 and maintain that separately

1015245
versioning	upgrade
i have been in this position before and i did a cost-benefit analysis for management and showed that it would cost more money to do the dual versioning than do the upgrade

1015280
bmp	png
the bmp and png maintain the same bit depth as the tif

1015298
gif	png
if you really need compatibility offer both gif png

1015330
width	height
title testwindow height 500 width 500

1015341
width	text-align
why don t inline styles work in this case and why must i use a class selector for width but an element selector for text-align

1015369
for-loop	loops
without an explicit loops variable the for-loop uses the special variable called

1015428
groupbox	panel
you can group three radiobuttons together using a groupbox or a panel as is done here

1015446
groupbox	panel
just put them in a panel or groupbox as suggested by matthew

1015461
qtcore	qtgui
-i usr include qt4 qtcore -i usr include qt4 qtgui -i usr include qt4 -i

1015461

1015461
qtcore	qtgui
-i usr include qt4 qtcore -i usr include qt4 qtgui -i usr include qt4 -i

1015478
stdout	stderr
so when you say you are telling the shell to redirect stderr fileno 2 into stdout fileno 1

1015493
put	get
youâ re likely to get better user performance if you put the section links on the side bar menu and the subsection links in the tabs rather than the other way around

1015571
getter	setter	public	protected
is it possible to generate a property with a public getter and a protected setter with codedom

1015596
apache	nginx
use nginx over apache

1015622
jobs	cron
i use cron jobs to call a script each minute looking something like this

1015636
jobs	cron
if php would just wait altogether you would getting a high number of cron jobs stacking up at

1015731
3dsmax	blender	maya	blender	maya	3dsmax
i ve worked with maya 3dsmax softimage xsi blender modo blah blah over the years and will always use silo to model in regardless of the animation platform being used

1015743

1015913
maven	cobertura
i have a problem that when i run the cobertura target maven the report always shows 0 .i ve tried forking my junit tests and no luck

1015927
opera	firefox
a number of years ago there was a highly visible discussion about mis-use of http cookies leading to various cookie filtering proxys and eventually to active cookie filtering in browsers like firefox and opera

1015948
cvs	svn
another solution is to use the keyword substitution feature from cvs and svn perhaps git and mercurial have this feature too and make a clever use of this feature

1015950
portrait	landscape
in 3.0 uinavigationcontroller polls shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation on each push or pop and obeys what it returns the way you d expect if you re currently rotated in landscape left orientation and you push an instance of a view controller that only supports portrait orientation via shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation it automatically and instantly flips the logical orientation and slides in the new view the correct way in portrait orientation

1015978
coalesce	isnull
fyi - it s sql server syntax but coalesce is just like isnull for the most part

1016015
firefox	safari
these will load the page you give it in either firefox or safari and you can tweak them to loop like crazy and allow the flash movie to run

1016050
heroku	engineyard
in the beginning though if you just need the code updates and maybe rails migrations then you can do simpler things like passenger and code sync or look at tools like heroku or engineyard s stuff where they do a deploy by doing a git clone and then offer some additional abilities

1016073
post	get
the gist of it is that you join the wp_posts table with the taxonomy tables a couple times to get the post ids in your desired category and then join those ids with the taxonomy tables a couple more times to get the related tags

1016096
datamapper	activerecord
the application models a fairly complex domain and i d feel more comfortable using tools such as the ruby datamapper orm having using nhibernate in the .net world than rails activerecord

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
all of these considerations of course point to using merb yet i m aware that merb is being merged into ruby-on-rails for version 3 and will no longer exist as a distinct framework

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
i d really like to know if it would be worth starting development in merb now and then porting it to ruby-on-rails but i ve yet to find anything suggesting how difficult this may be

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
in essence i d like to know how portable a merb app is going to be to ruby-on-rails 3 but am aware that it may be too early for anyone other than the core developers to know this

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
the plan is to start working on ruby-on-rails immediately and to continue fixing bugs and resolving other major issues in merb in the interim

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
we will also release versions of merb specifically designed to help ease the transition to ruby-on-rails 3

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
in particular we will do merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms to assist developers in tracking down the changes that will come between merb 1.x and ruby-on-rails 3

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
expect a number of interim releases that get incrementally closer to ruby-on-rails 3 and expect parts of merb most notably the helpers to be ported to run on ruby-on-rails 3 in order to further reduce friction

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
if youâ ve already learned merb we will be working hard to make sure that you can parlay that knowledge into ruby-on-rails 3

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
at engine yard we fully intend to continue using merb for our internal apps until ruby-on-rails 3 is out but we will be using those non-trivial applications to be sure the experience is smooth for everyone

1016115
pop-up	dialog
you can pop-up dialog add content all interactively and save it all back to disk for future use

1016117
ant	emma
i m using emma in my ant process

1016137
post	get
if you searched for a phrase that was only in private post you would get a blank page without any error for example

1016166
pascal	delphi
if i recall correctly basic turned into pascal while pascal was busy turning into delphi

1016197
put	get
the problem is then the test classes are in their own libraries they don t get linked into the main test program unless i explicitly call them i have to put in

1016205
merb	ruby-on-rails
both the ruby-on-rails and merb communities are going to have to cope with the merging of the projects with the release of ruby-on-rails 3 but that s going to be awhile

1016205
merb	ruby-on-rails
likely after the ruby-on-rails 3 release you ll find great walk-throughs on upgrading your ruby-on-rails 2.x merb 1.x application to ruby-on-rails 3

1016215
hash	salt
the token could be a cryptographic hash of some salt plus the username so it couldn t be copied to give permission to another user

1016258
post	put	post	get	put	get
i want to be able to delete or view the contents of a particular post from one url by sending either delete put post or get not different urls with additional params

1016303
put	get
in this approach you just put all your classes into one namespace and get your code working

1016304
post	get
facebook s rest server is a pseudo one you can do it like them asking for the post method post get etc

1016304
post	put	post	get	put	get
in facebook you only have server.php and there is where you make the request even for post get put delete...

1016377
post	put	post	get	put	get
put post or get not different urls

1016413
comm	grep
it appears that grep -l solves the real problem of the poster but for the actual question asked finding the intersection of two sets of strings you might want to look into the comm command

1016440
post	put	post	get	put	get
those verbs get post put and delete together with the path indicate what you want to do to the data on the server

1016440
post	get
the request to render this url would look like get post 4

1016440
post	get
the item being deleted responding with a redirect to get post makes good sense

1016440
post	get
get post 4.xml is intuitive server please give me xml describing post #4. the response will be that xml

1016501
filtering	grouping
if you wish to not have a grouping of files within a project inspected you can filtering these files out so they are not inspected by creating a file filtering

1016512
postgresql	mysql
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

1016535
getter	setter
i think that getter and setter should only be used for variables which one needs to access or change outside a class

1016535
getter	setter
that s why i believe in the proper use of getter and setter but you don t need them for every private or protected variable

1016537
client-side	server-side
however you don t do this on the server-side with php you do it on the client-side with javascript

1016576
put	get
catch rowupdated and get the latest autoinc value in the db in put it in the new row

1016578
postgresql	mysql
also mssql and postgresql are said to scale better but there are various successful applications that seem to do fine with mysql facebook and flickr as examples

1016628
free	malloc
i can see how you could do this for memory allocated off the heap using a custom version of malloc and free but i don t know about enforcing it on the stack too

1016662
gif	png
concerning the mime type of the image only gif jpg and png are supported

1016664
onkeyup	onfocus
onpaste onkeyup and onfocus of the area for which you want to do this action

1016703
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring nsdata nsarray or

1016718
ubuntu	linux
this is how the ubuntu live-cd boots linux if you select to use another option

1016719
entities	entitymanager
the first ejb module is the one that will extend the base entities and add ejb to get it s entitymanager

1016765
urllib	httplib
in python i m using httplib because it keep-alive the http connection as oppose to urllib 2

1016765
httplib	cookielib
now i want to use cookielib with httplib but they seem to hate each other

1016819
put	get
again you don t have to use it and you can happily write a manual bootstrap class to get you used to how the framework is put together

1016823
titlebar	window
is there any way i can rename the window titlebar of an application that i ve launched

1016853
versioning	upgrade
so i have been developing against the iphone 3.0 beta s and have just gone to upgrade to the final versioning released this week

1016853
versioning	upgrade
any iphone developers out there know how do you upgrade to final versioning of 3.0

1016896
width	height
therefore i need to get the screen width and screen height and then set position

1016930
int	chars
in this string the first three chars are alphabetical and the next seven are int

1016955
for-loop	arrays
is there a way to do this without having to resort to a for-loop to go through the arrays

1016966
datamapper	activerecord
zend framework does not use activerecord but instead uses the table data gateway and row data gateway pattern and uses a datamapper to map the contents of the row data gateway to the model because activerecord breaks down when your models don t have a 1 1 mapping to your database tables

1016966
getter	setter
to me their example looks very bloated with a ton of getter and setter all over the place

1016966
getter	setter
i came across various blog posts about domain driven design arguing that using so many getter and setter is bad practice because it exposes all the inner model data to the outside so it has no advantage over public attributes

1016966
getter	setter
my question if you remove those getter and setter how will you render your views

1016966
getter	setter
following the mvc and zend example seems to break ddd and leaves me typing up a whole lot of getter setter and datamappers for all my models

1016975
cos	sin
the coordinates of any point on an ellipse which center is x y are x + a cos c y + b sin c with a and b defining the size of the ellipse and c defining the angle in 0 2pi

1016986
foldable	traversable
foldable traversable typeclasses that abstract many of the operations of lists so that the same functions can be applied to other container types

1017043
int	chars
note unlike other escapes for unicode rtf uses the decimal signed short int 2 bytes representation for a unicode chars

1017065
folder	directory
as my properties file is necessarily in current directory in .. or in .. .. i wrote a small groovy code that checks these three folder

1017116
folder	directory
you rename the directory with subversion tortoisesvn whatever of course you have to rename the folder with the rename command of a subversion client otherwise you will end up in trouble

1017122
move	drag
using tortoisesvn right-click on folder you want to move and while holding button down drag to new location

1017132
children	parent
it is actually a simpler scenario parent child relationship with the children referencing their parent but you could probably adapt it for your needs

1017170
ubuntu	debian
if you re using debian or ubuntu something like

1017170
vim	emacs
you ll find that advanced editors like emacs and vim add a lot of functionality and so will help with ensuring that your syntax is correct before you try and build your document output

1017180
ubuntu	linux
most linux distributions have installation packages for tex live--see for example the package database entries for ubuntu and fedora

1017208
versioning	upgrade
once the first versioning of the database has been put into production you will need not only build scripts mainly for developers but also upgrade scripts based on the same principles

1017209
vim	emacs
most editors such as vim or emacs come with tex editing modes

1017255
int	chars
also note that in c++ the size of the int and chars members is not defined in bits

1017309
versioning	upgrade
i m also unsure whether including thiry-party components into versioning control is a good thing because of the space it takes - though you can also put them somewhere else and include them as external which makes it much smaller but also imposes the problem that upgrading the components for one app will upgrade them for all - so you better have good integration tests

1017339
jboss	weblogic
i am trying to run a jsf 1.2 application created using eclipse ganemede and jboss tools on weblogic 10.0 mp1

1017339
jboss	weblogic
i have configured a weblogic domain and a server using the jboss tools plugin through eclipse

1017344
post	get
will post if i get more

1017354
pylons	turbogears	web.py	pylons	web.py	turbogears
once you ve done this it s not very hard to take the next step and move to turbogears or pylons or web.py for a very simple framework

1017355
post	get
to get raw body of post request use

1017385
asterisk	ivr
asterisk - can do ivr and ivvr with some extensions but we use it for call management

1017409
postgresql	mysql
take mysql or postgresql

1017449

1017523
postgresql	mysql
ms sql server express postgresql sql mysql

1017547
implements	extends
if you re looking to manage state across events such as the browser closing you ll need implements your own state management mechanism persist state to a database for example and use a regular cookie with a long lifetime or with a sliding expiration where you extends the lifetime by a small amount of time on each request in your server side script to match state to the user

1017565
udp	tcp

1017603
postgresql	mysql
if you re doing a typical webapp my advice would be to go with mysql or postgresql as they re free and well supported by just about any orm you could think of my personal preference is towards postgresql but i m not experienced enough with either of these to make a good argument one way or another

1017893
inherited	properties
similarly having a common ancestor recipe type super class means that its very properties fields and methods can be expected in all sub classes inherited child recipes in other words a generic chocolate cake recipe might be used to create two new specialized versions of a chocolate cake white chocolate cake and dark chocolate cake where the color of the chocolate merely becomes an attribute that may be configurable using a chocolate cake specific method like setchocolatecolor

1017926

the purpose of didturnintofault is to give you a chance to release any instances variables particularly for transient values you might be holding

1018110
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
while it is meant to be used as a replacement for dealloc for nsmanagedobject subclasses that s because the life cycle of an nsmanagedobject is quite different from an ordinary nsobject

1018127
put	get
sending a little data should be simple you build a http get request and just put your data in the url - however there is a limit to the length of urls - sometimes this is restricted by device or by the network that you are using the device on - and sometimes by the server at the other end

1018142

1018384
versioning	upgrade
now when you install this versioning onto a device that has the old model - it will automatically upgrade that model to the new model

1018391
getter	setter
when using a dependency property the get and set methods must just be simple wrappers for this.getvalue and this.setvalue the reason for this is that wpf does not use the getter or setter to access the value so you can t depend on the extra code running all the time

1018447
int	boolean
to give one tiny example when you distinguish clearly between expressions and statements as opposed to is syntactically incorrect for using a statement where an expression was expected and not merely a type error for using an int where a boolean was expected

1018510
integer	unsigned
first you are casting the pointer to a signed integer - that s wrong - pointers are unsigned

1018548
division	modulo
the code is deployed and works but i was wondering if there was a better approach than writing a bunch of if switch integer division and modulo statements

1018624
ilist	icollection
does not require icollection or ilist

1018655
width	height
the css below will give you two background images that don t scroll in the page background - set the width of #mydiv to whatever you want or leave it unset for 100 and its height to 2000px just to test the scrolling and use your image urls instead of the example

1018704
sorting	filtering
i m trying to write a linq to sql method that handles sorting paging and filtering for an ajax grid

ubuntu	centos
i have now changed over from ubuntu to centos 4 and have tried again now i am getting random replys from the systems when i use wireshark

1018853
alloca	malloc
alloca allocates memory from stack rather than heap which is case in malloc

1018869
getter	setter
as far a possible create everything as an object with properties that have getter where you hide complexity and setter only if they can t be read only

1018881
alloca	malloc
however if the thing you want to alloc using alloca is reasonably small i think that it s a good technique that s faster and more convenient than using malloc or otherwise

1018884
notepad++	textpad
notepad++ is a good choice and so is textpad

1018898
division	multiplication
this is also the reason why it has actually become incorrect to state that relational division is the relational inverse of cartesian product as real-number division is the inverse of real-number multiplication

1018974

how to show in the wpf listview using the gridview an empty text like in asp.net please select a person or 0 items founded

1019063
coalesce	isnull
second do you have a lot of code that is using isnull or coalesce which you need to update these things slow performance so if you no longer need to check for them you should change the code

1019063
put	get
sometimes people will put in bad information to allow them to get rid of nulls

1019082
qmainwindow	qwidget
maybe i m missing something here but have you tried subclassing the qmainwindow class and overriding the qwidget event method to always return false

1019082
qapplication	qcoreapplication
if this doesn t work you could attempt to redirect the events to the desktop by calling qcoreapplication notify and passing the event to the desktop widget obtained by calling qapplication desktop

1019083
integer	unsigned
i have a big number integer unsigned stored in 2 variables as you can see the high and low part of number

1019083
subtract	add
i know how to add or subtract some other that-kind of variable

1019093
hide	show
this uses a manual tooltip and timer to show hide a caption when the mouse moves over the title bar

1019212
groupbox	panel
a groupbox may have a caption whereas a panel may not

1019215
bazaar	git
if you choose a dvcs mercurial bazaar -- or git since it works really well on windows you would not be able to get the same inheritance effect -- when you are selecting different versions with different successive select rules -- as said in that answer

1019258
groupbox	panel
the panel control is similar to the groupbox control

1019258
groupbox	panel
however only the panel control can have scroll bars and only the groupbox control displays a caption

1019258
groupbox	panel
also border styles of groupbox and panel are different

1019281
x86	64bit
windows uses completely different data structures to implement exception handling on 32-bit vs 64bit and on itanium vs x86

1019296
subtract	add
3 subtract shifted divisor from dividend and add one to result

1019357
width	height
i get questions a lot from designers about not only width but what height to use to keep everything above the fold

1019359
subtract	add	subtract	addition	subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
you can do addition and subtraction of arbitrarily large binary objects using the assembler looping and add subtract with carry adc sbb instructions

error type of accessor does not match the type of properties

1019383
folder	directory
i was wondering if it was possible to bind some filenames in a given directory of the clientbin folder to a combobox

1019389
multiplication	exponent
in other words fully factor the number into unique primes and exponent and do a simple multiplication from there

1019392
put	get
well get rid of the quotes then trim then put the quotes back

1019393
int	double
there s an identical question here in c# convert string to nullable type int double etc...

1019406
vim	emacs
despite being a vim user i m interested in starting to learn emacs

1019406
vim	emacs
however whenever i start to follow the emacs tutorial i end up hitting vim commands by accident and get frustrated with it

1019417
vim	emacs
the duration and intensity of the vim versus emacs debate suggests rather strongly that both editors are about equal in their usefulness

1019419
128bit	64bit	16-bit	64bit
if your processor or your c library has a fast 64bit divide you can break the 128bit divide into pieces the same way you d do a 32-bit divide on processors that had 16-bit divisions

1019461
post	get
from this post someone mentions recording x11 events this may get you halfway

1019462
gif	bmp
is there any image processing tool to convert .svg scalable vector graphics files to any other common widely used image format such as jpeg gif bmp etc

1019465
vim	emacs
i don t have any experience with this i use vim but vimpulse is an emacs script to emulate vim as apposed to viper-mode which emulates vi

1019508
jquery	scriptaculous
if you haven t it s probably a browser compatibility issue - i would try jquery dojo or scriptaculous because they work smoothly with common browsers

1019518
accessor	properties
if you want to be sure that the returned array is not mutable you could declare the properties as in your original example and then roll your own accessor

1019558
post	get
i have heard that web crawlers are supposed to follow only get requests and not post ones

1019573
hdd	floppy
i m working on a project where the user is able to save their work most likely to the hdd but also possibly any other media including floppy disks

1019594
getter	setter
properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines of code less code to maintain less bugs

1019647
getter	setter
maybe a minor point but with getter setter i find it annoying that when i m cycling through them in an ide with intellisense there s a massive block of getter next to each other and another block of setter

1019648
min	max
not the min one or the max value but the top n value encountered by sql server 2008

1019649
accessor	properties
properties are a runtime supported method of exposing a pair of get set methods that have metadata support which means they are discoverable using reflection without guessing what methods are supposed to form the accessor based on method name and signature

1019649
getter	setter
in the case of properties it doesn t mater if there is ambiguity between a function call and field access because for the greatest part you don t pay the function call cost property getter and setter because of their simplicity are high candidates for inlining which means that cost wise the are closer to fields than function calls

1019659
getter	setter
it is implied that a getter setter will be quick

1019678
postgresql	mysql
therefore postgresql and mysql developers don t get feel the need to improve it

1019740
multiplication	exponent
but if that s why it s so much slower why doesn t it perform a check for an int exponent and then just do the multiplication

1019751
perforce	svn
when i worked for a company in the middle of a switch the decision was between svn and perforce

1019808
multiplication	exponent
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

1019822
translation	localization
then i ll incorporate the localization using the integrated translation environment and distribute localized updates

1019823
nscountedset	nsmutableset
the ability to optionally make nsset nsmutableset nscountedset store and enumerate objects in sorted order like a binary search tree would certainly be welcome

1019823
nsscanner	nsnumberformatter
currently you have to roll your own with an nsnumberformatter or nsscanner and the process is tedious and error-prone

1019823
nsstring	nsnumberformatter
for example see nsnumberformatter to format us telephone numbers and remove all but numbers from nsstring .

1019846
getter	setter
with properties you can eliminate the boilerplate getter and setter for the 90 of properties that have only trivial getter and setter

1019873
width	height
i have fixed width height div

1019904
stdio	gets
note this also gets rid of the stdio and stderr

inherited	subclassing
mysub is now a subclassing of drvcrystalfontz and some_other_class inherited their methods and adds a new one some_extra_method

1019931
serializable	deserialization
while this limitation is understandable for deserialization i would be satisfied with just serializable for web use

1019934
comparator	comparable
treeset uses comparator defined by comparable or compare defined by comparator

1019938
google-chrome	safari
i m aware of this question but none of the answers work in safari google-chrome etc

1019954
qpalette	qstyle
an alternative could be to use qpalette to get the correct colours and qstyle to get the correct spacing

1019992
getter	setter
as for why to use properties instead of getter setter methods i would suggest the following thoughts

1020038
vim	emacs
as you probably know from learning vim vim and emacs fluency comes only with tons of practice until the commands become second-nature

1020038
vim	emacs
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

1020038
vim	emacs
after a while you start to compartmentalize the two mentally and you probably won t have much difficulty though i still occasionally wq emacs and c- vim it doesn t happen often enough to be a problem

1020038
vim	emacs
a lot of the terminology and functionality of vim and emacs is similar but just different enough to make it all confusing

1020038
vim	emacs
much like h is indispensable in vim the emacs help system is a great boon in navigating emacs enormous set of builtin commands

1020038
vim	emacs
emacs will never be as good a vim as vim

1020038
vim	emacs
the emacs way of doing things is very different but it has strengths and weaknesses of its own compared to the vim set of keybindings

1020038
vim	emacs
nowadays i have borrowed a bunch of emacs shortcuts and mapped them in vim and vice versa

1020038
vim	emacs
when not if emacs starts to make you foam at the mouth in rage take a break hop into vim and come back later

1020038
vim	emacs
you aren t going to forget vim and replace it in your brain with emacs

1020038
vim	emacs
if you know vim and you learn emacs then you will know both

1020072
qapplication	qcoreapplication
see qapplication or qcoreapplication for a method named something like post

1020081
submit	submission
the web server accepts an upload of the source file a process polls the submission directory processes the file and then submit the result to another directory which the web application polls until it finds the result and displays it

1020081
freebsd	linux
since you use linux i d investigate user mode linux or linux-vserver which are very similar in concept to freebsd jails i ve never used them myself but have read about them

1020086
irrlicht	ogre3d
one way to get back in and have fun at the same time is to go through nehe s opengl tutorials or by using higher-level gaming frameworks such as irrlicht or ogre3d

1020126
ilist	icollection
the code below will work with any ilist or icollection but the same technique can be used with any data source like always if you want the display to update when you add or remove items you need to use an observablecollection or similar

1020168
mouse	keyboard
humans use the computer through the keyboard mouse and interaction with the console or the window manager

1020175
google-chrome	firefox
but not just internet explorer it should also work for anyone trying to run google-chrome or firefox too

1020218
hash	salt
tradeoff hashing will not help much if your attacker knows both the hash pin and the salt

1020236
mouse	keyboard
humans use the computer through the keyboard mouse and interaction with the console or the window manager

1020236
mouse	keyboard
no keyboard no mouse no console no window manager

1020236
post	get
all i see are http get and post requests

1020236
mouse	keyboard
i have no use for keyboard mouse console or window manager

1020243
portrait	landscape
also supporting dynamically change screen sizes between portrait and landscape

1020249
hash	salt
so you will use a properly salt hash

1020256
maven	pom.xml
if you don t want to use maven for your own project you will need to modify the libraries poms and repackage them yourself download the sources add the above snippet to pom.xml and run mvn package

1020258
post	put
the post or put payload can contain data organized however you want

1020259
hash	salt
passwords with salt hash are best

1020275
cvs	svn
svn cvs done right as they claim is somewhat better

1020275
cvs	svn
so if you have real need for branching and merging at least get svn not cvs

1020312
getter	setter
this data is centralized by means of a singleton class which aggregates a couple of arraycollections arrays value objects and some other native member variables exposed via getter and setter

1020339
bazaar	git
the big hosting sites for mercurial bitbucket git github and bazaar launchpad should give you plenty of projects to browse and hopefully contribute to -

1020370
folder	directory
one thing to note is that my iis virtual directory only contains my silverlightapp.web folder

1020429
mantis	bugzilla
you don t have to do what everyone else is doing take for example the loads of time wasting cms projects out there while there seems to be no proper ocr in java and jira is a great issue tracking system no doubt but its not open source bugzilla sucks don t say mantis and eventum is written in php i m a java fanatic

1020437
hex	binary
14 could be written as xiv in roman numerals fourteen or 0xfe in hex or 11111110 in binary

1020483
hide	show
the usual solution is to show hide them as appropriate

1020503
bluetooth	usb
they both run on a pc and remotely control the nxt via bluetooth or usb

1020560
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it s not jquery but in firefox opera and safari you can use window.getcomputedstyle element to get the computed styles for an element and in ie 8 you can use element.currentstyle

1020586
x86	64bit
intel adopted amd s extensions for 64bit instructions so a value of x86_64 means you re running either an intel or amd 64bit processor otherwise you re running the regular x86 isa

1020604
keydown	keyup
that is used in the drupal.jsac function to bind the element s keydown keyup and blur events with triggers the autocomplete ajax operation which caches its values in the acdb object for that element opens popups etc

1020604
hide	show
it may be more sensible to create different autocomplete fields and simply hide and show them based on the value of the select

1020612
bindingsource	dataview
b is there an alternate way to add stuff to the bindingsource dataview at run-time especially the image column which preserves the use of .filter

1020621
mp3	ogg
ended up going with javazoom s vorbis spi and jorbis for ogg vorbis music after we found out we d need to pay royalties if we used mp3 via jlayer also from javazoom

1020630
strsplit	substr
for example you can write a generic version of strsplit that returns a strongly typed list so long as you tell it how to convert substr into t s

1020647
stateless	stateful
it attempts to turn stateless browser requests into a beast resembling a stateful form application not always successful and usually not gracefully large viewstate hidden fields broken back button functionality reliance on javascript for simple navigation

1020671
ienumerable	ienumerator
pass an ienumerator string rather than the ienumerable string by calling getenumerator

1020678
dictionary	map
this is not a suggested solution but the easiest way to see that this will always work is that you could store these immutable values into a map dictionary hashtable like structure keyed by a variable name

1020708
lisp	scheme
eventually you will probably develop a preference for scheme or common lisp but they both have enough differences that it s best to get a handle on everything that s out there

1020708
lisp	scheme
scheme has continuations for example and it s good to learn about those in scheme even though they can be implemented in common lisp

1020710
pop-up	dialog
i am having difficulty with the dialog box that pop-up when i try to check out a document

1020712

put x in get y out

1020740
put	get
now you put in a value of 3 in and you get a value of 6 out

1020749
public	protected
what are public private and protected in object oriented programming

1020753
getter	setter
protected means that a class and its subclasses have access to the variable but not any other classes they need to use a getter setter to do anything with the variable

1020754
public	protected
broadly speaking public means everyone is allowed to access private means that only members of the same class are allowed to access and protected means that members of subclasses are also allowed

1020766
gentoo	linux	gentoo	solaris	irix	linux	unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix	solaris	irix	redhat	fedora
streamcm runs on a variety of platforms - unix solaris aix hp-ux irix etc. linux redhat fedora gentoo etc. windows xp vista and on macos ppc and intel

1020775
postgresql	mysql
the database would be postgresql or mysql

1020776
implements	modifiers
they are access modifiers and help us implements encapsulation or information hiding

1020806
lisp	scheme
this is no doubt why the little schemer was translated from lisp into scheme

1020810
union	distinct
this is effectively a pivot but it s easiest to represent as the union of two distinct sets - the set of publications and the set of areas they are linked to

1020810
union	distinct
a union all will probably produce multiple areas is two publications are in the same area so you ll need a distinct to stop the duplicates there if you use union all

1020819
width	height
the check for a monochrome cursor simply tests whether the height is twice the width

1020820
int	chars
a quick program with a simple structure containing int and chars members and a function showed that size of the structure was sizeof int +sizeof chars

1020820
int	chars
i have a one big struct class with simple int chars etc data types but a large number of them

1020822

1020828
jdom	dom4j
jon doe suggested dom4j and jdom

1020843
trac	bugzilla	trac	mantis	mantis	bugzilla
also using mylyn allows you to migrate your tasks to real back-end when you re ready like bugzilla trac mantis etc

1020848
jdom	dom4j
dom4j or jdom are probably the most elegant you can write code how you like it

1020862
stateless	stateful
stateless programming is just as expressive and powerful as stateful programming it just requires a little practice to train yourself to start thinking statelessly

1020862
stateless	stateful
of course stateless programming when possible stateful programming where necessary seems to be the motto of most impure functional languages

1020885
width	height
the height width and opacity of each

1020885
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout
also there are other ways to hide and reveal elements such as fadein and fadeout

client-side	server-side
i m using the jquery validate plugin for client-side processing yes backed up with server-side stuff too the validation can t be done inline as the form needs to pass xhtml strict edit see my addendum below

1020991
stdout	stderr
reading stdout and stderr and communicating via stdin

1020994
lisp	scheme
however my lisp-oid experience is was mostly with scheme rather than common lisp so i may be subconsciously biased by the familiarity with the uniform namespace that in the end comes from that experience

1020997
lisp	scheme
a lisp-1 has a single namespace for both variables and functions as in scheme while a lisp-2 has separate namespaces for variables and functions as in common lisp

1020997
lisp	scheme
lisp-1 refers to scheme s model and lisp-2 refers to common lisp s model

1021044
packets	multicast
their is a special handshake at the switch level its telling the switch you are part of the multicast group so that you will also receive the packets

1021044
packets	multicast
what you need to do is join the multicast group then just recv the packets and write them to a file then i would assume the mpeg2 mpeg4 or however the stream is sent will be a file on your machine that should be playable through another program

1021077
versioning	upgrade
there are some very few obscure breaking changes when you upgrade to later versioning of the framework usually due to the use of deprecated apis or non-standard methods

1021131
boost	stl
for general purpose boost is best of breed and don t forget about the good old stl so i don t see the point of looking for something else that will cover much of the same ground but is not as polished

1021209
mouse	keyboard
the input structures can either be a mouse or keyboard event

1021217
width	height
then pretty much resize the movie as the browser window is resized and calculate the height from the new width divided by the original aspect ratio

1021238
mouse	keyboard
here is how you simulate input both mouse and keyboard

1021246
wav	flac
i second lunatiks answer but suggest flac instead of wav

1021246
mp3	flac
flac stands for free lossless audio codec an audio format similar to mp3 but lossless meaning that audio is compressed in flac without any loss in quality

1021246
mp3	flac
this is similar to how zip works except with flac you will get much better compression because it is designed specifically for audio and you can play back compressed flac files in your favorite player or your car or home stereo see supported devices just like you would an mp3 file

1021246
wav	flac
the reason why you d want to go with a lossless method flac or wav for storage in a warehouse is as follows

1021246
mp3	wav
if you do for example wav - mp3 - rm you will end up with a file that has artifacts from mp3 encoding and rm encoding

1021269
int	chars
in this case you have one box on the floor with the variables argc an int argv a pointer to a chars array a an int and b an int

1021276
mp3	ogg
xiph the people behind ogg vorbis have published a comparison between the leading codecs rm mp3 wma aac and ogg - you can listen and compare each of the codecs

1021318
fiddler	charles
a web debugging proxy fiddler charles etc.

1021322
public	protected
public private and protected keywords are used to specify access to these members properties and methods of a class from other classes or other .dlls or even other applications

1021345
for-loop	loops	put	get
put that in a for-loop to loops the color from 0 to 15 and you will get kids excited about programming

1021348
int	boolean
the mechanism which has the test on one line doesn t have that issue but generally it would be better to separate the test into a function which takes an int representing a year and returns a boolean representing whether or not the year is a leap year

1021354
macbook	isight
i had an old ibm laptop that had a keyboard light led mounted in the top of the lcd frame where the isight is on a macbook or macbook pro

1021397
helpers	actioncontroller
my conclusion was that you can have the config in place but you need to work with frontcontroller plugins or actioncontroller helpers

1021397
helpers	actioncontroller
from the helpers you can then load the actioncontroller and on that execute the getinvokeargs to load the bootstrap

1021402
post	get
i m not sure you can do it for post parameters but in case you will use get method you can pass parameters explicitly

1021404
postgresql	mysql
any relational database will do mysql postgresql sqllite oracle sql server - pick one

1021406
post	get
i don t understand why i get this message because i send a freshly created token in my post request

1021418
chm	winhelp
it s all available from the embarcadero website here in chm winhelp pdf html format

1021444
google-chrome	firefox
after trying jitters suggestion and getting it working in ie8 i realised the issue was with firefox and google-chrome when i click the button only

1021464
getter	setter
i m changing some classes of mine from an extensive use of getter and setter to a more pythonic use of properties

1021464
getter	setter
but now i m stuck because some of my previous getter or setter would call the corresponding method of the base class and then perform something else

1021464
getter	setter
how to call the property getter or setter in the parent class

1021470
django	web.py
for server-side actually almost every web framework web.py django etc. has its own form generation as well as validation lib for you to use

1021540
perforce	svn
i m not a git or svn user my main experience is with perforce but i ll try and outline some best practices that should work for any large enterprise level scm system

1021562
integer	unsigned
using 2 digits provides 31 major releases for signed 16 bit integer or 63 for unsigned

1021625
post	get
it seems that the server continues to add the normal get post content for that url

1021634
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
there are other frameworks out there that solve the same problem in a more straightforward fashion i suggest you have a look at openrasta and snooze or even asp.net-mvc

1021658
antlr	irony
you could pick a parsing framework that has a lot of existing grammars like antlr or newer ones like irony and use that

1021737
for-loop	loops
i was trying to figure out if a for-loop was faster than a foreach loops and was using the system.diagnostics classes to time the task

1021747
width	height
set exact width and height for them and overflow hidden and a float left on the li s

1021768
cvs	svn
it has a file control plugin that should do the trick among cvs svn and others

1021800
width	height
at the end of generating a crossword give it a score based on how many of the words were placed the more the better how large the board is the smaller the better and the ratio between height and width the closer to 1 the better

1021848
vbscript	jscript
keep in mind that classic asp includes jscript as well as vbscript

1021848
vbscript	jscript
interestingly you can parse json using jscript and use the resulting objects directly in vbscript

1021848
vbscript	jscript
you can access the contents of the jscript array from vbscript using dot notation

1021849
ant	maven
use a tool like ant or maven to specify and compile all the files in various packages and produce your final distribution

1021854
filesystems	xfs
among popular filesystems such as ext3 ext4 xfs jfs reiserfs reiser4 etc

1021857
factors	matrix
this one is about highly parallelizable approximate matrix factors suitable for use in kernel methods in machine learning

1021921
put	get
well it is possible to get the string that you need to put into the createquery method automatically

1021930
client-side	server-side
to smoothly integrate client-side dojo functionality with django server-side web apps i d look at dojango which does work fine with gae as well as without

1021959
width	height
you can have attributes like height width number of rooms city where it is located etc

1021984
queue	fifo
if you have large files or lots of traffic you could persist a fifo queue in a database and have a windows service take them out and execute them

1021988
min	max
i didn t want to know the exact number of rows that would return i just wanted to know if it would return rows that were between 1 and 100 or if it would return rows from min userid to 1 and 100 to max userid

1021990
nunit	mstest
for testing frameworks both nunit and mstest are good

1021990
nunit	mstest
there are nunit addins available for vs but they are quite as fully integrated as mstest

1021990
post	get
there s a blog post here about how to get going with that and an article here

1022000
googletest	gmock
i ran into this issue trying to detect googletest and gmock the google unit testing and object mocking frameworks with autotools and here s what i came up with

1022024
crypt	salt
function char crypt const char key const char salt

1022024
crypt	salt
the crypt function takes a password key as a string and a salt character array which is described below and returns a printable ascii string which starts with another salt

1022024
crypt	salt
without a salt an intruder can make a guess run crypt on it once and compare the result with all the passwords

1022024
crypt	salt
with a salt the intruder must run crypt once for each different salt

1022024
crypt	salt
the result of crypt will be the salt followed by a if the salt didn t end with one followed by 22 characters from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z up to 34 characters total

1022024
crypt	salt
for the des-based algorithm the salt should consist of two characters from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z and the result of crypt will be those two characters followed by 11 more from the same alphabet 13 in total

1022024
crypt	salt
to verify a password against the result of a previous call to crypt pass the result of the previous call as the salt

1022024
proftpd	vsftpd
if you want ftp-only users i would recommend using a ftp daemon that supports virtual users like glftpd pure-ftpd proftpd vsftpd .

1022026
accessor	properties	getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
java uses getter and setter or accessor and mutators wheras in c# you might be making properties for your classes

1022030
subtract	add
you can t sum dates but you can subtract them and get a time interval that you can halve and add back to the first date

1022051
getter	setter
the fact that some getter don t have a corresponding setter is normal since you might not want every attribute to be both accessed and changed

1022064
jruby	mri
the details vary by implementation but i know that at least in jruby and mri 1.8 there is a construct called an include class that is inserted in to the inheritance chain of a class when a module is extended or included

1022106
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i don t know why sortedlist and sorteddictionary don t as both would be able to search pretty easily

1022107
mvp	presenter
typically when you start implementing stuff using the mvp pattern you will start writing presenter logic at the same time defining the view interface

1022114
websphere	ibm
but i had a quick look to see if there are any messaging appenders for log4j i use log4net quite often - ibm have an article on a websphere mq jms appender which might be helpful to you

1022135
udp	tcp
it has very small overhead and is mostly used over udp or local unix sockets but may use tcp if you need reliable logging

1022170
ant	maven
if you are using fairly standard tools such as svn and ant maven - you should have a build up and running in 5 minutes

1022190
hudson	bamboo
we use hudson too and if it wasn t the recession we would probably use bamboo and most of the atlassian products bamboo crucible confluence together with jira

1022220
sorting	grouping
this is called natural sorting where you effectively treat a grouping of digits as a single character

1022225
sorting	filtering
this may also instruct sql server to filtering on k1 k3 k4 k5 k6 and order on k7 asc in one pass permitting sql server to stream the query results without the intermediate step of sorting a million results first

1022235
codeigniter	cakephp
once thing i will tell you is that if you want to streamline your understanding and your efficiency i have found great success with a number of mvc frameworks codeigniter cakephp etc

1022269
dictionary	map
most of us are familiar with the dictionary abstract data type that stores key-value associations whether we call it a map dictionary associative array hash etc

1022288
capitalize	uppercase
capitalize turns the first character uppercase and the rest of the string lowercase

1022329
jobs	cron
getting started with cron jobs and php zend framework

1022329
jobs	cron
php running scheduled jobs cron jobs

1022412
stdout	stderr
and the emulator writes all stdout stderr text to a file

1022429
cpython	ironpython
i would like to make my code portable across python implementations cpython ironpython and jython

1022466
inherited	subclassing
worker ant queen ant drone ant derive from ant and thus exhibit ad-hoc polymorphism where they all derive from the same ant class and exibit subtyping polymorphism inherited of the ant class these ants are all a subclassing of the ant class and inherited the 6 legs 2 eyes 3 body segments etc

1022486
min	max
so here s my dilemma should my data access layer contain a query that uses a more complicated stored procedure selecting min max and using if else to determine if they have been exceeded to determine exactly which records to retrieve in order to treat the records as being linked in a circle

1022486
min	max
or should the business logic layer determine whether or not the user has requested an id + offset that exceeds min or max and then use simple dal methods to accomplish what it needs to return

1022504
rss	feed
it looks like is messed up as are the 0.92 and 2.0 rss feed

1022514
put	get
to get the top 5 records of that query but i only want to select a certain record is there anything i can put into this query to do that similar to top

1022520
xfce	gnome
i m using gnome now and want to install xfce

1022520
xfce	gnome
nothing complicated but just curious - do all applications installed previously on gnome will be also removed or they would work on xfce properly after installing xfce and removing gnome

1022554
cvs	svn
if you use something like svn or cvs no

1022565
filtering	grouping
usually that includes grouping datasets and such or filtering data by some criteria

1022596
ada	pascal
pascal and many of its descendants too - ada modula oberon etc.

1022602
maven	pom.xml
you should be able to compile your code by adding the gmaven plugin to your maven pom.xml

1022646
persistent	transient
i shouldn t need to double the number of model classes just to have transient versions of my objects â not when i want them to behave exactly the same sans persistent

1022646
persistent	transient
yes the other option is to have an in-memory persistent store which houses all of the entities you want to be transient

1022659
postgresql	mysql
if you decide to switch to mysql or postgresql you can run the following standard command to save your database on the windows machine

1022659
postgresql	mysql
and then configure the settings.py on the linux machine for the mysql or postgresql database and run

1022683
opera	firefox
while it isn t yet standard in javascript mozilla s js engine and opera s to an extent has supported a similar feature since js 1.7 available as part of firefox 2 under the name destructuring assignment

1022683
for-loop	loops
in javascript the body of a for-loop doesn t introduce a new scope so any functions declared in loops body all reference the same outer variables

1022683
for-loop	loops
in lua each iteration of the for-loop creates new local variables for each loops variable

1022719
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if you use box-sizing border-box you can set width 100

1022719
width	margin
and the total of the width border margin and padding will be what is specified for the width

1022719
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox 3.5 and safari 4 support it not sure about ie8 or google-chrome

1022726
clang	llvm
llvm clang doesn t seem prime-time ready

1022734
getter	setter
you don t need to implement all the getter setter you can use__get and __set

1022743
multiplying	add
let s solve the system as they teach in some high schools multiplying first equation by second by -a.m 1 and add if in doubt do this on a piece of paper to solve for v.x

1022743
integer	fractions
this function only works for integer values of n even though for some matrices we can also define a fractions power such as square root in other words a matrix b such that

1022743
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
because those are still instances of our matrix class we can do quite a lot of operations with those addition subtraction multiplication division power - it s all already implemented

1022751
width	height
however the user then resizes the window and i can resize the rectangle correctly by using a transformation based on the ratio of the new height and width to the old height and width but i lose my relative positioning the rectangle s coordinates are now incorrect see image - this is a rough mockup of the problem

1022751
width	height
its resize is constrained by the other application but the aspect ratio width height changes by some unknown function

1022794
ant	maven	ant	emma
i know you can in standalone emma and with ant but i haven t yet figured out how to do this with maven and emma

1022838
google-chrome	firefox
explorer ie firefox portable google-chrome portable iron chrom without google crap also portable qtweb arora

1022839
google-chrome	firefox
explorer ie firefox portable google-chrome portable iron chrom without google crap also portable qtweb arora

1022840
google-chrome	firefox
web-browser ie firefox portable google-chrome portable iron chrom without google crap also portable qtweb arora

1022846
width	height
you can hook into every resize event and get the values there but in most case you can t just ask for a height or width and get what you want

1022880
width	height
in drawframe i set width and height

1022880
width	height
in drawcircle i need to access the width and height of drawframe

1022880
width	height
am i declaring width and height wrong in drawframe

1022895
width	height
then you can get the width height like so

1022918
x86	64bit
see documentation x86 boot.txt link to 2.6.30 s version for more detail for the traditional x86 architecture both 32-bit and 64bit including how these variables are passed to the kernel setup code

1022952
width	height
thatâ s because you are not setting the width and height fields in jframe but you are setting them on local variables

1022952
width	height
fields height and width are inhereted from imageobserver

1022952
width	height
if width and height represent state of the frame then you could refactorize them to fields and write getters for them

1022952
width	height
in drawframe i set width and height

1022952
width	height
width and height of drawframe

1022970
getter	setter
is there a good no a very good reason to go through all the trouble of using getter and setter for object-oriented languages

1022970
getter	setter
was i just too tired and fell asleep when someone walked out and said thou shalt write copious amounts of code to obtain getter and setter

1022983
getter	setter
some things require public getter and setter like serialization and patterns like the data transfer object pattern

1022985
getter	setter
getter and setter hide your classes data specifics from the users of your classes

1022985
getter	setter
if you don t use getter and setter when you change your mind about a data member you break your classes interface and must alter the rest of your codebase to conform to the change

1022985
getter	setter
if you wrap your properties in getter and setter you can make those changes and hide them from consuming code by modifying the getter and setter methods

1022994
post	get
it is basically a primitive version control system and i use both http get and http post to transfer files and strings

1022995
getter	setter
getter and setter are one aspect of implementing the open close principle

1022995
getter	setter
they are so important that c# went through the trouble to make basic getter and setter easy to write

1023017
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox but it crashes safari the first time it tries to set the background color in the if statement

1023066
free	malloc
your habit of ending something that you started - whether it be the closing parenthesis bracket brace or the .close call to match .open or delete free call to match your new malloc - is an excellent one

1023066
vim	emacs
the direct answer to your question most good programmer editors can be customized configured so you ll just have to do some reading about advanced configuration of the editor of your choice - vim emacs the visual studio editor

1023101
draggable	droppable
if you re working on a rich interactive ui you ll find jquery ui interactions such as draggable droppable resizable etc to be a handy base to build upon

1023103
int	double
but as i continue my exploration of c# i notice that int double float in c# has some inheritance hierarchy as they inherit from

1023119
fink	macports
you should already have curl mine is at usr bin curl which you can use to get the fink or macports downloads

1023188
width	height
if what you need is the width and height of the frame in the circle why not pass the drawframe width and height into the drawcircle constructor

1023188
width	height
when changing the drawcircle constructor as described at the top of my post dont forget to add the width and height to the call to the constructor in drawframe

1023214
post	get
ideally i would like to turn on an option in php for that user to pass the session id back and forth via get post if their cookies are messed up

1023284
dictionary	map
from what i understand a map is a dictionary that has additional rules including ordering

1023331
int	double
btw i wouldn t use float ever and float i would avoid as well as it only accurate to 6 places i would suggest using int long or double

1023333
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	jboss	geronimo	glassfish	weblogic	glassfish	geronimo	weblogic	geronimo
i suppose that when you said i had made my project in j2ee you mean an enterprise application which runs on a j2ee server such as glassfish jboss weblogic geronimo etc

1023375
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
i know that the ilist already inherits from icollection and ienumerable so why does arraylist redundantly inherit from these interfaces

1023383
lxml	elementtree
for example little desktop utilities written with the python gtk bindings or website maintenance scripts written with lxml and elementtree

1023390
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
if you implement ilist you must also implement icollection and ienumerable

1023432
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
by implementing it in arraylist it becomes easy for one to know - which interfaces arraylist implements rather that going up to ilist to find that it implements icollection ienumerable

1023432
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
the class derived from ilist hence indirectly implements icollection ienumerable as well

1023432
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
so even if you write your own class implementing ilist and not add icollection ienumerable in the declaration - you will see that it will have to provide the implementation for icollection ienumerable

1023459
rss	feed
twitter knows it is getting impossible to tell your friends what you are doing via email sms blogs feed rss and so on so takes care of it

1023478
vsto	add-in
based on your description it is enough but if you need to create an add-in i would just look at vsto

1023503
hash	salt
they use salt in their hash and have quite some parameters to tweak the hash

1023509
hash	salt
salt is a randomly generated string that is included in the input for your hash function

1023509
hash	salt
when authenticating you retrieve the salt and the stored hash you prefix the given password with the stored salt and hash the two together

1023558
getdate	dateadd
you can also do this inside the database with getdate and dateadd ... or datediff ...

1023565
hide	show
control this form with show and hide methods from the outside code

1023572
hash	salt
if you store the hash and salt in a database and the key in the filesystem then this prevents anyone from cracking your hash if they get their hands on your stored hash and salt

1023583
min	max
the fastest one i can think of is to find min max y coordinates within a polygon loop repeated n times with two compares and two stores and then to compare if the min y y max y

1023583
multiplying	add
somehow i feel this could be solved more mathematically but i always end with slower code for example vector way -- i need to compute differences for n i and n i+1 then multiplying them add etc -- much slower then 2 cmps+stores

1023594
min	max
you could short circuit it as well as if you get partway through the check and have a min + max that are and your y value then you have an intersection

1023610
min	max
if you can cache the min max y value with the polygon then you can save time by not looping each vertex every time you do the test

1023618
google-chrome	firefox
i have just tested it with firefox and google-chrome for my application and page refresh does not clear the history

1023655
content-length	content-type
now you know the content-type and content-length maybe you need this for some kind of allocation

1023664
hash	salt
difference of hash values without salt the same 2 passwords generate the same 2 hash

1023678
folder	directory
in sql management studio connect to your server right click on the databases folder and choose attach browse to your database and select it note that you may need to move it to a directory sql can see - by default sql runs as network service and cannot peer inside c users

1023697
ienumerable	icollection
from my point of view though icollection implements ienumerable while sets don t have to be enumerable --- example set of real numbers between 1 and 2 even more sets can be generated dynamically

1023785
postgresql	mysql
mysql firebird postgresql etc

1023787
httprequest	httpresponse
i m wanting to have our own context which provides some helpers on top of the standard httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc objects

1023865
width	height
if it s a bar graph it creates a rectangle of width 0 origin at x frame.size.height-y and height y

1024009
width	height
the problem is the image s width height change to be smaller than the actual image

1024025
verilog	vhdl
also you can check out for vhdl and verilog modules

1024025
verilog	vhdl
you can select different cores input parameters and get ready-to-use vhdl or verilog component

1024028
submit	submission
next you re going to want to run some javascript on form submission so you should set the onclick property of your submit button to a function such as the following

1024030
put	get
right after i set it if i print i get the right value but if i put it after that for by the end of the function when i print i get the first char of novoestado- rotulo.

1024043
inherited	properties
i have a custom control that inherited from usercontrol and i can t get it s properties to show in intellisense

1024053
int	chars
then do the conversion from int to chars

1024069
typedef	struct
typedef struct node char rotulo 10 instrucao 1 2 10 flag

1024137
testcase	fixture
the most common patterns are testcase class per class testcase class per feature and testcase class per fixture

subtraction	addition
solid models can be represented in a number of ways either by constructional solid geometry csg where the shape is made up from the addition or subtraction of solid primitives from each other or by boundary representation b-rep where the edges are stored or by triangulated faces as used by 3d studio max wpf and many others and so on

1024361
goto	break
in my solution i use a goto statement to break out of two for loops

realloc	malloc
just initialize instrucao to null and realloc will behave like malloc when first passed a null pointer

1024826
setinterval	document.write	setinterval	settimeout	document.write	settimeout
if you re attempting to sandbox javascript code and disable every possible way to evaluate strings into javascript code be aware that blocking all the obvious eval document.write new function settimeout setinterval innerhtml and other dom manipulations isn t enough

1024827

photoshop	fireworks
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop

1025008
dictionary	map
i suggest to use a dictionary to map between the input and the command

1025021
width	height
then when creating the object its x location would be negative half its width and the y would be negative half its height

1025036
webrat	cucumber
i ve just gotten started using bdd with rspec cucumber webrat and rails and i ve run into some frustration trying to get my view spec to pass

hide	show
home and services are the two links and i would like services when clicked to hide the #slideshow div and show the slideshow2 div which would be hidden and then replace the first one

1025080
ssl	https
another potential difference is that google and yahoo use https and if your php or ssl installation is misconfigured perhaps missing ca certs then your openid code will fail to establish an association or complete the check_authentication call

1025087
put	get
for that to work properly you ll need to fiddle around with the loader class and applicationdomain so that the classes get put into the proper domain

1025089
hide	show
you should use the callback method of the show hide methods

1025091
drwatson	minidump
when it crashes drwatson will create a minidump file load this into windbg my favourite and you ll be able to see exactly where your bug is it ll even tell you that the dump contains an exception and show you it by default

inherited	subclassing
you never know when you ll want to have a subclassing that acts like the others but really needs to inherited another class for some reason

1025163
jboss	weblogic
and full-blown java ee app servers like weblogic jboss websphere etc

1025255
versioning	upgrade
the problem is in order to get fixes you pretty much have to upgrade to the next versioning of scala as upgrade come out

1025255
versioning	upgrade
the problem with that is that most versioning upgrade contain breaking changes thus in order to obtain fixes you are likely to have to change your own code

1025255
versioning	upgrade
in order for scala to be viable in such situations long-term someone will have to start back porting fixes to earlier versioning so that people don t have to perform breaking upgrade just to get some fixes

1025272
touchesmoved	touchesended
depending on your need you could also override touchesmoved and touchesended

1025325
post	get
that s post get data cookies user-agent string search strings - anything that is supplied by the browser

1025476
post	get
use this free web service through either a soap call get or post

1025539
perl	tcl
and then you have examples like awk tcl tk perl which says that initially was a combination between sh and awk but it became so powerful that he considers it an odd but full-fledged programming language

1025551
x86	64bit
another strange problem is that sqlce 3.5 sp1 with entity framework will not work on 64bit systems unless you build it to target x86

1025565
folder	directory
hiding usage information in registry or some folder in c basically outside virtual directory is not an option for a website

1025592
iboutlet	ibaction
although you have the view tied to an iboutlet you need to connect the event using an ibaction or else you won t get any of those events

1025610
profiling	debugging
the debug_version lets you profiling frees in debugging code but both are functionally the same

1025618
post	get
you probably need to post a bit more detail about the type of exception that is being thrown to get the most help

1025627
inherited	base-class
let s say t base-class is of type stream and u is of type memorystream inherited class you cannot assign a stream to a variable of type memorystream

1025666

a parent and two children will be saved

1025714
realloc	malloc
wrap malloc and realloc like this

1025802
dictionary	map
alternatively if there is truly a one-to-one relationship between the keys perhaps you could use a dictionary to map from old key to new key and enumerate over the result of

1025819
getter	setter
a property is actually some syntactic sugar and is implemented by 2 methods a getter method and a setter method

1025819
getter	setter
so i think that you should be able to determine if a property is abstract by checking if the getter and or setter are abstract like this

1025820
udp	tcp
then you should be able to send and receive data using tcp oder udp like you would do with any other normal application

1025820
udp	tcp
you just need to think in terms of how can i exchange messages using tcp or udp between my device and my server now

1025847
superclass	subclassing
that is have a conversion method in superclass bar and implements it in subclassing eg mybar httpbar etc

1025849
client-side	server-side
i have a vague memory that in order to use client-side ssl in jboss you first need to configure the server-side part

1025905
google-chrome	firefox
this gives me problem in ie if the container div is not big enough to show it tried with firefox google-chrome it is working fine

1025921
expression-blend	silverlight
from your question it s not clear if you are creating a silverlight or a wpf application in expression-blend

1025923
int	double	int	chars
you can sort an array of any type int long double chars or some struct pointers.

1025964
dlsym	dlopen
now i am thinking of using dlsym and dlopen to use these libraries instead of linking them explicitly

1026006

antivirus	mcafee
when i started searching about this error in google i came to know that may be because of mcafee antivirus this error may come

1026160
width	height
i m not 100 sure but in my tests you can t bitmapdata.draw any displayobject beyond 4079 pixels in width and 4082 in height actually you can but they will not be drawn beyond this limits

1026212
int	chars
since you are using c++ there are nicer methods to convert strings of chars into int

1026213
int	chars
function atoi converts string to int not only one chars

1026221
jquery	scriptaculous
i tried differend javascript frameworks jquery scriptaculous standalone - so i guess it s my image gallery which causes this behaviour.

1026239
versioning	upgrade
i compared the upgrade project files in vs2k10 and the only difference was the updated versioning number - how can i stop vs from doing this

1026249
post	put
put the select box in a form and make the form post back to a filter method in your controller

1026316
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
-referencing the arrays in a local variable within the function of the for-each loops is irrelevant but in the for-loop you do get a speed bump 75ms instead of 105ms

1026370
multiplying	addition
as you can see it s simply multiplying with an addition and a shift

1026393
google-chrome	firefox
however for some reasons the flash works fine in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome

1026568
uiview	subviews
one way to implement this is by adding a tag uiview s tag property with a integer value to each subviews

1026615
google-chrome	firefox
it s available as a userscript for firefox and as a google-chrome extension

1026620
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout and using passthru instead of exec will give you all the output

1026624
updatepanel	scriptmanager
other than updatepanel scriptmanager timer

1026682
folder	directory
let s say i have a file directory that stores all the images and other file types and this file directory is located on a different drive then my application folder

1026699
ubuntu	debian
i ve created a ubuntu debian package that installs an application that depends on r

1026756
dpkg	apt
this makes it impossible for apt or dpkg to figure out the package dependencies

1026763
width	height
i ve been able to make this work for rotating the icons around an ellipse but i also want to have them move around the perimeter of a rectangle of a certain width height and origin

1026764
punctuation	words
there are also potential issues with punctuation or other characters which are neither words nor whitespace characters

1026779
for-loop	arrays
in your first for-loop increments the pointer such that it doesn t point to the beginning of the arrays anymore

1026799
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
as you iterate through your loops you are incrementing the pointer and by the end of the for-loop you are pointing to the last element in the arrays

1026799
for-loop	arrays
when you go through the for-loop to display all of your values you are indexing to values past the end of the arrays since ptrheaparray is pointing to the last element in the arrays you allocated

1026808
for-loop	arrays
so after executing the first for-loop your pointer is pointing to end of the arrays and not at the beggining

1026810
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit

1026819
disk	ram
this technique allocates space dynamically but it s disk space not ram space

1026835
gif	png
suppose i have image canvas or previously loaded image which supports transparency gif png

1026839
put	get
so for example it is x 50 and you can put that into the line above to get the y

1026859
button	checkbox
i would suggest using a single checkbox or two standard button s instead of radiobutton s

1026889
google-chrome	firefox
here s a really really simple one works in firefox google-chrome and ie7

1026896
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
b more commonly you have a 16 k heap you ve been doing a bunch of malloc free realloc calls and your heap is less than 50 full you call malloc for 1k and it fails - what s up

1026896
free	malloc
you d need to add logging shims to malloc and free so that you can get an idea of what dynamic memory operations are being performed

1026915
swt	styledtext
you can find many great code snippets at the swt snippets page including examples for drag and drop using the styledtext widget

1026966
interpreted-language	compiled-language
i like python a lot but there s one aspect of it and other interpreted-language i guess that is really hard to work with when you re used to compiled-language

1027054
nunit	moq
i am using nunit and moq for my frameworks

1027079
children	parent
i need to structure the data so that every parent has a children key which is an array of arrays repeated with no limitation on the amount of children a parent child grandchild can have the tree_depth key is worked out automatically by the dbms so i simply need to alter the structure of the array

1027081
versioning	upgrade
if you make sure you ve upgrade to the latest versioning of this plugin you can create multiple forms each with their own response messages

1027085
free	alloca
you can use alloca function that allocates memory on the stack - this memory will be free automatically when you exit the function

1027093
apache	nginx
how about running a simple webserver like apache nginx and have a php or cgi or other script that simply returns the time in any format you want

1027099
post	get
is it possible to do the logins from flex over standard http post like forms and still get the same level of granularity for protecting remote object calls

1027106
children	parent
of course it works only if your initial array is ordered the parent comes before its children

1027108
innodb	myisam
update i created a new table myisam of the same schema copied over all the records insert into select the changed the engine on the new table innodb renamed the corrupt table and renamed the new table then tried again and got the same error

1027145
width	height
if i draw a rectangle and select it rendersize returns proper size for it but if line is selected rendersize returns size which has width set as line.x2 and height set as line.y2

1027145
width	height
for example line begins at x1 50 y1 50 ends at x2 130 y2 90 rendersize returns size with width 130 and height 90

1027149
pop-up	dialog
i need a pop-up dialog to be shown when i get a message from different thread but the dialog should be not dependent on activity i.e it should display the dialog wherever the screen focus is

it appears that this also applies to subtypes of frameworkelement buttonbase the supertype of button togglebutton repeatbutton

1027283
versioning	upgrade
when vs detects that the project file is not high enough for it s versioning it will force an upgrade

1027358
min	max
assuming you have a map thats x tiles wide and y tiles tall and the tiles that are next to each other are adjacent so that each tile has at max 4 and min 2 adjacent tiles you could use a matrix to access the tiles and also represent adjacency by matricial adjacency

1027358
min	max
this solution could also fit max 6 and min 3 tile adjacency if tile y+1 x+1 is adjacent to tile y x

1027360
subtract	add
hence i need to capture events when the user selects deselects the gridview rows and calculate add subtract the amount accordingly

1027398
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade to the next versioning of the 3rd party source tell svn to merge the difference between software-version and next-version into a working copy of trunk software

1027410
post	get
now i got a big problem with subclassed form tb_order_service with a master detail approach when i post the tb_order_base dataset instead of delphi first post it and get the pk id from rdbms and then post the tb_order_product with id filled it does the opposed posting the detail tb_order_product dataset first then master tb_order_base so i get a big foreing key constraint error

hex	binary
analyze the binary data try to save various versions of the file with little variation and use a diff program to analyze the meaning of every bit with an hex editor

1027445
inherited	properties
i can t put them in baseviewmodel since other viewmodels inherited it which don t need these properties and i can t put them in ipageitemviewmodel since it is only an interface

1027455
disk	ram
when using the size is not limited by the protocol but by what your server can handle ram hard disk space database or as symcbean has pointed out what the server is configured to handle

1027463
inherited	properties
can you create a class that inherited from baseviewmodel that will implement these two properties - your pageitemviewmodel classes that need this could then inherited from that

1027472
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest uses different http methods get post put delete to specify which action is wanted and the server returns the status as the http status

1027516
getter	setter
has anyone an implementation that implements propertydescriptor for a dsl where the getter and setter use the exact same name as the property and a way to hook that into the java rt so i don t need to create them all by myself

1027640
folder	directory
this would not be ideal but in the absence of server-side processing which you really should be doing--either php or rails or perl or whatever your host supports you could allow directory listing on your images folder

1027665
rar	zip
the best way is to take your db offline zip it up or rar whatever and copy the .zip file somewhere safe

1027669
implements	extends
one way is to implements an activator for plug-in a which extends at least the class plugin plugina

1027678
getter	setter
is there anything odd in the id getter setter have you added code

1027683
gif	png
an un-orthodox solution - if browsers you care about support animated background images gif png just compile your set of images especially if they are small sized into an animated gif png and use that as background

1027705
pull	push
should i use ajax push or pull

1027744

1027778
rss	feed
for background jobs that are not user-initiated such as grabbing an rss feed and parsing it on a daily interval

1027785
allocator	stl
it makes very limited use of the stl the queue class in the pathfinding module and because it s a game it also doesn t do any memory allocator outside of the third party sound library in a dll and what s necessary for loading the graphics bitmaps

1027796
post	put
the example is to create a suggestion form that post the data to itself which is then put into a database

1027804
folder	directory
when building a project in xcode 3.1.2 2 folder are automatically added as header directory with the -i option

1027808
division	multiplication
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues aliasing etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega

1027819
jboss	glassfish
for that i want to configure the containers glassfish and or jboss to limit the number of instances of the bean

1028016
width	height
i have tried playing with the width height of the chart to no avail.

1028036
pull	push
they work great for simple utility type programs but when you start creating a complex system using them you will find little gotchas along the way that are easily solved by using a standard edit and a function to push pull data to from the database

1028044
post	get
if the api already provides a soap interface then use it like kev said otherwise you should develop something like that like chells said or maybe something even more simple like a plain house-made get post page.

1028050
put	get
you can get it to work some of the time if you put spaces between the and the d

1028119
actionscript	mxml
mxml is just a way of writing actionscript without having to know actionscript

1028119
actionscript	mxml
when flex creates the swf it looks at the mxml and creates actionscript from it behind the scenes

1028119
actionscript	mxml
for what it s worth as far as i know file size is not increased by using mxml as the mxml is converted to actionscript before the swf is created

1028187
cassini	iis
i ve been developing an asp .net 3.5 web application against cassini the built-in web development server rather than against iis

1028197

about asynchronous urlfetch which might be the ultimate best way of updating rss feed

1028302
tostring	charat
it has all methods needed to solve the problem charat setcharat length and tostring

1028378
width	height
another source of delay in some browsers is img tags where the width and height are unspecified

1028400
post	put
when you save or update an entry in uddi analogous to your post and put you need to supply the unique id in the published data such that the server knows what to do with it

1028500
width	height
a rectangle in wpf is position-less it s just a height width so the two size values are equal

also it lacks a good jit compiler currently though mri 1.9 has a bytecode compiler which is better and jruby compiles it down to java bytecode which then can compile via the hotspot jvm s jit compiler but it ends up being about the same speed as 1.9

1028570
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so this works great in firefox google-chrome safari opera mac windows

1028605
children	parent
now how would i get a list of children with categorynumber 2 from the list of parent containing at least one child with categorynumber 1

1028606
qtkit	quicktime
i ve been looking into the quicktime api qtkit and it looks promising but if there s a better way - one that could be extended to support live video streams that d be amazing

1028623
ostream	istream
open input.txt as an istream and output.txt as a ostream

1028643
put	get
if you put it out of your implementation you get this warning warning instance variable is protected

1028645
xsl-fo	xslt
xml - xslt - xsl-fo

1028737
kde	gnome
i am trying to get a proof of concept going on any platform so if you know how to do it on xp in gnome kde or mac os i would really like to hear about it

1028766
jquery	scriptaculous
i recently started a project where the team decided we d like to use jquery rather than prototype scriptaculous for our javascript needs

1028779
hash	md5
in the header file there should be a cc_md5 function that will compute an md5 hash of arbitrary data

1028779
nsstring	nsdata
some more info here including a wrapper using nsstring - should be easy enough to convert to use nsdata

1028792
rss	feed
i am using the following code to get the item from the rss feed but it only gives me the first item

1028815
int	double
double because you can cast int to

1028930
folder	directory
if you ve previously checked out into this directory there could be a hidden .svn folder folder prefixed with dot are the equivalent of hidden in linux osx

1028936
getter	setter
so we auto-generate code by selecting a table from the database using the cf admin api and create the dao with the usual init setter and getter so the basic crud stuff

1028946
range	minimum
i would recommend looking at a combination of multi-dimensional clustering mdc range table partitioning and deep compression to manage the table as it grows facilitate easy roll-in roll-out and most importantly to quickly zero in on the data requested with a minimum of scanning

1028947
rss	feed
i use zend framework to read an rss feed is as simple as instantiating a zend_feed_rss object with the url of the feed

1028962
fflush	gets
now my problem is when a person object gets fflush it tries to execute a collection remove action against person#thincollection which fails because it s trying to execute

1028965
children	parent
one parent will have one or more children -- i have not interest in this application in childless parent

1028965
children	parent
in my database i can implement this with a normal foreign key relationship and the set-based nature of sql makes it easy to find all children for a given parent or the parent for a given child

1028965
children	parent
i think that the parent should carry a collection list whatever of children

1028967
getter	setter
what convention do you use to comment getter and setter

1028967
getter	setter
now i could see for something more complex you might write more in the a parts to give context but for a majority of the getter setter out there the wording is almost exactly the same

1028967
getter	setter
i m just curious if for the simple getter setter its ok to only fill in either the a part or the b part

1028981
getter	setter
getter and setter ought to be self-explanatory

1028988
getter	setter
edit the above refers to getter and setter only

1028990
children	parent
you should probably re-examine why your children need a reference back to the parent and vice versa

1028990
children	parent
i would lean toward the parent having a collection of children

1028993
getter	setter
i usually just fill the param part for setter and the return part for getter

1028996
getter	setter
i d say only worry about commenting getter and setter if they have some sort of side effect or require some sort of precondition outside of initialization getting will remove an item from a data structure or in order to set something you need to have x and y in place first

1028996
getter	setter
edit in addition if you do find a lot of side effects are involved in your getter setter you might want to change the getter setter to have a different method name ie push and pop for a stack thanks for the comments below

1028997
children	parent
the solution you specify with parent containing references to children and vice versa eliminates the need to traverse the tree to obtain ancestry of a given child and children of a node

1029006
children	parent
as per your domain model parent have children and children have parent

1029006
children	parent
do you include the parent s children

1029019
postgresql	mysql
if you are using a decent rdbms like mysql postgresql sqlserver oracle etc.

1029023
children	parent
what is the fundamental issue you re having with a parent having references to its children and a child having a reference to its parent

1029033
qimage	qwidget
the server sends the image data using image.tostring and the client side receives it and turns it back into an image using image.fromstring then into a qimage using imageqt.imageqt image turns it into a qpixmap using qpixmap.fromimage qimage then updates my qwidget s qlable s image using lable.setpixmap qpixmap

1029058
getter	setter
when documenting setter getter i like to separate the what from the encoding

1029081
children	parent
if the children must have a parent i usually just require a parent type instance in the child constructor

1029090
profiling	debugging
try checking via the debugging profiling window perspective flex debugging the the breakpoints view to see whether there s anything in there you don t recognize

1029107
getter	setter
if it is a getter setter it should be documented

1029109
firefox	safari
with it and selenium rc you can puppet string ie firefox or safari from inside of perl

1029119
gif	png
where profile.avatarmimetype is an appropriate mime type for a gif jpeg or png

1029127
folder	directory
position of normal files and folder is stored in the hidden .ds_store file that exists for any directory

1029132
textview	imageview
there are sporadic examples out there largely consisting of contrived examples using programatically created interfaces or based on the assumption that the developer is working with a typical imageview or textview

1029132
width	height
the height and width are based on custom values that are being translated into pixels as needed

1029160
mouse	keyboard
your test application is a simple app or script that starts up your gui and then generates mouse keyboard events based on input files

1029160
mouse	keyboard
with any luck you ll be able to generate mouse and keyboard events with the api but you ll have to ask someone else if it s possible

1029169
for-loop	arrays
you ve created empty arrays lists in the for-loop so trying access any element in them return null to system.out.println

1029201
hid	joystick
you could modify this sample driver to emulate a joystick hid device and then send out joystick hid reports from the driver

1029270
hex	binary
alternatively you could manually build a hex string prefixed with 0x to create a binary literal to append to the query but it s not recommended

1029302
mouse	keyboard
xdotool lets you programatically or manually simulate keyboard input and mouse activity move and resize windows etc

1029306
rss	feed
the way i look at it is that if i am just parsing one rss feed a cron job might be good enough

1029306
rss	feed
if i have to parse x number of rss feed specified at run time by a user or any other system variable then i would choose tasks every time

1029306
jobs	cron
i only say this because in the past i have had to excecute many user defined twitter searches at regular intervals and with cron jobs i ended making a very bad queuing system to execute the requests that needed to be ran - it didn t scale it didn t help that and the smallest interval that a cron job can be is only 1 minute i had more searches to perform than minutes in the day

1029319
rss	feed
use sitemaps use rss feed use xml documents or even pdf files with links to offer your whole range of products

1029329
pop-up	dialog
is there a way to determine if a browser supports ntlm without having ntlm enabled for the particular site or directory in iis and without showing a login dialog pop-up

1029331
getter	setter
the r o will only have getter while the writable will inherit from it and add the setter

1029340
gif	bmp
i ve seen similar questions that answer how you might do this with image files jpg bmp gif etc but i haven t found a way that works with pdf

1029358
public	protected
mark the setters as protected in the parent and expose public setters in the child

1029391
put	get
as a side note my reasoning for wanting this is because i have graphic designers who put files into svn but they don t get added to the project and don t show up on deployment or deployment testing

1029419
versioning	upgrade
if you plan on using gems with system ruby you might have problems when apple upgrade the system versioning of ruby unless you are installing your gems in library ruby gems

1029440
opera	safari
crossbrowser object watch claims support for ie opera safari

1029440
opera	safari
opera safari

1029467
getter	setter
those methods are called setter and getter

1029467
getter	setter
by convenction setter and getter have the same name of the instance variable but this is not a requirement

1029503
mouse	keyboard
when i get bored of calling one common feature with the mouse i get the keyboard shortcut quickly

1029506
put	get
put it where you can t reach it and try to get along

1029512
post	get
the problems start when instead of get post is used which is easy because you can t know if this is a malicious post or just some really slow upload from an user

1029540
post	get
on the other hand if i run the doctest by calling doctest.testmod the pre post inv do get called

1029550
int	double	int	chars
i have no problem doing this for an int divide by 16 recursively and concatenate chars 0-9a-f but float double is stumping me

1029605
uisegmentedcontrol	uiswitch
i would recommend creating a custom control or an array of uiswitch controls representing each of the options in your uisegmentedcontrol

1029613
post	put
make sure your web server is configured to reject post messages without an accompanying content-length header and to reject requests and throttle the offending client which exceed the stated content-length and to reject requests with a content-length which is unreasonably long for the service that the post or put is aimed at

1029622
ienumerable	ienumerator
nope ienumerator and ienumerable are different beasts entirely

1029632
ienumerable	ienumerator
the basic reason you can t go that direction ienumerator t to a ienumerable t is that ienumerable t represents a set that can be enumerated but ienumerator t is a specific enumeratation over a set of items -- you can t turn the specific instance back into the thing that created it

1029637
xlwt	xlutils
there are three python modules that allow you to do pretty much anything you need xlrd reading xlwt writing and xlutils copy modify filter

1029666
margin	height
when a user clicks a button i want my elements height and margin set to 0px

1029666
margin	height
then i want it to set display to block and animate its height and margin to the values as defined in the css - 20px - to slide and reveal itself

1029666
margin	height
when the user clicks the button again i want to animate my elements height and margin back to zero

1029702
fold	traversable
groupby is defined on traversable and sum can be applied directly to the list you don t have to write a fold

1029711
button	checkbox
however since i want this function to be responsible for all the initialization of this class when being created and it contains mfc objects initializations such as combobox edit control checkbox control radio button control etc. should i be instead calling the initialize function here as i thought

1029712
width	height
that way the height width during the animation will be calculated correctly

1029724
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
there are other 3rd party mechanisms out there that you may prefer over the uikit uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller mechanisms

1029773
mouse	keyboard
to add to subtenante response since i don t have enough mojo to actually comment there if i find myself using the mouse do something repetitively my threshold is 3 times ie the third time i notice myself mousing the same task i look up to the keyboard shortcut and do that a couple times as practice immediately

1029779
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i can create it this way fine as long as i change the myviewcontroller to inherit from uiviewcontroller instead of uinavigationcontroller

1029791
post	get
you can access the buttons superview to get the uitableviewcell that contains your button but if you just need the row number you can use the tag property like the previous post deacribes

1029800
dictionary	map
it should be trivial to map this into a function dictionary list etc

1029840
subtract	add
my knowledge of excel sums goes only a wee bit further than add and subtract

1029841
post	get
and how would you receive post get information

1029849
freebsd	solaris	solaris	bsd
and since solaris and bsd working with freebsd at the moment don t have ip_recvtos from what i can see i don t get tos when looping over the cmsg data

1029862
rss	feed
rss feed in asp.net mvc

1029864
post	get
by doing a couple small joins in your query you can get post for a specific group from various different users - and thus fill your group-specific board

1029894
debian-based	linux
sometimes when i install a debian-based system i change the uid start option i forget its name i m not on linux now from 1000 to 500 for consistency with the other red hat-y machines

1029895
imperative	declarative
if i understand it is as why is it that css is a declarative language rather then imperative then it s because it s conceptually closer to how humans want webpages to be styled and how browsers feel comfortable reading it

1029901
hash	salt
which you can then use like this to salt you file hash

1029902
accessor	properties
if you synthesize your accessor declare the properties as either properties retain or properties copy

1029920
hash	hmac
in general i d go with an hmac rather than the standard hash function since they offer a bit better security

1029921
debian	linux
easy to set up on linux debian

1029940
post	get
cloudmade seems to be an open-source map location provider - the above blog post lists details on how to get forward geocoding

1029944
folder	directory
it doesn t require a server of any sort -- it s completely python based and the source control is kept within a .bzr folder at the top directory of the tree

1029955
inherited	properties
the contentpresenter gets it s content from the datacontext but i need the bindings on contained elements to link to original windows usercontrol s parent in logical tree datacontext - because this way when i embed textbox bound to viewmodel s properties it is not bound as the inherited chain has been broken inside the control

1029955
children	parent
it seems that i would need to save parent s datacontext and restore it to the children of all control s containers but i don t get any event that datacontext up in the logical tree has changed

1029960
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp comes with its own template library is there a similar feature in codeigniter

1029973
int	chars
for chars in the basic multilingual plane casting the chars to an int will get you the codepoint

1029993
firefox	safari
as of now rounded corners are supported in firefox and safari through browser extension

1029993
firefox	safari
rounded corner is a part of css3 specification so if you want to implement a rounded corner using pure css and html now it is possible only using browser extensions -moz-border-radius for firefox -webkit for safari

1030017
margin	height
either you can create the appearance of equal height by setting a background image on the table row element the faux columns technique or you can make the height of the columns match by giving each a large padding and equally large negative margin

1030017
margin	height
here s an example using the padding margin technique to balance the height of the columns

1030017
margin	height
this barcamp demo by natalie downe may also be useful when figuring out how to add additional columns and nice spacing and padding equal height columns and other tricks it s also where i first learnt about the margin padding trick to balance column height

1030031
gridview	repeater
the gridview will work but i would strongly suggest the use of a repeater as it is considerably more efficient

1030062
xslt	xquery
it s also instructive to look at the saxon xslt xquery processor since being a well-behaved xml application it has to take into account how java stores codepoints in strings

1030066
int	chars
the methods that accept an int value support all unicode chars including supplementary chars

1030066
int	chars
casting the chars to an int as you do in your sample works fine though

1030088
winpcap	wireshark
you could try using winpcap which is what s utilized by wireshark

1030102
rss	feed
when i come across a broken rss feed the usual reason its all blown to pieces is because line 23 says sanford sons.

1030106
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t happen in ie8 safari 4 or google-chrome 2

1030112
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it isn t magic it is a uinavigationcontroller that instantiates a uiviewcontroller internally a uitableview that is populated with your address book contacts and sets the uiviewcontroller as its root view

1030125
vbscript	jscript
i see vbscript wsh powershell cmd jscript etc and wondering what to learn or what combination of things

1030135
int	chars
for a chars which can be represented by a single chars 16 bits basic multilingual plane you can get the codepoint simply by casting the chars to an int as the question suggests so there s no need for a special method to perform a conversion

1030135
int	chars
just compare the chars to the int directly as the question suggests

1030163
uiview	subviews
i would make own button by subclassing uiview or alternatively subclass a uibutton and add subviews to it

1030165
inherited	subclassing
you should reserve inherited for things that are genuinely subclassing not just to add some functionality here and there

1030177
opera	google-chrome
tried google-chrome and opera and they both work

1030196
getter	setter
a jsf model-bean should be a pojo that follows the javabean design pattern with getter setter encapsulating properties

1030196
getter	setter
although it typically has javabean-style properties with associated getter setter these are properties of the view -- not of the underlying application data model

1030246
ironruby	ironpython
there is ironpython ironruby and others

1030263
versioning	upgrade
typically you want to say libraryx is at versioning 2.32 and will stay that way until i tell it to upgrade

1030312
opera	firefox
it could explain why you can hit the site with firefox and opera but not with ie or webclient

1030315
width	margin
your new width should be reduced by twice the crop margin since you ll be chopping off that amount from both sides

1030429
cos	sin
at 45 angle value of cos sin is same i.e 1 root 2

1030432
cos	sin
crazy fact from the 1980s in the old days we used lookup tables for sin and cos

1030454
post	get
you could get the same functionality by simply having your form post to the destination url redirect to the appropriate place from there or send them back to the form displaying any errors that may have occurred

1030459
awt	swing
however this new functionality is a part of awt so it doesn t do a very good job integrating with swing components

1030469
jquery	scriptaculous
judging by your latency requirement of 2 seconds it would be wise to look at some sort of ajax framework - jquery or prototype scriptaculous are both good places to start

1030469
ant	maven
in terms of other technoloqies to make things better you will want to consider a build system ant maven are fine with maven the slightly more complex of the two

1030522
lxml	celementtree
i m parsing the documents using celementtree or lxml semi-negotiable

1030535
rss	feed
i ve been seeing this in my visual c# 2008 rss feed forever now

1030555
width	height
let s assume we have the class rectangle with the two for simplicity public properties width height

1030555
width	height
but though the claim is a square will behave like a rectangle we can t set .width 1 and height 2 on a square object your class probably adjusts the width if you set the height and vice versa

1030559
width	height
because changing a rectangle s width does not affect its height

1030559
width	height
by definition a square has height and width always equal

1030559
width	height
that test will fail because setting a square s width to 100 will also change its height

1030559
width	height
to answer your question the correct design should probably be that both rectangle and square derive from a common polygon or shape class which does not enforce any rules regarding width or height

1030586
width	height
in matt s example if you have code that relies on width and height being independent then it does in fact violate lsp

1030618
qevent	qapplication	qevent	qobject	qapplication	qobject
you can use the qapplication postevent function to send custom qevent messages to a qobject to be processed in the gui thread with the qobject customeevent handler

1030622
mako	genshi
so i thought i would ask the community to provide me with some advice as to where when i might know i should consider using a templating engine such as jinja2 genshi mako and co

1030673
submit	submission
so pad submission software would be software that submit your application to agencies that keep track of software using that standard

1030688
post	get
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

1030692
rss	feed
over at spokenword.org weâ re trying to figure out how to scrape youtube pages or pages with embedded youtube players then hack a video or shockwave url that we can include in the enclosure element of rss feed

1030692
rss	feed
the latter url can be played by standard flash players so we can include it in rss feed

1030707
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	decimal	octal	binary
numbering systems binary hex octal decimal ...

1030707
int	boolean
type representation boolean int float struct ...

1030764
division	multiplication
the performance cost of multiplication division square root etc operations for embedded systems

1030776
post	get
so now when the form submits the ajax request gets sent but you are redirected to submit page anyway which i think has populated the get array instead of post

1030783
jboss	glassfish
since httpsession does not necessarily inherit from or is implemented by clientsession in the java ee spec unless i missed something fundamental the code will likely blow up when you run it on a different server say glassfish or tomcat or jboss to name a few

1030788
superclass	subclassing
if you re retaining it in the subclassing for some reason you should also release it in the subclassing but setting the property to nil in the superclass shouldn t have any negative side effects

1030793
width	border-box
however this raises even more questions which i ll ask in a seperate question but it seems that width uses the normal css box model and max-width uses the ie border-box model

1030799
translation	localization
fwiw i have uses tsilang translation suite in the past and am currently working on another project using the localization tools shipped with devexpress vcl

1030824
versioning	upgrade
did you upgrade versioning on your server

1030830
post	get
first of all to get this functionality that is outline in the following post you will need either the latest version of fxcop or vs 2008 sp1

1030849
freebsd	linux
the application is written to compile on freebsd linux via fork exec and windows createprocess

1030880
width	height
it can be styled to have certain height and width

1030923
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if your developing on windows case-insensitive and uploading files to a nix server case-sensitive this would easily lead to file-not-found errors

it is semi structured rdf it is self-describing ontologies using owl and allows resource discovery sparql

1030992
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	iqueryable
have my repository return iqueryable but restrict access to it by hiding it behind a bunch of filter classes like getproductbyname which will return a concrete type like ilist or ienumerable

1031005
maya	blender
surely every major 3d package that allows skeletal animation together with quaternion interpolation maya max blender etc must have solved exactly this problem

1031039
vim	kate
i sometimes use vim as an ide within kate when i otherwise would have had several tabs open in vim which are hard to change to

1031039
kate	kde
kde for windows will allow you to install kate in windows

1031062
serializable	deserialization
use serializable and deserialization to create a deep copy if the object is marked with a attribute

1031072
implements	sealed
the problem is that i wish to have the asomeabstractimpl.dosomething method sealed final so no other class could implements it

1031089
autocomplete	omnicomplete
i use vim alone - it has some basic ability to autocomplete via x then various options p for keyword o for omnicomplete good for switching between html css and so on in web files

1031157
setinterval	settimeout
i was wondering if there was a tool that you could use for this or if you d need to use javascript to add settimeout or setinterval code

spaces	delimiter
in particular are they always delimiter by spaces or something similar

1031329
firefox	safari
it works great on firefox and safari

1031335
webclient	httpwebrequest
but the only way to get at the httpwebrequest before it is sent is to inherit from webclient and override that method

1031385
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
for example in many languages integers and floats are implicitly polymorphic since you can add subtract multiplying and so on irrespective of the fact that the types are different

1031387
inherited	properties
i think the easiest way is creating a new class which inherited from button and add a new dependency properties for the cornerradius

1031396
folder	directory
on windows i checkout the vim folder over the one in the program files directory

1031397
hide	show
you can then use jquery a neat javascript library that makes a lot of things easier when writing client-side code to show and hide the tooltip with the following code

1031397

getter	setter
to get around this jaxb doesn t even try to instantiate the property class list derived from the getter setter pair if it s a collection

1034405
getter	setter
probably the simplest work around is to mark your business interface with xmltransient and add a different getter setter pair with xmlelement for the view for the data that you want to expose to jaxb

1034405
public	protected
i usually make these protected rather than public because i don t care to have the somewhat-goofy jaxb behavior as part of my classes public contract

hash	salt
my guess would be a 40-bit salt and a sha-1 hash since sha-1 produces 160-bit hash

1035873
ubuntu	linux
i have a server that is running ubuntu linux server edition

i wouldn t worry about it since most applications don t really have a good reason to muck with ip or even udp tcp headers directly

1035978
apache	nginx
i want to set up nginx as a caching reverse proxy in front of apache django to have nginx proxy requests for some but not all dynamic pages to apache then cache the generated pages and serve subsequent requests for those pages from cache

1036014

there is no standard way to do this across gnome kde and cde

1036067
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop looks for a null pointer in the words arrays so it knows when to stop--but you don t have null in the arrays

1036076
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
if you want to assign to an array you have to explicitly copy data into it with something such as strcpy not recommended except in select cases due to potential buffer overflows strncpy memcpy or strncpy_s available only on windows

1036076
int	chars
although they technically can contain more than one chars the endianness of the resulting int constant is implementation-defined and they re not what you want in this case

1036078
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you are using apache the easiest thing to do is to enable the multiviews option in your httpd.conf file to enable it globally or in a .htaccess to enable it per-directory

1036657
subtract	add
i want to add and subtract two dates as well as i want to subtract 1 year or 1 month from a particular date

1036663
viewmodel	caliburn
you can use caliburn s action feature to map events to methods on your viewmodel

1036689
gdal	proj
in my experience with swig in the gdal proj this error is actually harmless and since the ld_library_path is set up this will work fine

1036731
hash	salt
let the user enter the characters he pleases after all you ll just end up storing a hash + salt of it

1036740
verilog	vhdl
there is an online tool that can generate verilog or vhdl code for a pseudo-random number generator

1036758
elementtree	beautifulsoup
i suppose elementtree or beautifulsoup would be good starting points to interpret the html structure

1036866
int	boolean
perl doesn t have a native boolean type but you can use comparison of int or strings in order to get the same behavior

1036872
client-side	server-side
i need a client-server encryption solution for web transfer signed and encrypted client-side and verified and decrypted server-side

1036872
pecl	pear
one of the reasons is that it is supported in php through various pear and pecl modules php is the language i intend to use for both my client script and my server script though perl is also available as a last resort

1036879
opera	firefox
tested on opera and firefox 3.0

1036989

in my experience os 10.5 nsstepper s value does indeed change if you set it s min to a value between value and max or set the max to a value between min and value

1037009
kerberos	ldap
i m using gssapi in java in order to login to an ldap server using kerberos authentication

1037080
swt	swing
what criteria should i use to choose between swt and swing

1037094
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
in almost 99 of normal usage those work in firefox should work in safari opera etc

1037114
post	get
scenario 2 use get post message

1037130
swt	swing
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

1037143
lxml	beautifulsoup
mechanize may be overkill maybe you just want to find specific parts of the html and then lxml and beautifulsoup both work well

1037144
ironruby	ironpython
learning ruby or python and scala to a lesser extent means you ll have very transferrable skills - you could use the java version the native version or the .net version ironruby ironpython

1037164
udp	tcp
i am looking for the reason why fragmentation is done at ip level but why not for tcp udp

1037164
udp	tcp
pathmtu happens here why fragmentation is implemented ip level is my question and why not implemented tcp udp level code

1037187
udp	tcp
tcp udp are transport protocols and they shouldn t care of fragmentation - it s not their problem

1037194
folder	directory
windows controls directory icons by use of a hidden system dekstop.ini file in each folder

1037195
cng	cryptoapi
cryptoapi is deprecated still works in vista but you should go with cng cryptoapi next generation

1037213
integer	unsigned
the following fragment returns the next highest power of two for an assumed unsigned integer of type t

1037232
jsf	seam
it would make sense to start with seam as it s an easy introduction into ejb3 and jsf

1037272
ienumerable	ilist
fxcop will tell you that it s bad practice to return an internal implementation of something list rather than an abstract interface ilist ienumerable

1037312
public	protected
also extra points for showing how to do private protected and public class variables properly

1037352
ant	maven
i m thinking about using the maven site via ant to generate a html report with the various javadoc pmd and findbug reports for my project

1037371
inherited	properties
then customtextformat needs to extend textformat and the code in customtextformat s constructor should be modifying the inherited tf properties

1037396
opera	firefox
when i upload a jar file to my web server people using firefox or opera don t have any problems downloading it

1037408
post	get
soapui will do the job as well check out this blog post to get started

1037462
int	boolean
i have string which might be int datetime boolean byte etc

1037510
firefox	safari
indeed firebug in firefox shows the computed style for this element as having 0px for marginleft and marginright but this is non-zero in safari

1037514
swt	swing
my criteria to choose between swt and swing

1037514
swt	swing
notice i have only commercial experience with swt on small project and my swing experience is so small that can t be taken seriously - my knowledge is rather theoretical than practical

1037514
swt	swing
briefly after my swt eclipse rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing

1037514
swt	swing
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro

1037514
swt	swing
and there is lot of more custom components in swing than in swt this is very big pro for swing

1037523
rss	feed
i have added an rss feed to my website but i can t get google readers and others to pick it up from just my root domain www.example.com they need the full address to the rss feed

1037523
rss	feed
how can i get them to pick up my feed without my users needing to add the full rss feed address

1037546
instances	transient
if you really have an event listener with a reference to a dao mark the dao instances variable as transient

1037667
google-chrome	safari
i don t know why there is such a big difference between safari google-chrome ff2 and ff3

1037672
coalesce	isnull
isnull nullable value_if_null for mssql coalesce nullable1 nullable2 ... value_if_null for mysql

1037673
kde	gnome
theoretically it s possible to create pure python gui library that will use ctypes on windows windll.user32.createwindowex etc native pyobjc on macos and pygtk pyqt on gnome kde

1037680
post	get
can you post an exception-stacktrace that you most likely get

1037727
redhat	fedora
if you are a regular user and can su to root fedora redhat based distros run this

1037744
cout	cin
in the overload function i use is.get to read those charaters one by one but program jump out the circle when cin finish that means cout will not run

1037774
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works fine with google-chrome but firefox is finding errors

1037774
google-chrome	firefox
i am getting it to work fine in google-chrome but in firefox i cannot click the button

1037783
hash	md5
i have a wav file and i need to calculate the md5 hash of its contents

1037788
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl	isnull	nvl
coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

1037791
hash	md5
just look for digest md5 for the hashing part and any wav-related module if you want to hash a specific part of the file skipping metadata for example

1037849
google-chrome	firefox
i have a div element that is appearing fine in google-chrome but firefox for some reason has decided to put a border around it

1037909
daemons	systemd
it also should be emphaised that on unix systemd daemons mode of mod_wsgi must be used and you must implement the code monitor described in the documentation

1037921
opera	firefox
its work ok in firefox or opera

1037928
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried this in google-chrome firefox 3 and internet explorer 8

1037976
solaris	irix
consider that there are two basic modes to display load irix mode and solaris mode

1037976
irix	linux
in irix mode linux default a load average of 1 means that one cpu is fully loaded or 25 of each cpu on a 4 cpu system etc

1037976
solaris	irix
in solaris mode a load average of 1 means that all cpus are fully loaded so it s actually equivalent to irix mode load divided by cpu count

1037991
postgresql	mysql
i ve been a mysql user never tried postgresql

1038054
post	get
if you could post more specific information about how you are making the call to the web service in vs2003 aka code example it would help get a more definitive answer

1038078
int	chars
you would need to convert your result into chars put them in memory and then pass in the memory location to the int 21h call which will print them to the screen

1038145
factors	matrix
generate standard normal independent deviates and then transform by multiplying by the cholesky factors of the covariance matrix

but they are only lossless when the image width and height is multiple of 16

1038256
accessor	properties
matt gallagher s properties accessor script for xcode

1038256
accessor	properties
accessorizer if you want a whole application for the generation of properties accessor

1038279
postgresql	mysql
while it s unlikely that you ll find a significant benefit in postgresql over mysql if can t hurt to test

1038288
post	put
similar to the following post i believe when you have any object or array syntax you need to put in braces

1038307
hash	md5
i was reading this question on md5 hash values and the accepted answer confuses me

1038307
hash	md5
yet the consensus answer to the question why aren t md5 hash values reversible

1038342
implements	extends
you can t extends multiple classes but you can implements multiple interfaces

1038350
filtering	grouping
use linq specifically groupby then filtering by grouping count and return a flattened selectmany list

1038361
inherited	properties
perhaps you can mark the base class properties with a common mapping than you only override the properties in inherited classes where it should be different

1038408
webkit	gecko
java perl python to hook onto webkit gecko to solve the above rendering problem

1038413
hash	md5
1 the primary purpose of a hash is to map a very very large space to a smaller but still very large space md5 which will take anything and convert it into a space of size 2 128 -- big but not nearly as big as aleph-0.

1038413
hash	md5
so a good hash that makes even use of the destination space will make it difficult to find two inputs with the same output just by the odds if md5 were perfect the odds that two inputs would have the same output would be 2 -128

1038417
hash	md5
yet the consensus answer to the question why aren t md5 hash values reversible

1038422
multiplication	exponent
powers are easy - just repeated squaring and multiplication based on the binary representation of the exponent

1038437
hash	md5
why aren t md5 hash values reversible

1038465
getter	setter
don t use any getter setter properties

1038466
httprequest	httpresponse
but telling me that i can reconstruct it from the httprequest httpresponse objects is not useful

1038500
django	turbogears
a web framework like turbogears django grok repoze.bfg webpy or such

1038527
administration	activation
because those features are normally activated by administration from either the command line assuming the admin also has rights in the farm config database or from within central administration where activation occurs through the farm service account -- guaranteed to have rights to the config database

1038566
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net are totally different languages and ms has never officially endorsed an automatic migration route for anything beyond simple applications

1038567
postgresql	mysql
i ve got a potential client who wants a database driven app either in java or python driving mysql or postgresql but we need to get input from an external machine such that every time this external machine closes a microswitch a value in the database gets decremented and it shows up on the app

1038587
int	double
there is no automatic conversion between int and double elements in the array with arraycopy

1038591
int	double
that s exactly the case here - int and double are different primitive types so the exception is thrown as documented

1038613
width	height
doing so will make all of the contents in the wrappanel with the same sharedsizegroup share their width for columns and height for rows

1038618
post	put
on your confirmation page you can put a form with hidden fields that contain all values and a back submit button which will post them to the previous page

1038619
versioning	upgrade
the vb6 upgrade wizard in visual studio is actually a cut down versioning of artinsoft s visual basic upgrade companion

1038633
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it works in ie6 firefox 1.0 and 1.5 and opera 8.5 - don t know about safari but i expect no problems

1038652
sorting	filtering
if you want sorting filtering etc.

1038658
inherited	subclassing
meaning if you subclassing the control when you add it to the designer any changes you make in the constructor of your inherited control will show up in the designer

1038707

1038708
boost	stl
please only stl no boost or tr1

1038711
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i m creating some graphic data displaying widget in qt4 and i was tempted to use the qgraphicsscene for it create qgraphicsitem s for the data items etc

1038715
inherited	properties
my feeling it s inherited in some sense from the cells rowindex columnindex properties but only the first parameter is appropriate

1038866
button	checkbox
for example if i have selected few row through checkbox column and clicked on button to get all selected row id

1038927
hash	md5
hash algorithms like md5 are cpu intensive

1038943
trojan	virus
maybe they have a virus or trojan causing the issue

1039018
dbvisualizer	toad
toad or dbvisualizer are examples for tools which could make you happier than sqldeveloper

1039035
min	rank
this will return the rank of the new basis which was min d w before and we ll now approximate with ii

1039052
ant	maven
i moved a project from ant to maven recently

1039052
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin	maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml	maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
it worked well at the end but i had to use two different versions of maven-assembly-plugin and maven-jar-plugin in the same pom.xml got two profiles because what worked in one version was broken in another

1039154
ready	each
the threaded tasks will get one manualresetevent object each and call the set method when they are ready

1039181
post	get
the latter is just a bunch of keys and values and can be parsed the same way whether for get or post whereas the former requires full mime support and is thus more useful when you have data that can t simply be represented as key value pairs

1039186
versioning	upgrade
the direction i ve seen many applications take is at start check an xml file that you host for information on newer versioning and typically display a message to the user preferably in a news ticker or non-obstructive manor about a new versioning being released and why they should upgrade

1039192
getter	setter
show how getter setter private fields alleviate the problem maybe move to a typed language if you ve been using json .

1039208
post	get
and in the end if i simply can t get an answer i ll probably have to break down and write a test case where i can just post the entire rendering code here and demonstrate the problem

1039218
unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix
often production unix systems solaris hp ux aix etc. have a very plain vanilla install

1039220
x86	64bit
i am guessing you are running the x86 version of dependency walker which when analyzing a 64bit dll will show that it depends upon several x86 system libraries

1039280
jsfl	fla
i m working with an fla an as file document class and a jsfl file

1039341
onmouseover	onclick
i ve seen the related post on this but it only covers using inline vbscript for onmouseover events while calling a javascript function for the onclick

1039341
onmouseover	onclick
is there a way to call a vbscript sub for the onclick event from a button that uses javascript onmouseover and onmouseout events

the connection pool settings is min 50 and max 150

1039669
nexus	artifactory
here are some things off the top of my head that i really like about artifactory keep in mind nexus may have these features too

1039798
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
when i run the site locally on my development machine everything works fine in firefox ie opera and safari all the latest versions - i work from home and i only have 1 machine for personal use and development use except for some css differences between them and when i go to the live site on my machine it works fine also

1039819
post	get
if you want to be able to reference either get post values you can use _request

1039826
post	get
it contains the data submitted via the post method and only the post method versus data submitted via the get method

1039845
post	get
_request yourname contains all the variables that were posted whether they were sent by get or post

1039848
post	get
the two most common types of web requests are get and post

1039848
post	get
in general however any regular link you click produces a get request and any form you submit produces as post request

1039870
disk	ram
i am not talking about ram but rather disk space

1039921
implements	extends
if the class implements some interface or extends an abstract class you can tell jmockit to capture and mock implementations of the base type on demand as they are loaded by the jvm and even assign the created instances to a field in the test class

1039938
int	chars
however this won t work for primitive types like int bool chars etc.

1039938
free	malloc
that means you have to use malloc prefer nsallocatecollectable on leopard or later and free to manage the memory

1039941
put	get
if the number of rows that get updated as opposed to inserted every time you put up a new rowset it not too high then i think you should consider importing the new set of data into a set of staging tables and do an update-where-exists and insert-where-not-exists upsert solution and just refresh your indexes ok ok indices

1039942
lisp	smalltalk
it can be done in smalltalk and in lisp

1039943
sqldatasource	datalist
i have a datalist that is bound to a sqldatasource

1039947
inherited	properties
early in my learning about the little snags of this process i found that a number of the problems i would run into with tframe descendants streaming incorrectly often appearing as forms in the ide rather than frames could be completely eliminated by introducing my own tbaseframe class which inherited from tframe with no chanegs and then use that as the base class to develop components from adding methods properties etc

1039947
put	get
i could put all of my frame based components into one giant package but i d really really prefer not to as i can clearly see that will get too large out of hand over time given the nature of how many sets i plan on developing

1040026
draggable	droppable
check out the jqueryui addons draggable and droppable

1040056
ant	cruisecontrol	nant	cruisecontrol
linux java technologies are in parenthesis but i included their equivalent for the windows readers too i use cruisecontrol.net cruisecontrol visualsvn svn tortoise and nant ant to take care of all of my build needs

1040056
ant	cruisecontrol
when cruisecontrol cc sees that new code has been checked in it will execute a cc project which in turn calls out to the ant script on the build server

1040056
ncover	ndepend
once all of this is complete i like to run some analysis on my code using ndepend ndoc and ncover

1040067
isapi	iirf
i am using iirf - an isapi rewrite filter for pretty url s

1040083
int	double
casting a double to an int just creates the binary number 00001010 10 in binary and that is the value that is memset ed

1040113
int	chars
memset takes a int but casts it to an unsigned chars and then fills each byte of float sizeof float is probably 4 with that bit pattern

1040142
background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-image	background-image	background-color	background-image	background-position
the 5 attributes it includes are background-color background-image background-repeat background-attachment and background-position

1040142
background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-image	background-image	background-position
edit are background-repeat background-attachment and background-position useless if background-image is none

1040176
inherited	properties
specifies that the setting of the background-attachment properties should be inherited from the parent element

1040176
opera	firefox
note for this to work in firefox and opera the background-attachment property must be set to fixed

1040634
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this will work in ie7 firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1040645
post	get
i can get it to go to the correct controller but it s looking for the idnex method so it looks like it s treating my request as a get request even though the log says its a post request

1040688
width	height
your code disappears because you have block elements with line breaks and height and width inside an inline element no line breaks and no height or width

1040689
children	parent
when you remove an object such as logininterface from its parent s displaylist all of the children inside of that object will be automatically removed from memory as well as long as there are no other objects that contain references to the children

1040711
ssl	https
so presuming that the signup page is now https under one certificate is there any reason at all that there should be a problem redirecting to worldpay which is under ssl but under a different certificate

1040719
integer	fractions
you can subtract the integer portion from the value itself to retrieve the fractions part

1040719
integer	fractions
you can then multiply it to get the fractions part represented as an integer at whatever precision you d like

1040719
integer	fractions
mapping the fractions portion to an integer has some challenges - many floating point numbers cannot be represented as a base-10 integer and thus may require more digits to represent than an integer can support

1040780
doc	rtf
i m trying to call a php script from my php page in order to convert an rtf doc to a pdf using openoffice

1040861

1040861
hide	show
how do i get it to stay show and then click it again to hide it

1040881
width	height
if the layout you are trying to design is in fact a grid or table rows and columns i suggest either using the uniformgrid control for evenly-spaced rows and columns or the grid with height width set per row column and margins on all elements set to 0 to fully fill its cell

1040888
hide	show
or you could trigger the clicks of the show hide bindings and that way you wouldn t have to change the implementation of a#slick-toggle should you decide to change the animations

1040917
post	get
i wouldn t start passing any user information through post get vars when switching domains

1040917
ssl	https
the answer to your sign up page is that you need to force https ideally from code behind so users can enter their account information with the ssl encryption and see that trusty lock icon

1040937
mouseover	mouseout
or use javascript mouseover mouseout

1040951
int	chars
in the case of primitive types int chars etc. or array types like naming rules defined in the java virtual machine specification for field descriptors are used

1040975
firefox	safari
maybe the most complete package of the bunch and supports testing in ie firefox and safari

tapestry	stripes
check out any of the frameworks tapestry spring s web framework stripes struts...they can all do this kind of thing in the dark blindfolded hands tied in the rain with nails on the floor

1041003
aggregate-functions	sum
you may only reference non-aggregate values single-row values in an aggregate-functions or in the where clause so the solution would involve placing your case inside an aggregate-functions in this case your sum

1041012
implements	extends
extends ienumerable so already implements ienumerable

1041019
ienumerable	iqueryable
you re usually not worried what you re really getting if a list a ienumerable a iqueryable or whatever

1041029
ienumerable	iqueryable
well it might be iqueryable instead of ienumerable

1041083
superclass	subclassing
here you re doing the reverse - you re attempting to reference an instance of the supertype in a variable of the subtype assuming decal is the superclass and transactiondecal the subclassing

1041092
bazaar	git
there are a few popular versions git mercurial and bazaar

1041146
getter	setter
the linq to sql and other data sources models use a traditional object model of add remove getter and setter and update to commit the changeset to the data backing

1041151
range	minimum
the idea there is that the minimum and maximum of the range stays the same as the input but the middle is bent like you have in your graphs which i might note is not the circular arc which you would get from the cosine implementation

1041202
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
in particular this library support wav au aiff mp3 csl sd smp and nist sphere files

chunked	transfer-encoding
the response is being sent as a transfer-encoding chunked

1041513
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1041524
prng	random
in fact performing any additional actions from a number returned by a prng doesn t really increase its randomness and in fact the number can become less random

1041524
prng	random
therefore in operations where the high-end is discarded and the low end is returned the value can become less random than the original value returned from the prng

1041539
apache	nginx
thus using keep alive on the apache side is pointless when using nginx in front of it

1041539
apache	nginx
because though nginx doesn t implement keep alive it should drop the connections promptly as it will have no intention of reusing them so you shouldn t suffer if you do forget to turn of keep alive in apache when using nginx as front end

1041594
subtraction	addition	subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo
similiarly addition subtraction and modulo are exact

1041677
cdr	cons
a cons cell consists of two parts which are called car and cdr

1041677
cdr	cons
a list is a series of cons cells where each car holds some value and each cdr points to the respective next cell the last cdr pointing to nil

1041677
cdr	cons
when you write cons a-list x this creates a new cons cell with a reference to a-list in the car and x in the cdr which is most likely not what you want

1041707
int	chars
moreover it will also work for other types so you could use it on an int a short a chars etc

1041716
children	parent
this will mean your linq to sql queries become less intuitive querying against entity.right and entity.left isn t quite as pretty as parent or children ... but you can do in one query what might take hundreds or thousands in the literal recursive approach

1041763
post	get
sort of what register_globals does to the post get etc vars

post	get
there s a post here that will get you started

1041832
put	get
it will usually come out in the same order it was added but there are no guarantees and once you get a lot of rows in your table there s a reasonably high probability that they won t come out in the order you put them in

1041847
for-loop	arrays
i then explode it and put the ids names into an arrays and then use a for-loop to echo them out

1041858

this solution works well on firefox but the output of opera and ie6 is much different

1042110
cout	cin
in c++ using cin and cout is too slow

1042139
rsa	dsa
update the pgp module does not provide ways to generate keys but presumably these could be created with the lower level rsa dsa etc

1042139
openssl	m2crypto
also if you know how to generate these using openssl command line commands it should be reasonably easy to convert that to m2crypto calls

1042169
distance	polygons
to answer your original question as to how to generate the smaller polygons you can find the centroid of each polygons and offset each vertex by a percentage of the distance to that centroid point of the polygons to get the smaller polygons

1042174
post	get
if i have try to use the updatepanel on a project that was originally a .net 1.1 project upgraded to 2.0 now recently upgraded to 3.5 i can t get partial post backs for anything

1042315
width	height
important overide when i need to use custom width height

1042324
min	max
in general probably the easiest would be to put the logic into a trigger that would check to see what value is being inserted and change it to your max or min if it s out of bounds

1042339
wordpress	joomla
for php i am using codeigniter joomla and even wordpress

1042381

1042494
rss	feed
secondly i haven t seen anyone convert rss feed back into database entries

1042502
implements	extends
so this task now becomes a little more as now you need to write your own virtualizedwrappanel by extends virtualizedpanel and implements iscrollinfo

1042543
tcplistener	tcpclient
if you use higher level components like tcplistener and tcpclient then you can access the underlying socket and retrieve the remote end point

google-chrome	firefox
a good tool to use for profiling is either firebug in firefox or fiddler for ie google-chrome

1042729
iprincipal	iidentity
please verify that you have implemented a class for iidentity iprincipal interface and then you are using something like the following code to assign the currentprincipal

1042747
getter	setter
secondly when you need to write multiple entity classes you can push a lot of functionality in to a delegate class and use code template to write the property getter setter

1042805
ienumerable	ienumerator
or should it maybe be an ienumerator instead of ienumerable

1042809
folder	directory
make 1 leaving directory home thayoz desktop untitled folder quantis-usb src linux driver

1042836
children	parent
look at the children of its parent in other words its siblings

1042876
easymock	jmock
you should mock stub with one of the mocking apis jmock or easymock and inject the mock into the class-under-test

1042896
inherited	properties
imo you need only to inherited your interface from ienumerable message so you do not need special properties to get messages because ienumerable has corresponding method getenumerator

1042939
post	get
here s some instructions on how to get grails working with netbean s couldn t submit the second url in my last post

1042946
tolower	uppercase	tolower	toupper	toupper	uppercase
some characters do not round trip toupper ãÿ is ss and tolower ss is ss but there are some words only distingished by ãÿ vs ss so will give a false positive is matched by mapping to uppercase and which will break assumptions about case mapping not changing string lengths

1042946
tolower	toupper
tolower i is i unless you have working in turkish or azari where the result is ä latin small letter dotless i and toupper i is ä latin capital letter i with dot above

1042946
tolower	toupper
in the past approaches based on toupper and tolower where making assumptions about working in only english text and ignoring the majority of the worlds glyphs and characters

1042956
innodb	myisam
myisam or innodb for safety of data which should i choose

1042961
g++	gcc
550kb is about as small as you can get it because mingw and gcc g++ in general are bad at stripping unused functions

1042978
google-chrome	safari
does safari and google-chrome support overflow

1042989
innodb	myisam
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

1043003
inherited	properties
note internet explorer does not support the properties value inherited

1043016
factors	mean
but then 2 users behind one ip will be only counted as 1 hit so you lose accuracy - see what i mean about a balance between various factors

1043024
client-side	server-side
always keep in mind that client-side validation is for the user s convenience and to some extend to reduce network traffic for bad requests but the real validation has to be done server-side

xna	spritebatch
in xna is there a way to render the contents of a spritebatch after drawing to a texture object before rendering to the screen

1043132
hide	show
i remember having to actually hide the controls when i launched my popup and show them again when the popup closes

1043142
width	height
you can also place an iframe with 100 width and height which will hide the combobox

1043146
comparator	icomparer
edit alternatively you could sort with a custom comparator icomparer if that s applicable to your situation

1043148
hide	show
an ugly work-arround is to hide all combos when you are going to show the popup

1043150
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tried this and it worked in all browsers ie firefox google-chrome opera and safari

integer	fractions
dividing two ints performs an integer division the fractions part is truncated since it can t be stored in the result type also int

1043185
int	double
try casting one of the int s to a double inside the operation

1043256
width	height
now you know the height - and so the width - of the other aspect ratio tv

1043267

postgresql	mysql	postgresql	informix
it is more or less standardized and used by almost all relational database management systems sql server oracle mysql postgresql db2 informix etc

1043350
webclient	webrequest
i suggest setting a longer timeout on the request but you d need to use webrequest instead because there is no way to set a timeout on webclient

1043360
dynamic-languages	introspection
dynamic-languages introspection reduces the volume of source

1043360
config	ini
we don t have xml or ini config files in some foreign syntax

1043384
hide	show
wouldn t it be better to only hide the previously show div

1043395
hex	binary
bytes when converted to hex are two hex digits or 8 binary digits depending on what base you look at it in

1043395
integer	unsigned
the above statement shifts the high 4 bits down is unsigned right shift and logical ands it with 0000 1111 so that the result is an integer equal to the high 4 bits of the byte first hex digit

1043400
gif	png
for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

1043400
gif	png
also internet explorer 6 doesn t exhibit problems displaying png images with a 1 bit alpha channel which is essentially what gif has too

1043401
gif	png
png afaik will always be a smaller file size than gif because it uses a better compression algorithm

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
i know i can use mouseover mouseout to bind the event with .live

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
which is a good solution if it weren t for mouseover mouseout bad habit to break the event if you hover a child element of the current element the mouseover is bound to

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
or should i just roll over and use mouseover mouseout with live

1043418

1043635
svg	vml
in one of the few posts on the subject groups.google.co.in it is explained that for example browsers which doesn t support svg or vml send placemark polygon polyline information to google where the map will be rendered and sent back

1043635
svg	vml
from what i ve found ie6 does not have support for svg or vml and thus not capable of rendering the information by itself

1043653
post	get
server 2 listens on a uri post data get json data convert back to dictionary or orm objects insert into db

1043674
jboss	glassfish
following is the client which works for glassfish but doesn t work for jboss

1043677
pop-up	dialog
jquery as mentioned could get you a pop-up or a modal dialog but would not serve very well to open a new window as the op requested

1043687
int	chars
this functions useful computes an int which i want to be transmitted as a parameter to the constructor variables const chars s

1043687
int	chars
so i am converting the int to a string and then to a const chars data type

1043690
svg	vml
google maps uses vml on ie browsers and svg on the others

1043698
stdout	stderr
you should consume the stdout and stderr in separate threads otherwise you will experience blocking behaviour

1043716
stdout	stderr
also you read the stderr and stdout sequentially

1043716
stdout	stderr
however the read to stderr blocks as there are no errors printed by the application and you don t move to the phase where you read the stdout

1043716
stdout	stderr
you could join the stderr and stdout via processbuilder.redirecterrorstream and then you need only to read stdout

1043716
stdout	stderr
your sample works in some cases because when you are blocked on the stderr the application response on the stdout doesn t hit the size of the communication buffer

1043716
stdout	stderr
when the application quits the stderr loop exits and the loop for stdout is able to retieve the contents of that buffer

1043729
getter	setter
synthesize the setter and or getter

1043757
awt	swing
if i replace the swing jbutton with an awt button like so

1043777

you should probably apply ceil or floor before casting to an int

1043786
children	parent
can someone please let me know that if i have a web page that consists of a checkbox parent and on this same web page i also have a iframe that is sourced from another page that displays a number of records which also has a checkbox children against each record if i tick the parent checkbox i would like to cascade this through to all children checkboxs within the iframe as well as disable these children checkboxes

1043796
int	double
i don t think the cast is necessary there is an implicit cast from double to int

1043812
int	double
you don t need to cast double are casted automatically to int if needed

1043812
int	double
when casting double to int the decimal places are truncated and not rounded

postgresql	mysql
we have developed a design time tool for generating and editing entity framework and linq to sql models with further code generation for oracle mysql postgresql sql server and sqlite for our customers

1044002
firefox	safari
i tested in firefox 3.0.10 and it worked so by the looks of it jquery ui is not all that compatible with safari 4.0.1 4.0 4530.17 or just maybe their demos on their site

1044009
implements	extends
a more elegant solution would be to write your own authorization action filter either by extends authorize or implements iauthorizationfilter as follows

1044015
button	checkbox
clicking the button on the parent page will select all the checkbox with the name checkbox on the frame page

1044037

i m not sure either approach sleeping for an hour or creating cron jobs from php is ideal how about a cron job that runs every hour anyway then your php script checks whether it should run

1044678
recursive-descent	lalr
as a matter of interest it is also worth looking into recursive-ascent which is a parsing algorithm directly encoded after the fashion of recursive-descent but capable of handling any lalr grammar

1044749

1044988
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in firefox and google-chrome

1045026

have you looked into file filereader filewriter bufferedreader

1045253
hash	md5
first use a simple cryptographic hash like md5 not crc32

1045261

mouseleave	mouseenter
on a mouseenter mouseleave event i would like to capture the absolute top position of the cell of a table

1045426
persistent	transient
this is really just a case of understanding how your application will be creating an object graph and what entities are transient and which might be persistent or detached

1045426
persistent	transient
i would recommend reading this entire chapter from the hibernate docs to understand fully the terminology of transient persistent and detached

1045434
width	height
it seems that setting the width and height style properties as below do not take in ff

1045456
width	height
a partial solution would be to calculate how much to move my tooltip by finding out if the current mouse coordinate + the tooltip width height and see if it will exceed window.innerheight or window.innerwidth

1045503
unix	solaris
this doesn t work correctly under solaris unix linux using the system gtklookandfeel

1045540

when i look at the image object from the toolkit in debug it does say height and width are -1 but the imagedata within the has byte 5144

1045807
httprequest	httpresponse
httprequest and httpresponse pre mvc used to have a getinputstream and getoutputstream that could be used for that purpose

1045849
runtimeexception	filenotfoundexception
you just wrap the filenotfoundexception in a runtimeexception

1045850
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
if your position is that this is so unlikely and should just end the program use an existing runtime exception even runtimeexception itself if not illegalstateexception

1045865
mouse	keyboard
a keyboard action that depends on the mouse position sounds a little unorthodox

1045865
mouse	keyboard
keyboard actions should normally effect some item that is highlighted focused selected on the screen either selected by previous keyboard actions or by a previous mouse click on that item

1045873
width	margin
if you are adding another column be sure to account for the additional width plus margin and either reduce width on other elements or increase the width of your containing element

watch out for the circular reference now between parent and children now

1045938
width	height
this can be expanded for the width and height

1045938
width	height
each of those size attributes can be expanded to show the width and height

1045938
width	height
when the pdf file is rendered via the reportviewer s built-in export function the width and height of each page within the pdf will be determined by the width and height in the report s pagesize attribute you could override this if you used your own custom code for the pdf rendering

1045938
width	margin
your report s body s width plus the report s left margin plus the report s right margin must be smaller than or equal to the report s pagesize s width

1045938
width	margin
for example if my report s body has width 7.75 my left margin is 0.5 my right margin is 0.5 and the width specified in the pagesize is 8.5 my report will always use 2 pages for each 1 page of data

1045938
width	height
as such in my last example i would rather set the pagesize to have width 11 and height 8.5 which is a real letter-size in landscape

1046066
hash	salt
if the hash does not use a salt then there is no sign for that

1046066
hash	salt
the reason for this is so you can have many types of hash with different salt and feeds that string into a function that knows how to match it with some other value

1046068

1046199
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
you likely want to take a look at autoresetevent and manualresetevent

1046214

note that you use the urlrequest object to specify and get post parameters you want to send so in that case you want to build the urlrequest separately rather than inline

1046234
rss	feed
when you set security with forms authentication in the web.config you then lose the ability to access the rss feed

1046234
rss	feed
i d like to be able to secure elmah but yet still pass through authentication to the axd to be able to access the rss feed elmah.axd rss from a rss reader

1046234
rss	feed
thinking that http authentication would be proper as then i can probably get to the rss feed with the following url syntax i assume you would need to set authentication mode windows on that specific path in the web.config

1046234
rss	feed
is there another way that is better to be able to access the rss feed while still being secure

1046239
put	get
now i have put it on the show event but this seems not to get triggered consistently or before the page is fully created the first time

1046304
width	height
this way you can quickly calculate cell width and height yourself

1046327
touchesbegan	touchesended
to detect the touch in a view controller you could use the touchesbegan and touchesended methods store the touch from touchesbegan and if the touch moved more than some amount to the left or right it was a flick not a nudge to the left or right

1046344
int	chars
if you send it a chars or int it just strips everything above the 8th bit with 0xff

1046617
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard input audio

1046669
udp	tcp
ok this might just be a dumb question but i was wondering if bluetooth follows tcp or udp protocol

1046688
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are transport level protocols whereas bluetooth would be a lower level protocol

1046688
udp	tcp
thus you could use tcp or udp on top of bluetooth just as you use tcp and udp on top of ethernet

1046721
post	put
lastly to be nice and restful i d like this to work for post and put requests

1046737
disk	ram
in practice it s even less than that usually 2 gb or 3 gb depending on the os and various linker options. on a 64 bit machine you can have a huge virtual address space in any practical sense limited only by disk and a pretty damn big ram

1046771
int	chars
it s not good enough that a chars can be implicitly promoted to an int

1046814

disk	ram
we thought about using ram disk to help on disk i o if we have to but just wondering if there are any other options

1046946
int	double
in other words an int and an short won t necessarily compare like this nor would an int and a double

1046977
int	double
for strings double int etc it was pretty much baked in but if you used custom objects you could write the audit implementation for them that just had to return a audit object

1046980
post	get
my eventual goal is to get a basic message board going post edit delete user sessions

1047058
jobs	cron
just create your cron jobs to call wget to upload or download your file via ftp

1047075
int	double
1 adt which means basically a new type something like int int or real numbers double or even a new concept like date

1047075
int	double
look at double and int in c++ the int is a sun of double because every int is a double at least in concept

1047089
hide	show	children	parent
can someone please let me know that if i have a web page that consists of a checkbox parent and on this same web page i also have a iframe that is sourced from another page that displays a number of records which also has a checkbox children against each record if i tick the parent checkbox and assume the iframe is hidden from the user have a feature to show hide iframe can i set all children checkboxs within this hidden iframe or does the iframe need to be rendered

1047128
hide	show
you can of course further re-factor the code to hide show the right view

right now the technique i m using is graphics.measurestring to get a sizef containing the width and the height of my string to compare it to the height and width of my textbox control

1047294
width	height
i can get it to work fine for the width but i can t seem to ge the height right in a multiline textbox

1047319
width	height
i m pretty sure there isn t any browser api i can query but has anyone worked it out by inspecting and comparing certain height width measurements exposed by the dom

1047337
width	height
what about determining the distance between the viewport width and the resolution width and likewise for height

1047339
r5rs	r6rs

1047407
physx	ogre3d
i m using ogre3d and physx

1047429
apache	nginx
wsgi is the crucial glue between web servers not just the simple one in wsgiref of course -- real ones too such as apache or nginx both with respective modules called mod_wsgi as well as for example google app engine -- that one offers wsgi too as its fundamental api and web applications and frameworks that make it easier to write such applications

1047434
postgresql	mysql
here are the documentation pages related to date time functions for both mysql and postgresql

1047625
postgresql	informix
this is very similar for every db driver i used in python and jython i work with postgresql oracle and informix

1047630
post	put
if you want to keep everything controlled yourself you can put a resize script on a server of yours which takes the url to the raw uploaded image which can be up to 10mb due to http response size limit but you would have to store it as 1mb chunks in the datastore downloads it from your application resizes it and then post s it back to your application

1047638
int	double
therefore b 2 becomes the double 1.0 apparently in this case its value is slightly less than one giving you a 0 as the int value

1047638
ceil	floor
if you want to prevent this use both floor and ceil and compare the values

1047655
dictionary	map
i think what you call map is in python a dictionary

1047659

then you need to handle onmousedown or onmouseclick and onkeydown events and shift state images for needed list item

1047699
onmousedown	onmouseup
you can see i m trying to change the class of the div containing season.png onmousedown and revert it onmouseup

width	height
i want the dialog to be of a fixed width but adapt the height depending on how big the text is

1048239
getter	setter
obviously this can be handled by making both the getter and setter of the data synchronised - but for a large web application this is quite an overhead

1048242
tiff	png
the provided formats are jpeg png and tiff however the design allows new formats to be added easily

1048254
min	max
upon changing the the max and min values of a progress bar widget the progress bar appears blank

1048270
getter	setter
testing say simple getter and setter looks like a waste of time

1048273
librsvg	cairo
you can probably use cairo and librsvg to read svg into cairo surface and export to pdf using cairo

1048281
put	get
and now put an entry to it with an associative string and afterwards count the length i get a length of 0 but why

1048292

post	get
after loading the files it would be easy to get the stats from the database and post them in any format needed

1048389
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient doesn t have this kind of functionality - even the slightly-lower-level httpwebrequest doesn t as far as i m aware

1048428
webclient	httpwebrequest
as stated by jon skeet this is not available in the webclient not httpwebrequest classes

1048459

1048964
division	modulo
use the modulo to perform get division remainder

1048968
qfile	qtextstream
assigning a qtextstream to a qfile and reading it line-by-line is easy and works fine but i wonder if the performance can be inreased by first storing the file in memory and then processing it line-by-line

1048968
qiodevice	qfile	qfile	qbytearray	qbytearray	qiodevice
qfile is inhereted from qiodevice which allows me to readall it into qbytearray but how to proceed then and divide it into lines

1049017
bazaar	git
i m not going to give a specific one to avoid potential flaming but the big ones are git mercurial and bazaar all of which are quite good

1049042
qfile	qbytearray	qfile	qtextstream	qbytearray	qtextstream
or you could read all into the qbytearray and qtextstream can take that as an input instead of a qfile

daily weekly monthly yearly calculation for max min and average value

1049052
daemon	cron
something simple like set it up set cron or if it has a daemon even better set input enjoy output

a workaround is to create a new interface ihaseverything that inherited from ihasname2 and therefore from ihasname1 and reimplements the properties you need in your binding you can do that with the new statement

1049064
hide	show
hide the id column then the grid show

1049081
unix	aix
i have the java code below running on unix both aix and linux but it doesn t work

subtract	add
and if you want to move the gun in one step you would just add subtract the delta correctly

1049193
getter	setter
you may well want to only put the getter in the interface though - it s slightly unusual to include a setter in an interface

1049193
getter	setter
there are oddities if you want to override an existing or abstract property which only has a getter to add a setter but it s okay to implement a getter-only interface with setter as well i believe.

1049246
3des	aes
so for strong encryption provided by .net you d be best off going for either 3des 168 bit effectively or aes up to 256 bit - the latter is implemented under its original name of rijndael as .net first published this library before the aes selection process had formally ended

1049285
subtract	add
any time you add or subtract angles you can force the result into n bits using a logical and operation angle 0x00ff for 8 bits

1049327

other browsers like firefox safari are fine because they usually follow the w3c standard better

1049399
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
we certainly wish we could since we spend tons of time making our pages work on ie6 as well as ie7 ie8 firefox 2 firefox 3 google-chrome safari 2 safari 3

1049419
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
for my personal project i focus on firefox opera safari ie8

1049419

1049558
width	height
i have an image img src img1.png width 64 height 64 - the image is actually 64x64

1049558
width	height
now i have another image img src img2.png width 64 height 64 however the image is not as big as it should be its 32x32 - what happens here is it resizes the image to 64x64 and makes it look like

1049558
width	height
how do i make images smaller then the desired width and height centered in the img area without any resizing what so ever

1049586
post	get
apparently the guy who built this did not believe in the post redirect get pattern and instead serves up a page directly in response to a form submission

1049588
bash	zsh
in both zsh and bash 4.0

1049646
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview control bound to an objectdatasource which returns a list of objects that look like this

1049679
getter	setter
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like

1049693
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
not sure about how this works with objectdatasource but with sqldatasource we set keys on the rows of the gridview

1049708
starttls	smtps
i can t find anything in the ruby api for net smtps referencing tls or a starttls command

1049732

1049732
actionscript	mxml
i ve defined some panels in the mxml and set so that the new panel i ve created in actionscript will be added to the coverflow container

1049733
int	chars
that s a relatively common c idiom for converting a number stored as a chars to an int so it should be legible to other programmers who read it

1049748
children	parent
since querying for immediate children of a node is complicated i think it makes sense to also store the parent id in the table

1049846
versioning	upgrade
i m wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar upgrade experience and can share what gotchas pitfalls there are what has to change in my code what is not backwards compatible between the two versioning

1049880
integer	unsigned
first consider an unsigned integer stored in 4 bits

1049880
subtract	add
the circuits to add and subtract using sign magnitude will be very complex

1049880
subtraction	addition
you can store negative numbers you get rid of the two zeros problem but addition and subtraction remains difficult

1049907
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
wsdl.exe is the only core .net proxy generator other than svcutil.exe

1049918
mp3	flv
i should give the input as frames but in flv i will get the sorenson video and mp3 audio frame after doing some trivial string operations to remove the headers

1050001
width	height
if you want to get width by height information you can use capabilities.screenx and capabilities.screeny

1050001
width	height
therefore each 412x324 pixel image above will appear at 412 1440 29 width and 324 900 36 height of your full screen at your current video setting

1050001
width	height
i ve seen a couple of posts about setting a div s width height to 1in and then querying the offsetwidth offsetheight but that doesn t work any better than screendpi

1050080
bmp	png
textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations

1050109
portrait	landscape
when you switch from landscape to portrait and back on the iphone text reflows

as we know there is a relationship between a subclassing and its superclass is-a

1050170
webclient	httpwebrequest
given that you generally communicate with couchdb over rest and json i d imagine it wouldn t be too hard to use json.net and the normal webclient httpwebrequest classes to do it

1050200
pthreads	fork
i gather process groups are transferred by fork from the pthreads definition of fork

1050201
icomparable	compareto
your class should implement icomparable or in order for the sort functions to know about your compareto method

1050206
comparator	icomparer
as an alternative if you don t want your class to implement that you can also implement icomparer clientworkspace in another class or create a method that matches the comparator clientworkspace delegate

1050207
icomparable	compareto
you can implement the icomparable interface and provide an implementation of compareto method there

1050256
jobs	cron
i know i can set up automated jobs cron for unix and scheduled task for windows but i want it cross platform and i want it in our application s log configuration as a part of our application rather than in separate code outside in os specific scripting languages

1050260
icomparable	compareto
it is not enough to just implement the compareto method since the sorting algorithms will look for the icomparable interface before attempting to call compareto through that interface

1050331
min	max
- obtain values time at max min value fall time etc

1050331
min	max
can the blob be of a packed oracle type so that the values could be read by oracle itself ie to obtain max min etc

redmine	trac
i think some formalized bug tracker trac redmine jira fogbugz etc. could help us

1050435
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
an alternative would be to use nsurlconnection and create a new nsxmlparser and re-parse the data each time some data comes in in the connection didreceivedata method of your nsurlconnection s delegate

min	max
i have asked this question about using the a linq method that returns one object first min max etc from of a generic collection

1050457
cvs	svn
svn subversion and cvs - simpler to use with fewer resources available

1050461
stdout	stderr
i think the problem is this the program writes all of its output to stderr rather than stdout

1050461
stdout	stderr
so to overcome this it seems like you have to redirect the output of your program unix2dos uses stderr to stdout

1050461
stdout	stderr
the 2 means redirect stderr and 1 means to stdout

1050463
pop-up	dialog
the dialog box pop-up fairly quickly so this works for me

1050501
redmine	trac
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use

1050534
width	height
ie7 ie8 and ff3 does not accept value 100 as height or width or sl2 object

1050534
width	height
change height and width to px value for ex 800px and that will solve the problem

1050545
actualheight	actualwidth
or you can pass it actualwidth actualheight and you ll get the bottom-right corner

1050660
firefox	safari
this made the page line up perfectly in firefox and safari but in ie the nav column was pushed over to the right too far

1050660
firefox	safari
the placement of this line of css is important if my page is still to look good in firefox and safari

1050660
firefox	safari
firefox and safari will read that line and then it will be over-ridden by the body div#nav selector lower in the document

1050660
firefox	safari
when ie 7 comes along it will act like firefox and safari

1050661

1051084
x86	64bit
this is why you see a program files x86 folder on your 64bit os to handle a lot of your old 32-bit apps

1051086
x86	64bit
most .net applications should work unmodified in 64bit if they target x86 instead of any cpu which is the vs.net default

1051111
versioning	upgrade
sometimes microsoft will add a method to the libraries and not upgrade their major or minor versioning

1051128
imagemagick	libtiff
tiff compression is available for free with libtiff or imagemagick and built into .net and java

1051181

1051183
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
look for the iphone versions of nscalendar nsdate and nsdatecomponents

1051204
getter	setter
a dto is a dumb object - it just holds properties and has getter and setter but no other logic of any significance other than maybe a compare or equals implementation

1051217
client-side	server-side
but asp.net is more about server-side processing than it is about client-side processing and what you want is completely client-side

1051273
textarea	textbox
and why so and other websites and software apple use courier-like fonts for data entry fields textbox textarea like this

1051288
portrait	landscape
if the device is in portrait mode then it should display the video but when the user changes the device to landscape mode it should just show an image

1051541
min	max
examine and see if it s valid for what you think are the min and max values for i

1051564
post	get
reusing it will obviously mean the pre post functions don t get called every time

1051610
dateadd	datepart
the datepart and dateadd stuff are tsql specific but i d assume you d have access to similar functions on whatever platform you are using

1051623
ienumerable	icollection
if the underlying ienumerable t implements icollection t like t list t etc. then the copy step is skipped and the enumerator just iterates over the underlying collection directly

if it s just a size issue is there some other library object i can use in vbscript jscript that will get the job done

1051720
firefox	safari
just an idea - tested in firefox safari - seems to work if you create an iframe to store the document temporarily

min	max
you could also output the min and max as custom attributes of the textbox and even namespace them if you want to retain xhtml validity

1051724
glut	glfw
it provides raw opengl bindings as well as glut and glfw - as a beginner i found glfw much easier to use for my simple needs than glut

runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are subclasses of the runtimeexception or error classes

1051732
serializable	deserialization
our current serializable routine uses bigdecimal.toplainstring for serializable and new bigdecimal string for deserialization - i m assuming there s a better way

1051753
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
errors and runtimeexception are called unchecked-exception because the compiler does not enforce this requirement on them

1051761

i m looking for a c# wrapper to a native md5 or sha1 library to improve hash calculation performance

1051767

where created_at between dateadd week -1 getdate and getdate --specify the date range to include

1051968
post	put
i see why you might want to map rest url post to save and rest url id put to update but that goes against the meaning of those verbs

1051968

a put should be the only way to add a new url and post the only way to update a url

1051972

post	get
but when i try to use post the body seems to get lost and is never printed out

1052127

1052211
disk	ram
i know from oracle is that they insert data in a temporary place both in ram and on disk and do housekeeping on periodic basis the database engine is busy all the time optimizing its structure but in the same time we do not want to lose data in case of power failure of something like that

1052221
free	malloc
valgrind does overwrite new delete malloc free but not during compilation so you don t have to recompile if that s what you mean

xui	iui
check out iui xui and jqtouch as well

1053052
gif	png
weirdly this works perfectly with a png but gives the above error with jpg and gif which is rather confusing

1053058
wordpress	joomla
the reason i am using joomla because i have some components that i need to implement on joomla instead of using wordpress

1053064
width	height
and programmatically if the width height of this control were set the contents of the canvas would also scale within those bounds

1053064
width	height
how about not clipping path strokes when they go outside of the width height bounds

1053086
pop-up	dialog
an external link when clicked will pop-up the confirmation dialog and if it says yes they will be able to get to the external url opening in a new window

1053118
free	malloc
the other thing you should not do is free a pointer allocated by new or malloc from one dll that was allocated in the other

1053134
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
in your in your handler for the finished signal you will be passed a qnetworkreply object which you can read the response from as it inherits from qiodevice

1053134
qstring	qbytearray
you can construct a qstring from that qbytearray and do whatever you want to do with it

1053135
int	double
the problem is in the c code you have the long long filled out right but then you convert the int value directly into floating point rather than reinterpreting the bytes as a double

1053138
postgresql	mysql
support these sqlite mysql postgresql

1053163
post	get
if i have a post having but still if i type i get redirected to

1053168
addclass	removeclass
i m not sure what you re trying to achieve so some combination of addclass removeclass or toggleclass will do the trick

1053192
hide	show
the show and hide jquery commands take only two parameters speed and a callback

1053219
post	get
as mentioned by others there are several libraries and several post available for you to get started

1053253
utorrent	mirc
but there doesn t seem to be any infomation about creating applications similar to k3b utorrent ccleaner and mirc

1053267
vb.net	vb6
however if your moving from vb6 then i d recommend learning vb.net or preferably c#

1053280
vb.net	vb6
if you re coming from vb6 i d recommend c# vb.net or java in that order

1053283
portrait	landscape
i need to implement behavior of my uiviewcontroller subclass like in standart ipod.app when device rotated from portrait to landscape content of uiviewcontroller stay s still and new view add s above it

1053306
int	chars
it takes 2 arguments - an int named argc the number of command-line arguments and a const chars array named argv the command-line arguments

1053318
stdio	gets
that part tells the preproccesor part of the compiler that goes through and gets things ready to be compiled to take the contents of the file stdio in some special part of your computer and put it on top of your source code

1053338
mvp	presenter
but if you break out logic to controllers presenter like the mvc mvp pattern you can at least test the presenter

1053346
actualheight	actualwidth
i would like to bind a scaletransform to a converter passing the actualwidth or actualheight

1053422
mvp	presenter
in the diagram below from this article the mvp model shows all the data moving through the presenter - and this generally isn t the case for well-built cocoa apps

1053458
robocopy	xcopy
after that you could use xcopy or robocopy to copy all the files and subdirectories

1053520
xna	slimdx
if you want to use vb.net then you can go with xna or slimdx

1053524
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
you didn t mention want type of images you loading jpeg png gif bmp of course that bmp is the fastest one since it has not or almost no compression

1053524
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
are your images 256 colors 8 bit w palette bmp gif and png support that format that can load pretty fast

1053566
pascal	delphi
the code is written in delphi pascal but it s basic enough to easily translate into most other languages

1053573
versioning	upgrade
unlike major os upgrade people have been upgrading to new versioning of iphone os very very quickly

1053579
yacc	bison
and 3. i can t suggest much beyond what you already found i mostly use python and pyparsing and could comment from experience on many python-centered parse frameworks but for c++ i mostly use good old yacc or bison anyway and my old gnarled copy of the dragon book -- not the latest edition actually -- is all i keep at my side for the purpose...

1053592
getter	setter
are instance methods the accessors getter and setter while class methods are pretty much everything else

1053602
httplib	cookielib
i d go other suggested way but i ve done a hack done for different reasons though which does create an interface between httplib and cookielib

1053626
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
i think you could probably figure out a way to make this work by making scaleconverter descend from dependencyobject giving it an actualsize dependency property putting two instances of it in your resources instead of one and doing a one-way-to-source binding to bind one instance s actualsize to the canvas s actualwidth and the other to its actualheight so the instance s actualsize is always kept in sync with the canvas s width height as the canvas resizes

1053626
width	height
you also need to assign a width and height to the canvas to get that to work since canvas doesn t have a natural size by default

1053626
width	height
the above snippet sets a width and height that would put your ellipse at the lower-right corner of the stretched viewbox

1053673
awt	swing
i ve been messing around with awt swing lately trying to learn how to do applets

1053676
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie google-chrome all have no problem with this basic square-one feature

1053717
min	max
i m going to stick my neck out and say no i don t think there s any way to make that significantly faster unless inlining the calls to min and max would help but i expect the optimiser will take care of that

1053718
range	max	range	min	min	max
now samples which are already in the current min max range don t need any side effects so let s get rid of the assignments in that case

1053718
cpu	processors
as another answer said this is a very easy operation to parallelise - it should improve the speed nearly linearly with cpu count 2 processors twice as fast etc apart from the cache misses etc.

1053730
children	parent
passing an object around can get old because sometimes you end up only having a link to the object to pass to someone else so i would avoid that approach unless you were just passing from one parent to a few immediate children

1053764
min	max
you might also try inlining the min max calls yourself but there s a good chance the jit is already doing that for you

1053764
min	max
just make sure you don t write to the min max values from multiple threads at the same time

1053764
min	max
don t lock on it either though i would have a min max value per thread and do a final compare between the min max values of each thread task when all threads are done

1053784
put	get
just put your head down and get copy-pasting

1053813
put	get
if you put the got data interrupt to sleep and then get more data what happens

1053827
post	get
it not precisely like picasa they decided only to show full rows of photos instead of a partially covered row like picasa but by implementing your own virtualizing iscrollinfo panel reasonably straightforward and ben constable has a great series of post on it you should be able to get the performance you re looking for and the behaviour you want

1053833
rss	feed
i followed along this tutorial for django s rss and atom feed and i got it to work

1053837
intersect	contains
an inverted list that maps a number that appears in the lists to the lists that contains it then intersect those lists to find those that have more than one number in common

1053841
min	max
only finding the max and min of an interval

1053846
equals	gethashcode
also to continue with the small rant i wonder why they did not add the notion of declarative immutable types and make this a possible generic type constraint because this would allow to make sure a key does not change its hashcode during runtime which can happen currently if one implements gethashcode and equals on some mutable object

1053919
free	malloc
it s only called once and i check the address after the malloc call to cplptr and before the corresponding free for cplptr

1053931
int	boolean
you can assume that data are 0 and 1s int string or boolean your choice and output is a single bit

1053933
dao	facade
but the twist is that we selectively expose methods on the dao through a facade and forward only those we absolutely must

1053944
post	put
my frustration is with trying to upload put and or post a new object a photo to an existing bucket

1053992
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
note if you use this you should want to take into consideration that any pageview will create a row in your table so based on useragent you can disregard bots or only count the popular ones firefox ie safari opera etc

1054030
hash	md5
i would md5 sha1 the password if you don t need to be able to reverse the hash

1054033
hash	salt
by representation i mean that you want to hash the password using a salt which should be different for every user and a secure 1-way algorithm and store that throwing away the original password

1054033
hash	salt
then when you want to verify a password you hash the value using the same hashing algorithm and salt and compare it to the hash value in the database

1054038
width	height
however i would like to be able to autosize the height and width of the control based on the number of rows and columns in the control respectively

1054039
hash	salt
as a key-hardened salt hash using a secure algorithm such as sha-512

1054040
hash	salt
the best security practice is not to store the password at all not even encrypted but to store the salt hash with a unique salt per password of the encrypted password

1054045
google-chrome	safari
but in webkit safari 3 + 4 and google-chrome the sub-level ul flashes after the hide function

1054062
lisp	scheme
modern variants of lisp from scheme onwards don t use dynamic scoping a misfeature that was sadly highly visible usually manifesting as hard-to-understand bugs in their code to beginners basically as soon as they started writing functions in lisp 1.5 i once was a beginner in that and can testify to how badly it bit me

1054064
post	put
another table would contain essays with fields for the essay or rebutter s userid the conversationid the body of the post and a post count to put them in order

1054064
post	put
finally i d have a comments table with comment posters userids essayid s to link them to essay post commentid s to put them in thread mode if that s apropriate and of course the comment body

1054069
hash	salt
see how to hash data with salt c# example

1054089
min	max
random.next takes arguments that let you specify a min and a max value so that s how you would control the length

1054135
post	get
first i just changed a post to a get but that resulted in an error that my http request exceeded the maximum size for a get

1054156
client-side	server-side
html css server-side database client-side scripting etc.

1054157
postgresql	mysql
i have some experience with postgresql s built in full text search capabilities but for this thing it s going to be mysql

1054161
hash	salt
what you should do is store a hash of the password with an appropriate salt

1054161
hash	salt
they can merely accept a password and see if it s the right one or not by hashing the input with the same salt you can t reverse a hash

1054225
mvp	presenter
in an mvp pattern you typically create a presenter for each view

1054236
formview	detailsview
and bind it to a formview detailsview or listview

1054248
min	max
if you set both your min max to the first value then if you find a new min there is no reason to check if it is also a new max

1054270
folder	directory
i ve enabled directory listing of a folder under public_html by adding

1054305
free	malloc
just be careful to free the memory that your function malloc s in whoever calls it

1054332
min	max
i want to display today record min time and previous day record max time

1054332
min	max
from the above table i want to display today min time and previous day max time

1054332
min	max
i want to get today min time and previous day max time for the particular person id

1054335
expression-blend	silverlight
the silverlight site also has sample downloads trials of expression-blend and the bits for deepzoom but they re extras and not necessary to get started

1054343
ferret	sphinx
i ve personally used ferret in production sphinx in almost-production and xapian to screw around with

1054343
postgresql	mysql
comparison of full text search engine - lucene sphinx postgresql mysql

1054359
firefox	safari
this is happening in both firefox 3.0 and safari 4 i haven t tried it in any other browsers

1054365
gdi	directdraw
i found that setting the gdi palette using create selectpalette before setting the directdraw palette using idirectdrawpalette setentries would restore the palette after it became corrupted wm_palettechanged handler

1054386
getter	setter
public members don t require a getter and a setter so you wouldn t have to worry about that.

1054399
arcgis	proj
i am trying to use arcfm with my arcgis proj and i ve noticed a bug

1054413
ironruby	ironpython
i m using mac os x to develop with silverlight 3 using ironruby and ironpython and textmate

1054453
versioning	upgrade
you can also set a setting of needsupgrading to true by default and set it to false after performing an upgrade so that end users who are not changing versioning numbers every time the app is started will not be upgrading all the time

1054463
createelement	each
i mean yes i could through and use createelement for each element and setting each attribute separately but that seems like a lot just when this is so simple

1054464
bash	zsh
maybe the problem with job control had to do with some bug in zsh that doesn t even exist in bash and maybe it is no longer relevant in zsh either

1054484
hash	md5
for example take the md5 hash of the username then treat the last 8 bytes of that as a long

1054492
filesystems	ntfs
i forget exactly how this is done now and it will only work for ntfs filesystems but it s possible

1054504
datamapper	activerecord
you might want to look at using datamapper or sequel for your orm if you re finding that activerecord lacks the expressiveness you need for complex queries

1054517
spaces	delimiter
for more attribute pair within the same table just append them to the end spaces delimiter

1054530
bmp	png
a library that converts a bmp to png and only has a save file option - no in memory function

1054564
disk	ram
these libraries often just accept a filename as input not an ostream in this case though not really being a programming solution you could set up a ram disk

1054578
post	get
generally you are following the right approach but this can get nasty quite fast if you need to do queries on more than one cluster - your friends recent post type queries

1054579
stdout	stderr
by refering to stdin stdout and stderr streams

1054595
folder	directory
if you delete a folder extension from the extensions directory it has the same effect as uninstalling it

1054640
serializable	deserialization
just because you can or is there a real need like a profiling session confirming that serializable deserialization takes most of the time

1054665
rss	feed
i was writing a generic class to read rss feed from various source and to consolidate in one collection of object in vb.net

1054665
rss	feed
basically the function - using linq to xml - is working properly but i have a problem when the rss feed i am trying to read does not contain one of the node as you know many of them are optional

1054681
width	height
this uses the nsstring method sizewithfont constrainedtosize linebreakmode to calculate the frame height needed to fit a string then sets the origin and width

1054698
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i ve found that a lot of scripting languages tend to wrap one of three free image libraries imagemagick imagescience and graphicsmagick

1054700
lisp	scheme
emacs lisp - scheme or cl didn t have enough performance at that time

1054738
gridview	repeater
the repeater does not have built-in pagination like the gridview or other complex controls so it does not offer events such as the pageindexchanging

1054782
lisp	prolog
lisp prolog ai

1054789
bmp	png
it is certianly possible to find a png - bmp converter that can work in memory

1054805
post	get
have a post method for users to get to their own profile and test the profile id w the form s hidden values or redirect not your nose go away

1054820
autofac	castle-windsor
i think castle-windsor autofac and structuremap are at least as good or better

1054906
post	get
the way i see it i would have to create a php file called get_messages.php that would connect to a database and get through a variable return all post beyond date x and then i would somehow through jquery call this php file every few minutes with

1054937
uilabel	uibutton
in interface builder there are layout options to send to back or send to front any elements such as uibutton uiimage uilabel etc.

1054995
mouse	keyboard
between the user and the ui the ui events mouse and keyboard

1055022
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when using a uiviewcontroller the normal way pushing it on a uinavigationcontroller it adjusts its view s frame

1055025
opera	firefox
neither javascript itself or any webbrowser ie firefox opera ... are xquery capable or have support build in

1055039
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but you d be better off to use the uiviewcontroller and push this on the uinavigationcontroller

1055073
children	parent
if your nodes link to their parent and the children of a node will always be enumerated in the same order you can trace your steps without having to save them

1055116
innodb	myisam
the standard suggestion of bumping key_buffer or innodb_buffer_pool for myisam and innodb respectively still applies

1055140
width	margin
give your .navigation ul a width and use margin 0 auto

1055145
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	elementtree	elementtree	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup lxml and other python libraries elementtree etc. make dealing with xml more easy

1055149
width	margin
doing that you can remove the float left from the list items and you don t need to have a fixed width for the navigation bar as you would if you used margin 0 auto

1055151
width	margin
well to use margin 0 auto on something it must have a defined width

1055159
entity-relationship	diagram
is there a program that converts a sql server database diagram to entity-relationship model or create entity-relationship model of a database from sql server server

1055183
youtube	vimeo
should we upload the video to youtube or vimeo and embed

1055191
youtube	vimeo
uploading to a service like youtube blip.tv or vimeo is good but you ll have to settle for them tossing in related videos or other ads on your content and you ll be forced to stick with their player branding

1055211
post	get
instead use your page controllers to parse input such as get and post instanciate the correct business logic objects and call the correct methods on those to do the actual data crunching

1055212
firefox	safari
this uses the video tag if it s supported but as firefox and safari both support different formats ogg and mp4 you need to have a couple of different versions of the video files

1055212
opera	google-chrome
this works on every browser from ie6 to the iphone and from google-chrome to opera including everything in between

1055213
accessor	properties
class extensions can also be used to redeclare a publicly readonly properties as readwrite prior to synthesize ing the accessor

1055217
boost	stl
i am unsure about what boost has but some stl implementations like sgi have hash_map

1055219
firefox	safari
ie will use an object tag generally with an id and firefox safari etc will use the embed tag and since you aren t supposed to be the same id on two elements people generally use the name attribute instead of an id attribute on the embed tag

1055251
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
you can use any of the free ui applications to access the source control repositories such as tortoisesvn smartsvn etc..

1055278
width	height
you can change the width and height to be 100 but it won t cover the browser chrome or the os shell

1055287
shadowbox	lightbox
i d recommend looking into jquery as there are a number of shadowbox lightbox plugins for it

1055296
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
use openfiledialog and savefiledialog to let the user select the xml file and xmlserializer to load and save ur data model

1055315

scm integration svn cvs git mercurial bazaar and darcs

1055325
for-loop	arrays

1055334
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh	zsh	tcsh
i would say that this is because it is useful to learn some basic bash zsh tcsh whatever pipes loops redirection of streams ...

1055355
cvs	svn
you can use svn cvs which has loads of gui utilities to back it up on almost every os out there

1055367
firefox	safari
surprisingly it works with safari 4 but it doesn t work with firefox with safari 3 the background is not transparent

1055391
memcached	apc
if you re married to the idea of incrementing filenames you ll probably want to use some sort of shared datastore for holding your sequence number like mysql memcached or apc

1055432
gif	png
if you don t want to do the animated gif trick but need support for jpeg or png it get s nasty

1055441

our clonedr clone detector does this for java c# c++ cobol vb.net vb6 fortran and a variety

1055573
post	get
so that php parses them into an array in post get

1055577
int	chars
btw bytes do not have endianess unless you re casting a byte chars array or similar to an int type you just determine the endianess by assigning the bytes back in the approprate order

1055609

1055758
brainfuck	basic
i m creating a brainfuck parser in a basic dialect ultimately to create an interpreter but i ve realise it s not as straight forward as i first thought

1055802
folder	directory
what i would like to have is to have the pages aspx user controls ascx and handlers ashx basically as dummy placeholders sitting in the directory structure organized from the logically according to the point of view of the outside visitor while the actual code page user controls implementations serve control and utility classes should be placed in s different folder structured into logical namespaces organized by the modules or features of the application

1055802
inherited	subclassing
i leave this class be no code will go there but create a subclassing say in myapp.somenamespace.somesubnamespace.mypage inherited from myapp.mypage

1055829
subscript	superscript
the possibility to make text superscript or subscript is built-in in the richtextbox see this msdn article

1055829
subscript	superscript
edit if i understand correctly you don t need just subscript and superscript capabilities but a full equation editor

1055861
installshield	orca
transform files are partial databases constructed via installation tools such as orca sdk link installshield or wise advanced installer etc.

1055899
folder	directory
your users can then go directly into the extracted folder structure and update the file in question and then map the directory to other pc s and install the msi

1055913
free	malloc
if something was allocated with new free it with delete malloc is free by free and new by delete

1055926
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
but if i upgrade the installed versioning of paramiko from what an old distro provides i 1 make life hard for the package manager 2 might break some existing apps due to incompatibilities in the library versioning and 3 might get broken if the package manager decides to overwrite my custom installation

1055933

lisp	scheme
in that regard i d recommend scheme which is in my opinion more elegant than common lisp

1056133
opera	firefox
the above works just fine for me in opera firefox and ie6 can t test others

1056208

you have to declare a getter setter method to change or view a variable from another class - what you are really looking for are properties that make it easier to define and access these getter setter methods

1056723
getter	setter
in the implementation file you d have the getter setter created with the synthesize statement just after the implementation line

1057606
gif	png
the loader class only works for jpg gif png swf

1057684
put	get
i don t know what you are trying to get with this sql but you can either put the and filter on the correct on after e.eid d.eid or you can change the tables used to filter in the current on so one of the fields belongs to managerdetails

1057748
matplotlib	scipy
python + numpy + scipy + matplotlib are the right combination to start

google-chrome	safari
this wonâ t count as a valid answer because i donâ t know how to actually fix that but the problem is that most browsers besides safari and google-chrome perhaps load javascript sequentially because itâ s necessary to wait for the previous script to finish executing as it may change the document

1057903
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

1058524
getter	setter
if for some reason i couldn t afford the numpy dependency e.g on app engine which doesn t support numpy i d use the standard library array module - it only supports 1-dimensional arrays but it s just as space-efficient as numpy for large homogeneous arrays and the getter setter routines you mention can perfectly well linearize a 3-items tuple that s your natural index into the single integer index into the 1-d array

1058546
post	get
how do i implement the post redirect get pattern in asp.net webforms

1058546

1059327
button	checkbox
example of this one is below i m checking to see whether a checkbox is checked before enabling the button

1059518
qmainwindow	qwidget
does the same thing happen if you just make it a regular qwidget instead of a qmainwindow

1059522
hide	show
this code would essentially show the list bind a click handler that finds the next list element relative to the one being clicked on if it finds one it hide itself and show that one and then outside the click we show the first one to get things started

1059548
int	chars
can you do something where you split on spaces and then check to see if the first chars of some interior string is an int

1059811
versioning	upgrade
has anybody upgrade to the latest versioning of visual svnserver and been able to get trac to continue to work under win32

1059847
ftp	telnet
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

1059855
short	base
in short not the kind of thing you would base a new technology on

1059886
free	malloc
why not malloc x in main so you wouldn t forget to free x later thus creating a memory leak

1059942

the int will be faster for joins than a 64 chars string primary key would be

1059999
getter	setter
where coordinate is a defined as setter getter left out for readability

1060773
boost	allocator
so if you want the c++ version to compete you ll probably have to solve that allowing your containers to resize without having to perform actual heap allocator probably by using custom allocator for the containers perhaps boost pool might be a good bet or you can try rolling your own

1060775
dumpbin	stdafx.h	stdafx.h	vcproj
after changing the vcproj preprocessor settings so that winver and win32_winnt are 0x0501 and making a similar change in the stdafx.h file and rebuilding dumpbin stil shows that the operating system version is 5.0

1060787
folder	directory
after creating a styles folder in the application directory

1060831
nsstring	uifont
i believe you re looking for the uifont nsstring extensions that allow you to calculate the size of a string given a uifont

1061179
children	parent
doing this appears to have 2 benefits when it comes to adding children to the collection in your code and then saving the parent with cascade-all set you save an unneccessary hit on the database because without inverse set hibernate thinks it has two places to update the fk relationship and according to the official docs

1061179
set	bag
many valued end the set or bag

1061250
inherited	subclassing
a very popular alternative to inherited as in subclassing is object composition and delegation

hide	show
if you instead made a string with all the ids seperated by comma you could select and hide show them all in one action

1066390
put	get
here s some code i wrote this weekend to get an image from a twain device via windows image acquisition 2.0 and put the data into something i can shove in a gtk based ui

1066409
overwrite	preserve
the purpose of the overwrite list more commonly called the clobber list is to inform gcc that as a result of the asm instructions the register s listed in the clobber list will be modified and so the compiler should preserve any which are currently live

1066417
gwt	cssresource
there may be other ways to accomplish the same effect in gwt but the power of the cssresource can be leveraged for more things than what i ve gone over here

1066423
typedef	struct
extern is used to say i know a variable of this type with this name will exist when this program runs and i want to use it. it works with variables objects not classes struct unions typedef etc

1066452
pop-up	dialog
what is the best cross browser way to open a download dialog lets assume we can set content-disposion attachment in the headers without navigating away from the current page or opening pop-up which doesnt work well in ie6

1066454
post	get
i know it can be done using ajax cookie session or post variables but i really want to use get variables

1066455
getter	setter
think about it - your getter and setter are really doing something

1066455
getter	setter
you can t bypass them without changing the semantics completely and i wouldn t expect a setter to run just because i changed something in what the getter had returned

1066481
hide	show
one way to handle this scenario would be to hide the overlay window in the application.ondeactivate event and to show it on the application.onactivate event

1066486
junit	testng	junit	easymock	testng	easymock
junit testng and easymock for testing there are many others those are the ones we use

1066486
junit	easymock
junit allows you to easily create methods that run as part of a test easymock allows you to create mock or fake objects to pass in that will respond in very specific ways which you can use to test a method that relies on a framework or running environment that isn t there during testing

1066529
jquery	curvycorners
can i assume you are using the curvycorners jquery wrap

1066532
client-side	server-side
from the kss project description kss has both a client-side javascript library and server-side support

1066532
client-side	server-side
however there are facilities in kss for binding kss client-side events back to server-side callables in a python web framework

1066561
organization	naming
i believe that wpf kept this organization and naming convention for compatibility with silverlight where vsm was first implemented

1066584
min	max	min	median	median	max
scan the dataset for the min max median mean

1066611
post	get
question from thomas -- when do you use post and when do you use get

1066629
tostring	string.format
in the case where tostring is called on something statically typed as an interestrate as in your example or in certain related cases where an interestrate is cast to object and then immediately used as a parameter to something like string.format you could conceivably detect the problem with static analysis

1066644
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
ie6 is one of the obvious ones but then there are all the released versions of mozilla firefox opera safari etc etc

1066651
direct3d	directx
i ve been experimenting with the dxut functions for direct3d applications in the march 2009 directx sdk

1066666
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
a foreach loops goes through each item in the arrays much like a for-loop

1066718

if i had just used int chars etc then the alignment might be 1 2 4 or 8

1066722
firefox	safari
on the following page the orange buy topo map link will open a page in ie7 and firefox and safari but not in ie8

1066729
firefox	safari
xmlhttprequest - in firefox and safari but not in ie it can be used for long-pull page loading that enables to handle fragments as they appear on each readystatechange event

1066730
gridview	detailsview
users can then fill out these forms in a detailsview-like control thereby creating documents. the documents can be shown in a detailsview or certain fields of several of them can be shown in a gridview

1066730
gridview	detailsview
the problem is that gridview and detailsview seem to be specifically designed to access properties on objects that come out of a datasource

1066737
int	double
for anything that is a primitive type int double float you don t need the asterisk

1066757
pop-up	dialog
the browser will usually forget the old value pop-up another user pass input dialog and if users then press the abort button they are logged out

1066787
ssl	https
that said https http over ssl is a good starting point this will allow you to authenticate the website to the device or browser and is ubiquitous

1066818
facade	mediator
the facade pattern and the mediator pattern perform similar tasks to what you are describing

1066818
facade	mediator
your use of the middleman moniker implies the mediator pattern over the facade pattern as a middleman is responsible for negotiating between two entities with neither entity needing to know the specifics of how to communicate with the other

1066818
facade	mediator
you can use either of these patterns to reduce coupling for the client class which needs to use the system the mediator or facade is masking

1066819
spaces	delimiter
can you assume that the urls will be spaces delimiter or return delimiter

1066820

make sure you re using a textarea element - you should be able to put padding 5px or whatever you want on the container element then put height 100 and width 100 on the textarea

1066896
pop-up	dialog
if i do pop-up the dialog when not needed it shows briefly then disappears which has an annoying flashing effect

1066902
hash	md5
md5 is not a symmetric encryption algorithm it is a one-way hash

1066905
min	max
you would need to change count to max or min in the top line of your query and possibly other changes depending on what your data looks like

1066923
width	height
any ideas on how to get the width and height of the thumbnail image

1066936

nsstring	nsxmlparser
void parser nsxmlparser parser foundcharacters nsstring string

1067041

i don t have a way of dynamically sizing the textbox but if you enclose the textbox in a div assign the div a height and width and set the margins of that div to auto margin auto

1067094
formview	detailsview
the detailsview is not very customizable so you should take a look at the formview

1067203
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this includes ie6 7 8 firefox safari webkit opera etc

1067216
createfile	deviceiocontrol
i can call createfile successfully on the dvd device but when i try to call deviceiocontrol with the control code ioctl_dvd_start_session it returns a success code but i don t seem to get the sessionid value back successfully always returns 0

1067248
googletest	gmock
we use googletest and it s companion gmock

1067253
getdate	dateadd
most databases have a getdate function and a dateadd function that you can use to create the offsets you re looking for

1067253
getdate	dateadd
store the result of getdate in a variable then use dateadd to create your range relative to the current date

1067258
dateadd	sysdate
change dateadd day -7 current_date syntax to whatever the sysdate minute 7 days syntax is in your databse flavour

1067303
haskell	scheme	erlang	scheme
we ll collectively be happy to help with any questions that should spring from these attempts i m personally unfamiliar with f# or scala but would be happy to help with haskell any ml-family language scheme or erlang -- and similarly for the other groups

1067346
dlsym	dlopen
for this purpose i am using dlsym and dlopen to use the api in the shared library

1067393
implements	extends
by definition all classes in java extends the base object class and object class has a default clone method even though object itself does not implements cloneable

1067451
clang	llvm
they re also investing heavily in development of llvm and clang as a replacement for gcc

1067471

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
- void tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller controller didselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

1067520
profiling	debugging
and always profiling the release build - profiling the debugging build is generally a wasted effort

1067627
dlsym	dlopen
your question and answer are both very confused if you can link your executable directly against libdrmaa.so then there is absolutely no good reason to also dlopen that same library and presumably call dlsym on its handle as well

1067646
opera	safari
moreover do all new browsers ie8 ff3.5 opera 9.6 safari 4 support compression method both gzip and deflate

1067652
post	get

i m programing an excel add-in with vs2008 and vsto c# over office 2007

1067732
profiling	instrumentation
from xcode 4.2 choose product- profiling and when instrumentation launches choose zombies

1067749
sorting	grouping
the signature has the property that sorting will grouping

1067844
put	get
if i don t put it in i get the annoying lingering icon in the tray until you move the mouse over it

1067845
inherited	properties
is there a good way to allow only a certain class to have read write access to properties in another class without having inherited structure between them during design mode in .net

1067877
put	get
with the inner join as i put you ll get list of employees that have at least one project

1067883
public	protected
you have public protected internal including but nothing more granular at the inter-type level

1067922
bash	zsh
this works in zsh and in bash 4 after you run shopt -s globstar

1067928
implements	extends
i would go with having models that extends an abstract class and that one will implements an access to either zend_db_table or another class that you later might want as your data provider

1068016
opera	firefox
only working on firefox opera ie8

1068019
versioning	upgrade
at the very least you should get something out of your automated build that you can run without tweaking on your production server to upgrade your database to the new versioning when you are upgrading your program

1068044
hide	show
the trick is to use css and show hide with javascript

1068067
junit	testng
of course there is more to that and this where test frameworks junit testng dunit nunit ... will come in handy they will take the little pains away and only leave the coding part of the test

1068098
versioning	upgrade
i believe the firefox team have fixed this bug - upgrade to the latest versioning of firefox to resolve the issue

1068113
width	height
that does not set it s width and height though

1068123
hide	show
is there any way to hide the number pad first and then show progress view

1068128
wav	ogg
ogg theora ogg vorbis and wav

1068137
for-loop	loops
foreach is elegant in that it has no concern for the number of items in a list and treats each element equally i think your only solution will be using a for-loop that either stops at itemcount-1 and then you present your last item outside of loops or a conditional within loops that handles that specific condition if i itemcount .

1068152
freebsd	linux
migrate to enterprise linux or freebsd postgres works much better on unix type systems mdash

1068162
post	get
gets you can have the get page auto-submit the post - kind of a loophole around that bit of the rfc but legit and you dont require the user to double-optin and you re not bugging him.

1068178
children	parent
your problem is that you want to affect the rendering of a parent tag based on the number of its children of a particular type

1068240
boost	stl
but if you want best performance compatibility functionality ratio you will probably have to look at boost library part of it is stl anyway

1068283
mouse	keyboard
my understanding of this kind of application is that when multiple users log in to the same vnc server they share the keyboard mouse and desktop so only one person can actually use the computer whilst the other users can watch what is happening

1068284
tostring	string.format
is there a simple way to format numbers in javascript similar to the formatting methods available in c# or vb.net via tostring format_provider or string.format

1068358
shibboleth	opensso
opensso opensaml and shibboleth seem like the major options

1068368

the pageviewcontroller initwithnibname method has been uncommented and is just the default setting self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil

1068410
next	except
creating classes that do nothing except extending already existing collections seems like multiplying entities beyond necessity but would make my code more clear especially when there are next levels - like map of allconnections by month and so on

1068446
searchable	luke
i recommend to use luke to inspect your generated index to see what tokens are actually searchable

1068501
phpunit	simpletest
write automatic unit tests with phpunit or simpletest since you re using php or any other unit-testing framework available for your language of choice

1068530
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
is there a way to do this that is common across most linux distributions but ubuntu fedora and opensuse would be the priority

1068571
ubuntu	debian
the former covers ubuntu debian variants and the latter red hat variants

1068571
kde	gnome
you will have to deal with gnome and kde menu management and also different distributions lay out their menus differently

1068571
kde	gnome	kde	kubuntu	kubuntu	gnome
i don t know if it is possible for a single .deb to handle both gnome and kde menus systems for ubuntu and kubuntu respectively but i imagine the capability is there to reduce duplication of effort for ubuntu

1068578
youtube	vimeo
i let users embed videos from youtube google vimeo etc

1068608
spaces	delimiter
i believe you try to separate an input string in words trying various delimiter - spaces comma semicolon etc

1068620
serializable	deserialization
it allows you peak at the message headers control serializable deserialization return status codes etc

1068683
hide	show
you can very well hide the table borders to show the text alone

1068745
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian the .deb i would add that you do not send it to people but you create a repository and have the users add that url to their etc apt sources.list then you get a easy way to update the software as well

1068858
rss	feed
i am developing an app which parses an xml or rss feed of a magazine..the thing is i have to include an offline capability ie save the previous results which were displayed in each cell similar to the new york times app and then display the saved ones when there is no network connection

1068879
int	chars
therefore a row that contains just one int value might contain over ten chars just to describe that one value

1068918
ant	maven
it can even be used as eclipse plugin or ant maven script

1068945
haskell	ocaml
functional programming ocaml haskell scala

1068993
mouseup	mousedown
if you re not happy with mousedown and mouseup perhaps you could just put the rectangle in a button and handle the button s click event

1068999
division	multiplication
this avoids any computationally expensive functions such as log or even multiplication or division

1069024
user-controls	elementhost
so create a wpf user-controls and set it up for virtualmode true and host that user-controls on your winforms client with an elementhost container

1069061
debian	linux
debian linux

1069190
imperative	declarative
sql is not an imperative language its a declarative language

1069223
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome safari are great including the latest version of ie i think but ie 7 does not show the scroll bar or page down

1069251
integer	unsigned
things get quite simple once you start looking at an ip address as a 32-bit unsigned integer

1069272
cvs	svn
vcscommand plugin is really helpful in this case and it woks seamlessly with svn cvs and other repositories also

1069310
children	parent
parent contains a collection of children which is large and lazy loaded

1069310
children	parent
assume session-in-view is not an option as the fetching of the children collection would only happen after the user has viewed the parent and decided to view the children

1069367
std	ostream
regarding the error ostream is part of std namespace and not part of the global namespace or the namespace the class you re refering is part of

1069371
firefox	safari
the problem is that this event occurs before document is fully loaded in firefox safari

1069376
std	ostream
you also need to change this into std ostream because c++ standard library names are within the namespace std

1069385
children	parent
i m making some assumptions about what the user is looking at but it seems like you only want to retrieve the children if the user has already viewed the parent and really wants to see the children

1069385
children	parent
why not try opening a new session and fetching the children by their parent

1069405
google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in ie firefox and google-chrome

1069405
websphere	ibm
however when i deploy it to our development portal ibm websphere it doesn t quite work in ie

1069405
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome when a user is on the detailed information page they can hit back on their browser and it loads a cached version of the search results

1069455
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the benefit of this was that you could just uninstall and reinstall a new versioning of the software and it would automatically upgrade the existing database to the latest versioning

1069455
installation	upgrade
installation upgrade and maintenance was a dream

1069455
put	get
if you can get away from having your business logic in stored procedures and put them in the entity classes then the benefit is that they re strongly typed

1069471
post	put	post	get	put	get
i have written routines to connect to a server using sockets and post put and get commands combined with cgi or php scripts and have read extensively about the ajax paradigm which i see as the way forward

1069483
hide	show
you have to put a textblock or a contentpresenter behind the textbox bound to the same value so when you hide the textbox the textblock becomes visible and show the selected value

1069520
concave	convex
the intersects method checks if the convex hull of the shape intersects with the provided shape so in the case of the concave curve this is functional but not accurate

1069573
inherited	subclassing
when using table per class or table per subclassing inherited a table for every subclassing class will be created

1069627
hide	show
i understand that i can make the property nullable or use a bool called propertyname specified to determine whether the property is serialized to xml but i would like the auto-generated examples to hide these elements in one method s definition and show them in another

1069634
int	double
note that you can use x y to initialize them disregarding of their type that s then value initialization and usually yields a proper initial value 0 for int 0.0 for double calling the default constructor for user defined types that have user declared constructors ...

1069799
hash	salt
store your passwords in a salt hash so the original text is unrecoverable and thus unbreakable by anything short of a brute force attack

1069826
postgresql	mysql
currently i m using mysql but would like to switch to postgresql later on so ideal solution would be db independent

1069892
3-tier	n-tier
in the classic 3-tier n-tier world the database is an independent storage of company information

1069904
inherited	properties
of course selector and combobox don t have all the properties that you could possibly bind to either you ll have to traverse all the way back to uielement to find most of the inherited properties

1069912
inherited	properties
best way then is just to have one class inherited the other and add the column properties

1069958
post	get
am i making any mistake in post or get method declaration or returning something wrong

1069990
versioning	upgrade
that worked great until i had to upgrade the rdp client to versioning 6 in order to access server 2008 boxes we were using versioning 4 or 5 not sure which

1070012
hide	show
you can show hide the normal way and based on the current row in focus change the innerhtml of the div in focus

1070098
vb6	vba
the easiest and most efficient way is to move your vba code to a vb6 compiled com automation addin

1070110
width	height
if you add another div inside the video wrapping around the title and define a height and width on this with overflow hidden it should standardize and stop the issue of some blocks being different height to others

1070135
int	boolean
testing for equality to true can lead to a bug at least in c in c if can be used on int types not just on boolean types and accept any non-zero value

1070135
int	boolean
i d think that an optimizing compiler should optimize away any difference because there is no logical difference assuming it s a language with a true boolean not just int type

1070141
vb.net	vb6
i have spent the last day or so writing a simple control library in vb.net to be used in an existing vb6 project

1070178
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
and what s even more annoying is that i can t get it to show up in ie6 7 or firefox or safari or opera etc

1070193
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
since the data is static and never or rarely changes you are free to take a different approach and pre-generate the 50 000+ xml-formatted records into 50 000+ static files and then serve up this static content using apache or better lighttpd or nginx

1070199
elf	coff
if the function was loaded dynamically or is an extern reference to an exported symbol what you really get is generally a pointer to some fixup code in the plt a unix elf term though the pe coff mechanism on windows is similar that then jumps to the function

1070231
jobs	cron
this question will probably only make sense if you know about the whenever gem for creating cron jobs

1070231
jobs	cron
the cron jobs still have rails_env development

1070238
hide	show
in that formula you need to check against the record count variable i forget the exact name and return a boolean in that formula to show hide the given section

1070260
jqmodal	blockui
check out blockui impromptu jqmodal plugins

1070397
switching	screens
this might sound long-winded but the two layers mean you can switching the xsl out to change the way it looks on screens whilst keeping the code that arranges what you want displayed separate

1070434
background-color	transparency
so a simple fix is to assign the a element a new attribute style background-color transparency

1070446
width	height
to get the height and width this is what i would do

1070469
int	chars
if you use types that stray from the ordinary voids structures etc you will have to do some extra work to get it right but for the average api using int s chars s etc it s fine

1070492
int	chars
most of the time when i have run across this it was the result of either data that was longer than expected trying to fit a 60 chars string into a varchar 50 field or it was a number where precision might be lost fitting a 26.5 into an int field or a 26.55 into a number field that only allows for one decimal place

1070497
hex	binary
for example the hex string 0000000a which is 00000000000000000000000000001010 in binary and 10 in decimal

1070558
gmail	hotmail
just need simple grab contacts from gmail fb hotmail etc

1070591
maven	pom.xml
if you are going to use maven for your war file builds you should be adding your dependencies inside of the pom.xml file

1070677
spaces	delimiter
obviously i can t explode the string into an array using a white spaces delimiter which has me kind of stuck

1070686
implements	extends
now if you wanted to do something like you have above you could either have both a and b extends an abstract base class or implements an interface and type both of your instance variables as either the abstract class or the interface

1070707
rss	feed
ive removed the extra quick search at the top including the rss feed div so that it validates in the w3c check but still no luck every other browser works just fine

1070715
spaces	delimiter
this is traditionally why query strings use as the delimiter and not spaces

1070724
spaces	delimiter
you can specify delimiter as spaces instead of comma and enclosure as single quote instead of double quote

1070752
jruby	mri
we are using mri but could easily switch to jruby too

1070807
for-loop	loops
the solution i ve used is to eliminate the foreach loops and just use a for-loop

1070856
opera	firefox
grids with a large number of columns are fine in firefox opera

1070899
moq	typemock
anyway rhinomocks moq and typemock do not work on .netcf

1070917
width	height
it should behave just as if it didn t have any particular positioning with width 100 and height 200px but always in the bottom right hand side of the document

1070922
listview	gridview
if your objective is an html table of strings then you can create either a listview or a gridview and databind to that

1070942
vb6	vba
it s not a feature but a thing i have seen wrong so many times in vba and vb6 parenthesis added on method calls where it will change semantics

1070950
hide	show
we ll tie a couple events to show hide #mydiv based upon the selected value of #theselectid

1070969
httphandler	httpmodule
are you managing your context with an httphandler or httpmodule

1070991
solaris	bsd
this should work for you in bsd and solaris also

1070999
post	get
without using something huge like django what s the best way to write scripts that can process get and post

1071015
pylons	web2py	pylons	cherrypy	web.py	pylons	web.py	web2py	web.py	cherrypy	web2py	cherrypy
if you really want lightweight though check out web.py cherrypy pylons and web2py

1071019
ienumerable	ienumerator
a yield return statement can be used only if the return type is ienumerator ienumerable or

1071037
stateless	stateful
the reason you can t find examples it s not best practice - it s turning something that should be stateless web services into something stateful and something that will not load balance well at all

1071040
pylons	turbogears
pylons and the new turbogears based on it

1071040
turbogears	cherrypy
cherrypy and the old turbogears based on it

1071040
pylons	cherrypy
however i think that pylons and cherrypy may be a better answer to your question

1071058
django	turbogears
i agree with paolo - django is pretty small and the way to go - but if you are not down with that i would add to turbogears to the list

1071106
kerberos	ntlm
the reason i have always assumed this is coz i always think of them as being very similar to authenticating a windows client with an ad in which case the client server will either employ ntlm or kerberos for authentication where the passwords are always encrypted

1071790
expander	grid
i m just traveling directly to the grid that contains the arrow and header content instead of trying to find the controls by name so this won t work exactly as is if you are also re-templating the expander into a different structure

wkhtmltopdf works great and uses the webkit rendering engine safari google-chrome instead of a cooked up html css parser

1071925

1072112
width	height
however i don t want to scale in the height of the element just the width

1072112
hide	show
ideally what i would like to happen is when the function is called to hide an element the object s width goes from it s original width to 0 and it s alpha drops to 0 then the reverse would happen when i tell it to show

1072249
stdout	fflush
if your programs are communicating using stdin and stdout then make sure that you are either calling fflush stdout after you write or find some way to disable standard io buffering

1072251
stdout	fflush
if you re using c calling fflush stdout whenever you want output sent will be sufficient

1072261
pull	push
i recently created a branch and started working on it making several commits and now wish to push the branch to github and be able to pull it to another cloned repository

the critical feature of java.lang.instrument i m looking for is to simply inject interceptor around method calls without changing source attributes on methods classes or rebuilding existing assemblies to inject the interception code

1072439
superclass	subclassing
i don t really care if it s a purely virtual class like an interface in java or a concrete class with actual implementational stubs for those methods in the superclass but what i want is to make it deterministically necessary that the subclassing implement certain methods of the superclass

but with better libraries like jquery its getting easier to write malicious javascript xmlhttprequest scripts that can do a two step attack a get parse the anti-xsrf viewstate query string extra cookie etc and then submit a post

1072508
apache	nginx
apache s crucial because it s the most popular one but maybe you should also look at nginx which is also deservedly popular though still a niche player compared to apache and focused on one-master many-workers processes architecture

1072515
ant	maven
it s worked great integrates nicely with our build server hudson and the few things that we needed to do that maven doesn t support or fully support we ve basically thrown in a simplified ant build xml that we attach to the build process

1072538
client-side	server-side
only if it s an exceedingly poor token that doesn t check the user session and ip address could a server-side language possibly be leveraged to retrieve it and then combine it with a client-side csrf

parcel and fundparcel...and i m trying to convert an ienumerable of the subtype to an ilist of the supertype..

1072613
disk	ram
or maybe the os will cache all the data in memory so it involves only access to ram but not to the disk

1072633
folder	directory
listing a directory will only give you the names of the files folder in question so you must manually stat each filename returned to get information about each file itself

1072654
ienumerable	ilist
so if you need to be able to iterate over the collection you take an ienumerable whereas if you need to add or remove you take an ilist

1072654
ienumerable	ilist
if you return an ienumerable then he will not know a priori that he can make an ilist out of it

1072713
firefox	safari
i only get different results in size between firefox and safari on windows when a viewbox is defined in the svg

1072713

firefox	safari
then both firefox and safari show the same behaviour

1072713
firefox	safari
as they are supposed to have transparent backgrounds in safari and firefox

1072723
pull	push
that git repo will represent your submodule but if you modify and push that submodule you will still have to pull from that git repo to the actual hg repo

1072861
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
create an nsdatecomponents object with and nscalendar and your nsdate and compare the hour components

1072917

touchescancelled	touchesended
you ll have to do some simliar work within touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent to make sure the other views get the appropriate messages

1072920
wordpress	joomla
i tried wordpress and joomla

ubuntu	linux
the more practical thing to do is to get an easy to use linux distro ubuntu suse mandriva and familiarize yourself with it while doing some programming projects

1072922
freebsd	opensolaris	opensolaris	bsd
then when you are more familiar with how things work so you can manage to solve issues by yourself with ease and to get a feeling about a different flavor of os try opensolaris nexenta or some bsd flavor for instance freebsd

1072939
ubuntu	debian
the major distros ubuntu debian fedora suse and many others should all have a good variety of c c++ perl development tools available because c c++ perl apps are a core part of pretty much every distribution

maven	pom.xml
but when i update my maven dependencies i get only the jar and pom.xml from the repository

1072981

it would be preferable if it was generic and i didnt need to copy the post and get data by hand

1073100

1073147

just show hide with jquery that

1073150
hide	show
if you use javascript to show and hide the controls then because it s on the client side you would not have to postback the form and could do server side validation when the save button is clicked

1073157
free	malloc
is it a portable behaviour of stdlib malloc and free or am i looking for trouble

1073157
free	malloc
the question is about the malloc 0 + free combination not the value of ptr

1073161
ubuntu	linux
these are both capable systems but differ somewhat in their userspace architecture the tooling for the desktop environment and default configuration for system security works a bit differently on ubuntu than it does on most other linux or unix flavours but this is of little relevance to development

1073161
vim	emacs
most unix programming can be accomplished quite effectively with a programmer s editor such as vim or emacs both of which come in text mode and windowing flavours

1073169
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

set	bag
is this a case where i should use set over bag

1073239
set	bag
i ve read up a little on bag vs set and to me it seems like set perhaps would solve my unique row issue but still as this is just a join table my biggest concern is to be able to delete connection and remove a contactinfo from a group

1073245
unix	bsd
its a unix bsd based os but with a really slick user interface over the top

1073251
typhoeus	eventmachine
i think it works better with other libraries like typhoeus typhoeus or if you re usning eventmachine em-http-request they both allow multi-request and you should be able to send more than 2 to the same domain at least it does with ubuntu

1073276
getter	setter
next apple for good reasons recommends against using getter setter in your init dealloc

1073276
super	self
next after super dealloc your object is destroyed so you cannot reference self and hence your ivars after that so your dealloc should look like

1073276
getter	setter
further as above apple recommends you should not use setter or getter in your dealloc routine so your deallocation would initially look like

min	max
and max t.transaction_number - min t.transaction_number 4

1073591
goto	break
the one advantage that ab using do break while or while break for this purpose has over goto is that you are guaranteed not to be jumping above the construct -- goto can be used to jump to a label earlier within the same function

1073604
websphere	ibm
this is a bit similar to some ibm rational modeling tools for websphere

1073634
pow	math.h	pow	sqrt	math.h	sqrt
alternatively to using the pow function you could simply define a square function and use the sqrt function in math.h which would probably improve performance a bit

1073646
filesystems	ntfs
the hard drive uses ntfs though i d appreciate knowing how it s done on other filesystems as well

1073671
pascal	delphi
the excellent delphi jedi project has converted most of the windows api header files into delphi pascal

1073681
goto	break
also if you are working to strict coding standards yes goto is likely to be forbidden but often so are break and continue so the loop is not necessarily a workaround for that

1073682
put	get
put simply you can t get the value of the sun.os.patch.level property without throwing an accesscontrolexception

1073692
post	get
i would presume it was get head and post but was just wanting to double-check

1073716
inherited	properties
also the entity diagram seems to require you to add properties to inherited classes just to be able to use them for associations between classes

1073738
getter	setter
it is fine but proper as3 practice is to use the for only internal private protected variables and then write getter and setter without the

1073740
innodb	myisam
make sure you have an index on code if your table is innodb and id is a primary key or on code id if your table is myisam or id is not a primary key

1073760
getter	setter
besides that a property is nothing else than a getter and a setter method from a design perspective a property should never contain any computations other than initializing or validation eg

1073770
tabcontrol	tabitem
is there any way to have to tabcontrol take the size of the largest tab item well actually the tabitem s content

1073770
width	height
since the tabcontrol has no specific size assigned it should autosize it does that correctly but when you switch tabs it automatically resizes itself to the height and width of the contents of the currently selected tab

1073800
hide	show
need to find the best way to selectively show and hide sections divs etc on clicking or changing a value of a control but not having to post back javascript

integer	unsigned
if n_half is a positive or unsigned integer it halves it

1073955
integer	unsigned
use single-letter prefixes or single letter + numbers for integer types to stop the names getting too unmanageable so maybe u8 for 1-byte unsigned integer a for array r for struct as in record

for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined

1074084
superclass	subclassing
most ides can be configured to show a warning if you refer to a superclass constant via a subclassing and i d guess static analysis tools like findbugs can do it too

1074093
ant	maven
i ve got an ant task using the maven task set up to automatically download all my java apps dependencies and consolidate them into a lib directory but i cant see a way to tell intellij to basically treat everything in that dir as an external lib - i have to manually add them all to my project

int	double
by doing the division by a double amount 2.0 you end up doing floating point division instead of int division

1074273
fgets	fgetc
perhaps instead of fgets one should use fgetc since fgets captures through to the newline

1074278
hide	show
remove the margin from the container div add a wrapper div with the same margin value but as a padding attribute and simply show hide the container div

icefaces	woodstock
at least not as mainstream as icefaces woodstock and the other jsf components

1074359

check whether your php configuration has magic_quotes_gpc activated in such case the php server automatically adds slashes to get post cookie values.

multiplying	subtract
multiplying by 31 is fast because the jit can convert it to a shift left by 5 bits and a subtract

1074544
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
however runtimeexception were supposed to be programming errors that weren t supposed to be handled directly - such as nullpointerexception which only occur if methods take invalid arguments or don t check for such cases directly

1074556
folder	directory
i need to monitor and report on all changes folder and directory added permissions changed registry entries added that are made during the installation of a software program

1074559
button	checkbox
if you want the user to click on a button to perform the action then what you need to handle is the click event of the button not the checkbox changed event.

1074559
button	checkbox
when the button is clicked just go through all rows of your datagridview and perform an action on rows with a checked checkbox

1074576
mouse	keyboard
still it would allow you to attach a second keyboard to this one and if this second keyboard has a build-in mouse or if you add an usb hub then two people could work at the same time

1074577
ready	each
we want to be able to assign build qualities to each branch dev - ready for test.

1074614
ubuntu	centos
i ve been getting more and more comfortable using vi on a daily basis but one thing that bothers me is that when i use it on ubuntu it behaves differently than when i use it on centos and probably other places

1074614
ubuntu	centos
in centos insert mode there is a big bold notice at the bottom that i m in insert mode but in ubuntu there is no notice so i can never tell which mode i m in

1074614
ubuntu	centos
in centos insert mode i can use the backspace key and it will delete the character that is before the cursor but in ubuntu i just hear a beep sound and nothing happens

1074678
wordpress	joomla
i tried wordpress and joomla

1074689
mouse	keyboard
there s a company adesso that makes some nice products that integrate mouse and keyboard functionality into one

1074732
imperative	declarative
msbuild property evaluation is pretty complex since it mixes declarative and imperative styles

1074753
hash	md5
is there a reason you don t want to do something like an md5 hash of the two files and compare the results - here is an example of some code that seems pretty common

1074753
hash	md5
how do i generate a hexadecimal md5 hash

1074761
inherited	properties
i believe i need to create a custom eventargs class that inherited from eventargs and has my custom properties

1074783
boost	stl
what parts of stl no boost or tr1 please people still commonly use in their professional as well as personal environments if any

1074788
junit	jmockit
i regularly run junit tests that use jmockit with and without the -javaagent jvm argument in debug mode and never had any issues

1074789
width	height
set the width and height properties to auto

1074808
post	get
this really becomes a problem is say i am trying to get a count of all post items for a room and i want that method on the room class

1074815
disk	ram
if it s from l2 it takes a while longer if it s in ram then it s longer still and finally if it s on disk it s a huge time

1074818
int	double
although the hash of the double are int the double could mess up the hash

1074845
direct3d	gdi
alternatives would as you mentioned be direct3d or you could consider regular gdi with system calls

1074845
direct3d	gdi
gdi can be relatively easy once you figure out the basics direct3d is a bit more complex

1074877
temporary	tablespace
that means you need to store these values somewhere be it memory temporary tablespace or a permanent tablespace

1074879
doxygen	docset
my problem is that when i create the documentation no matter how i modify my doxygen config file exclude_parameters etc... the first time it creates the docset for the documentation it is fine

1074936
cvs	rcs
cvs was originally a set of scripts over the file-oriented rcs and it never escaped its history

1074936
cvs	rcs
a cvs repository is a collection of rcs files arranged in the directory structure you want when it s checked out plus some lock directories

1074936
cvs	rcs
so no the cvs revision of a file is the rcs revision in the repository and has nothing to do with any other revision number

1074959
jsfl	fla
if you want to code against a fla the most straightforward method would be to use jsfl - it s just javascript for controlling the flash ide

1074971
maven	pom.xml
some jars that can t be added due to license reasons have a pom.xml entry in the maven central repo

1074972
post	get
or if it s just a search result try to live without the post and use a get which also has other advantages

1074987
maven	pom.xml
the referenced jars aren t available on the maven2 central repository so unless you have an additional repository declaration in your pom.xml or an active profile in your settings maven will not know where to obtain the artifacts from

1074987
nexus	artifactory
another alternative is to use a maven repository manager like nexus or artifactory to manage maven s interactions with external repositories though that is almost certainly too much information if you re just starting out

1075011
xslt	relaxng
if you are then you might want to fit in with xhtml xslt svg xproc relaxng and the rest

1075026
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentexception and argumentnullexception are both used for validating arguments eg

1075037
width	height
the proportions of the width height are the same as the ones in the original image

1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i personally use argumentexception or argumentnullexception in conjunction with testing parameters passed to routines like this

1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local variables

1075127
put	get
i m kind of a javascript noob and i m trying to use the new geolocation api in firefox 3.5 to get an estimation of the user s coordinates and put that into a text box in a form

1075139
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a wpf tabcontrol that has a couple of buttons in the tabitem header

1075148
cpython	ironpython
although for cpython this is the address of the object this is not guaranteed i believe and may be different on other implementations like ironpython

1075150
coalesce	isnull
it should be noted that with two arguments isnull works the same as coalesce which you could use if you have a few values to test - coalesce in_my_field1 otherval null

1075151
rss	feed
i ve written an rss feed parser using nsxmlparser in under half an hour

1075175
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tested it on ie 6 8 firefox 3.0 google-chrome safari and they work

1075184
free	malloc
others have answered the question as written but i d like to suggest sticking with malloc free for such allocations

1075184
free	malloc
if you know that you just need an arbitrary block of memory using malloc and free is perfectly reasonable

1075232
persistent	transient
when nhibernate checks whether the child is transient the trigger responds that it is transient and a save happens which marks the child as persistent

1075247
serializable	deserialization
i don t want to serializable the java object implementations in the data file itself i just want a way to look up the proper classfile on deserialization

1075250
int	chars
for subsequent comparison the system should use this hash being an int or a long the comparison should be a single operation rather than iterating through each chars of the string until a mismatch is found

1075271
postgresql	mysql
in mysql postgresql sql server try running

1075277
bmp	png
also note that without compression also image size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless compression you can choose png

1075327
tabcontrol	tabitem
however we d have to set that on each tab so instead we can create a style for the tabitem in the tabcontrol like so

1075340
int	chars
this will work fine up to 6 chars in a 32-bit int

1075341
freemarker	velocity
the same will apply when using velocity and freemarker

1075363
x86	64bit
is there a way to execute a .net application compiled under anycpu as a 32-bit application when running in a 64bit windows environment without recompiling as x86

1075367
accessor	properties
if you look at the properties accessor in the generated code in settings.cs you ll see that they re marked with an attribute containing the default value of the setting that s in your app.config file. if you change a setting by editing the app.config file directly settings.cs won t be updated but the new value will still be used by your program when you run it because app.config gets copied to foo.exe.config at compile time

1075391
jobs	cron
we have several cron jobs that ftp proxy logs to a centralized server

1075423
hide	show
in the past the way i ve handled this is to have the user not leave the login page and have an asp.net panel show itself with the oh hey you need to change your password bit and hide the rest of the page

1075423
post	get
if i have it post to another action view then i run the risk of either having to log in the user or have the change password page be not protected by authentication since unlike the change password bit you get provided with i don t want them to be authenticated when they see the page

1075426
websphere	ibm
ibm seems to frequently reorganize its website so the above link might not work if you check back here after a long while but the supportpac can be found easily by doing a search for saveqmgr on the websphere mq page

1075444
free	malloc
you should also take care of declaring such large arrays if you need big arrays you should use malloc free otherwise you will exhaust your stack

1075499
int	chars
if you really want to avoid the lookup and just unse auto-increment you can create a function that turns an int into a string of seemingly-random chars with the ability to convert back

1075518
jobs	cron
your cron jobs should tell that they re finished

1075518
jobs	cron
we have our cron jobs that transport files just write an empty filename.finished after it s transferred the filename

1075565
post	get
maybe someone else can post some better information on it but here s a link to one approach to get you started

1075599
inherited	properties
it s a way to implement properties inherited

1075684
width	height
i want to have an anchor with a specific height and width

1075706
udp	tcp
my program runs fine locally but overseas sites are having issues and i am wondering if sql might be using a tcp or udp port that is still blocked

1075739
icmp	tcp
as far as i understand your question you are asking whether icmp ping packet which returns guarantees you can open a connection on a particular tcp port

1075784
addclass	removeclass
following that with yet another operator and passing that operator the string removeclass or addclass gets you the removeclass or addclass jquery method

1075824
realloc	malloc
realloc should be used for memory allocated with malloc - like functions

1075854
rss	feed
i ve used squid before to reduce load on dynamically-created rss feed and it worked quite well

1075860
post	get
i found this post which looks similar but can t quite get it to work with my approach because i need to deserialize an interface which is xmlserializable

1075863
inherited	properties
i m writing a custom .net data provider modeled on sqlclient and have to implement the isnullable properties in my parameter class which inherited from dbparameter

1075870
addclass	removeclass
addclass removeclass step

1075870
addclass	removeclass
again based on n it will either call the addclass or the removeclass method passing it the appropriate class name

1075889
put	get
put as an answer to get the formatting of the code..

1075897
realloc	malloc
clarification you cannot realloc part of allocated memory - only the whole malloc ed chunk

1075902
hide	show
i am using a datagrid in expression blend but i just need to show only the registries and hide the columnheader

1075981
inherited	properties
as multi-table inherited defines a properties on the parent instance to access a child instance this is all pretty straight forward

1076002
getter	setter
use the property - any logic that may be encapsulated within the setter and getter ought to apply even within the class itself

1076002
getter	setter
if there is no logic within the getter and setter it is still not safe to use the fields themselves because if at any point you wish to add logic around the access to those fields you will have to refactor much more

1076014
post	get
the only ways to pass this data would be get post values cookies flat file or storing the data to the database

1076020
accessor	properties
while in this particular example it really doesn t make much of a difference the get set accessor offer the ability to do a bit more work when grabbing a properties

1076020
accessor	properties
for example many of our properties get accessor perform some lookup within a more complex data structure or set default values if nothing has been defined

1076030
post	get
the only difference i see is that getjson performs a get request instead of a post

1076041
subtraction	addition
this will allow you to perform operations on monetary values - not only basic addition subtraction and so forth but possibly also currency conversions between usd and say euro

1076052
post	get
the simpler way will be to use post rediret get pattern

1076056
freemarker	velocity
perhaps you should be using a template engine freemarker velocity stringtemplate etc... instead of jsps

1076108
slideup	slidedown
how about the slidedown and slideup methods

1076133
folder	directory
you can set webcontent as the content directory main java and main resources as java source folder and you can add the jars from libs to the build path or simply put them in the webcontent web-inf lib directory

1076185
width	height
override the set height and set width functions in the parent mc you could do scalex and scaley as well

1076185
width	height
set the scalex for width or scaley for height of the child mc to 1. scalex width or 1. scaley height

1076241
inherited	properties
also since it is an inherited properties you can just set the attachedproperty directly on the tabitems you don t need to assign it specifically to the content

1076283
youtube	vimeo
i m not sure about vimeo but the youtube player has a javascript api and when you enable it the player will call a javascript function onyoutubeplayerready when the player is loaded and ready

1076309
width	height
given a randomn image how can i scale it down so it is below a certain pixel height width while not distorting the images

1076326
pop-up	dialog
select the project in vss - right ckick on the project and pick show history - in the dialog that pop-up select the version you want and then click get

1076350
icomparable	compareto
i wrote the method compareto in the myobj class per the icomparable interface but when i use the it returns false when it should be true

1076384
portrait	landscape
in stating the as we run the app it should be in the landscape mode and in this mode if we orientate the phone in 90 angle than it should play some video than problem comes video play by default in the landscape mode but we need it in the portrait mode than for playing video in the portrait mode we put the code

1076385
ienumerable	iqueryable
i thought iqueryable was derrived from ienumerable so why can t i access the results of my query like a collection of records

gridview	sqldatasource
working on setting up a sqldatasource connecting mysql database to a asp .net gridview

kerberos	ntlm
yet how should i go about securing the application if we all know that kerberos is superior to ntlm

1076632
getter	setter
do you have getter setter for the property unvanid

1076652
equals	compareto
am i correct in assuming that if you have an object that is contained inside a java set or as a key in a map for that matter any fields that are used to determine identity or relation via hashcode equals compareto etc. cannot be changed without causing unspecified behavior for operations on the collection

1076666
width	height
cliprectangle x 128 y 290 width 250 height 200

1076725
scapy	libpcap
it was written by the author of pypcap a different libpcap wrapper but it shouldn t be too difficult to get it working with pcapy to see if it s faster for your purposes than scapy

1076764
many-to-many	one-to-many
suppose i have a one-to-many or many-to-many association between entities person and event such that a person class in java contains a

1076798
metaclass	subclassing
if you want to make absolutely sure that subclassing of a override size you could use a metaclass for a that will raise an error when a subclassing does not override it note that a is a new-style class here

1076818
postgresql	mysql
the requirements for the project i m working seem to point to using both a relational database postgresql mysql in combination with a key-value store hbase cassandra

1076820
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot view the error from my computer on firefox ie and google-chrome but yet i see the error up top when browsing from another computer s browser

1076833
chunked	transfer-encoding
not quite sure how to do this in asp.net haven t tried it before but in general if the http client supports http v1.1 as indicated by the version of its request the server can send a transfer-encoding response header that specifies chunked and then send the response data using multiple data blocks as they become available

1076866
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
did not work on safari 3 firefox and opera ie is not enable to draw svg

1076912
777	tmp
tmp is usually 777 rwxrwxrwx

1076920
mouse	keyboard
the job of gtk_main is pump events -- it detects low-level events such as keyboard mouse input and os timers converts them to higher-level events and passes those onto the application code

1076944
short	base
if you want short urls and predictability is not a concern you can convert the auto-incrementing id to a higher base

1077008
width	height
you can get pretty in depth with the actual layout of the grid column row spanning width height etc

1077056
profiling	debugging
it is freeware and very good for quick debugging and profiling

1077072
profiler	aqtime
my profiler list includes ants dottrace and aqtime

1077078
updatepanel	ascx
my ascx control inside a container updatepanel does a full page refresh when one of the controls inside it is clicked

1077085
width	height
create a subclass of movieclip and override the get and set methods for width and height

1077085
factors	matrix
since you are using a matrix override the get and set matrix functions set the scaling factors with your new functions and set them to not scale before calling super

1077085
width	height
use scalex scaley instead for getting the width height and multiply by the width and height values for 0 rotation 1.0 scale

1077089
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
after installing you can use mysql in the standard .net way using mysqlconnection mysqlcommand mysqldatareader and so on

1077103
outputstream	inputstream
you d want to get the blob as an inputstream and dump its contents to the outputstream

1077106
getter	setter
for whatever reason javascript getter setter for custom objects seem to work with any browser but ie

1077145
draggable	droppable
here is a example that does some other thing but makes use of droppable and draggable objects maybe it can help you understand how it works

1077157
ant	buildr
then i would create build targets for all these script in ant nant buildr etc

1077207
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
btree sortedlist inserting special nodes in the sorteddictionary could all be useful

1077228
width	height
your margin-top + height 24px + 1px 25px and your margin-left + width 16px + 9px 25px

1077233
width	height
that makes that if you don t define the width and height of the pictures explicitly it becomes 25x25px

1077233
width	height
fix it by adding width 24 and height 16 to your images

1077281
win64	windows
technical quibble you can avoid com but you can t avoid interop twain is a native win32 or win64 dll that is not part of windows proper and is unknown to the clr so at the bottom either in your code or the component you use there are interop calls to unmanaged code

1077282
lua	scheme
my palm has a lua implementation that allows you to do reasonable guis a fairly useless old python 1.5 a superb forth which allows you to produce compiled apps and a scheme that allows for copmlete gui dev

1077319
width	margin
also without setting an explicit width the auto margin trick doesn t work too great

1077325
getter	setter
resig s post references his env.js implementation being the first time he uses the getter and setter methodology you are looking for

1077325
getter	setter
to handle browser compatibility as well as focusing on an aspect that javascript does very well use closures for your getter and setter methods to protect object properties

1077337
google-chrome	safari
i cannot make any claims about the efficiency of safari s webkit konqueror s kjs ie s proprietary engine or google-chrome s v8

1077344
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if you need to block threads refer to the manualresetevent and autoresetevent classes

1077359
puts	gets
however i ve run into a snag when trying to query mbeans for specific caches within a cluster which is where i can find stats about total number of gets puts average time for each etc

1077377
mouse	keyboard
using the keyboard to browse through large source code is much easier than manually scrolling through text highlighting text and fumbling through an ide with a mouse

1077380
awt	swing
i haven t tried it before but swing is built on top of awt and the robot class had a way of sampling specific pixels in the awt

1077400
pop-up	dialog
the tooltips created are not linked to the dialog pop-up directly - they re not created as child widgets of the pop-up

1077405
width	height
if the width and height are set using inline styles including those created by javascript you can override them by using the

1077428
mouse	keyboard
currently i could use mouse click to choose the selection i d like to add keyboard control to allow autocomplete control

1077454
hash	salt
in sites i have previously created i made use of a user_id and a salt hash of the user s password

1077454
hash	salt
the primary reason i used two fields to authenticate a user is because it saved me the trouble of adding another table and thus complicating the database design. with the user_id also being stored in the cookie i could do an indexed look-up in users table and efficiently match the salt hash to the user

1077477
ant	maven
for me it turned surprised when the experienced programming talk about the difficulties of maven when i saw ant in some project maven showed me a miracle

1077484
ant	maven
i think maven suffers from a relatively high barrier to entry compared to tools like ant

1077488
perl	tcl
- and has the theoretical advantage that it can also wrap c or c++ code for use from java perl tcl etc -- but if you only care about python it s hard to see anything to make it stand out

1077489
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest organizes a web application into resources like a twitter user or a flickr image and then uses the http verbs of post put get and delete to create update read and delete those resources

1077489
put	get
likewise if you use a restful web service to update your twitter account information you can put the new information as many times as it takes in order to get confirmation from the web service

1077492
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
online example rendered neatly in firefox google-chrome safari and ie

1077513
metaclass	subclassing
of course this way you ll get the error only when an instance of a subclassing of a which doesn t override size actually tries to use self.size the metaclass approach has the advantage of giving the error earlier when an errant subclassing of a is created

1077520
ant	maven
so i can see why people would backoff from maven coming from ant for example

1077520
ant	maven
maven for an ant user has a lot of magic properties and behavior that creates an uncomfortable aura of uncertainty that does not sit very well with the typical build master paranoia we get when we start deploying apps to client and want stable versionning

1077520
ant	maven
also if maven is not acting the way you want you can always revert to ant and then integrate in the maven bigger picture

1077521
firefox	safari
i get this on firefox 3.5 and safari 4

1077547
ant	maven
in my experience the introduction of maven to projects that were previously built with ant has invariably created more problems than it solved

1077547
ant	maven
in one case maven started to take up so much of our time that we eventually migrated back to ant again

1077581
treemap	treeset
but it d be fatal inside a treeset treemap

1077588
websphere	ibm
i have a page that gathers environment status from a couple of ibm websphere servers using iframes similar to this

1077599
unix	bsd
- to mark s repeated assertion that file handles just can t be passed around between running processes -- this is simply not true in real modern operating systems such as oh say unix free bsd variants macosx and linux included -- hmmm i wonder what os s are left out of this list..

1077627
ant	maven
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known

1077627
ant	maven
most existing projects do not conform to maven s convention and hence many projects are simply not bothered to spend the effort to migrate their already well-crafted ant build system into another especially if maven does not offer anything that their ant build can already do

1077643
ant	maven
i switched an ant build over to maven because i had a whole slew of projects with interdependencies

1077643
maven	cargo
like this guide to using cargo starting external process during integration testing in maven which i found not from the maven-cargo plugin website but just because i happened to be trolling through stackoverflow

1077645
width	margin
save the hassle and do margin auto along with the set width

1077682
accessor	ivar
if you explicitly want to access an ivar the right thing to do is to make it an accessor

1077684
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested it on my end on google-chrome firefox and ie unless you define the button itself it will maintain the default size

1077768
postgresql	mysql
for your purposes the sqlite version that comes with mono see here seems perfect no much how wonderful postgresql or i guess even mysql

1077859
hide	show
i see this all over the web but was wondering if anyone has the javascript code for the easiest way to show input value on blur but hide in on focus

1077869
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tested this with firefox 2 firefox 3 opera 9 opera 10 google-chrome safari ie6 ie7 ie8 even wget

pdfsharp	itext
yes adding security to a pdf which stops people from being able to edit it is quite easy using a variety of different pdf toolkits itext pdfsharp quick pdf library etc

1077979
scrollable	panels
this panels allows the user to type into the search box to control the items of the scrollable checkbox list in real time

1078006
vim	emacs
there maybe more that i don t know of and it s fully possible that vim and emacs have some sort of plugins for this

1078013
profiler	yourkit
an option would be to use a profiler like yourkit switch makes a pretty good stab at calculating the retained size of a reference

cvs	svn
if you pretend its just a more modern svn or cvs you ll get frustrated by the lack of improvement in your coding workflow and you ll become annoyed by the multitude of commands

1078062
tortoisegit	svn
all the typical guis that i ve seen eclipsesvn tortoisegit svn all preselect your recent changes as being part of the commit you re about to make whether those changes are ready to be committed or not

1078069
python-mode	ropemacs
from what i understand python-mode has the several dependencies so i need to install rope ropemode and ropemacs

1078088
width	height
width height will change as you rotate the clip

1078109
int	chars
i think caching in the worst-case hit every value couldn t take up more than 250kb 17576 possible values sizeof int 4 + sizeof chars 3 + string overhead 2

1078205
super	implements
it s not particularly super safe but active directory is usually implements with lockout after a few bad attempts so that s no so bad

1078218
int	double
count is an int x is a double

1078237
crypt	md5
openldap offers crypt md5 smd5 ssha and sha according to my man page

openldap for example supports the schemes salt sha1 crypt os dependent md5 salt md5 and sha1

1078244
kerberos	ldap
ldap comes in handy when you have to connect different clients to a central authentication system proprietary software email servers or if you have to integrate it into some kerberos or sasl authentication scenario

1078307
getter	setter
i also tried jquery.extend with a simple value getter setter object on the air.urlloader but no success

1078323
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but i was wondering the reason why google-chrome and safari btw completely refuses to render this page works 100 ie and firefox

1078324
maven	m2e
all modern ide s eclipse only with 3rd party plug-ins m2e or q for eclipse support importing maven projects directly so you do not have to adapt anything

1078332
versioning	upgrade
i don t see what this new versioning offers to justify upgrading and working through possible issues after the upgrade

1078341
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
maybe because safari and google-chrome are using webkit to render webpage but firefox uses gecko and ie trident

1078352
google-chrome	safari
i believe it s because you re using a very old and tag and i don t think webkit the rendered in safari and google-chrome handle that tag

1078373
google-chrome	safari
fix the issues and it should render correctly in google-chrome and safari

1078381
versioning	upgrade
if anything upgrade for the bug fixes but make sure to check compatibility a few things have changed in this versioning goto namespaces parameter parsing mhash etc...

1078401
uitableview	nsindexpath
i have overloaded - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

1078451
width	height
i also tried setting the height and width to 0 or setting visibility to hidden or collapse but none of those worked

1078451
google-chrome	firefox
the solution should at least be supported in ie6 up firefox 2 up and google-chrome latest

1078466
webkit	gecko
webkit is stricter than gecko

1078470
hide	show
you can either set class hideme to hide your control or class showme to show your control

1078491
hide	show
you can set the display to none if you want to hide the element and display to block or inline if you want to show them

1078501
google-chrome	firefox
i ve implemented functionality that has been tested to work in internet explorer 6 7 8 firefox and google-chrome but what about other browsers

1078516
post	get
hi if you use get method instead of post then we can t the form filed values

1078520
ubuntu	linux
my server being linux only ubuntu 8.04 lts i am wondering if installing mono in place of the .net framework is a good idea for production use

1078532
put	get
get webclient to do the work for you with its downloadfile method which will put the data directly into a file

1078624

1078677
debian	linux
i ve a question about the memory management in c and gcc 4.3.3 under debian gnu linux

1078680
getter	setter
i was hoping to pass in the checkbox s checked getter setter as follows

1078680
getter	setter
i m fairly certain that the checkbox getter setter returns a bool

1078690
free	malloc
if you ll have additional malloc calls after the free - chances are that the old contents will be lost

1078705
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
use the touchesbegan withevent and touchesmoved withevent methods

1078718
getter	setter
my dto data transfer object which is simplecar.java contains the variables id type color and their respective setter getter

1078743
nginx	cherokee	nginx	lighttpd	fastcgi	scgi	cherokee	lighttpd
if instead you are having to use fastcgi scgi or ajp adapters for a server such as lighttpd nginx or cherokee then you need to use flup package to provide a bridge between those language agnostic interfaces and wsgi

1078746
ubuntu	centos
in centos vi is an alias for a different program vim but in recent versions of ubuntu vi means just vi not vim

1078774
hibernate	gilead
if you are talking about gwt rpc returning model objects from the server such as hibernate objects gilead as mentioned elsewhere is probably worth looking at - though i ve never had any personal experience

1078781
cpu	processors
also it might be worth seeing if you can check the cpu flags as there will either be the intel vmx flag or the amd svm flag if the processors supports virtualisation extensions

1078785
folder	directory
if your page for example default.htm lies inside the virtual directory website1 then you can create a folder for images say images and can point to an image inside the images directory by using images image1.jpg

1078787
folder	directory
put the files in a directory that is in the same folder the html file is in

1078807
jobs	cron
by the way i m using windows pycron for my cron jobs

1078838
superclass	subclassing
so does that mean the superclass should have those attributes and methods even if all the subclassing don t need them or do i define them on the subclassing especially for attributes like variant where each subclassing has it s own list of valid values

1078838
superclass	subclassing
or given that i then end up putting all the attributes and methods on the superclass as most are shared between at least a couple of the drink types i wonder what was the point in subclassing at all

1078839
width	height
i also had to change my webpart to derive from microsoft.sharepoint.webpartpages.webpart with the attendant changes to how i handle the width and height of my webpart

1078899
floating-point	integer
snufflesmodel has integer coordinates but snufflessprite has floating-point ones

1078941
pdfsharp	migradoc
there is this migradoc stuff which comes with pdfsharp but i hardly found any proper doc faq for it

1078969
width	height
i have used jquery for a small animation work a table #photos contains 9 photos and i would like to increase the width and height using the animate function on mouseover

1078997
profiling	debugging
just like with debugging profiling is a task best done by the perl interpreter itself

1079006
getter	setter
then you could access the getter setter of your singleton from anywhere in your program

1079008
valgrind	gprof
using gprof valgrind oprofile .

1079062
post	get
see the android developers page on data storage to get started i d post a link but apparently i m only allowed one link in my post

1079192
hash	md5
i guess this is almost a another question but since i am using the result to generate a cache key string would it make sense to use a crytographic hash function like md5 or just use the string representation of this int

1079208
free	malloc
free and malloc are not from gcc

1079208
free	malloc
i particular after you use free you are releasing the memory block malloc gave you

1079219
jobs	cron
i will say that the framework i created for my own use i generally found that cron jobs needed enough different processing that creating dedicated controllers made more sense than trying to hang them on the outside of existing controllers

1079239
junit	mockito
this is my testing class i m using junit 4 and mockito

1079251
multiplying	add
if the order is important you can instead multiplying by a prime number and add

1079264
mockito	jmock
jmock doesn t do anything special for final classes other than rely on the jdave library to unfinalize everything in the jvm so you could experiment with using jdave s unfinalizer and see if mockito will then mock it

1079275
min	max	minimum	max
maximum and minimum referred to getting the max and min id when grouped by date and account_id

1079293
versioning	upgrade
i am using nant to get latest versioning of source upgrade versioning of the libraries and application build the application build the setups.

1079329
mouseover	mouseout
i originally started using the .live method with mouseover and mouseout however this has massive cpu implications when moving the mouse over the parts of the page without the grid as the event is delegated to the document mouseover

1079342
put	get
however when i put exactly the same expression in the .hgignore file i get this

1079373
nginx	lighttpd
you could use a different web server such as lighttpd or nginx

1079379
post	get
it would be easy to query for example all post with a certain tag but how could i get all the post that has a list of tags

1079379
post	get
another thing that may be more difficult is having a post get the post that have tags in common ordered by the number of common tags so i could get similar post to this one in some way

1079419
int	chars
if you wish to avoid unsafe code then you can use bit masking techniques to pull out individual bits from int and chars if dealing with strings with not too much extra hassle

1079441
pop-up	dialog
alternatively you can use a javascript framework which has many other styles of modal dialog which are equally if not more useful than the ajax modal pop-up extender

1079453
folder	directory
replace that folder with a file of the same name minus .xpi if that s part of the name and inside the file place the full path to your source directory of the add-on

1079475
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to pop-up dialog from run method it gives me exception that looper.prepare not called when i call the same method i dont get any exception but there is no pop-up dialog shown on the console

1079538
titlebar	window
the titlebar is customizeable on the command-line and i intend to allow window positioning too

1079626
gridview	linqdatasource
i drop a linqdatasource and a gridview on a page enable update and delete for both and i m on my merry way

1079671
getter	setter
is there a maven plugin that will automatically generate setter and getter with the corresponding javadocs

1079716
icu	gettext
i would highly recommend using icu instead of gettext and the locale stuff offered by the standard library if you are developing a commercial application

1079767
getter	setter	public	protected
i would recommend having a disposed property on the base class with a public getter and a protected setter

1079784
post	get
i suggest you start doing this and post a question when you get stuck

1079808
dlsym	dlopen
to avoid this i have replaced the api calls with function pointers obtained using dlsym and dlopen

1079808
dlsym	dlopen
am i missing something while using dlsym and dlopen

1079814
int	chars
also note that i use an int in the loop in main just to be able to iterate over the whole range of unsigned chars

1079830
inherited	properties
you would check at runtime for the existence of methods or properties that are required to fulfill your needs regardless of inherited hierarchies

1079919
getter	setter
when an event is dispatchen the main class either does something or retrives a variable or sets a variable in the loaded swf with the getter or setter function

1079929
calloc	malloc
you could also use calloc instead of malloc since calloc gives you zeroed memory

1079940
onresume	onpause
in any case you ll definitely want to move the acquire and release methods into onresume and onpause respectively

1079940
onresume	onpause
your best bet is to construct the wakelock in oncreate as you have acquire the lock in onresume and release it in onpause including the call to isheld

1079944
nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception
other methods that attempt to use _comobject after dispose will get a nullreferenceexception or ideally those methods would check the _comobject field and throw objectdisposedexception

1079978
vsts	tfs
in tfs 2005 and when you open from the client side from vsts the source control explorer and you create a workspace

1080017
post	get
so assuming you do want to post instead of get your .ajax call might look like this

1080019
g++	gcc
any .l files will get passed through flex and gcc any .y files will get passed through bison and g++ and any .cpp files through just g++

1080047
puts	gets
three specific issues i can think of are efficiency of your gets and puts write contention and exploding indexes

1080049
int	chars
in this case the chars are int values obtained by calling integer.parseint

1080065
put	get
i d say that the workflow of sign up get e-mail click on link in e-mail is now fairly ubiquitous and wouldn t put off the majority of users

1080103
versioning	upgrade
the force is to upgrade older versioning

1080110
int	boolean
how does the industry refer to storing mulitple boolean value state in one int

1080136
bitarray	bitset
bitset or bitarray

1080166
opera	firefox
for me your code works without problems in ie6 firefox 3.0.11 and opera 9.64

1080274
uitableview	uisearchbar
i ve got a uitableview with a uisearchbar as the tableviews.tableheaderview

1080331
post	get
as lavinio said above post the complete exception and maybe you ll get some help

1080331
post	put
you should put a try catch block around the code having the problem catch the exception in for instance ex then post the result of ex.tostring

1080381
bufferedreader	gzipinputstream
i though of creating my class which extends the reader or bufferedreader class of java and use gzipinputstream as one of its variable

1080388
sorting	grouping
edit your grouping and go to the sorting tab

1080510
versioning	upgrade
you should be on the very latest versioning of ruby on rails and upgrade frequently

1080532
firefox	safari
both safari mac and firefox mac move cursor at the very beginning when iâ m pressing the arrow up key

1080553
post	put
still interested in any improvements on this there may be a bit too much code to post really so just put some snippets in that hopefully illuminates

1080628
g++	gcc
cc gcc -m32 cxx g++ -m32 linux32 rpmbuild -bb -target i586 package.spec

1080640
glut	sdl
i could try using glut or sdl but i m not sure i want to include those as dependencies.

1080644
subtraction	addition
i d like to have a class a with a for example sortedlist collection srtdlst property and inside this class a allow the addition or subtraction of srtdlst items

1080644
subtract	add
but in a instance of the class a only allow to get or set the content of the items not to add new items or subtract the existing ones

1080677
width	height
this will make the height and width of the actual image 0 but will expand the box to fill the size of the image with padding

1080685
printf	atoi
but what i recommend you do is atoi their input and then printf cmd levelplayer.exe 03d lvlinput_as_integer

1080742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
only firefox 3.5 safari all versions and google-chrome 2+ support it

1080742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the article says it works in ie only however it works in google-chrome 3 what i m using firefox 3.5 internet explorer and safari

1080748
integer	fractions
with each decimal expansion of the fractions you end up with a remainder which if multiplied by the current decimal place is an integer

1080753
getter	setter
i can make the setter or getter private internal

1080769
n-gram	words
instead of writing another n-gram search or improving the one in whoosh we now keep a words index retrieve all entries that have at least one correctly spelled words in common with the query and use difflib to rank those

1080775
getter	setter
you can t create truly read only property because you have to define both setter and getter

1080792
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i want to rotate a single word of text by 90 degrees with cross-browser ie6 firefox 2 any version of google-chrome safari or opera support

1080812
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 or safari webkit 3.1 check out -moz-transform and -webkit-transform

1080885
submit	submission
please test your regex before submission it rather than submit what should work. for example i tried the following first

1080905
decoder	encoder
edit 2 the custom message encoder that you mentioned looks like it both encodes and decoder messages

1080909
fortran	ada
i m talking about things like mixing c++ with fortran or ada with haskell etc

1080919
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
in the past i ve used dotnetzip ms-pl sharpziplib gpl and the 7zip sdk for c# public domain

1080934
getter	setter
properties are really just two methods a getter and a setter of type and so you have to write different things do deal with the setter and the getter

1080959
sorting	filtering
it s offline in the sense that it is self contained that html is carefully generated and the js inside it is carefully crafted to allow the user to browse thousands of images sorting or filtering by a number of criteria

1080981
put	get
so i m willing to put the effort in now to get it set up right for the long term

1081007
folder	directory
i say to some extent because for some odd reason the microsoft demo app displays blank file and folder names though it can upload download files and traverse directory just fine

1081015
codeigniter	cakephp
you should also look into frameworks like cakephp and codeigniter that do some things like this for you automatically

1081019
codeigniter	cakephp
lastly if this is your first big use of php and want to implement something like mvc you might check out something like cakephp or codeigniter

1081024
post	put	post	get	put	get
i output an anchor tag that was the id of the post and passed it through post or get or within the post based on what the user was clicking so that when they navigated to the page again my code would put in the anchor

1081033
mp3	wav
i use a combination of wav files for sound effects and mp3 for music which seems to work fine

1081038
codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	cakephp	kohana
definately check out some other frameworks like cakephp kohana codeigniter if you need more details and code examples

1081045
atomic	compare-and-swap
spoiler uses atomic compare-and-swap cas operations if not available in ruby you could emulate them with locks

1081076
width	height
but if i draw the component at 500 450 and the texture width and height are 100 i would expect to only see the whole width but only half the height of the component

1081099
kde	gnome
also it sure would be different under kde gnome fluxbox whatever

1081132
min	max
my current solution is to simply track the center of the particles by finding the min max of the x s and y s and make the viewport s middle follow that

1081214
int	chars
perhaps byte is closer to chars than to int

1081237
subclass	abstract-class
i would add a pure abstract clone method to class person which definitely looks like it should be an abstract-class existing mainly for the sake of being subclassed -- if you need a concrete none of the above kind of person it s best done via a separate concrete subclass otherkindofperson rather than as the base class itself

1081300
nyromodal	jqmodal
i ve been trying to create my own firefox toolbar with commands that will open and close a modal dialog using either jqmodal or nyromodal

1081305
versioning	upgrade
they suggest that i upgrade crystal reports to versioning r2

1081317
vb.net	vb6
similar to vb.net having a bad rap due to vb6 history

1081328
cairngorm	puremvc
you might want to use a framework like puremvc or cairngorm for separation of model and view

1081363
nant	cruisecontrol
how do i configure nant cruisecontrol etc

1081380
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to layout an html table it s tabular data and it is rendering differently in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 2.0.172 edit and ie7 - which renders the table like google-chrome does

1081403
postgresql	mysql
i sort a lot of data and if sqlite cannot sort naturally i suppose the solution is to head back to postgresql or mysql

1081431
min	max
there is the slightly chance of your code producing an overflow and languages like java will jump from max int to min int and you get a very big negative number

1081434
post	get
i know subsonic is built for a single db but i ve read several post about switching the connect string in the default provider to get multi database support

1081445
public	protected
normally i add a java doc to each public method and to some private protected methods

1081448
public	protected
every method - private protected public - should be documented describing what it does

1081450
implements	extends
look in each directly implements or extended interface in the order they appear following the word implements or extends in the method declaration

1081530
put	get
while each very useful and usable don t let you get anywhere as close to the machine as c++ and c allow simply put all of those languages impose on you a higher level of abstraction.

1081580
width	height
if i set width and height attributes on my window element that sets the non-client outer size which isn t useful

1081580
width	height
i can set width and height on the window s content element a in this case and then set the window s sizetocontent attribute to widthandheight

1081599
width	height
you can remove the window width and height attributes in xaml and add sizetocontent widthandheight

1081640
post	put	post	get	put	get
in fact many violate key aspects of rest such as using get for manipulation or post for retrieval and there are disagreements over fundamental usage post get vs post get put delete

1081655
post	get
if you post some more details we can see if we can help you get around it

1081681
post	get
many developers stick to get and post in which case the last one might be

1081696
verilog	vhdl
once you know verilog it will be easier to bridge the gap to vhdl

1081696
verilog	vhdl
i started out with vhdl then learned verilog and am now pro verilog

1081706
folder	directory
this assumes that your media_root media directory contains the admin media folder which is what i understood from your question

1081743
ssl	https
transmitting in ssl https provides encryption over the wire

1081777
daemons	systemd
in nix like systemd a daemons will normally create a pid file at somewhere to indicate its existence

1081787
nunit	mstest
it uses rhino mocks again but nunit instead of mstest

1081808
udp	tcp
an understanding of the network protocols differences between tcp udp and capacity is important to the architecture and the performance of the system performance in this scenario being hugely significant

1081820
integer	unsigned
for example if the largest offset of a starting integer is only 12 000 and the largest range is 9 000 long then you can use a 2 byte unsigned integer for all of these

1081848
spaces	delimiter
unlike the english language which uses a as the delimiter between words in a sentence chinese does not use spaces between words

1081974
hash	md5
it s a good idea to create an md5 hash to make it possible for clients to check the integrity of their downloads

1081996
filtering	grouping
suppose i need to fill no of people living in city based upon city id and there is another condition of filtering like business grouping service grouping students

1082049
client-side	server-side
on server-side i ll use java very likely spring framework depending on what i ll be using client-side

1082088
getter	setter
they have their uses but for me small functions like getter setter are not one of them

1082100
versioning	upgrade
however it means that each of the applications using that library must use the same versioning and unless backwards compatibility is ensured must upgrade at the same time

1082107
inline	inlining
of course the compiler may still inline the function if it thinks that will be efficient but it s not the same as an explicit inlining

1082118
postgresql	mysql
you could try either postgresql or mysql

1082128
cassini	iis
for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

1082142
cassini	iis
when you re using iis are you running on the same computer that had the slow cassini

1082182
folder	directory
usually the source code goes into an src directory and the documentation goes into a docs folder

1082183
postgresql	mysql
i would recommend using javadb for the first one and then one of the other db - oracle mysql postgresql etc

1082205
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled by the user

1082209
innodb	myisam
deprecate myisam innodb is the way to go

1082212
innodb	myisam
foreign keys are only supported for innodb tables not for myisam tables

1082219
udp	tcp
can anyone help i trying to figure what i need to do i have been given the tasks of writing a server and a client in tcp udp

1082219
udp	tcp
i am looking for soome good examples with c# for tcp or udp

1082219
udp	tcp
as far as i know there is udp and tcp .

1082219
udp	tcp
if in fact a connection is needed again going back to tcp udp

1082221
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp codeigniter and others are only focused on rad development

1082240
width	height
the google ads are not showing correctly in ie7 i tried applying css properties display block and also tried with inline specified width and height specified position relative so what should i add to css to get it correctly positioned with floating element above it

1082273
udp	tcp
it sounds to me like you re not clear on the distinction between tcp and udp

1082273
udp	tcp
perhaps it s feasible to use both tcp and udp for different requirements within your app tcp for registering orders udp for transmitting price updates events

1082273
udp	tcp
i d consider your requirements and familiarise yourself with the limitations and features of tcp and udp

1082279
inherited	properties
create a wrapper class around customer either inherited from customer if possible or create an entirely new class that holds a customer object and exposes further properties

1082290
error-handling	exception-handling
the point of exception-handling is to separate the ideal flow from the error-handling flow

1082293
openssl	libcrypto
just for clarification you can do encryption and decryption using libcrypto which is a part of openssl

1082309
rar	gzip	rar	zip
algorithmss for text - zip bzip gzip rar 7zip are good enough to compress

1082321
accessor	properties
however outside of -dealloc or your initializers consistently accessing the properties via its accessor is a good idea

1082322
ant	maven
either let this be a maven project or ensure it works with ant ivy

1082364
postgresql	mysql
for most projects you will be fine using either mysql or postgresql

1082364
postgresql	mysql
at a later date you may decide you need to use an object-relational-mapping tool like hibernate but i would not worry about that now either just get familiar with jdbc and either mysql or postgresql

1082376
pecl	pear
the http pecl extension can do it also pear http_client snoopy and many many other libraries classes

1082394
udp	tcp
you shouldn t even consider udp if you re considering tcp too

1082394
udp	tcp
if you re considering tcp means you are thinking in terms of a stream exactly once in order messages and using udp will put the burden of fragmentation retry and acknowledgment duplicate detection and ordering in your app

1082394
udp	tcp
will be much harder to change your code base from tcp to udp and vice versa if you made the wrong choice using raw .net socket components

1082400
innodb	myisam
in general for me the most important point is that innodb offers per row locking while myisam does look per table

1082412
post	get
you very rarely want to actually press the submit button rather than making get or post requests to the handler resource directly

1082412
post	get
look at the html where the form is and see what parameters its submitting to what url and if it is get or post method

1082424
fadein	fadeout
also you may wish to consider using the fadein fadeout functions as these are designed to properly apply opacities over a range

1082433
int	chars
what you can pass from c# to c++ are types like bool int and chars

1082443
nunit	mstest
i ve only used the basic features of mstest so far and they have satisfied my needs and i don t really know anything about nunit

1082443
nunit	mstest
could someone list out some of the disadvantages and advantages of using mstest and nunit compared to each other

1082448
jtextfield	jtextpane	jtextfield	jeditorpane	jtextpane	jeditorpane
the listener approach will work on a jtextfield jtextarea jeditorpane or jtextpane

1082452
nunit	mstest
here is a nice blog which lists out some differences between mstest and nunit

1082462
int	double
the int double conversion is not even related as it is not a class cast but a conversion telling the compiler to store whatever is in x in y which happens to be a double

1082469
int	double
the int double is unrelated

1082469
int	double
that is a conversion not a cast - there is no relationship between int and double

1082472
jruby	mri
the following code will run forever in mri and jruby

1082472
jruby	mri
it s very important for people reading this thread to realize the whole issue is exclusive to jruby â in mri the built-in hash is sufficient

1082476
superclass	subclassing
for the first question you cannot cast a superclass to a subclassing because a subclassing adds members that the superclass doesn t have

1082507
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks the search button a user control containing a search form should be displayed in a jquery ui dialog pop-up

1082528
int	boolean
but it should be possible for simple types like int or boolean

1082632
icomparable	compareto
then instead of using the operator you could use the compareto method of the icomparable interface

1082649
keydown	keyup
i have just discovered that while i can capture keypress in javascript i cannot seem to capture keyup or keydown in javascript

1082649
keydown	keyup
can anyone explain why i am unable to capture the keyup keydown events in javascript or suggest a workaround

1082707
libusb	pyusb
on pc side you are using pyusb wich wraps libusb

1082753
children	parent
i m sure it would be a good example for others out there - the statement is trying to pull products that have a many-to-many relationship with product categories and the categories have a hierarchy of parent children

1082771
ready	each
each spring controller has the ability to call an init method you could have each controller add it s name and url to the controller url map in the init methods so it would be ready to use when the controllers go live

1082775
versioning	upgrade
it isn t compulsory to install the full versioning of visual studio 2008 to upgrade to service pack 1

1082869
easymock	jmock
if this is for test purposes you should look at mocking frameworks like jmock and easymock

1082891
width	height
call g.drawimage with the old image and the overload to specify width height

1082901
int	chars
so i m trying to figure out how to use file io to read the numbers into a chars array that i will later convert to int

1082979
for-loop	loops
boldewyn i believe you can also use a for...in loops instead of a regular for-loop to shorten the code a bit

1083028
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
my question is what would be the most painless way to practice these graph algorithms not just limited to bfs but will also come in useful when i want to implement dfs dijkstra floyd-warshall etc

1083036
public	protected
a nested class can have private protected and protected internal access modifiers along with public and internal

1083178
mouse	keyboard
however i notice that once the frame is not in focus as it is when its iconized the mouse and keyboard trapping that normally works when the frame app is in focus no longer works

1083178
mouse	keyboard
i am aware that i could write a c++ program to create a message queue hook and trap all mouse and keyboard events at the os level but id rather not roll up my sleeves that far

1083180
postgresql	mysql
i m pretty sure i ll be using sqlite for this project but does anyone think postgresql or mysql could perform better with a pretty big join like this

1083183
pthreads	fork
as for why the kernel can t just find a bunch of free memory well if you want someone to do that work for you either use fork instead or use pthreads

1083185
pthreads	fork
unless you have very good reason to use clone stick with fork or pthreads

1083207
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this should work with safari firefox and opera

1083211
mouse	keyboard
do you really need mouse and keyboard events or would it be sufficient to just know if the user has been idle

1083217
mouseover	mouseout
you could chain the mouseout to the mouseover

1083286
free	malloc
i ll bet 0.02 that it s crashing somewhere inside malloc or free in which case the problem is plain old heap corruption and there are many heap-checker tools available to help you catch it

1083291
imperative	declarative
sql being declarative and set based any workaround you may find that tries to force sql to do imperative row oriented operations is unreliable and may break

1083304
int	double
it can be stored freely int double etc

1083313
unix	solaris
you can then host on either windows or unix linux solaris mac

1083315
coldbox	model-glue
mvc frameworks mach-ii or model-glue because i m familiar with them although i m open to checking out coldbox

1083319
multiplying	subtract
the second is to subtract the integer portion then iteratively multiplying by 10 and again subtract the integer portion until you get zero

1083414
firefox	safari
also i m using both safari and firefox to debug

1083465
stdout	stderr
then you can use tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launch the same-named .exe file

1083471
post	get
sendredirect sends a 302 but the correct code to use to transform a post into a get is 303

1083471
post	get
most browsers will treat a 302 just like a 303 if they get it in response to a post however

1083508
int	double
the goal would be to allow one to store int int float or double values in the data type

1083567
versioning	upgrade
if you have an earlier versioning either upgrade or remove in the snippet above

1083610
vb6	vba
in that case you have few options because event handlers cannot be shared in vba vb6

1083671
validationsummary	customvalidator
customvalidator markup you can place this anywhere sensible such as next to the validationsummary control

1083732
webclient	webrequest
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest

1083733
actualheight	actualwidth
yes i ve done this in the past with the actualwidth and actualheight properties both of which are read-only

1083733
width	height
so the view model has width and height properties that are always in sync with the observedwidth and observedheight attached properties

1083733
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
ergo the width and height of the view model is always in sync with the actualwidth and actualheight of the usercontrol

1083749
google-chrome	firefox
you could use the file usercontent.css lying within the directory named google-chrome in your mozilla firefox profiles directory

1083755
google-chrome	safari
in this url i have rounded divs that appear to be rounded in ff3 but on safari and google-chrome the rounded corners are not there

1083769
cart	oscommerce
here is an example application built in delphi which acts as a front end store manager for oscommerce shopping cart

1083773
swt	swing
also swing tutorial or check out swt if you prefer faster and more native looking ui

1083836
dns	spf
the best advice is to ensure you re sending list is clean ip address has a good reputation reverse dns spf records good unsubscribe and bounce handling on the campaigns spam check on content and get recipients to add you to their address book

1083939
photoshop	fireworks
i have tried creating the resource in illustrator photoshop and fireworks

1083939
firefox	safari
the problem is the same on firefox as in safari

1083964
typedef	struct
you would use a typedef so you do not need to specify the struct keyword when declaring variables of that struct

1083980
typedef	struct
in c++ this is not so useful because c++ was designed to make definition of new types easier and more complete than c at least at the beginnings of c++ and the typedef is not even necessary to refer to a previously declared struct or class

1084008
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in ie6 ie7 firefox google-chrome safari and even in my mobile web browser se p1

1084036
bash	tcsh
i found unix power tools o reilly to be an awesome resource to learn any of the popular shells bash and tcsh are what i use

1084060
post	get
this will make all get request direct requests etc. use the new action and the post request the create action

1084097
subtraction	addition
should you learn how to do basic arithmetic like subtraction and addition by hand when now we have calculator and computer that can do this for you

1084106
inherited	properties
it could inherited from tab control for the bulk of its functionality and properties for the datagrid and whatever else custom you need

1084119
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	lxml	elementtree	elementtree	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
i typically uses lxml that exposes an elementtree around libxml2 and libxslt

1084126
gif	png
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

1084130
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
object has four public methods tostring gethashcode gettype and equals

1084136
pecl	pear
also keep in mind any third party libraries extensions pecl pear zend framework drupal wordpress or custom written that you re using that may not work on 5.3 yet for any given reason

1084148
width	margin	margin	text-indent
the width is to allow enough room in the displayed select box when not active the margin does what it always does text-indent is used to feign padding between the left boundary of the select box and the inner-text

1084170
comparator	comparable
sorted would imply ordering according to an implementation of comparable or comparator

1084173
sortedmap	sortedset
sortedmap and sortedset are sorted collections which means that iteration through the collection will happen in a sequence derived from the elements themselves

1084174
public	protected
protected constructors can be useful when you are providing it along with some public overloads to provide some more functionality to derived classes

1084202
post	get
please post the error messages you get they say everything you need

1084205
multiplying	subtract
what you probably want to do is negate the numeric value just multiplying it by -1 or subtract it from 0 as you suggested and reflect that change in the interface you mention a text box

1084290
division	exponent
it might be more efficient to do repeated integral division than to cast to a float perform an exponent then floor and cast back to an integer but the basic idea remains the same

1084301
division	modulo
if you really don t want to do that though you should use modulo which gives the remainder of a division

1084316
serializable	deserialization
see serializable and deserialization to learn the differences between this class and the datacontractserializer

1084323
sorting	filtering
if all you re looking for is sorting and filtering then just use a dataset and create a dataview referring to the table you ve filled in

1084327
spaces	linefeed
the problem with textarea component is that it works in plain text with no html tags included so you need to replace each linefeed with a br and each additional whitespace with the white spaces html entity

1084336
getter	setter
what code should not be unit tested apart from getter and setter

1084338
cout	cin
the easiest is probably to move out of a direct cin cout loop and to use std getline instead

1084395
min	max
you can also use min and max

1084437
division	modulo
however for your specific task of removing leading and trailing digits these calculations modulo and integer division are very simple and much faster than converting the entire number

1084481
post	get
basically the method property defines whether you are doing a http get or http post

1084481
post	put	post	get	put	get
the object you put into the data property is the data that will be added as a query string in an http get or added as the message body for a http post

1084492
stdout	stderr
the technique uses tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launch the same-named .exe file

1084514
mouse	keyboard
i d like to write a program able to use other programs by taking control of the mouse keyboard and being able to see what s on the screen

1084544
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but in firefox when i try to start dragging it fails

1084607
post	get
get to grips with get and post requests the http protocol why many web applications need rdbmss etc

1084629
pdfrenderer	icepdf
as well as pdfrenderer there is icepdf and jpedal

1084656
lisp	scheme
have a look at peter norvig s tutorial on good lisp programming style though you would have found the answer to your particular question in any scheme lisp book

1084686
int	chars
that last reason doesn t hold so strong for c# anymore where a chars is 16 bits and not implicitly convertable to int

1084729
subtraction	addition	operands	decrement
the increment ++ and decrement -- operators as well as the addition assignment + and subtraction assignment - operators are overloaded for a variety of numeric types and they perform the extra step of converting the result back to the operands s type when returning the result

1084744
tabs	tabpanel
i have a rich tabpanel with several tabs in it

1084755
ant	maven
many of the reasons they re against maven are basically it s not ant or i can t do x like i can in ant

1084773
mouse	keyboard
it lets you fake keyboard and mouse input nicely at a system level ie not just posting events to a single application

1084794
required	placeholder
default is just that - a placeholder and no links are required for it.

1084816
ubuntu	linux
update i m seeing the same problem on my linux machine ubuntu 8.10 running git 1.6.3.2 and svn 1.5.1

1084839
many-to-many	one-to-many
i know this doesn t address the error you re getting but i d suggest using three one-to-many relationships instead of one many-to-many relationship

1084846
tcplistener	tcpclient
but i have to use ssl as well and the only way to do that seems to be to use a tcplistener and then grab a tcpclient from the begin end accept method and then get the underlying network stream and layer the ssl stream on it using the beginauthasserver

1084860
post	put
i put up a detailed post on how to do this a couple weeks ago so i ll just refer you to it

1084861
firefox	safari
it does work in firefox and safari it does not work in ie

1084968
punctuation	words
if i give you a sentence the dog rover ate his food. the first thing you do is break it up into words and punctuation

1084975
lisp	scheme
writing a scheme lisp processor is a project of this type

1084997
width	height
however when i access the position top left and dimension height width properties of the form it would appear they are wrong

1085080
itunes	iphoto
i will be changing the view with some buttons at the side as show in iphoto itunes and generally most mac apps out there

1085088
public	protected
i also didn t know if the point was to make the profile method behave like ruby s public protected private keywords

1085111
mouse	keyboard
if you are comfortable with pascal a really powerful keyboard mouse screen-reading program is scar name scar it can do ocr bitmap finding color finding etc

1085125
getter	setter
each member in the model must be a property with a getter and a setter

1085151
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

1085153
int	double
boxing is the term for turning a value type int double float guid etc. into a reference type system.object system.string etc.

1085201
emacs	jedit
you can use a modular system like jedit or emacs

1085237
vsto	add-in
as i know we can use com add-in or vsto to develop our own plugin for ms outlook

1085282
cvs	svn
you can t beat the shell integration you get with svn cvs git etc

1085282
vim	emacs
vim emacs but never under-estimate

1085288
chown	chmod
i want to give people the option to use chown and chmod

1085290
multiplying	multiplication
but convolving is the same as multiplying in the fourier domain so repeated application of the filter is like repeated multiplication in the fourier domain and here you can see that things will either blow up or go to zero

1085306
width	height
when jquery is animating either the height or width of an element it will automatically set overflow hidden on the element while the animation is happening

1085335
cvs	svn
the sql to create your stored procedures should be in source files as part of a project in some source control system cvs svn etc.

1085340
chown	passwd	chown	chmod
full chown chmod in a web app is equivalent to just pasting your root passwd on the page

1085351
concave	convex
the maintaining the topology of the features block of colour gradients convex and concave curve will be more important the exact size shape and colour of those features

1085356
ironruby	ironpython
i d be astonished if that was the case in an overall system that supports dynamic languages as .net now does such as ironruby and ironpython -- maybe if c# won t let you go around accessibility limitations via introspection the dynamic languages could serve

1085379
ctrlp	auto-indent
vim will do auto-indent and some autocomplete ctrlp

1085477
chown	chmod	chown	chgrp	chgrp	chmod
perhaps you should look at the php commands chmod chown chgrp and fileperms

1085498
gmail	hotmail
hi can somebody tell me how to import all of my contacts from gmail yahoo hotmail and so on

1085503
int	chars
also why are you initializing an int and chars to null

1085528
hide	show
as we all know there is no way to hide or show some tab pages on the tab control

1085561
range	max
edges above 2 the max radio range have been culled from the list

1085584
x86	64bit
c# - how to get program files x86 on windows vista 64bit

1085609
accessor	ivar
if it isn t the above it is probably either specified an observer on an ivar or are using object serialization and don t actually have an accessor method for it and thus throws an exception

1085638
ienumerable	ienumerator
i was going through ienumerable and ienumerator but could not get one point clearly..if we have foreach then why do we need this two interfaces

1085641
put	get
and how to get console out put from this class

1085680
maven	pom.xml
it is now possible to import maven projects directly without mvn eclipse eclipse and it turns out that the root pom.xml is also imported as a project which is excactly what i wanted

1085697
ant	maven
i made ant script for it that can be used in maven

1085764
post	put
i was thinking i could generate a random number check if there is a current session tag with that number push all the post data into a an object put the object into ses randomid obj

1085788
networkstream	sslstream
then i created an sslstream object by using the constructor that takes networkstream bool remotecertificatevalidationcallback

1085803
firefox	safari
this works fine in safari and mozilla firefox

1085853
folder	directory
this technique will only work with inline code if you wish to compile your code then you would create the site as normal and then add an application folder within the virtual directory of that particular site for example my site is called intranet

1085873
free	malloc
however this tends to trigger crashes on windows since it s not unlikely to happen that the object is new ed in the plugin dll but later due to a deref call on the shared pointer deleted in the main application - and afaik this malloc free mixup is a no-no on windows

1085896
scrollable	panels
also if i were to build such a control does there exist a convenient built-in control for making like a list of custom controls that is scrollable - maybe panels

1085902
filesystems	ntfs
for example you d be much better off building something that supports fat32 rather than ntfs because the former is a much much simpler filesystems

1085932
post	put
another option would be to build a usercontrol that is able to display one post and put that control into a vb.net repeater control which ships with the vb.net powerpack

1085936
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard actions to windows

1086016
chunked	transfer-encoding
all of them mentioned that the long-life http response should be transfer-encoding chunked

1086073
cvs	svn
the vcscommand plugin provides global ex commands for manipulating version-controlled source files and it supports cvs svn and some other repositories

1086106
folder	directory
when you create your own custom virtual folder and set it inside the iis it s highly possible that the user account who run the application pool of that particular iis virtual directory is currently set to nt authority network service

1086107
spweb	spsite
take note of the need to dispose of partially unmanaged objects such as spsite and spweb if you take this route

1086118
button	checkbox
on the other hand if you need some functionality that is not available in the datagridview for example you would like 5 different button at the bottom of the tweet and 3 checkbox on the right then the custom control would do you better because you could build practically everything you wanted

1086187
int	double
the only constructors being called implicitly are value types structs like int and double

1086217
tripledes	rsa
just so that you know - rsa is asymmetric tripledes and rijndael are symmetric

1086250
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1086253
ienumerable	ienumerator
you don t need to use ienumerator and ienumerable although it generally is a very good idea to do so

1086260
interpreted-language	smalltalk
interpreted-language - smalltalk

1086264
camping	ruby-on-rails
i like _why s camping now maintained by the community which has to be the lightest of them all for recent info v1.9 see the camping links on the camping wiki eleanor mchughe s going off the ruby-on-rails or v 1.5 jeremy mcanally s going camping slides or these camping screencasts this camping podcast and nathaniel talbott s why camping matters but read the camping mailing list for current version info changes and evolution and try the latest blog example

1086264
merb	camping
there s also a ruby-forum discussion about camping and merb that also covers alternative orms

1086288
uitableview	uisearchbar
first make sure to add the uisearchbar to the tableheaderview of the uitableview so that it gets scrolled with the table s content and isn t fixed to the top of the view

1086311
lxml	beautifulsoup
that looks fine and beautifulsoup is useful for this although i personally tend to use lxml

1086339
int	boolean
if the number of boolean attributes does not change you could put them into a single int field and mask them as mike chaliy suggests

1086343
int	boolean
i have seen people doing things like having a 32-bit int field thus allowing them to store their 17 boolean values using bitmasking and leaving some room for additional fields

1086366
for-loop	arrays
just build the arrays in your for-loop

1086373
min	max
i m wondering if during the time elapsed between the first call to get_time and the next oracle s internal counter rolled over from its max value and its min value resulting in an overflow when trying to subtract one from the other

1086414
superclass	subclassing
can we assume the order in which they will be triggered as the superclass s constructor was called and added the handler before the subclassing

1086478
ssl	https
if i configure the four ports http and https to have different values and none of the https values is the value of the ssl port configured and certified in iis i get the following exception on service call but both services are started in the wcf service host

1086478
ssl	https
if i configure the first service to use the ssl port 443 then only the second service is started the one with the wrong https port

1086500
getter	setter
it s better practice to initialize variables via constructors and getter and setter method of the class

1086540
width	height
for instance assuming you only care about properties you might have an array stylename width height ... and you can maybe use the array like this

1086578
boost	stl
stl and boost why

1086615
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
otherwise i d recommend using the asihttprequest library which provides a great high-level api to the cfnetwork apis including the ability to use self-signed certificates

1086661
firefox	safari
it renders the intended way in firefox although as expected its not good on safari

1086670
jar	war
the solution i use is to put only web resources into the war and to put the war s class files into a seperate jar inside the ear

1086693
integer	unsigned
this may or may not help you but in your c# code you use uint32 32-bit unsigned integer for tssl_connect.sock and in the sslclt_connect prototype whereas the delphi header defines it as integer 32-bit signed integer

1086695
post	get
reason being is my bank requires that i open there payment gateway and pass my values by post and not get

1086706
dbml	edmx
one such tool is my add-in huagati dbml edmx tools

1086735
post	get
one idea is to get and save all posted data 1 on the captcha page and then recreate a middle white page with this form data and automatically make a new post to the previous page

1086904
hide	show
but basically you can bind some value trough a valueconverter to the uielement.visibility property if what you want is to hide show any uielement

1086919
vsto	add-in
they range from building a macros in outlook using vba to building full blown vsto add-in

width	height
how can we make it so as theta 0 - 2pi the results are about an ellipse of width a height b

1086981
libpcap	wireshark
wireshark uses libpcap

1086990
width	height
it is important to give each panel a width and height otherwise it will only show one element in the coverflow or no elements at all

1087013
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
with wpf and wanting to grow with the window the magical starting point is to set the margin to 0 and avoid setting width and height

1087046
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
you have to import the avfoundation and in an object that stays loaded the whole time your app runs or view or the app delegate you have initialize a avaudioplayer give it a file to play and set it to preparetoplay it.

put	get
i get an error saying can t find dependent libraries unless i put the path of the other dll on the system path variable i m on windows xp

1087066
calloc	malloc
the intent is to have operator new implementable by calling malloc or calloc so the rules are substantially the same

1087186

put an id on the tag you want to get its data from

1087227
ssl	https
i need to write a script that connects to a bunch of sites on our corporate intranet over https and verifies that their ssl certificates are valid

1087227
ssl	https
python by default just accepts and uses ssl certificates when using https so even if a certificate is invalid python libraries such as urllib2 and twisted will just happily use the certificate

1087237
int	double
they re more like int with a scale than float double types

1087315
inherited	properties
since the .text properties is on a control inherited from webcontrol it can be set read manipulated during any of the events following the control s load event wherever whenever you load the control inside the page but the text cannot be directly read used manipulated by the code-behind without referencing some other control to get to it like a containing div s innerhtml properties

1087360
post	get
i want to get an edit token via a http post command

1087421
mockito	easymock
you need to provide expectations for each method that is called with the expectation on any concrete methods calling the super method - not sure how you d do that with mockito but i believe it s possible with easymock

1087478
range	max
the maximum number of steps possible the max range essentially is different from row to row though i highly doubt any of them will get into the hundreds so in 99.9 of cases the maximum should never exceed 20 or 30 and i d be surprised if it ever got anywhere close to 100

1087501
subclass	abstract-class
instead i suggest defining a non-abstract subclass of your abstract-class in your test

1087523
implements	sealed
here is some code that appears to work for me to implements your own commandcolumnseries i stole a lot of it from the source for the columnseries sealed class

1087556
swt	swing
you realize of course that swt is not portable the way that swing is

1087567
width	height
this is called sof0 and contains height width bit depth etc

1087567
width	height
then there will be two bytes for height two for width and a single byte for the number of components

1087574
put	get
according to the kigg sample mvc web project you can get it from the official asp.net they put extension utility classes with a subfolder under root

1087625
getattr	setattr
for many tasks i ve seen people ab- use exec and eval for python s powerful built-ins such as getattr and setattr indexing into globals c provide preferable and in fact often simpler solutions

1087637
width	height
also the components will all the be the same height and width

1087676
width	height
i created a new view xib in xcode and in the size inspector the width and height are disabled and grayed out to 320 by 460

1087717
decoder	encoder
for exmaple maybe you have an image encoder decoder

1087734
multiplying	subtract
to get the minutes figure subtract the whole number portion so you only have the amount after the decimal then multiplying the fraction by 60 to get the minutes

1087775
ready	each
i was thinking about writing an application that for each file in the site searches all the other files to see if they referenced it then corrected any casing errors but thought on the off chance it may already be done and i can just download a ready made solution

1087844
swt	swing
in java desktop land you have 2 major choices swing or swt

1087883
stdout	stderr
data from stdout and stderr until

1087885
children	parent
now when a parent component moves its children just move along without any properties changing or move events being dispatched on the children

1087950
folder	directory
if your wanting to use the compressed folder option you will need to modify the directory flags on the directory handle

1088010
put	get
although it does work when i put the html files out of views folder but i get page not found 404 when i put those in views folder

1088010
folder	directory
i am also unable to browse the views folder by setting directory browsing option in iis

1088012
width	height
create a new image with the same width and height but a different image types

1088033
hash	salt
at least you have to use a salt for generating the hash

1088043
hash	salt
to securely authenticate a user via hash code so you avoid sending the actual password across the wire first generate a random single-use salt value on the server

1088043
hash	salt
send this salt value to the client and generate a hash code from the salt version of the password the user has input

1088043
hash	salt
send the resulting hash code to the server and compare it with a hash code generated from the salt version of the stored password

1088043
hash	salt
the reason for the single-use salt is to prevent anyone listening to the conversation from capturing the hash code of the users password which when you use hash code comparison is just as good as having the password itself

1088046
put	get
the deploy directory contains only those executables and dlls that are needed for the actual app ie testing dlls don t get put there

1088052
hash	salt
note that in order for this to be secure the hash must be salt with a string provided by the server and the string must be unique for every request

1088129
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller does not neither does the uitabbarcontroller

1088209
firefox	safari
interestingly enough it hits the error event in ie but not firefox safari and the rest and i don t know why this code works great and renders my data just fine in firefox and the rest

1088251
ethernet	wireless
i am able to get a list of the network interfaces using system.net.networkinformation.networkinterface but is there any good way to see if the interface is cell data wireless or regular ethernet as well as the available speed particularly in the case of cell data

1088272
versioning	upgrade
a little late but i just upgrade from isapi rewrite versioning 2 to versioning 3

1088387
vim	emacs
given what i just said what productivity advantages does vim or even emacs have over a gui text editor aside from that fact that it is installed on every computer

1088387
vim	emacs
i d like specific tasks that are better faster on vim emacs or that are just not possible with existing gui text editors

1088417
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	h.264	webm
as well there s some fight over which codecs to support for the videos - firefox google-chrome and opera all support both ogg theora and webm while safari and ie are shipping h.264 though either can support theora webm with proper codecs

1088417
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
to add support for ie 8 and earlier and other downlevel clients like older versions of firefox safari opera etc just put your standard video embed code inside the video tag below the source elements

1088429
mouse	keyboard
i actually ended up going lefty on my mouse at work because it let me move my hand less to reach for the mouse my keyboard at home doesn t have a number pad so i can keep it on the right

1088439
mouse	keyboard
basically with a small lead-time you can learn ten or twenty keyboard shortcuts that mean you don t have to keep shifting your hand to grab the mouse

1088460
put	get
here are some of the errors i get the whole stacktrace is too big to put here

1088485
accessor	properties
at least one properties accessor if

1088540
organization	naming
organization s own internal naming

1088575
accessor	properties
creating a properties and assigning it outputfolder simply results in another item group not a properties i can reference with the accessor

1088585
width	height
a column width or row height of 0.0 is an indicator of whether or not the range is hidden

1088600
superclass	subclassing
i have a table of electronic devices that serves as a generic superclass and then separate subclassing tables for phones laptops cameras etc

1088626
unix	sunos
we have a small daemon application written in c for a couple of various unix platforms this problem is happening in sunos 5.10 that basically just opens up a serial port and then listens for information to come in via said port

1088657
maven	pom.xml
write a maven pom.xml build file for each project

1088705
vim	emacs
a tabbed interface is not as nice as the windowed interface that vim emacs give you

1088728
public	protected
protected is somewhere between public everyone can access and private only class internal can access

1088743
coalesce	isnull
the coalesce is ansi standard and isnull is not

1088811
versioning	upgrade
in versioning 2.x we are using auto-generated msi packages with major upgrade as recommended by wix3

1088815
gridview	repeater
i currently have a gridview nested withing a repeater the repeater displays the plan in a label and onitemdatabound i call a method to populate the gridview

1088815
gridview	repeater
i m not opposed to handling this a different way as in loose the gridview and or repeater if someone has a better idea

1088850
ubuntu	linux
i usually use putty to connect to my linux box running ubuntu and for some reason the arrow-keys maps to a b c d in insert mode and the whole color support issues

1088854
filtering	grouping
the where clauses of receive are restricted to conversations and conversation grouping and this is as a means to help application leverage the conversation grouping locking concept not to filtering our certain messages

1088865
put	get
so whenever you want to manipulate elements especially a query to get all the elements that have a title you definitely need to put the code around this special event

1088904
post	put
i assume you are responding to a put or post request on your blog post resource

1088906
button	checkbox
it also occurs to me that perhaps what i really want is a button control that looks like a checkbox maybe an invisible button with the usual animated checkbox on top which i bind data to the graphic of

1088916
hash	md5
so is there anyway to get md5 to hash via a specific key that would be consistent to both

1088918
pop-up	dialog
i have a button which event is handled serverside and when i click lthis button i want to pop-up a dialog where i can show my custom web control or any web control lets make it generic from the start

1088933
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption - it s a hash

1088933
hash	md5
md5 is an unkeyed hash function - there is not key in use at all

1088933
hash	md5
you would then md5 the string or file and compare the hash you computed with the hash they sent

1088933
hash	hmac
a hmac is a keyed hash function

1088937
vim	emacs
in my experience the main productivity gains which vim and emacs i m a vim person myself but emacs is surely similiar provide are

1088937
vim	emacs
i don t know why that is or maybe i m just lucky but maybe people who took the barrier of getting accustomed to an old tool like emacs or vim have the right dedication and contact to other people like that

1088937
vim	emacs
maybe it s an indirect effect of these editors but hanging out with other vim or emacs people on irc turned out to be quite interesting since the same people were also quite interested in all kinds of software engineering or computer science issues

1088940
hash	md5
md5 is a hash function and strictly speaking is not used to encrypt a string

1088946
hash	md5
tom s right md5 is just a one-way hash you can t decrypt it

1089077
base	fractions
the values that can be finitely represented depend on the number of unique prime factors of the base so base 30 2 3 5 can represent more fractions than base 2 or base 10

1089084
addclass	removeclass
instead of specifying all the styles in your code why not use css and jquery s addclass removeclass and toggleclass functions

1089088
versioning	upgrade
as well it handles things like flash player versioning detection player upgrade downloads and displaying alternative content if the user does not have want flash

1089142
dictionary	map
the primary structural difference between them is that dictionary relies on chaining maintaining a list of items for each hash table bucket to resolve collisions whereas hashtable uses rehashing for collision resolution when a collision occurs tries another hash function to map the key to a bucket

1089158
hash	md5
use a persisted md5 hash column

1089194
int	chars
it is 3 reads for an int the depth of the b-tree built on an int column vs 4 reads for a chars the depth of the b-tree built on an chars column

1089204
integer	unsigned
according to the 1999 iso c standard c99 size_t is an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bit see sections 7.17 and 7.18.3

1089204
integer	unsigned
the standard also recommends that size_t shouldn t have an integer conversion rank greater than long if possible ie casting size_t to unsigned long is unproblematic if the recommendation is followed

1089205
gridview	radiobuttonlist
if i have an asp.net radiobuttonlist within a templatefield in a gridview which is tied to a data control i can get databinding on page loading like so

1089261
onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeyup onkeydown and onkeypress are the events to look at

1089341
serializable	deserialization
i only consider using xml if there s some part of the xml ecosystem i need validation transformation automatic serializable deserialization etc

1089349
versioning	upgrade
even if you were to pick only one exact versioning to support and force everybody else to upgrade downgrade it s not true that flash is the same everywhere the flash plugin for ie and flash plugin for everybody else aren t even the same binary and yes it matters they access the network in different ways which was part of the cause of my ie7 f9 bug

1089392
addition	multiplication
in each case the values that we worked with had a finite representation in binary and so the values output by the basic multiplication and addition operations also produced values with a finite representation

1089393
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also don t forget html5 which now has integrated video element supported by major browsers including firefox google-chrome and safari

1089414
uiview	caanimation
this means to do what you want you would at least have to try a uiview animation block and most likely actually create a caanimation

1089427
children	parent
parent children

1089442
stdout	stderr
being able to redirect stdout stderr of arbitrary commands to those same log files

1089443
jar	war
you can try using jruby to package it up in a jar or war

1089464
decimal	ieee
for 6.1 we must use another representation like decimal representation or ieee 854 that allows base 2 or base 10 for the representation of floating-point values

1089490
folder	directory
i was then hoping to add an include directory pointing to that folder relative to the workspace but eclipse won t do that it seems to only want to point to thinks in home user workspace myprojectnamehere

1089507
g++	gcc
i would suggest installing cygwin and gcc g++

1089512
min	max
obviously you d want to package this up in a function that drew the plot using open close min max tuples and you probably wouldn t want to randomly assign your opening and closing prices

1089514
put	get
you get out of it what you put into it

1089548
put	get
and pretty rarely you ll get a fixup error when the address of foo doesn t fit where the linker wants to put it

1089552
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
xcode supports use of version control - cvs svn and perforce

1089552
cvs	svn
but for a new project you should be using svn instead of cvs anyway

1089570
maven	pom.xml
i am downright annoyed because the quartz release i m importing does not have a proper pom.xml file deployed maven repo

1089584
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
i ve got an application a daemons inside library startupitems to be precise running as root that occasionally launchd another process using systemd open applications myappname.app

1089585
nexus	artifactory
you can run repository manager such as artifactory or nexus locally

1089641
ivar	subclassing
you should probably subclassing uitableviewcell and make the mapviewcontroller an ivar of that class

1089644
folder	directory
the user s directory is now c programdata myfolder and that folder is created as read only genius

1089645
mkmapview	mkannotationview
using mkannotation mkpinannotationview and creating a custom mkannotationview in an mkmapview

1089649
jsf	seam
i am running a seam web application with richfaces for the jsf implementation

1089649
jsf	seam
the problem i am having is seam jsf do not like the redirect here for some odd reason

1089741
ubuntu	linux
i m a bit new to ubuntu gcc linux so i ve started off like this

1089745
post	get
if you post the specifics of your proc i bet you will get some good suggestions for how to do what you need with a single stored proc call and no cursor

1089749
button	checkbox
to make it run queries serially edit the dataset that runs the sp click the ... button next to the data source dropdown and check the use single transaction checkbox at the bottom

1089804
daemons	launchd
you should make your daemons a proper launchd daemons stick a plist in library launchdaemons

1089804
daemons	launchd
you probably shouldnâ t be launchd the second daemons directly from your daemons

1089804
daemons	launchd
however as i said you shouldnâ t be launchd your second daemons using open or launchd services

1089804
daemons	launchd
for example itâ s often best to have your launchd daemons launchd on demand rather than have them running continuously

1089900
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton and uiimageview are distinct subclasses of uiview and uibutton is a subclass of uicontrol so the only things they have in common are uiview methods

1089901
maven	pom.xml
maven already such that a pom.xml

1089920
post	get
on the post back of view 2 you then do updatemodel wizard object again to get the 1st 2 fields and then the email

1089920
hide	show
what you can do is use javascript to hide and show elements of the wizard so that all entry fields are on the same page

1089939
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
use a sqldatasource instead of a linqdatasource and put your select statement into the selectcommand property

1089953
folder	directory
to the .profile or maybe the .bashrc - i m not at my mac now and cannot check which one file in my home directory and put all those scripts into the bin folder in my home directory

1089983
jboss	weblogic
if i am only going to be using java ee do i need a full application server like jboss weblogic websphere etc or is this over kill

1090021
getter	setter
traditional object or bean with getter setter

1090027
put	get
the best optimization you can get is to not put the test into a function

1090060
gdal	ogr
geos for the geometry model and gdal ogr for a spatial data abstraction library which supports rasters and vectors

1090060
wgs84	utm
to find distances in meters you can transform from wgs84 to something that uses meters like utm

1090123
put	get
if you put in the corresponding html and used you would get your newlines

1090158
awt	swing
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -

1090158
awt	swing
some people prefer the native look of awt over swing s not quite there platform skins

1090158
awt	swing
there are better 3rd party native looking skins than swing s implementations btw lots of people preferred using awt s filedialog over swing s filechooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the weird custom swing one

1090191
disk	ram
there are better ways to scale a web app than moving to c++ and most of them involve reducing the time your script is waiting for data from the db or disk such as sharding your db or moving data into a ram cache

1090202
width	height
problems encountered using screen.availheight and screen.availwidth as the height and width params in window.open causes the browser size to include the taskbar and positioning at 0 0 ignores the possibility of the taskbar being up there

1090210
hide	show
then just iterate over the returned array to do the show hide logic

1090238
post	get
this is what i did when i had to develop a midlet twitter app that calls a wcf service to get friend updates post tweets etc.

1090361
int	boolean
public deflater int level boolean nowrap

1090385
width	height
i want to change the view size for iphone 3.0 but i find that in ib size position section the width and height for view was set as fixed values

1090393
stateless	stateful
using a creation hook here isn t really the right way to go because you are trying to add stateful data and those hooks are really for stateless behavior

1090430
gridview	detailsview
this issue is somewhat confusing compared to other controls and applies to gridview and detailsview controls

1090438
vbscript	jscript
to quote the feature list vbscript jscript delphiscript c++script or c#script. note it says c++script not c++

1090441
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
above code worked for ie7 ie6 firefox 3 google-chrome opera 10beta but not safari 4

1090455
pascal	delphi
most of the multithreaded work i have done has been in c c++ python or delphi object pascal

1090519
folder	directory
what i m trying to do is if the files already exist in the directory where the files are being dropped i want to rename the files folder being copied in ahead of time so that there s no collision

1090573
post	put
use whatever client side language you want a java app flex etc. and push to the server with http put no flex or post

1090573
post	put	post	get	put	get
my application does something similar to the above--we regulate both up post and put and get down stream bandwidth

1090604
postgresql	mysql
i want to know which database is more secure mysql or postgresql

1090613
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

1090621
dreamweaver	fireworks	photoshop	fireworks
at work i see one colleague designing a site in photoshop fireworks i see another taking this data slicing it up and using dreamweaver to rebuild the same from scratch

1090621
photoshop	fireworks
i know that photoshop can output a tables based html and fireworks will create divs with absolute positioning

1090621
width	height
photoshop s tables by themselves are pretty much useless i agree but surely we can take this data and then select a group of cells and say right this is a text div overflow auto or these cells are an image block style it with the same height width as the selected area

1090637
debian	centos
i can tell you that debian centos and zend server all use this option by default

1090658
postgresql	mysql
and as far as security is concerned well it is mostly in your hands than in mysql or postgresql

1090663
sorting	grouping
sometimes you may not want additional roundtrips to a database especially if you want fast response times when grouping sorting

1090726
button	checkbox
besides id s won t work for checkbox and radio button because you ll probably have several controls with the same name but a different value while an html element s id attribute has to be unique in your document

1090800
implements	extends
by extends the application class and implements it as a singleton you get an object that will exist whenever any of your application components exist providing a centralized place to store and transfer complex object data between application components

1090830
mp3	wav
im reading a audio file for ex wav mp3 etc and get a

1090838
cvs	svn
it will be used by extremely non technical people on windows so i have ruled out svn cvs git etc

1090867
punctuation	words
i used instead of s incase the words is followed by some punctuation

1090886
division	subtraction
you will want to take care to ensure that the operands to subtraction and division are popped off the stack in the correct order

1090887
cvs	svn
if you do then be aware that nearly all source control systems like cvs svn git etc

1090945
integer	unsigned
this meant that a 32-bit unsigned integer could only represent a span of time less than 829 days

1090945
integer	unsigned
later the system time was changed to increment every second which increased the span of time that could be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer to around 136 years

1090953
put	get
for a start flexibility around where to put the iis apps is seriously limited you get one virtual dir and the user can only choose the name you cant have multiple instances

1090953
pop-up	dialog
ultimately you can add as many custom steps as you like and they can pop-up dialog and whatever they like

1090962
getter	setter
in particular for use with xmlserializer it must have a public parameterless constructor and all the properties must be public with both getter and setter

1090981
comparator	comparable
the reverse order comparator is simply going to be flipping the sign of the output from the actual comparator or output from comparator on the comparable objects being inserted and i would therefore imagine it is very fast

1090994
icmp	udp
you may want to investigate configuration via timeouts etc. or some sort of timed protocol to identify a disconnect through absence of response perhaps out-of-band heartbeats using icmp udp

1091022
post	get
i do not need the proxy to simulate logging in instead the login page html should be displayed to the user normally and all the cookies and http get post data to flow through the proxy to the server so the login should be authentic

1091037
youtube	vimeo
blender is the only decent one i know why not taking a look in youtube vimeo on some tutorials

1091063
superclass	subclassing
basically you use the new modifier when the subclassing method has nothing to do with the superclass method

1091072
getter	setter
as i see it the setter and getter of the class has to be clean of all extra logic as the jpa implementation uses these to build up the objects

1091072
getter	setter
would it be better if the generic setter and getter be private for jpa and the classes would have a separate public transient api meant for the developers

1091073
try-catch	exception-handling
if you are writing a constructor which could throw an exception-handling you had better make sure you clean up anything you need to by using using or try-catch block

1091119
bazaar	git
i would recommend you one of the distributed version controls out there like mercurial git bazaar monotone and so on

1091127
processors	hyperthreading
increment decrement operations on 32-bit or less integer variables on a single 32-bit processors with no hyperthreading technology are atomic

1091127
processors	hyperthreading
on a processors with hyperthreading technology or on a multi-processor system the increment decrement operations are not guaranteed to be executed atomicaly

1093958
public	protected
you can think of c++ as having a very primitive access control system - either you can access all members friend or member function or you can access only public members everything else except... or you can access public and protected members ...special rules for inheritance

1093958
public	protected
on the other hand clearly friend can be used to completely break encapsulation by naming every other class you can think of as your friend like making all your members public or package protected in java or making all your members public in c++

innodb will still store critical information in its system-level data file however and you can t do things like casually rename a database by renaming the directory it lives in like you can with myisam

1094008
width	height
you could wrap that div in another div that maintains the proper width height to keep the layout consistent

1094649
intersect	contains
the two queries will produce the same results but there may be a difference in performance as the first query may perform slower than the second query in some instances when table 1 contains only a subset of the elements in table 2 as the left join will be executed first - and only then intersect with table1

1094655
matplotlib	scipy
i know that scipy has some signal processing tools for wavelets in scipy.signal.wavelets and a chart can be drawn using matplotlib but it seems i can t get it right

1094661
extjs	smartgwt
the difference being that if you run an extjs gwt application in hosted mode and attach your debugger you can see what extjs gwt is doing but with smartgwt you ll just see lots of idispatch calls where it disappears into native javascript where your debugger won t be able to follow

i see the same thing as validome.org with firefox google-chrome and wfetch--that last of which blindly reports the text obtained from the socket similar to curl or wget

1095034
getter	setter
in java classes is it considered good or bad practice to access member fields with their getter and setter

1095042
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox opera and google-chrome the center pane has the intended scrolling behavior when the class list exceeds the height the center pane has a scroll bar

1095045
firefox	safari
so for example you would create an application on the iphone that has the embedded safari browser however any website the user visits with this browser wouldn t know you were on safari on the iphone it would think you are on something like safari on a pc or even ie firefox

1095050
getter	setter
i don t see how there can possibly be any harm in defining getter and setter

1095056
getter	setter
if you know you are changing the value from outside the class and only then provide a setter if you don t know make the variable private and if you need access later maybe provide a getter or a setter

1095056
getter	setter
having a getter and a setter without thinking about it for every member breaks encapsulation and is not a good design choice

1095066
getter	setter
many times have i been saved from the pain of rewriting a class just because i left a getter or a setter open to overriding

1095070
getter	setter
it depends on what you use your getter and setter for

1095070
getter	setter
in that respect i really use getter and setter as an interface layer between this class and other classes that might need access to its data

1095070
getter	setter
i tend to write my internal code such that it knows how to handle data private to this class so accessing it with its own getter and setter is generally unnecessary and undesired

1095070
getter	setter
it all depends on how you use your getter and setter though

1095074
getter	setter
my rule of thumb is that if they do anything more complex than just set or return the value use the setter getter

1095086
getter	setter
i would say that using getter and setter internally is not an anti-pattern or a pattern

1095091
hash	md5
to handle that i d name each file there with by appending the date and username to the original file name and taking the md5 or sha1 hash of that string

1095116
versioning	upgrade
adobe can add new features and new codecs to video a lot quicker to a mass audience generally under a year over 90 of users upgrade to the latest versioning of flash compared to browser vendors there s still a large number of ie6 users out there and that browser came out in 2001

1095120
getter	setter
have getter and setter

1095135
getter	setter
it sounds to me like some people are interpreting this question as being about getter and setter that are used externally

1095150
folder	directory
an alternate approach is to start with a directory in your project with some files drag it into xcode and have it create the folder references for you

1095161

you need to understand busses and interfaces spi i2c usb ethernet etc

1095164

1095452
folder	directory
inside the projects directory create another folder called build_output

1095462

because it is in the superclass you now won t have to make yet another copy of it if you decide later to make a new subclassing that uses this method as well

1095615

of course this is not valid in my context in the example i just considered int or double as the datatype i m parsing the symrec properly but in this scenario won t the destructor dealloc 2 leaving as some kind of dangling pointer

option 4 of 2a - show q3 and hide q12

1095719
hide	show
option 1 of 2a - show q12 hide q3 and q4 --- this situation is quite complex

1095722
imperative	declarative
languages can have elements from different types of programming perspectives functional procedural imperative declarative etc

1095724
client-side	server-side
most surveys i ve seen do this server-side not client-side using an interface similar to a wizard

1095749
lisp	scheme
can i handcode some of these techniques in my lisp scheme program

1095760
lisp	scheme
can i see the translated machine instruction of a scheme function like disassemble in lisp

1095761
ant	maven
ant maven and gradle all are designed for building java applications

1095782
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed with nsxmlparser and it s working fine for the title and other strings but one of the elements is an image thats like

1095786
mechanize	hpricot
i ve written similar stuff to grab data from my bank accounts i m not too keen on giving mint my credentials using mechanize and hpricot as well as job sites used car dealerships etc so it s flexible

1095828
dictionary	map
python has its dictionary perl has its hash java has a hashmap and many other types of maps c++ has std map though that is not backed by a hash table and doesn t have constant time access

1095852
pop-up	dialog
use qt dialog.exec instead of qt dialog.show to pop-up the window as a modal dialog

1095882
int	double
int or double

1095883
lisp	smalltalk
just as when you are learning to program you are taught first c pascal then java c++ and finally python ruby smalltalk lisp and when learning any language you start with simple language constructs you should first learn ecmascript then learn dom and finally frameworks

1095891
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
developer.apple.com has most of the information you need to get started with developing for the iphone the elements application shows you how to implement the uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller programatically

1095901
post	get
passing a token in the get or post - when the user s broweser is redirected to the other site a digitally signed parameter is passed containing the identity and session status

1095937
nsstring	nsobject
just cast your nsobject to an nsstring before calling the function

1095958
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
to learn javascript get crockford s javascript the good parts book and try to learn the language using a standards compliant browser say firefox with firebug safari google-chrome without focusing on dom manipulation

1096048
mergesort	in-place
in general mergesort is doing a lot of list manipulations so it is much better to do things destructively by sorting sub parts in-place

1096073
folder	directory
how can i create a directory in c and assign an icon to the folder all with in my program

1096092
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
when you change views by pushing a new view using the pushviewcontroller method of navigationcontroller the view appears to slide in from the right

1096114
hide	show
small java script code to show or hide the control

1096210
dictionary	map
i d have the temp controller through a getstate method return a map in python a dictionary in javascript an object in c++ a std map or std hashmap etc etc of its properties and current values -- what s convoluted about it

1096244
getter	setter
you can extend the idea to read only and write only properties by removing getter or setter from the class as appropriate

1096262
getter	setter
indexers work much like properties they have a getter and a setter and you can perform just about any function in the getter or setter

1096288
codeigniter	cakephp
i d suggest use a good stable framework like cakephp symfony or codeigniter

1096338
width	height
if you need to stretch use an image inside the div and make height and width to 100

1096342
width	height
if you are not wanting to stretch the image but more some of the background image is cut off then expand the height of the element that has the background with the css property width or height

1096357
hide	show
ultimately it might be better if you could keep the show hide functionality on the client-side completely

1096369
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
you need to create a uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate to supply the data and configure the appearance of the picker view

1096436
google-chrome	firefox
i am using mozilla firefox and google-chrome in both its not working

1096439
udp	tcp
android s java.net package is pretty much the same as java s so you can use socket s and serversocket s for tcp communication or a datagramsocket for udp

1096474
installation	upgrade
upgrade an installation to the next

1096498
pascal	delphi
as much i know pascal as the base of delphi does not provide very easy approach as the best could be tstream or tpipeline usage tsocket should not be good right

1096558
hash	md5
this is basically a math problem but very programing related if i have 1 billion strings containing urls and i take the first 64 bits of the md5 hash of each of them what kind of collision frequency should i expect

1096596
hash	md5
if the first 64 bits of the md5 constituted a hash with ideal distribution the birthday paradox would still mean you d get collisions for every 2 32 url s

1096612
int	chars
chars string_mult int n

1096632
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
if you do want to do it by hand you would use nsurlconnection to download the data and then whatever you need to parse the output nsxmlparser for xml a bit harder for json

1096643
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the properties and synthesize make the accessor declarations and implementation for the already declared ivar

1096670
post	get
i need this to encode parameters for get and post requests with yahoo.util.connect

1096670
post	get
it turns out yahoo.util.connect has a setform method to serialize a form but that still leaves me out cold to encode parameters for get requests or the 4th parameter of yahoo.util.connect.asyncrequest to pass post data

1096718
for-loop	loops
you can t possibly get any reasonable performance increase if you change say for-loop to while loops

1096729
onmousedown	onmouseup
you can also solve this independently of the drag function you re using by making the click function be a onmousedown followed by onmouseup

1096741
folder	directory
the root directory but all my index pages are inside their language folder

1096772
nsstring	nsobject
now to give an example of a different use let s say i have an instance of nsobject where i would like to determine if i have an nsstring or nsarray

1096804
free	malloc
in the linux kernel for example the standard memory allocation functions malloc nmalloc free etc

1096942
mouseover	mouseout
i have a menu in a masterpage which uses images and mouseover mouseout events for design purposes

1096962
rss	feed
despite rss is a specific specification some search engines allows rss atom feed to be submitted as simple sitemaps

1096962
rss	feed
however if you submit a rss feed you won t be able to take advantage of all sitemap features such as the priority attribute

1096962
rss	feed
also rss atom feed can only be compared with classic sitemaps

1097028
winpcap	libpcap
winpcap is a windows version of libpcap on unix

1097043
versioning	upgrade
for example it allows you to run different versioning of the database simultaneously on the same system or it allows you to upgrade specific database or automatic storage management instances on a system without affecting other running databases

1097066
int	chars
my gut tells me you ve got either some chars set conversion going on unintentionally or that the corruption is due to moving between raw bytes java byte primitives and java int primitives

1097130
int	chars
on left shift of chars 0xff by 8 and casting it to int we get -256 or 0xffffff00

1097172
width	height
i m getting problem with the rotation of image.i want to create a new image with height equals to width because rotating by 90 degrees.but new image created change dimentions but do not place data in image accurately

1097172
width	height
new height equals to width of origunal image

1097175
width	height
by default this property is usually 0 0 width height

1097185
for-loop	loops
previously i used a for-loop and a do-while loops

1097185
for-loop	loops
i used the for-loop as a counter and the do-while loops as a comparison for end of time

1097213
int	chars
when i first looked at the problem my initial view was that the chars c should be shifted left 8 bits - all 8 bits being discarded the empty chars would then be cast to an int of value 0

1097213
int	chars
therefore the chars c is converted to an int first then shifted left giving the answer you see

1097250
google-chrome	firefox
i tested with a very short snippet if this works in ie firefox and google-chrome - and it does

1097270
inherited	properties
when dealing with custom exceptions i usually inherited from exception and then add some fields properties to my exception class to store some additional info

1097295
getter	setter
don t tell me that you plan to have 128 static setter and getter one for each bit

1097295
int	boolean
i d definitively go for setbit int index boolean value and getbit int index as instance methods

1097316
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter and its fork kohana

1097324
folder	directory
3 make sure the image s haven t been added multiple times from different directory and or to different group folder

1097365
profiling	debugging
if you don t have sql profiling available you will need to download the source and use debugging to see the actual sql statement that it is trying to execute

1097421
unix	solaris
solaris unix apis are sometimes different than standard unix functions

1097453
implements	extends
create a class that extends implements sprite

1097457
vsto	add-in
the solution found was to create a standard vsto add-in add a ribbon xml to it and then using the commands node to disable buttons

1097479
int	chars
also for the first call of g 1 i should have one call of f chars followed by two calls of f int and for the second call i should get three calls of f chars

1097509
profiling	benchmarking
later if you have performance problems benchmarking and profiling to pin-point where they are occuring

1097511
getter	setter
a property defines a getter and setter the setter is optional interface

1097513
width	height
width 2490px height 3515px so it represents a4 paper in 1 1 measure this is a4 paper resolution if print is to be 300dpi

1097639
udp	tcp
actually doing this by hand has its pitfalls when you have to handle a truncated response and need to switch from udp to tcp

1097729
superclass	subclassing
t needs to be either a subclassing or a superclass of system.int32 for casting to work without any additional operator overloading

1097849
google-chrome	safari
seems like it is dockable in safari and not in google-chrome both based on webkit

1097853
mouse	keyboard
i.e without clicking the mouse i need to invoke this event just by hitting enter on keyboard

1097854
udp	tcp
if it helps apple events are sent on port 3031 via tcp udp

1097891
serializable	deserialization
i m going to correct myself on this marc gravall pointed out the first iteration has an overhead of bulding the model so i ve done some tests taking the average of 1000 iterations of serializable and deserialization for both xml and binary

1097897
terminate	timeout
even in cases where the program is expected to simply wait for a set amount of time i use a wait function on a semaphore with a timeout so that i can end the thread immediately by releasing the semaphore if something somebody asks my program to terminate

1097913
post	get
will post some code when i get this implemented..

1097914
int	chars
you are not asking it to display a value indicated by a chars sized pointer you are asking it to display a hexidecimal int x using the contents of a chars pointer

1097915
int	chars
the expression is of type signed chars and it is being promoted to a signed int while being passed to printf

1097915
integer	unsigned
later on you print it out with x which means unsigned int in hex which causes you to print all the 1 s as opposed to correctly interpret them as a part of a 2 s complement signed integer

1097915
int	double
if the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

1097943
post	get
in the handling for search whether post or get one would normally run the query in the back end and if there was only one search result or one overwhelmingly relevant result you would redirect to that result otherwise to a page showing links to the top n results

1097972
for-loop	arrays
we could put each type in its own arrays and do a good old for-loop and access the objects with indexes but that would mean creating named arrays

1097986
move	drag
in my application i have two sliders and a chart that move when i drag the sliders now when i have the following positions

1098005
free	malloc
flashcards 1297 0xa0690fa0 malloc error for object 0x4fd78a0 pointer being free was not allocated

1098005
free	malloc
flashcards 1297 0xa0690fa0 malloc error for object 0x4fdc200 double free

1098078
rss	feed
as you notice in the comment it just says a rss feed may contain elements not described on this page only if those elements are defined in a namespace

1098080
ienumerable	icollection
because gridviewrowcollection implements the non-generic ienumerable and icollection interfaces which are not strongly-typed like this but its item property is strongly typed and returns a gridviewrow

1098115
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
from this faq it states that all of the latest browsers ie firefox safari and google-chrome support a client retry sometimes called browser retry

1098152
short	base
the code is quite short and well-written so this might make a good base for when you decide what you want to crawl

1098154
versioning	upgrade
as i understand it that is there specifically so that code with statements that have been made illegal in later versioning will survive an upgrade and continue to run

1098211
mp3	wav
can cygwin call a media file like a mp3 or wav file

1098219
width	height
my issue is not so much the scrollbars but that i do not know how to tell the child divs to occupy the width or height remaining to them rather than the full height or width of the parent

1098247
children	parent
it has the tree nodes children collection parent prev next sibling etc

1098259
stdout	stderr
then you can use tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launch the same-named .exe file

1098292
getter	setter
the best method seems to be using a hibernate formula mapped to the getter and setter of my bcount attribute in the class a

1098295
min	max
it would be nice to be able to create sub-hashes based on the min max and avg keywords which is why i want to split on the last whitespace of each heading

1098302
folder	directory
this will update your working copy with the contents of the chosen repo path including all the parent directory up to the start of the checkout working copy thus mirroring the folder hierarchy of the repository in your working copy

1098305
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in your example you can t the 5px margin is added to the bounding box of div#two and div#three effectively making their width and height 100 of parent + 5px which will overflow

1098311
disk	ram
16 bytes so if you have lots of rows and lots of non-clustered indexes the clustered key gets added to each and every entry in each and every non-clustered index using a guid will unnecessarily bloat your space requirements on disk and also in your machine s ram

1098318
width	height
setting a dimension height width and overflow to auto or hidden on the parent element causes it to contain any floated child elements

1098357
int	chars
also for the first call of g 1 i should have one call of f chars followed by two calls of f int and for the second call i should get three calls of f chars

1098357
int	chars
both of int and chars do not have argument dependent lookup an thus all the function calls you do will call f chars after you removed the d++ line

1098357
int	chars
as you see you will have to change from int chars to some user defined type enums or classes too see the effect of lookup in instantiation context

1098363
cpu	processors
i ve already mapped the bottleneck to cpu - but want to optimize the script s performance before taking a hit on processors costs

1098397
unsigned	short
53328 cannot be nicely stored in short use int instead as it allows you to store unsigned value up to 10 9

1098418
sum	coalesce
if your query is returning null you can use one of the coalescing methods coalesce sum ... 0 will return the first non-null value in the list.

1098459
profiler	shark
since you re using a mac you might try apple s shark profiler free download from adc which has java support and apple s performance group has put a fair amount of time into the tool

1098465
hash	salt
if an attacker knows the salt the hash password and the hash algorithm then they can mount a brute-force dictionary attack or rainbow attack

1098480
junit	testng
from junit 4.7 it s now possible to run tests in parallel without using testng

1098499
hash	salt
to successfully attack an account an attacker needs to know the salt for that account and every account s salt should be different the hashing algorightm used and the final stored password hash

1098499
hash	salt
if it s a bad salt too simple or short this can be made much faster because the program can use rainbow lookup tables to match the final stored password hash to the string that was hash and then just subtract the salt

1098502
serializable	deserialization
it might provide some insight into whether the problem is occuring during serializable or deserialization

1098603
division	modulo
i don t use linq to entities but if it supports .year .day .week as well as integer division and modulo then it should be possible to work out the week number using zellers algorithm congruence

1098616
dictionary	map
values in the dictionary you pass to translate as opposed to keys which must be ordinals can be unicode ordinals arbitrary unicode strings or none to remove the corresponding character as part of the translation so it s easy to specify ignore a certain character for sorting purposes map ã to ae for sorting purposes and the like

1098621
folder	directory
caveat if you want to keep these files which you appear to want you must manually remove the .git directory from the submodule folder

1098686
aggregate-functions	sum
the above doesn t work because you can t have the aggregate-functions sum in the where clause

1098702
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

1098733
getter	setter
then you have getter setter without the _ to give them public access

1098737
disk	ram
the big way that a lot of people speed sql up is to give it enough ram so that it never has to write to disk - this will probably be your bottleneck in the end

1098775
post	get
if not please post the results you do get

1098807
move	drag
in map user can move the marker to position it after drag finished it will return the city state and zip

1098815
ssl	https
you can use an http to https proxy or an ssl proxy like stunnel in front of your java server

1098866
maven	cobertura
is there a way to show the icon for maven site documentation if using a freestlye project i switched to a freestyle project rather than maven2 project because of certain bugs - cobertura graph not showing up on front page double unit test coverage counting when running cobertura

1098883
equals	gethashcode
if you are finding that the results are empty when they shouldn t be you might want to check to make sure your image class implements equals and gethashcode properly so that they can be effectively compared

1098897
udp	mtu
given the minimum mtu on the internet is 576 and the size of the ipv4 header is 20 bytes and the udp header 8 bytes

1098933
webrat	cucumber
we re bdd tdd ing with rspec and cucumber which is using webrat for webpage testing

1098944
postgresql	mysql
if you are looking for in-memory datasets for the speed they provide you may want to look at in-memory table storages mysql and postgresql do it and others can be tricked into doing it by setting the table storage space on a ram-disk for instance

1098950
daemons	launchd
i ended up installing a tiny flash policy daemons and setting launchd to provide it inetd-style

1098955
inherited	properties
or if you want to particularly test for properties of the object instance and not inherited properties use hasownproperty

1098965
post	get
if the site is a html and reports can be requested by a simple post or get then urlib urlib2 and cookielib python modules should be enough to fetch an excel document

1099028
des	aes	des	rsa	rsa	aes
cryptographic algorithm aes des rsa md5 ...

1099040
put	get
if i move the code around and put the select from the lead table i get the leads right bot 0 on all clicks

1099073
int	double
unsigned will enable you to have a larger double the size int id column

1099118
ati	nvidia
there will also be offerings from nvidia ati intel etc

1099120
min	max
i want the min startdatetime and max enddatetime for each category

1099120
min	max
using min max with a group by category doesn t seem to work

1099120
min	max
i also tried two inner joins on a sub-query for each min and max statement however it seems to be excluding some records

1099130
interpolation	splines
you can simply sample the finger location at set intervals and then interpolation the sample points using something like a catmull-rom splines

1099147
implements	extends
there is an opportunity to implements the features in ddaviesbrackett s words that we want netbooks to have other than by extends a 1970 s time-sharing os

1099152
persistent	transient
fluency seems to me much more important when your objects are subject to persistent focused attention than when they are transient and ancillary to the core logic

1099192
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
however this seems to be causing my application issues as it can get called several times dealloc didreceivememorywarning and viewdidunload

1099195
rss	feed
it s part of this rss feed

1099249
integer	unsigned
if it was an unsigned 32 bit integer you probably would need to use a long in java to capture all the possible values since java does not have unsigned types

1099263
post	get
this returns a parameter value with a given type post or get which is optional

1099264
post	get
the code gets the value from the get and post data arrays

1099271
post	get
looks like some insane way of making sure you re getting the correct get post vars

1099272
post	get
the code is a function that takes a parameter s name and the http request type it s expected to be found in get or post then looks through the current and and deprecated and request variable arrays for a value matching that name

1099356
migrate	upgrade
there used to be an utility called scptxfr.exe which was part of the standard sql server 7.0 and 2000 install.its original purpose was as part of the upgrade process that allowed sql server 6.5 databases to be migrate to sql server 7.0 and 2000

1099388
hide	show
i am using the jquery method for one of these sections to hide show the section if the use clicks an html link.

1099392
getter	setter
within the quad class definition the scale attribute can be a property with proper getter and setter functions

1099401
temp	tmp
i find myself using w meaning working as a prefix instead of temp or tmp for local variables that are just there to jockey data around like

1099416
put	get
you want to put the reference itself inside in order to get at the whole array

1099464
profiler	shark
shark is a memory profiler that comes with the apple developer tools it can be used with both iphone and mac applications

1099494
profiling	instrumentation
you ll want to use instrumentation to profiling your app

1099500
slideup	slidedown
i have it working except when my mouse goes over the trail-text area that area bounces slidedown slideup repeatedly a number of times

1099501
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation provides memory profiling tools allocated objects leaks etc... and can connect to the iphone simulator or a remote device to profiling iphone apps

1099520
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter
the problem is that the mouseover and mouseout events bubble upward which means they fire every time the mouseenter or leaves any element within your div

1099529
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest is the idea of having resources addressed with a global identifier the uri in the case of http that are accessed in a crud way using post get put and delete in the case of http .

1099616
hide	show
i have some divs that i am using jquery to hide and show using the toggle function

1099669
awt	swing
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash

1099672
udp	tcp
since tcp guarantees packet delivery and thus can be considered reliable whereas udp doesn t guarantee anything and packets can be lost

1099672
udp	tcp
what would be the advantage of transmitting data using udp in an application rather than over a tcp stream

1099684
opera	safari
i tested this properly recently in a few non-js browsers and disabled js completely in fx safari and opera and got exactly the results i was hoping for

1099692
udp	tcp
that is why these types of applications use udp instead of tcp

1099695
udp	tcp
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

1099698
udp	tcp
you want to use udp over tcp in the cases where losing some of the data along the way will not completely ruin the data being transmitted

1099712
udp	tcp
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delays needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp

1099718
udp	tcp
udp is also used in situations where the expense of creating a connection and syncing with tcp outweighs the payload

1099732
super	implements
not only is simple to implements it is super simple to implements 2s complement hardware that supports both signed and unsigned arithmetic since they are the same thing

1099734
udp	tcp
udp can be multicasted to multiple hosts whereas tcp cannot do this at all

1099771
inherited	properties
to the variable test you have now constructed a new object that inherited all the properties and methods from the gmap constructor class

1099787
firefox	safari
why would this ajax call work in safari but not firefox and how do i fix it for firefox

1099801
children	parent
parent can have also other children

1099807
udp	tcp
a big thing that people forget is that udp is packet based and tcp is bytestream based there is no guarantee that the tcp packet you sent is the packet that shows up on the other end it can be dissected into as many packets as the routers and stacks desire

1099807
udp	tcp
so the term udp packet makes sense but tcp packet doesnt necessarily

1099807
udp	tcp
tcp has its own re-try and ordering mechanism that is hidden from your application you can re-invent that with udp to tailor it to your needs

1099870
udp	tcp
there are other cases where udp is preferable to tcp

1099870
udp	tcp
one unique case where you would want to use udp instead of tcp is where you are tunneling tcp over another protocol tunnels virtual networks etc.

1099870
udp	tcp
hence one generally prefers to tunnel tcp over udp or some other stateless protocol

1099871
subtract	add
