wordpress	joomla
try looking at wordpress drupal joomla and other well known php-based cms s to see how their api hooks look and feel

79
versioning	upgrade
does anyone know if there is a way to upgrade the versioning of eclipse aptana that is built against to 3.3.0

89
svnkit	subclipse
i m not sure how aptana is different but try either upgrading javahl or switching to the pure-java svnkit implementation within the subclipse config

113
versioning	upgrade
i did upgrade directly from an older versioning to 1.5.2 though and never used 1.5.1

126
getter	setter
what is the purist or correct way to access an object s properties from within an object method that is not a getter setter method

126
getter	setter
i know that from outside of the object you should use a getter setter but from within would you just do

126
getter	setter
when i learned oo i was taught to use getter setter for every single property even if it was public and actually i was told never to make any variable property public

126
getter	setter
it appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don t need getter and setter which goes against what i was taught and what i was talking about although maybe that needs to be discussed as well

127
getter	setter
this has religious war potential but it seems to me that if you re using a getter setter you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road somebody adds code to a setter that needs to run every time that property is set and the property is being set internally w o that setter being called

139
public	protected
another approach would be to utilize a private protected method to actually do the getting caching db etc and a public wrapper for it that increments the count

143
getter	setter
if your getter setter does something you need use it

143
getter	setter
the opposite case could be made that if you use the getter setter and somebody changes the getter setter they have to analyze all the places the getter and setter is used internally to see if it messes something up

169
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter use them

195
post	put
if you want more info on this post something and i can put the script somewhere accessible

264
puts	gets
my application is pretty simple i ll be doing gets and puts of records that are about 1kb each

307
ironruby	ironpython
a different approach would be to consider a language that is specifically built for scripting such as ironruby ironpython or lua

307
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby are both available today

367
cpu	processors
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processors was booted

396
email	dkim
use email authentication methods such as spf and dkim to prove that your email and your domain name belong together and to prevent spoofing of your domain name

396
dns	spf
the spf website includes a wizard to generate the dns information for your site

430
range	min	range	max	min	max
if you supply an expected range where max 1000 min you can easily guess

451
dns	spf
yahoo uses a method called sender id which can be configured at the spf setup wizard and entered in to your dns

471
lxml	libxml2
it s in pure python and as i say pretty nice but if you wind up needing more performance then lxml exposes the same api and uses libxml2 under the hood

516
versioning	upgrade
i choose not to put schema dumps in under versioning control as alumb and others suggest because i want an easy way to upgrade my production database

516
versioning	upgrade
a sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the ddl necessary to move the schema from versioning n to n+1

516
versioning	upgrade
gets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new versioning

516
versioning	upgrade
this ensures that it s easy to see what versioning of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripts are run only once

518
folder	directory
i think you ll have to iterate through the various font folder on the system system library fonts library fonts and there can probably be a user-level directory as well library fonts

532
maven	pom.xml
we commit the pom.xml to the scs and the maven repository contains all our dependencies

535
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i am starting work on a hobby project with a python codebase and would like to set up some form of continuous integration running a battery of test-cases each time a check-in is made and sending nag e-mails to responsible persons when the tests fail similar to cruisecontrol or teamcity

549
ssl	https
ssl https encryption

549
public	protected
secret urls public url protected by digest

555
hash	salt
instead store the salt hash

555
hash	salt
the salt is a public value so you can store them with the hash in the database

568
int	chars
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others

568
int	chars
so int is a fancy way to work with an int just as perhaps string is a fancy way to work with a group of chars

576
gmail	hotmail
sign up for an account on as many major email providers as possible gmail yahoo hotmail aol etc

583
int	double
in c# int is just an alias for system.int32 string for system.string double for system.double etc.

583
int	double
personally i prefer int string double etc

591
versioning	upgrade
on all subsequent versioning i do two things i make a new text file to hold the upgrade sql scripts that contain just the alters for that versioning

591
versioning	upgrade
then rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run whatever code i have running the create upgrade scripts uses the versioning to determine what to run

650
versioning	upgrade
i would like to be able to display a versioning number in the form of 1.1.38 so when a user finds a problem i can log the versioning they are using as well as tell them to upgrade if they have an old release

669
hash	md5
md5 sha1 and des are weak password hash

696
openbsd	centos	post	get
if anyone has run across getting everything to run natively under openbsd that would be great but what i think i may have to do is setting up a second server running centos with db2 installed most likely via zendcore for ibm since it seems to do all this for me and the driver so that i can set up a small transaction server that i can post against and get a json representation of the db2 data that i need

754
int	chars
1 to capitalize it in say c - use the ascii codes to find the int value of the chars and subtract 32 from it

766
postgresql	mysql
i can get python to work with postgresql but i cannot get it to work with mysql

798
mbunit	nunit
mbunit is worth alook it has a set of features comparable to nunit it has its own gui or can be integrated into vs if you have resharper

886
pull	push
if you need a change from someone else though she has to commit to her local repo and then she must push that changeset to you or you must pull it from her

886
pull	push
someone has to be responsible for doing that push pull from everyone else s repository resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before then doing the build and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos

893
pull	push
if it were just 2 people i d say git is also easier because you can just push and pull from eachother

906
translation	localization
if you get lazy and don t notify the people in charge of translation or you embed strings without going through your localization system it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later

1043
hex	binary
w2k edit binary select data format hex click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok

1043
hex	binary
wxp right-click the value choose modify binary data click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok

1061
punctuation	words
the # char is indexed as punctuation and therefore ignored so it looks like we ll remove the letter c from our words indexing ignore lists

1069
disk	ram
when running under a sophisticated debug environment rational purify vs2008 msvc9 or even microsoft application verifier the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn t crash memory-bound cpu is not getting above 50 disk light is not on the program s going as fast it can box consuming 1.3g of 2g of ram

1070
solaris	aix
what is the correct way to get the process size on solaris hp-ux and aix

1131
chm	winhelp
then microsoft decided that winhelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to chm up to the point they actually axed winhelp from vista

1131
chm	winhelp
but with winhelp not being an option anymore either i wonder what the alternatives are especially when it comes to integrate with my application for winhelp and chm there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic

1145
free	realloc
if i try to use realloc i get an error that tells me i am doing a double free - which i don t see how i am since i am only using realloc

1149
realloc	malloc
just a shot in the dark because i haven t tried it yet but when you realloc it returns the pointer much like malloc

1154
free	realloc
as a general rule you should never do a free or realloc on a user provided buffer

1189
opera	firefox
firefox ie and opera all load successfully in the same scenario

1216
assemblyinfo	csproj
customizing csproj files to autogenerate assemblyinfo

1238
chm	winhelp
if you don t want to use an installer and you don t want the user to perform any extra steps to allow chm files over the network why not fall back to winhelp

1269
cvs	svn
the two approaches are more or less the same idea but svn was specifically designed to fix long standing flaws in cvs so in theory at least svn will always be the better choice

1272
cvs	svn
cvs only tracks modification on a file-by-file basis while svn tracks a whole commit as a new revision which means that it is easier to follow the history of your project

1272
cvs	svn
add the fact that all modern source control software use the concept of revision so it is far easier to migrate from svn than it is from cvs

1278
cvs	svn
svn has 3 main advantages over cvs

1312
turkish	thai
i was just listening to a podcast from scott hanselman this morning where he talks about internationalization especially the really tricky things like turkish with it s four i s and thai

1314
nant	cruisecontrol
we have been using cruisecontrol for quite a while with nunit and nant

1331
robocopy	xcopy
note xcopy is now deprecated please use robocopy

1415
imap	nntp
imap pop3 and nntp

1453
put	get
i don t want to put a magic number in there for weight since the object i am using has a defaultweight parameter that all new shipments get if you don t specify a weight

1488
subtract	addition
in addition to john downey and jdecuyper s solutions i ve also added an explicit deny bit at the end beginning of the bitfield so that you can perform additive permissions by group role membership and then subtract permissions based upon explicit deny entries much like ntfs works permission-wise

1496
vim	emacs
for those of us that like to use the graphical version of vim or emacs instead of the console version which version do you recommend

1496
emacs	aquamacs
for emacs carbonemacs xemacs and aquamacs

1517
macvim	textmate
macvim works well and certainly looks more mature than vim-cocoa moreover there is a cocoa plugin architecture in the pipeline for macvim and someone is already working on a textmate style file browser tray plugin which is a huge ++ imho

1528
inherited	properties
some of the more recent descendant classes inherited dependency properties which have become vestigial and can be a little confusing when using intellisense or using the classes in a visual designer

1595
int	chars
to capatilise it in say c - use the ascii codes to find the int value of the chars and subtract 32 from it

1595
int	chars
use library calls don t assume you can use int arithmetic on your chars to get back something useful

1718
phpunit	simpletest
this started with junit in the java world and has become a best practice in php as well with simpletest and phpunit

1762
hide	show
i am trying to set a flag to show or hide a page element but it always displays even when the expression is false

1820
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i like testdriven.net even though i use resharper and i m pretty happy with xunit.net

1821
nunit	mstest
for the microsoft-types mstest is adequate but slow and clunky compared to nunit

1821
mbunit	nunit
oh and testdriven.net will give you ide integration for both nunit and mbunit

1894
versioning	upgrade
i create folders named after the build versioning and put upgrade and downgrade scripts in there

1894
versioning	upgrade
each one contains the script that allows you to upgrade or downgrade your database between versioning

1936
submit	submission
one such situation is when you encounter validation errors after a form submission and need to redirect back to the form but would like the url to reflect the url of the form not the action page it submit to

1936
post	get
if i use the viewdata parameter my post parameters will be changed to get parameters

1995
int	double
i have values stored as strings in a datatable where each value could really represent an int double or string they were all converted to strings during an import process from an external data source

1995

for all the rss feed i subscribe to i use google reader which i love

2048
rss	feed
i do however have a couple of specific rss feed that i d like to be notified of as soon as they get updated say for example an rss feed for a forum i like to monitor and respond to as quickly as possible

2057
rss	feed
i ve used pingie in the past to send me an sms when a new items appears in an rss feed

2064
rss	feed
as matthew stated you really shouldn t bother an rss feed more than the producer allows but you can use http headers to check for changes in a very light way which is something rss2email does quite well

2067
mvp	presenter
mvp designs have the presenter access the model and interact with the view

2080
rss	feed
if you have access to microsoft outlook 2007 or thunderbird these email clients allow you to add rss feed in the same way you would add an email account

2080
rss	feed
i use google reader generally but when i want to keep up-to-date with something specific i add the rss feed to outlook and it arrives in my inbox as if it was an email

2120
hash	md5
i want to get the md5 hash of a string value in sql server 2005

2222
cairngorm	flex
also are there any other resources on how to do flex development the right way besides the cairngorm microarchitecture example

2328
client-side	server-side
for example if we have a client-side ajax action to add a new item to the grid and then a row is dragged the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side

2360
mouse	keyboard
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

2361
mouse	keyboard
apple menu system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts

2374
cvs	svn
from a mechanical perspective you will need to see if they use svn for example on google code or cvs for example on sourceforge and determine if they use patch or some other method

2525
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization

2562
wmv	flv
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

2702
aggregate-functions	sum
i know i need to have although i don t know why a group by clause on the end of a sql query that uses any aggregate-functions like count sum avg etc

2750
getter	setter
i m wondering if it s a good idea to make verifications in getter and setter or elsewhere in the code

2750
getter	setter
this might surprise you be when it comes to optimizations and speeding up the code i think you should not make verifications in getter and setter but in the code where you re updating your files or database

2754
getter	setter
validation should be captured separately from getter or setter in a validation method

2761
getter	setter
well one of the reaons why classes usually contain private members with public getter setter is exactly because they can verify data

2865
rss	feed
i would first find out if the site s in question provide an api server or rss feed for access the data you require

2884
ubuntu	linux
if you do feel like using linux then you could try ubuntu

2884
unix	solaris
modesty mono provides the necessary software to develop and run .net client and server applications on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

2905
mouse	keyboard
if you keep at it you can use exclusively the keyboard and never touch the mouse which increases your editing speed by a significant margin

2905
emacs	gedit
update i think gedit is exclusively gui based though so it would be useful to learn emacs in case you are stuck with just a shell it is fully featured in both shell and graphical mode

2905
vim	emacs
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too

2905
emacs	gedit
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

2976
versioning	upgrade
revert your site back to a known good status and if need be upgrade to the latest versioning

2984
clang	llvm
i ve heard good things about clang static analyzer which iirc uses llvm as it s backend

3010
gmail	hotmail
personally i ran mine through a freshly installed spam assassin a trained spam assassin and multiple hotmail gmail and aol accounts

3019
getter	setter
if i remember well there was an option through which you could ask vs to create the setter and getter automatically for you

3026
getter	setter
if you are using visual studio 2005 and up you can create a setter getter real fast using the insert snippet command

3030
button	checkbox
for example if i have a treeview with checkbox think installation of a new program choose features to install page i might want a check all button which would be something like this pseudocode

3032
getter	setter
this will create a getter setter property for a variable

3032
getter	setter
i m not too big a fan of this technique as it is a little bit awkward to use if you have to create a lot of getter setter and it puts the property directly below the private field which bugs me because i usually have all of my private fields grouped together and this visual studio feature breaks my class formatting

3075
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have a simple page with my scriptmanager and my updatepanel and my contenttemplate has one listbox and one label

3106
ubuntu	linux
i m developing some cross platform software targeting mono under visual studio and would like to be able to build the installers for windows and linux ubuntu specifically with a single button click

3143
teamcity	nant
i m compiling a nant project on linux with teamcity continuous integration server

3143
teamcity	nant
update take a look at mbunittask its a nant task that uses sends messages that teamcity expects from nunit so it lets you use all of teamcity s features for tests

3217
kate	kde
kate the kde advanced text editor is quite good

3234
gif	png
i am able to display images of type gif jpeg png all i have tested so far bit trying to display .swf or .ico files gives me a nice little error

3315
ienumerable	ienumerator
but of course the compiler spits its dummy because foreach expects an ienumerable rather than an ienumerator

3437
ssl	https
will the maps api work over ssl https

3457
firefox	safari
so long as it works in ie firefox safari insert other browser here you should be okay

3464
int	double
in java the primitive wrappers classes like int double float boolean.

3464
getter	setter
so that this classes only has getter methods no setter besides the constructor

3485
getter	setter	public	protected
i can be wrong because i m autodidact but i never user public properties in my java clases they are allways private or protected so that outside code must access by getter setter

3485
getter	setter
if getter method is trivial i use the property directly but i allways use the setter methods because i could easily add code to fire events if i wish

3486
post	get
precisely i don t want users automating access to forms issuing direct get post http requests to the appropriate servlet

3511
addition	multiplication
according to bodmas multiplication should always be done before addition therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to bodmas and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5

3603
mbunit	nunit
we use nunit and mbunit here

3776
hide	show
once they are added they could be flipped through using hide show or bringtofront sendtoback methods

3790
put	get
what i want to know is if there s some kind of redistributable that can be packaged with our software to allow 64-bit users to get the wmi installer provider put onto their machines

3795
hide	show
why not just show hide the proper container when a node is selected in the grid

3862
cvs	svn
the major centralized vcs are cvs and svn

3862
cvs	svn
todo write explanation on what branches are and why merging is hard with cvs svn

3862
pull	push
distributed vcs let everyone have their own server where you can pull changes from other people and push changes to a server

3869
perforce	svn
my recommendation you re safest with either git svn or perforce since a lot of people use them they are cross platform have good guis you can buy books about them etc

3869
cvs	rcs
dont consider cvs sccs rcs they are antique

3881
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
i have always been torn in this situation should i throw an illegalargumentexception or a nullpointerexception

3886
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
it seems like an illegalargumentexception is called for if you don t want null to be an allowed value and the nullpointerexception would be thrown if you were trying to use a variable that turns out to be null

3895
bazaar	git
please do not use git or hg or bazaar because of the hype

3895
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
use git or hg or bazaar because they are better tools for managing source code than svn

3979
mbunit	nunit
i used to use nunit but i switched to mbunit since it has more features

4080
cobertura	emma
code coverage tools cobertura emma and any others

4098
emacs	textmate
you can try emacs with ruby-mode rinari for rails and yasnippet which provides automatic snippets like textmate

as the user changes settings using the app s ui clicking checkbox choosing radio button etc. i plan to be writing those changes out to the appsettings

4166
ant	jdepend
we use findbugs and jdepend integrated with ant

4221
listview	gridview	gridview	linqdatasource	gridview	repeater
i m going to use the linqdatasource with the listview control not a gridview or repeater

4231
gridview	linqdatasource	gridview	repeater
i know that if you use a paging repeater or gridview with the linqdatasource it will automatically optimize the number of results returned but i m also pretty sure in the datasource wizard you can go to advanced options and limit it to

4260
post	get
a post with some links to get you started in that direction is here

4312
phpunit	simpletest
i like php so phpunit or simpletest work well

4332
min	max
start title dpath i min max separate | shared

4408
.htaccess	httpd.conf
another solution would be to set an include path in your httpd.conf or an .htaccess

4455
put	get
i get that you re mocking the ianimals seeing as apparently you don t yet have any concrete animals to play with but why not just make them stubs because obviously you re not expecting anything else to happen to them apart from being put into the list

4586
pentaho	olap
i m not completely familiar with the implications of step 2 in your approach above but if you re looking for a more robust olap solution it might be worth your while to check out mondrian the open-source olap analysis services module of pentaho

4627
versioning	upgrade
is it possible to upgrade my asp.net web server to versioning 3.x of the .net framework

4670
bazaar	git
so i want to get a project on a distributed version control system such as mercurial git or bazaar

4678
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are typical hash algorithms

4691
tunnel	vpn
another option that is often useful as it works over a vpn or simple ssh connectivity is ssh tunnel or x11 forwarding over ssh

4692
rss	feed
i wrote a powershell provider to give me access to ie7 s rss feed store and had lots of fun with it

4692
folder	dir
it lets me cd to a drive called feed and navigate around folder and feeds using cd and dir

4706
vmware	esx
it works with vmware server and workstation but afaik it s not available for esx server

4755
lisp	scheme
two semesters ago i used scheme a language based on lisp to write an interactive program that simulated abbott and costello s who s on first routine

4755
lisp	scheme
in summary learning lisp or scheme may not yield many practical applications beyond ai but it is an extremely valuable learning experience as many others have stated

4768
tunnel	vpn
x11 forwarding with ssh is secure and uses the existing ssh connection to tunnel so working through a vpn should be no problem

4897
keydown	keyup
each time keyup or keydown is fired update the reference to the active selected item in the data structure

4924
button	checkbox
one method you can used to obtain this option is by placing a checkbox object and changing its appearance from normal to button this will give you the same functionality that i believe you are looking for

4937
vim	emacs
vim or emacs varying on religion will always be my first answer to this question over any point-and-click ide

4968
ready	each
then at the end of each day or whenever you merge together whatever you are ready to test and you check it out onto the dev server and test it

5036
vim	emacs
if you are taking your time switching to linux i d switch to emacs or vim at some point as well

5036
vim	emacs
the key with either vim or emacs is knowing it could probably take you the better part of the day just to figure out what you want them to do let alone how to get them to do that

5071
cvs	svn
do you guys know any way to recursively add everything in a given directory to the current cvs project or if svn or git makes this notably easier

5142
interbase	bde
bde administration version 5.01 installed with interbase 4.0 drivers

5179
post	get
an httpwebrequest works great if you don t want to redirect and javascript is fine in some cases but can get tricky if you really do need the server-side code to get the data together for the post

5320
gtk	motif
there s a particularly good port for python wxpython as well as versions for different languages -- c# c++ perl and ruby come to mind -- and for various guis win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince

5322
versioning	upgrade
then you put your scripts to build a new database in your versioning control and it ll either build a new database or upgrade any existing database to the schema in versioning control

5343
ada	pascal
bindings exist for ada qtada 4 c # qyoto kimono 5 java qt jambi 6 pascal perl php php-qt ruby rubyqt and python pyqt

5357
implements	extends
i don t know how java is implements internally but if the constructor of the superclass throws an exception then there isn t a instance of the class you extends

5357
equals	tostring
it would be impossible to call the tostring or equals methods for example since they are inherited in most cases

5382
int	boolean
they re called bitwise but they are defined for both int and boolean data types in c#

5445
int	boolean	int	double
it is pointless and distracting but is in relatively heavy use at my company at least for types like int strings boolean and double

5462
versioning	upgrade
the times i ve run into headaches using cs is when the client wants functionality cs does not provide but also insists on keeping the ability to upgrade to the latest versioning whenever telligent releases an update

5503
expressionengine	multisite
expressionengine with the multisite manager works great for that kind of situation

5572
hash	salt
also if you are going to store the password field i highly recommend storing the password as a salt hash binary in the database

5823
mouse	keyboard
take command does support copy cut paste from the keyboard and the mouse

5872
folder	directory
i m getting tired of making a branch and then going through the branch and deleting all of the .svn folder the docs directory and my prototyping files

5887
folder	directory
right click the root project folder tortoisesvn export and tell it where you want the .svn free directory

5943
for-loop	loops
the reasoning is that you have n iterations in the for-loop and o 1 work in side loops

getter	setter
in my form class i wouldn t think twice about using getter and maybe setter around this even if they didn t do anything other than provide direct access to the variable

5997
getter	setter
however the vs designer doesn t seem to implement such getter setter for those public objects that are components on a form and therefore does not comply with good programming practice

5997
getter	setter
in order to do the right thing should i wrap such vs designer components or objects in a getter and or setter

6003
getter	setter
i always do that and if you are following an mvp design creating getter setter for your view components would be a design requirement

6003
getter	setter
microsoft violates a lot of good programming practices to make it easier to create stuff on visual studio for the sake of rapid app development and i do not see the lack of getter setter for controls as evidence of violating any such best practices

6005
getter	setter
the reason for not implementing getter and setter for components on a form i believe is cause they wouldn t be thread safe .net objects are suppose to be only modified by the form thread that created them if you put on getter and setter you are potentially opening it up for any thread

6014
put	get
the general idea i have in mind is create one that before the commit will put the new revision number in the file get it using svnlook or maybe change a bogus property on the file it has to change or svn will ignore it

6018
getter	setter
however the vs designer doesn t seem to implement such getter setter for those public objects that are components on a form and therefore does not comply with good programming practice

6018
getter	setter
a form could have forty or fifty controls it d be somewhat unnecessary and unwieldy to provide a getter setter for every control on the form

6018
getter	setter
the designer leaves it up to you to provide delegated access to specific controls via public getter setter

6022
maven	cobertura
cobertura for our coverage reports - run from maven

6095
hide	show
public methods or properties are behavior show hide position or data-oriented set data get data update data

6113
post	get
unfortunately i can t get to the jon galloway post at work so i can t judge if that will work

6188
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
standards based and works in ie6 safari firefox opera etc

6192
free	malloc
the inefficient malloc free backend

6199
folder	directory
use the export command to export to a folder called export in the same directory as a file called deploy.bat then i run the deploy script v1 stands for version 1 which is what version i am currently on in this project this script utilizes 7-zip which i have placed on my system path so i can use it as a command line utility

6285
firefox	safari
if safari and firefox support is good enough for you there is a css solution

6296
rss	feed
in my work place we ve set up a post-commit hook that generates rss feed that are displayed in various dash boards and are used for code reviewers to know when it is time to review and for us to see that new employees are committing enough

6309
integer	unsigned
typically integer values are signed unless you explicitly need an unsigned value

6344
min	max
also it won t work if your min and max are greater than 10000

6359
rss	feed
as the lead developer i get a roll-up of commits every morning via the rss feed from that basecamp forum and can see what my team has been up to pretty quickly

6371
versioning	upgrade
a follow-up question how do you track database versioning so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance

6371
post	put
it s about 200 lines so i won t post it though i might put it on pastebin if there s interest

6378
put	get
i m starting to get the feeling that each of these client implement different parts of the standard and i m unsure of what pieces of information we should be trying to export from the application so that someone can put it on their calendar especially around recurrence

6382
versioning	upgrade
these scripts will upgrade the current production database to the new versioning in development

6405
free	malloc
just malloc a new buffer return that and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text

6441
firefox	safari
the following code works great in ie but not in firefox or safari

6441
firefox	safari
it works great in ie but the problem manifests itself in firefox 3 in my case and safari all on windows xp

6456
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari document.frm in your code evaluates to undefined

6463
folder	directory
flubba does this allow me to have folder inside my include directory

6471
solaris	aix
at least it didn t worked in aix and solaris

6543
implements	sealed
is there a way to implements a sealed class from an interface.

6578
free	malloc
i m reasonably comfortable with c s malloc and free concept but cocoa s references counting scheme has me rather confused

6607
config	ini
storing them in a local ini file or config file or similar

6614
free	malloc
the basic way this differs from malloc and free is that any given object doesn t need to worry about other parts of the system crashing because you ve free memory they were using

6620
config	ini
if you just need a simple way to store config information i would recommend a config file using ini or xml as the format

6651
bazaar	git
there s a nice comparison between git hg and bazaar in this infoq article

6658
junit	testng
we have been considering switching over to junit 4 for new tests being written but i have been keeping an eye on testng for a while now

6658
junit	testng
what experiences have you all had with either junit 4 or testng and which seems to work better for very large numbers of tests

6659
junit	testng	junit	unitils	junit	easymock	testng	unitils	testng	easymock	easymock	unitils
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

6661
onmousedown	onmouseup
i m aware of things like onchange onmousedown and onmouseup but is there a good reference somewhere that lists all of them complete with possibly a list of the elements that they cover

6671
junit	testng
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

6757
config	ini
if it s a small application and you want to have aspects of it user-configurable without making a config form go for a quick ini file

6778
firefox	safari
the background renders correctly in firefox and safari however as soon as you use the browser s scroll bar then mouse over the flash control you must click once to activate the control

6824
profiling	benchmarking
but it s a guess try benchmarking and or profiling the two to get a proper comparison

6824
profiler	perf
if you suspect a perf bottleneck then stick a profiler on your code and see where it really is

6854
png	ico
i like the free silk icons at famfamfam but they re png s and when i convert them to ico format they look pretty crappy

6932
mp3	flv
i d like to do something like youtube or google video where users can upload whatever format they want and i encode it to flv mp3 and or mp4

6950
mouse	keyboard
the left monitor is actually a separate computer running linux and keyboard mouse shared with synergy so i have multiple ebooks or documentation pages open one on each virtual desktop.

6955
atomic	compare-and-swap
edit chris s suggestion to use an atomic compare-and-swap would certainly work

7020
processors	work-stealing
or if you prefer have one reader thread assign the lines to three other processors threads via their own queues and implement a work-stealing strategy

7031
hide	show
using javascript to show and hide buttons and php to check to see which buttons to show

7035
ubuntu	linux
i m writing a few little bash scripts under ubuntu linux

7035
sudo	passwd
so far the only input required is a passwd for sudo - and gksudo handles that fine

7080
stdout	stderr
the following will silence both stdout and stderr

7080
stdout	stderr
the following silences stdout but stderr will still appear via stdout

7087
hide	show
if you don t intend to show the buttons it s not useful to send the html and images to the browser and then hide them with javascript

7097
getter	setter
in the book he talks about how to handle mutable objects that callers pass to your code in setter and mutable objects that you pass to callers in getter

7098
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you are using a browser that doesn t implement border-radius google-chrome pre-v4 firefox pre-v4 ie8 opera pre-v10.5 safari pre-v5 then the links below detail a whole bunch of different approaches

7099
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
although this works ok in the latest versions of safari and firefox but not at all in ie7 and i don t think in ie8 or opera

7104
accessor	properties
the best you can do is detect when this happens and throw an exception by checking that instance is non-null in the properties accessor

7151
actionlink	redirecttoaction
unlike rails url_for anchor urlhelper.generateurl and actionlink redirecttoaction and so on which use it don t have a magic property name that lets you encode an anchor

7190
ncover	nant
we are currently looking at configuring cruise control to work with nant nunit ncover and trac as a test case

7192
coalesce	isnull
using coalesce or isnull for that matter as shown in the link in lance s post uses a similar method but doesn t leave you with an extra comma to remove

7206
opera	safari
there is now a firebug lite that works on other browsers such as internet explorer safari and opera built

7221
ncover	cruisecontrol	ncover	fxcop
we use cruisecontrol with nunit ncover fxcop svn and some custom tools we wrote ourselves to produce the reports

7222
opera	safari
this is the firebug lite that john was referring to that works on ie safari and opera

7257
int	double
as you have a string i d look at whether you need to know that it s an int rather than a double

7257
int	double
if int.tryparse passes then so will double.tryparse so you could half the number of checks - return either double or string and floor the double when you expect an int

7276
feedback	review
it might help if your code review feedback or discussions reference the book so he or she has a thread to pick up and follow

7343
folder	directory
i m not in a position to modify the permissions on folder especially outside of the virtual directory home folder and don t already have an app_data folder so am a bit hesitant to go with that

7345
folder	directory
i m not in a position to modify the permissions on folder especially outside of the virtual directory home folder and don t already have an app_data folder so am a bit hesitant to go with that

7367
inherited	properties
i m looking for help setting a new default properties value for an inherited control in visual studio

7385
int	boolean
darren that would work if the types were specific enumerations - for general enumerations to work you have to cast them to int or more likely uint to do the boolean math

7470
rss	feed
after a couple hours fighting with the gallery2 rss module and getting only the message no feed have yet been defined i gave up

7540
cpu	processors
i would like to be able to see what tabs are using what percent of my processors via the javascript on that page or anything in the page that is causing cpu memory usage

7669
stdout	stdio
it opens a console then shoves the right handles into stdout and stdin so the debug function which was designed as a stdio interactive function can interact with the newly created console

7682
stdout	stderr
msvcrt tries to emulate the unix handle numbers where stdin 0 stdout 1 stderr 2 and so on

7715
organization	naming
naming is hard but in every organization there is someone who can name things and in every software team there should be someone who takes responsibility for namings standards and ensures that naming issues like sec_id sec_value and security_id get resolved early before they get baked into the project

7724
organization	naming
the adventureworks sample uses a very clear and consistent naming convention that uses schema names for the organization of database objects

7729
apache	lighttpd
the server-side part of this http pseudo-streaming method is fairly simple to implement for example in php as an apache module or a lighttpd module

7756
unix	solaris
the problem is that the op s data seems to be comma delimited and solaris 8 s uniq doesn t allow you any way specify the record separator so there wasn t a super clean way to do the preprocessing using standard unix tools

7756
uniq	grep
you could probably massage the uniq output into a single regexp to feed to grep but the benefit would only be known if the op posts expected ratio of lines containing suspected duplicate keys to total lines in the file

7771
rss	feed
i use rss bandit for windows to stay up to date with my rss feed blogs

7771
rss	feed
if you don t want another big application but have windows vista you could also choose to make internet explorer monitor the rss feed and use the feed sidebar application called feedschlagzeilen in german version not sure about the english one that comes with vista to show the latest headlines

7815
post	get
i did not copy any of his answer here to ensure patrick steele get s credit for his post

7833
firefox	safari
however in firefox 3.0.1 and safari 3.1.2 you must click the play button twice to see the animation

7852
textmate	geany
when i searched for textmate alternative for linux i ended up using geany

7856
profiling	debugging
set up a profiling for development then debugging by tweaking the source code adding logging and alert s and reloading the affected window

7873
contentplaceholder	loginview
is there a way to hide this on the loginview as the contentplaceholder does an excellent job for this

7926
apache	nginx
it s a lot easier to get going than the traditional solution of apache nginx + mongrel

7949
gedit	bbedit
classic menubar-based editors like winedit gedit or bbedit

7949
emacs	aquamacs
emacs and its brethren xemacs aquamacs etc

7949
emacs	textmate
emacs and textmate are also easily extensible by user-created scripts in lisp emacs or any other command-line-language textmate

7957
versioning	upgrade
when restoring backup sets from an earlier versioning of sql server a database upgrade may be required

7958
hide	show
you can use javascript to hide the elements just before displaying an overlay then show them again once you re done

7986
rss	feed
personally i prefer to send a message to something i can get an rss feed from as an email-per-commit would overload my inbox pretty quickly

8035
int	chars
e is assumed to be an int converted to an unsigned chars and printed

8042
ienumerable	iqueryable
is this what ms have done to ienumerable and iqueryable for linq

8249
fseek	ftell
change the definition to int so that error messages can be transmitted and then use fseek and ftell to determine the file size

8250
fseek	ftell
a quick search in google found a method using fseek and ftell and a thread with this question with answers that it can t be done in just c in another way

8273
integer	unsigned
iirc the standard library defines off_t as an unsigned 64 bit integer which is what everyone should be using

8286
rss	feed
seconding matt miller on rss feed

8286
rss	feed
there s a useful tool called websvn that offers rss feed of every repository and individual branches tags folders with full commit messages

8369
.nettiers	codesmith
in c# i love linq to sql for anything new but i really like using .nettiers + codesmith generator to get a quick and dirty data layer to the database happening if i m using c# on .net 2.0

8371
ssl	https
i have a server on https for which i paid an ssl certification for and a mirror for which i haven t and keep around for just for emergencies so it doesn t merit getting a certification for

8381
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology -

8484
post	get
then if they are not then send it i m sure it wont take that many post to get to 100 and the community will instantly dive on anyone seem to be spamming with offensive tags why not add a report spam link that downmods by 200

8532
int	boolean
and why does increasing the boolean query s static max clauses int actually make this error go away when i m definitely only using a prefix query

8573
accessor	properties
this creates a proper accessor to that control that won t expose the control s whole set of properties

8574
hide	show
you can use this public property to hide or show the control or to ask the control current visibility property

8602
put	get
you could get visual c++ express and put together the startup program pretty easily

8636
int	double
for many types int double datetime etc there is a static parse method

8730
postgresql	mysql
if a query is more then just a simple select on a single table i always run it through explain if i am on mysql or postgresql

8770
cairngorm	flex
about how to develop flex applications the right way i wouldn t look too much at the cairngorm framework

8770
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
it uses flex to its full potential doesn t rely on global variables as cairngorm and puremvc and it makes it possible to write much more decoupled code

8941
implements	extends
plus if you then need to later extends to any lightweight custom types they can also implements the same interface with no changes required to the base code

8950
firefox	safari
edit browsing a sharepoint wss site on a mac whether using firefox or safari has a very similar look and feel as it does on windows ie

8970
macbook	isight
is it possible to access the isight camera on a macbook programmatically

9030
ssl	https
enabling ssl https for iis in windows xp

9033
accessor	properties
properties accessor accessibility modifiers by xanadont

9040
put	get
even if you do get it to switch drives it still is going to put a lot of stuff on the system drive

9067
sorting	filtering
with this property in my baseclass i can automate handling of paging setting filtering values to filtering a gridview make sorting really easy etc

9102
postgresql	mysql
if you re using mysql or postgresql there s various tools for seeing query activity in real time but i haven t found a tool as good as the sql profiler for measuring query performance over time

9142
mp3	ogg
i ve been looking at the ntag project as well which handles mp3 wma ogg

9193
freebsd	linux
linux freebsd and mac os x this final one on different hardware all degrade much more gracefully in terms of aggregate bandwidth when moving from one thread to two

9193
freebsd	linux
my home unbranded pc amd athlon64 running windows xp 32-bit freebsd 64-bit and linux 64-bit with single drive

9196
folder	directory
delete the bin and obj folder in your solution directory

9218
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
let the nice package maintainers from linux distros such as debian or ubuntu do the work for you

9240
getter	setter
in your business logic layer you have described your business objects getter setter accessors and so on.

9288
folder	directory
this takes all of the files in my home directory and uses rsync s archive mode -a verbosly -v lists all of the changes made -i while deleting any files that don t exist anymore --delete and puts the in the folder home me school on my remote server

9304
getter	setter
but when i want to actually implement some getter setter logic i have to use the private public pair anyway

9304
getter	setter
i see the benefit that i save a lot of code one vs six lines without losing the ability to change the getter setter logic later but then again i can already do that by simply declaring a public field public string title without the need of the get

9308
getter	setter
if you want to do stuff in getter or setter there s no problem to convert them to normal properties later on

9308
getter	setter
also the properties allow you to set different access levels for the getter and setter which you can t do with a field

9421
int	chars
for a function that returns an int and takes a chars you would do

9596
getter	setter
but then again i prefer my private public pair to be together because that allows for easier debugging of getter setter logic as you see the private and public property next to each other

9615
svg	vml
ie handles vml though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser svg vs

9615
mouseover	mouseout
the level of interactivity i need is ability to detect dom events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover mouseout click etc

9639
int	boolean
results in a null if t is a reference type and 0 if it is an int false if it is a boolean

9654
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
safari opera and firefox all support svg natively eg

9654
svg	vml
unfortunately any standards based approach is kind of destroyed by ie s willful disregard of what is happening outside its own ecosystem however there are a number of libraries that try to convert canvas svg into vml ie s proprietary vector language such as iecanvas

9749
vmware	esx
vmware esx vmware server xen installations..

9769
profiling	debugging
i d like to script flexbuilder so that i can run debugging or profiling without having to switch to flexbuilder and manually clicking the button or using the key combo

9788
subtraction	addition
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten

9801
postgresql	mysql
if you really want a free alternative that is similar to ms sql and supports growth should you need it you could have a look at mysql or postgresql

9810
globalization	localization
take into consideration the fact that for globalization localization purposes some parts of the world use different calendars methods of organization of the year

9814
addeventlistener	onload
there still is an ugly solution which is far inferior to using a framework or addeventlistener attachevent that is to save the current onload event

9826
queue	fifo
while linux and others can choose between different policies before vista windows was locked in a single policy a fifo queue where all requests where splitted in 64 kb blocks

9910
post	get
a recent post from 37signals gearheads don t get it really sums up a good point about not focusing on the technical details but content and community
