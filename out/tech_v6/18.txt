800011
murmurhash	fnv
the recommended hash functions for these data structures these days are fnv jenkins and murmurhash

800015
integer	fractions
an easy solution is to split and count the floating point value when still a string eg splitting at the decimal point and counting the integer part length and the fractions part length then create the formatter as

800016
stdout	stderr
in more complex scenarios where you want to fetch stdout stderr or the return code you can use well known standard modules like ipc open2 and ipc open3

800021
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
it starts by calling either document.addeventlistener domcontentloaded or document.attachevent onreadystatechange depending on the event model and goes on from there

800034
stdout	stderr
there is also no point in returning stdout stderr or exit status of the command

800034
stdout	stderr
it allows you to read stdout stderr and write to stdin of your command

800071
mouse	keyboard
and then the command can be pushed in an execution queue both when the user presses a keyboard button moves the mouse or without a trigger with the playback mechanism

800105
stdout	stderr
ipc open3 run a process and create a pipe to stdin stdout and stderr

800128
post	get
if you send a get request to index.php you ll show some output and if you send a post request to index.php you ll perform some data manipulation

800137
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i am trying to make a for-loop that checks a 16 element arrays so it loops from 0 to 15

800169
for-loop	loops
the criteria of using a for-loop instead of a while loops is that you know beforehand exactly how many times a for-loop will execute

800176
ienumerable	iqueryable
the kind of thing that i was after was replacing the queryable constant in the expression tree with a concrete ienumerable or iqueryable via .asqueryable result set...this is a complex topic that probably only makes any sense to linq provider writers who are knee deep in expression tree visitors etc

800179
wmv	asf
i m compressing raw avi files to wmv using the asf writer

800187
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is equivalent to the following while loops

800209
uitableview	nsindexpath
cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

800217
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
because the dictionary doesn t implement inotifypropertychanged or inotifycollectionchanged

800230
mouse	keyboard
if i have no nodes selected and that treeview gains focus i ll get an afterselect event with the first node selected even though i didn t select it using the keyboard mouse or programmatically

800235
bash	zsh
i need to change the following bash code to zsh

800237
for-loop	loops
you cannot accomplish this with the built-in loops structures and as bill the lizard said you probably don t really want to reuse the for-loop variable

800264
post	get
the best resources i ve found to get my head around uac is is robert flamings blog he s got a series of about 25 post that explain how vista uac and msi all interact

800295
stdout	stderr
when i wrote this code i would also get the error via stdout stderr

800295
stdout	stderr
the best way to redirect stdout stderr in your process is by using freopen

800296
awt	swing
what you really must understand with dealing with swing and in fact awt is that you need to keep all interaction with the components of the awt event dispatch thread edt

800334
stdout	stderr
after getting a hold of stdout and stderr which you ll need anyway add -xcheck jni to your jvm command line to get extra jni-related warnings from the jvm

800354
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but it obviously can t use msxml in firefox google-chrome safari opera etc

800367
cvs	svn
in the cvs svn world there are various statistics metrics tools

800397
hudson	bamboo
atlassian bamboo cost sun hudson free and cruise control free are all popular options in order of my preference and have support to handle phpunit output because phpunit support junit output

800399
swt	swing
then swt interferes with swing

800433
folder	directory
they certainly can t run in the same folder or virtual directory

800437
post	get
the general rule of thumb is that if you re retrieving something use get but if you re sending or changing something use post

800505
executable	upx
related question are there any downsides to using upx to compress a windows executable

800509
post	get
you can use get or post

800539
os.path	shutil
i just wrote some code to move vmware virtual machines around and ended up using os.path and shutil to accomplish file copying between sub-directories

800543
hash	salt
how can i migrate those passwords to a stronger encryption schema involving a salt user-specific hash and their password all encrypted with sha1 bcrypt whatever

800551
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function not necessarily an encryption method

800551
salt	md5
you will probably want to save these old passwords in a separate column then when the users login to the new system compare the md5 ed version of that password with the old one and if the digest matches perform sha1 with a salt on that password and store that in a separate column

800682
hash	md5
the part of rex m s answer about using sha1 to generate a hash is a good one md5 is also a popular option

800685
hash	md5
md5 16 bytes time to hash 500mb 1462 ms

800685
hash	md5
under normal situations when you use the md5 algorithm with no malicious intent and no third party has any malicious intent would you expect any collisions meaning two arbitrary byte producing the same hash

800685
hash	md5
2 random file-names with same md5 hash with md5 sha1 sha2xx in general what are the odds for non-malicious collisions

800687
width	height
try to preload the image into hidden dom and when it loads you can try to get its width height

800697
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
as long as you don t care to protect against collisions you are still safe to use md5 in an hmac as well and you do want the speed sometimes you want a slower hash then you can still use md5 confidently

800699
hash	md5
i am not an expert at this sort of thing but i keep up with the security community and a lot of people there consider the md5 hash broken

800707
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in ie6 firefox 3.0.5 and google-chrome and they all work

800711
stdout	stderr
if you click on that you will see the stdout and stderr output of your running application

800712
execl	fork
so basically i set up a pipe and fork and then call execl

800720
mp3	wav
decode the mp3 to wav reverse the order of the samples re-encode to mp3 then play it

800775
implements	extends
ideally then i d extends zend_view_abstract to allow me to implements other concrete functions that we require but i don t know how to set this up

800786
jdom	dom4j
it doesn t seem like any of the normal xml libraries dom4j jdom java xml have any built in support for this

800790
bash	zsh
i get bash when i start terminal now although i have bin zsh at terminal settings in mac

800802
daemons	systemd
since the wait systemd call is waiting on the parent daemons process it should exit

800866
ubuntu	linux
the issue is when use the cleanlooks widget style for the vertical scrollbar it looks ok on the linux ubuntu machine where qt-4.3.3 is running

800904
jboss	glassfish
i d like the solution to be as simple and straight forward as possible i m trying to avoid things like glassfish or jboss

800952
pop-up	dialog
actually i want to pop-up my own dialog which save file on server without asking the target path location instead of adobe s save as dialog

800957
wordpress	joomla
install drupal joomla or wordpress download some plugins and design a custom site for your boss

800969
hash	md5
in md5 s defense there is no known way to produce a file with an arbitrary md5 hash

801067
put	get
being the one that management has put between a rock and the hard place then what you need to do is get them to buy the fastest processor and best tools that they are willing to spend based on the colorful pie charts and graphs that you are going to generate from thin air as justification

801084
put	get
it d suggest to put more than 0.5s because sometimes your lataency can get higher

801085
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
you should take a look at objectdatasource instead of sqldatasource

801106
hide	show
if you re going to use a table to display this don t try to dynamically hide or show table rows it doesn t work well

801121
wxpython	wxformbuilder
wxformbuilder can generate .xrc files for wxpython

801135
pop-up	dialog
you can use jquery ui library to pop-up dialog box for editing

801139
entity-relationship	diagram
bear in mind that sql server since at least 2005 possibly earlier has been capable of generating entity-relationship entity relationship diagram from the management studio

801163
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
use gzipinputstream and gzipoutputstream which are compatible with gzip format

801177
wxpython	pyqt
this may not answer your question directly but i chose pyqt because there were no good ui designers for wxpython

801184
translation	localization
localization to both is similarly complex - besides getting your texts translation you ll need to make sure you don t use bold text doesn t work on either script and make sure any linebreaking algroithm works when words are no longer stings of letters seperated by spaces

801207
mouse	keyboard
simulate mouse and keyboard input wh_journalplayback

801207
mouse	keyboard
if you try to simulate these events by sending or posting messages windows internals do not update the keyboard or mouse state which can lead to unexpected behavior

801207
mouse	keyboard
if hooks are used to play back keyboard or mouse events these events are processed exactly like real keyboard or mouse events

801257
put	get
the answer that you will get here is no different from the answer in the other question put in a separate project for each separate dll

801268
post	get
to me the most useful thing is testing form submissions including each parameter in a get or post request for each form that is necessary for the operation of your site

801306
freebsd	linux
tested on freebsd and linux

801347
hash	md5
when inserting it with a special routine which needs a csv file the password in this case the alphanumeric key is stored as a md5 hash

801375
int	double	min	max
of course this doesn t explain the strange behaviour of numerics_limits min which could be a result of the fact that there are different min max borders for int min -2 n max 2 n-1 but not for double

801462
implements	extends
although i think that using view helpers would be the correct zend-framework -way of doing this you can extends zend_view and implements all additional methods you d like to have - this way you don t loose the features of zend_view

801477
post	get
shown_players appears to have the right value within get because the html generates correctly but it is empty within post

801491
post	get
that s why you can t create a varable in get and use its value in post

801553
filesystems	fat
if you need the capabilities they also have a fat filesystems a peg graphical ui library usb device and host and tcp ip available for additional license fees

801669
mouse	keyboard
or it could even be hooked to mouse or keyboard events so that when the user doesn t move the mouse or isn t using the keyboard the timer counts down until it reaches the log off time

801682
mousemove	keydown
probably it would be simpler to just update the timer based on the mousemove or keydown events on the form itself

801703
onclick	onsubmit
answering prashant s comment digg are adding an onclick handler to the or possibly an onsubmit handler to the form which builds the neat-looking search url and redirects the browser to that url and then returns false to prevent the from submitting the form itself

801728
put	get
i tend to put utilities into one or a few bigger assemblies but work with namespaces to get a clear structure among them

801791
width	height
spacing between nodes can be found by finding the maximum height of the tree using some constant width for the deepest nodes and doubling that width for every lesser depth so that the width for any depth 1 + maxdepth - currentdepth deepestwidth

801795
int	chars
when in doubt look at the source theres no magic in string it just uses primitives like int and chars just like any other class

801797
folder	directory
how would i get the actual directory path of an iis application virtual folder using wmi

801803
datalist	objectdatasource
when i try to run databind on my datalist to enhance objectdatasource wired to getofferphotosaccphototableadapter in .xsd file i get the error translated

801831
int	chars
2 int int chars

801832
switching	screens
has anyone successfully trapped the power standby button on a wm5 device such that your code prevented users switching off even the screens

801988
hex	binary
if the compiler in question is the mspgcc it should put out an assembler listing of the compiled program together with the binary hex file

802071
int	double
this has the benefit that it also handles cases with mixed data types like when minvalue is an int and value is a double

802073
hide	show
i want to show hide certain parts of a view based on authentication-status or roles

802074
jsf	seam
is it some or all of the following seam ofcourse jsf ejb3 hibernate spring inversion of control container

802074
jsf	seam
jsf - essential for seam to really make sense afaict - i recommend focusing on facelets as a primary way of creating jsf pages

802074
stateless	stateful
seam takes care of stateful session and conversation scoped beans generally part of your presentation logic tier and spring is best for the stateless context such as interfaces to back end services such as databases and any soa clients

802074
jsf	seam
i ve found seam + jsf facelets + hibernate + spring to be quite a good combination for creating uis over jbpm and also on another project for delivering content pages though that is not really what seam is for

802113
.nettiers	codesmith
i use a code generator codesmith with .nettiers template to generate all the dal code

802155
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering and wcf have nothing to do with eachother

802155
sorting	filtering
so you have to implement sorting and filtering yourself as in most cases

802191
unsigned	short
with these definitions and assuming unsigned short 16 bit and int 16 bit and unsigned long 32 bit note that the size of int is important

802191
unsigned	short
but it s unnecessary as the presence of one unsigned long in the calculation will cause the other to be automatically promoted from short to long size

802199
jsf	seam
jsf is a prerequisite for using seam

802201
post	put
i put the code in a blog post mock and stub for linq to sql

802224
salt	md5
alternatively you could salt prepend some secret string your code and then calculate md5 of it

802318
folder	directory
instead it will use a folder under your eclipse workspace directory workspace .metadata .plugins org.eclipse.wst.server.core tmp0

802339
width	height
area width height

802426
width	height
ideally i want to be able to mimic the drodpown list behaviour in that the list of options is drawn floating and is not constrained by the usercontrols height and width nor even the parent forms boundaries

802502
jsf	seam
seam is a meta-framework that combines the ejb3 and jsf frameworks and wraps them with a form of dependency injection

802504
subtract	add
when i check in my code making the methods alphabetical it updates the hierarchy above so that subtract becomes method 1 and add becomes method 0

802569
executable	upx
i asked a question about the con s of using upx on delphi executable here on so a while back and i got some great responses

802569
executable	upx
are there any downsides to using upx to compress a windows executable

802586
pull	push
and these operations are by design nondestructive so you can push pull when you go grab a coffee if your central repo is lagged. another nice thing is that it comes batteries included the builtin gitk is a good enough history viewer

802602
getter	setter
the simple setter getter in our example aren t too persuasive

802611
put	get
i believe if you put it inside cdata tags you ll get the whitespace

802617
public	protected
it doesn t have public and protected either except by naming convention

802620
public	protected
when you check out the class you can specify the order that you like best alphabetical public protected private etc

802652
subtract	add
here s a version of add and subtract that work on any instantiation pattern

802655
updatepanel	scriptmanager
when you call scriptmanager the control parameter must be a control that is within an updatepanel that will be updated

802656
int	chars
int is a value type but checked it again with a chars pointer local to main and obtain similar results

802702
button	checkbox
for example you could create a style for control objects and then apply it to multiple types of controls button textbox checkbox etc

802705
width	height
i probably don t need to set width height enabled and send the hide message on the splash screen

802800
min	max
short min -32768 max 32767

802800
min	max
int min -2147483648 max 2147483647

unsigned long min 0 max 429496729

802863
jsf	seam
regarding seam and portal development better question would be is how well jsf and portal work together

802863
jsf	seam
they do work together of course - here is relevant tutorial developing portlets using jsf ajax and seam

802871
udp	tcp
for example it s pretty common to deploy dns services by udp or tcp on port 53

802913
bmp	png	bmp	tga	png	tga
there are at least two decoders in hackage stb-image partial implementation of jpeg png tga bmp psd decoders with a really simple api and pngload pure haskell loader for png images

802968
jobs	cron
- look promising for scheduling of jobs without cron access

802970
boost	stl
libs used stl wxwidgets boost asio cryptlib

803041
outputstream	inputstream
getstreamstohostnamed port inputstream outputstream

803052
xmltype	clob
in my current project we save off the xml used in an xmltype or clob and allow other applications to access the data and xsl templates to generate documents via a web service

803052
super	implements
this was an after thought of the original design that was super easy to implements due to our decision to use xml xsl

803083
int	double
i think that this is an error caused by the limited precision above all because using double instead of int

803097
g++	gcc
the following macros are defined in my version of gcc and g++

803170
pop-up	dialog
in my winforms application i need to pop-up a little custom dialog that stays on the screen for x amount of seconds and then disappears

803170
invokerequired	begininvoke
this of course means that i have to do the whole if invokerequired begininvoke dance which isn t really a problem

803200
hide	show
add one to the pop up form and start it as soon as the form is show then hide the form on the tick event

803215
move	drag
the user won t be able to move any of the application s windows and if the user drag other windows over the top of it and off again you ll end up with an ugly mess while the ui waits to repaint itself

803216
sorting	filtering
i can then bind the ordersview along with supporting sorting and filtering to a list in wpf

803217
perforce	svn
my first choices would be svn or perforce but the team has a few people who really like vss -

803218
getter	setter
i have no property compiler directive no synthesize so no getter and no setter

803226
recvfrom	datagram
if you friend receives the udp datagram using something like the recvfrom system call the address parameter will receive the ip endpoint information to respond to

803330
spaces	delimiter
thus in contrast with other solutions it is possible to specify every delimiter and not just a spaces -- in this case 8 of them

803395
width	height
flexible width s are really nice but not as critical as the height

803430
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
in terms of running debugging i use firebug on firefox and opera safari ie8 s built in js debuggers

803441
google-chrome	safari
if you re using a webkit based browser safari or google-chrome then you can use the web inspector

803468
udp	tcp
would you use tcp udp for the lobby that is should users connect to server to observe the lobby or would you go for a request-response mechanism

803483
implements	extends
so here you are only saying that s1 is something either object or some class extends object that implements serializable

803485
multicastdelegate	delegation
further a delegation reference can with some restrictions see below reference multiple methods called multicastdelegate

803485
multicastdelegate	delegation
the restrictions for a multicastdelegate are that the method delegation signature should not have any return value void and the keywords out and ref are not used in the signature

803485
multicastdelegate	delegation
once the signature complies the delegation is automatically a multicastdelegate

803537
versioning	upgrade
edit i personally think that if the team is not able smoothly to upgrade from versioning 1.0 to 1.1 on the same time on dev - smells like bad design and mix in the responsibilities on what should be on the app layer and what on the db server

803540
user-controls	tabcontrol
how can i expose the selectedindex property of the tabcontrol to the user-controls if i want to close the tab with a button inside the user-controls instead

803544
qtp	loadrunner
you also set up other qtp and loadrunner scripts to run if a script fails

803580
post	get
to replicate this it is really no different than replicating a normal get or a normal post like i showed above

803581
ubuntu	linux
what tools should i look to install ubuntu linux options prefered for flex development

803587
min	max
you can t specify a min max bound for it

803591
int	double	implements	extends
you might have to create an interface iinfinity and have k extends iinfinity and iinfinity to have a method getinfinityvalue and then wrap extends int double bigdecimal etc in a class that implements iinfinity .

803643
nsimage	nspopupbuttoncell
_defaultindicatorimage | - nspopupbuttoncell _coreuidefaultindicatorimage | + nsimage imagenamed | + nsimage _coreuiimagewithname | + nsimage _coreuiimagewithbasename state backgroundstyle

803645
draggable	droppable
edit please correct me if i m wrong but these droppable all require a draggable to be dropped at it right

803689
post	get
there s a post on msdn blogs that shows how to get around this reasonably easily

803700
nginx	lighttpd
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

803700
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
a common setup at least in the ruby and python web world is to run nginx in front of lighttpd or apache

803701
ubuntu	linux
to clarify i am running my tests under linux ubuntu 7.10

803714
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
if you are running debian ubuntu or possibly other gnu linux distros there should be examples of this type of completion in your etc bash_completion.d directory

803719
put	get
that said i was able to put together a decent flex-building environment using emacs and some third-party packages to get everything running under linux

803773
folder	directory
it automatically rewrites requests to point to a folder called public_html within the user s home directory the web server must have read access up the tree to this folder

803778
post	get
as noted below you should not print get and post data back to the page without sanitizing it first

803851
actionscript	mxml
it uses actionscript mxml as its underlying languages

803887
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome don t support onbeforeunload and onunload seems to be too late

803887
google-chrome	safari
is there some way to replicate the same functionality in safari google-chrome

803917
pull	push
out of the blue i can t push or clone or pull with git

803918
settings.bundle	plist
i know i can do this in my app by adding a group footer but is it possible to do this in the settings app by adding a field to the plist file in my settings.bundle

803927
starttls	smtps
for example when a client connects to an smtps server and issues the ehlo command the server will list its capabilities which might include support for the starttls command

803940
hide	show
now i want to have a jquery code that show only 3 items after each header and hide the rest to make the list shorter and more usable

803963
udp	tcp
blocking certain networks have protocol priorities so your udp packets may be dropped in favor of allowing tcp traffic through

803965
put	get
makes perfect sense to me so i took the components nodes out of the .wxs file and put them in a separate file but when i attempt to compile the project in visual studio 2008 i get an error for each componentref stating it s an unresolved reference to symbol ... in section product ...

803982
stdout	stderr
also interesting was that i could not for the life of me capture stdout or stderr correctly with any of the freopen or dup2 tricks

804005
installation	upgrade
our installation was an in place upgrade from sps2003 so the database names and ssps were a little goofy

804013
google-chrome	safari
this works perfectly for me in both google-chrome and safari

804023
opera	safari
however in opera and safari for windows i am confronted with the following big-nasty-exception

804087
toggleclass	each
i tried using a toggleclass function to set the class of a li element to active so that it would be yellow but no dice so i ve resorted to resetting the css each time

804129
implements	extends
to answer the core question your own interface that implements a public clone as mmyers wrote and require that c extends that as well

804130
ssl	https
suppose that moments after ssl connection is established client surfs to some other url and shortly there after it again requests via https the original page one with which it has ssl connection established

804134
getter	setter
this looks reasonable but if neither the setter nor the getter uses autorelease the go on to do something part will likely crash because oldvalue has now been deallocated assuming nobody else had retained it

804178
fast-forward	merge
if done correctly the subsequent merge from your branch to branch b can be fast-forward

804184
boost	stl
i believe this is one of the parts of boost that is going to be included in the next version of c++ at which time it will become part of the stl but right now it s a free 3rd-party library

804200
width	height
false resizable false closed false width 300px height null expandedheight 0 index -1

804209
queue	fifo
if you click on use you will also find collections.aslifoqueue deque is already a queue but it is fifo rather than a stack

804254
opera	safari
the background-size property is only supported in newer versions of safari and opera

804265
move	drag
basically the issue is i have a flash movie which contains a text box and if the user clicks in the text box and drag to select highlight text and they drag outside the flash movie and release the mouse then the flash move doesn t receive the mouse release event and even though the mouse is up moving the cursor around the page continues to change the selected text within the flash

804311
getter	setter
i changed the supportticketcategory property to old school getter and setter and it worked...syntax sugar for loss

804348
ecj	javac
i don t claim to easily understand those complex generic types but if you find some code that compiles in javac and doesn t in ecj the eclipse compiler then file a bug report with both sun and eclipse and describe the situations cleary best if you also mention that you filed both bug reports and mention their respective urls although for sun it may take a while before the bug is publicly accessible

804348
ecj	javac
i tried to compile the sample code with javac javac 1.6.0_13 and ecj eclipse java compiler 0.894_r34x 3.4.2 release and javac complained loudly and failed to produce any .class files while ecj only complained about some unused variables warnings and produced all the expected .class files

804358
division	multiplication
the binding class has events called format and parse which you can use to perform the division the format event takes a value from the trackbar and formats it for the text box and the multiplication the parse event takes a value from the text box and scales it for the trackbar

804374
put	get
i want to get all mouse clicks on my application but i don t want to put a listener in every child component neither use windows mouse hook

804603
udp	tcp
i m looking for a way to efficiently send receive messages over a tcp ip or udp socket stream connection

804631
ceil	floor
you can force rounding in a specific direction by using floor or ceil

width	height
the child usercontrol has a set of images and basically i need to know if they have fully loaded inside the parent usercontrol since i need their dimentions for a method not just height and width

804695
free	malloc
you should allocate the data on the heap with malloc and explicitly free it with free

804710
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
the advantage of knowing emacs or textmate or vim my personal preference or any generic editor is that the skills you acquire in that editor apply regardless of what platform you re writing for

804721
ubuntu	linux
i want to know if oracle enterprise linux is the only one linux os where oracle can be installed or we can install oracle even in redhat ubuntu etc

804881
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

804936
children	parent
be warned with using the first example if you have any children elements outside the parent element they will be hidden

804937
getter	setter
late addition i m so sorry i should have mentioned that a and b have roughly 50 methods each and all i want to do is add a single property to suba along with a getter and a setter

804975
inherited	properties	getter	setter
it will inherited the 50 methods from the parent a and you can add your additional properties to the child plus the getter and setter

805003
pull	push
at the very least you should make sure that you do not push to the currently checked-out branch but generally you shouldn t just shove your code into someone else s repository you should ask them to pull from you instead

805045
put	get
i can envision using secure ftp to put and get files but not sure how to spawn the child processes in linux

805071
bash	zsh
i don t know zsh here s what i did with bash and sed

805098
subtract	add
solutions where you add and subtract or the xor-based ones are less readable and most likely slower than a simple temp variable solution arithmetic boolean-ops instead of plain moves at an assembly level

805120
post	get
this server talks http with it s clients get and post via pyamf

805131
plink	prompt
hint you will need to set up the full public private key configuration for plink to work without an annoying password prompt

805150
mouseover	mouseout
all hover is doing behind the scenes is binding to the mouseover and mouseout property

805170
for-loop	loops
your loops is a perfectly ordinary for-loop but it no longer looks like one â it has two variables they re counting in opposite directions and one of them isn t even used in loops body â so anyone reading your code including you a week a month or a year from now when you ve forgotten the optimization you were hoping to achieve will need to spend extra effort proving to himself or herself that loops is indeed an ordinary loops in disguise

805179
mp4	h.264
i ve also read that flv s in particular have problems with audio video syncing so if you can upgrade to flash player 9 which supports mov h.264 and mp4

805187
innodb	myisam
in fact the reason to use innodb over myisam is that it will do row locking instead of table locking

805200
int	chars
however even though it contains that chars 4 you cannot add to an int without using some function to convert the string to an int type

805253
mouseleave	mouseenter
unbind the mouseenter and mouseleave events individually or unbind all events on the element s

p.s - i did find out about glui that provides such entities but i am not allowed to use anything other than glut

805430
mouseleave	mouseenter
i d like to avoid having to use specific mouseenter and mouseleave events for all controls with a tooltip

805691
post	get
when i do a post or get request is there a library out there that would parse the different fields

805692
titlebar	window
then put thumbs titlebar etc on the grid to simulate window behavior

805736
hash	md5
i would also note that in most implementations of md5 it s possible to add data into the digest function a chunk at a time and then ask for the hash at the end

805761
rss	feed
maybe you ll even want something that s not html at all like an rss feed

805788

805879
versioning	upgrade
also if you may want to upgrade to the latest versioning i.e rails 2.3

805892
getter	setter
and the compiler magically creates a getter and setter where the setter may just look like that

client-side	server-side
you need to add server-side actionscript to handle the recording and the correct client-side actionscript to your media player.

805938
translation	localization
for translation of the resources you should look at a localization tool for instance passolo

805941
free	malloc
it is valid also with c malloc free memory functions

805998
listbox	icollectionview
i am using a wpf listbox which is databound to an icollectionview to display a list of items that can be filtered

805998
listbox	icollectionview
using the icollectionview s filter method i filter the items in the listbox based on the string that is entered in the text box which is assciated with the listbox

806013
getter	setter
also important when dealing with objects with many attributes do you use getter and setter for each attribute or rather one method to set all and one method to get all

806020
equals	compareto
or does it something like equals or compareto

806104
getter	setter
i also use getter and setter for almost all of my member variables which i define private protected most of the time because setting one value triggers changes in other values very often

806104
getter	setter
one downside of creating g s is the vast amount of ugly stupid code that accumulates over time if you define getter setter even for attributes that do not trigger changes elsewhere

806121
getter	setter
i ve used the second version usually for database models in codeigniter and particularly during early development in combination with custom php5 getter and setter methods to allow you to overload the class dynamically

806135
boost	stl
with arrival of stl and development of boost parsing text happened to be extremely easy with c++

806135
boost	stl
now i use c++ with stl boost

806151
hash	md5
the hash is meant to be used for caching so i was thinking of md5 or sha1

806157
cfstring	nsstring
so for example you can create a cfstring and then send nsstring messages to it or you can create an nsarray and pass the array to cfarray functions

806163
google-chrome	firefox
it seems firefox ie7 and google-chrome don t care

806177
post	get
when you do not go through the server-based proxy service you can use only http get or post methods

806183
children	parent
be careful of children brought up by other than their natural parent

806192
width	height
oddly enough removing the width and height properties from the span allows you to click on the image

806249
gtk	cairo
as flexible as this solution is it requires a very deep knowledge of gtk cairo and everything else involved

806297
extjs	smartgwt
all three of these libraries are based on existing javascript component libraries extjs for gwt-ext and ext-gwt and smartclient for smartgwt

806316
ssl	https
your web service must be using https with the attendant ssl certificate

806319
hide	show
then show and hide them non-modally as you do a mouse-enter or -leave event

806376
mouse	keyboard
i know how to simulate mouse and keyboard events but they act as if the user did them so they will affect the window that is active

806379
getter	setter
like i understand synthesize actually is generating the getter and setter

806384
translation	localization
note a localization tool only manages translation not the original language

806410
mouse	keyboard
this class is used to generate native system input events for the purposes of test automation self-running demos and other applications where control of the mouse and keyboard is needed

806429
boost	stl
i am already experienced with template usage stl boost poco and writing template classes methods

806444
cfstring	nsstring	cfstring	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
essentially it boils down to the fact that you can cast between corefoundation and nextstep classes of the same name cfstring - nsstring cfdata - nsdata cfdictionary - nsdictionary.

806454
width	height
you would get the right width height values from xml

806458
hash	salt
note that a good password hash function not only includes salt it also applies the hash function several thousand times

806463
memcached	apc
maybe a memory cache like apc or memcached see also this comment to the session_set_save_handler function

806464
pascal	delphi
it s free it s totally easy to use it s open source pascal delphi it can install your apps in a fraction of a second it just works

806473
int	boolean
will give you a boolean true if the context item is an int false otherwise

806481
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in particular ones that are lightweight can display images and fast like google-chrome safari 4 or firefox was pre 1.5 - although it s not a prerequisite

806482
getter	setter
synthetize can be seen as a macro that creates the getter and setter methods

806483
width	height
q jqmodal go form qblh width 781 height 400

806498
versioning	upgrade
the obvious solution is to upgrade the server or downgrade my development machine so the versioning numbers to match

in particular ones that are lightweight can display images and fast like google-chrome safari 4 or firefox was pre 1.5 - although it s not a prerequisite

806631
inherited	properties
i think your best approach would be to inherited each control and set its default display properties

806664
getter	setter
the use of getter and setter makes since on the properties that need to be changeable to the calling code

806664
getter	setter	public	protected
the getter setter pattern doesn t make sense with public properties obviously but it does with protected and private properties which may need some validation or to be sanitized

806753
mouse	keyboard
to relieve pain - i ve never had pain from the keyboard but i get tendinitis from the mouse

806764
mouse	keyboard
anytime you re about to use the mouse forcibly stop yourself and look up the keyboard shortcut for that operation

806774
mouse	keyboard
as long as you can t reach for the mouse without thinking about it then you will find that it is easier to use keyboard shortcuts instead

806774
mouse	keyboard
essentially you want the mouse to be an option but the keyboard to be a better easier more convenient one

806795
vim	emacs
switch to vim or emacs for code editing or use viemu if you really need the intellisense

806822
fgets	fgetc
reading input from stdin is a little trickier but all it really involves is essentially using some of the file reading functions fgets fgetc fscanf and passing in stdin as the file path or php stdin depending on how new your version of php is

806904
put	get
if you forgot to put int bands in foo.obj you d get a linker error and have to go resolve it

806907
put	get
if you are not using votive then you can put the wix xsd into visual studio xsd repository to get intelisense

807010
mouse	keyboard
i know how to simulate mouse and keyboard events but they act as if the user did them so they will affect the window that is active

807033
range	max
if the reult so far is between max 7 and max-1 then the result will be uniformly distrubuted in that range

807058
hide	show
having or hide in the load event will cause your form to show briefly as there is time between when it becomes physically visible and when the load event gets fired in spite of the fact that the documentation says the contrary

807068
superclass	subclassing
what the tech lead is likely thinking is that the factory pattern is to replace a constructor in the same object not to return subclassing or perhaps only return subclassing from a superclass not from an unrelated object

807082
shadowing	named
if it refuses to compile because of one variable shadowing another of the same named it isn t a real c compiler

807092
caliburn	prism
i ve also seen mention of prism composite application guidance and caliburn

807156
disk	ram
it may be physical ram or virtual memory paged away on some hard disk

807216
slug	permalinks
i would store the slug in the database for the simple reason that slug usually form part of a permalinks and once a permalinks is out in the wild it should be considered immutable

807252
implements	extends
basically you create a class which extends the jplugin class and implements the method with this header

807260
httphandler	httpmodule
you can write a httpmodule to grab all the the axd js files from the response combine them into one and send them to the client s browser through a request to an httphandler

mouse	keyboard
you ll see your productivity drop during the learning curve but jump way up after as you save a lot of time by not moving your hand of the keyboard to use the mouse

807336
profiling	debugging
whilst the profiling is v cool - it doesn t help debugging when the system throws an exception

807385
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to get an if statment that says if my points arrays at i initialized in a for-loop is equal to the x and y of a circle which is set to smallcircle.x and smallcircle.y

807387
width	margin
assuming margin 0 auto then the element should be centered but the width is left as-is--whatever it is calculated to be disregarding any margin settings

807388
getter	setter
property declares getter and or setter

807401
inherited	properties
they have no common properties which is why they have no need to inherited from some base class

807442
folder	directory
somewhere under var maybe or just a folder that s set to in one person s home directory

807465
redhat	fedora
redhat is one of the easiest distros for installing oracle but there are some differences between the different versions of redhat and the different versions of fedora core too so search for the right step by step document of you don t have any experience in the setup process

807472
cldc	midp
as with all generic javame vm s you will not be able to access internal api s hardware which is not accessible from within the standard cldc midp libraries the javavm you are using supports

807494
havok	physx
it d still be my pick after the big 2 havok and physx

807577
for-loop	loops
if this is the only thing your for-loop is doing you can write the whole loops like this

807647
submit	submission
to get around the d property problem in the object that has to be returned by the submission web method handle the click event of the submit button and push the data to the server by directly calling your web method

807812
implements	extends
the custom controls extends one of the wpf control base classes and provide additional functionality through code so all the added logic and representation must be implements inside the code

807864
udp	tcp
c# and c++ both support tcp and udp network connections in many flavors

807866
pop-up	dialog
however when the user first runs the app a sql authentication dialog box pop-up asking the user for a username and password to the requested database

807871
edifact	x12
i m looking for at least one sample file each in edifact and x12 that show

807871
edifact	x12
the edifact one should include the data wrapped in uno unp segments and the x12 one needs to use one of the binary segments bin or bds

807892
for-loop	loops
the issue is that if i call it once i get a random string if i call it again in a for-loop for example i get the same string for the entire execution of loops

807896
int	double
interlocked.exchange only works on reference types there are different overloads for int long intptr float and double

807939
calloc	malloc
what is the difference between new and malloc and calloc and others in family

807949
calloc	malloc
calloc is like malloc but initializes the allocated memory with a constant 0

807963
free	malloc
malloc only allocates some memory free deletes memory allocated by malloc

807963
calloc	malloc
calloc does the same thing as malloc and also zeroizes the newly allocated memory

807963
free	malloc
as other posts have pointed out malloc free is part of c++ to be compatible with c

807966
realloc	malloc
the main difference between new and malloc i can recall is that you cannot reallocate memory allocated by new using realloc

807966
calloc	malloc
calloc allows you to initialize the memory block you allocate while malloc does not

807969
calloc	malloc
calloc is the same as malloc except for it clears memory to all bits zero

807970
free	malloc
malloc free + family

807970
free	malloc
malloc free family is the c way to allocate and free memory from the heap

807970
calloc	malloc
calloc is the same as malloc but also initializes the memory

807970
free	malloc
data cannot be allocated with malloc and free with delete nor delete

807979
put	get
the above is a breadth first search which is considered the best for huffman trees since items that are in the source more often are higher up in the tree to get better compression however i can t figure out a good way to keep track of how we got to a particular node without backtracking using the head pointer i put in the node

807991
ienumerable	ienumerator
i cannot come up with an implementation of ienumerable that would not be able to supply an efficiently cloneable ienumerator vectors linked lists etc

808026
for-loop	loops
you have to loops over the data with a normal for-loop and then you can modify the collection but you must be careful to correctly update the current index if you insert or remove elements

808065
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
perhaps you ought to use svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe to generate proxy class files

808111
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
add button adds one checkbox two textboxes and one dropdownlistfor to a new line on my page

808111

808122
haskell	scheme
to understand c# and f# sequences you need to look at lists in haskell not lists in scheme

808148
calloc	malloc
what is the difference between new and malloc and calloc in c++

808159
free	malloc
the only reason to do so that i can think of would be a poorly constructed api which expected you to pass in malloc d memory because it would be doing the free

808167
free	malloc
if the memory is to be released by free in your or someone elses code it s pretty darn required to use malloc

808203
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
try cvs svn or even something paid like perforce

808247
dictionary	map
i d use some type of a map dictionary maybe and keep track of the insertion order yourself as the actual data

808348
getter	setter
for some reason in other types of programming languages like java i have no problem with using setter and getter for every single variable but when i m programming in php probably because it is so flexible it feels kind of like a waste of time

808348
getter	setter
is it really that wrong not using setter and getter

808355
implements	extends
try extends picturebox to implements your interface

808361
implements	sealed
if the class you re interested in creating an interface for is not sealed then your could create a new class and inherit from the non-sealed class implements the interface

808361
implements	sealed
if it were sealed and i don t think picturebox is you d probably want to build a wrapper class that implements the interface that you re interested in and contains a picturebox control exposing only the members that you re interested in

808365
getter	setter
the point of getter or setter is that you can still add logic to your modifications of the field in one place instead of everyplace you want to modify or retrieve the field

808369
sorting	filtering
this means we re limiting the functionality a fair bit no drill down sorting advanced filtering and only one table worth of data

808389
getter	setter
using them you can easily merge all getter setter function in only 2 functions

808396
post	get
for the auto-login to the .net app assuming it s asp.net i would have the vb6 application login process write a session guid to the database and use it as a get or post variable when building a link to the .net application

808399
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
the main problem with not using properties accessor is that if you find out you ever need to change a field to a properties later on â to make it a computed properties in a subclass for instance â youâ ll break clients of your api

808399
getter	setter
this arguably makes using getter and setter mechanically fairly easy

808423
getter	setter
if you access these variable in your script lots of time and if you update yoru class often you should use setter and getter because but if you dont this when you improve your class you have to update all files which uses this variable

808470
free	calloc
you are free to write a wrapper over new or even use calloc but most of the time for non-pod objects this doesn t make much sense

808487
implements	extends
the port class i am instantiating extends com.sun.xml.rpc.client.stubbase and implements javax.xml.rpc.stub and com.sun.xml.rpc.spi.runtime.stubbase

808490
getter	setter
i am probably not going to get many upvotes on this one but personally getter and even more so setter feel like a code smell to me

808490
getter	setter
but yes property like getter and setter are a step up from a dependency on a field directly for this very reason

808514
width	height
in that case s is the fractional component of the total width of the quadrilateral at t t is likewise the fractional component of the total height of the quadrilateral at s

808516
maven	pom.xml
but isn t the whole point of dependency management that maven sees b goes to the b pom.xml file where it sees the dependency on a and so it should go build a automatically

808569
mouse	keyboard
i should mention that the selectedindexchanged event fires properly on when an item is selcted via keyboard or mouse input

808626
vim	emacs
of course vim and emacs is available for everything

808667
firefox	safari
also besides the firefox extensions you have the safaritidy plugin for safari which will check all your tags

808688
post	get
the obvious thing to do is get the eventqueue and post events to it

808688
opera	safari
someone claimed yesterday the opera and safari do their own thing and don t give the required permission to untrusted code

808693
put	get
i would suggest rather then arguing against it being installed suggest that they put in place the correct exclusion rules so databases and processes which are extremelly unlikely to get viruses aren t scanned

808701
ironruby	ironpython
and here is a page dedicated to an example answering your very question albeit in a generic dlr-centric way -- this would allow you to host ironpython ironruby or whatever dlr languages you want to support

808716
nginx	lighttpd
have a light weight http server for static content nginx or lighttpd

808850
hide	show
so when javascript was first released a technique was needed to hide the code from older browsers so they wouldn t show it as text in the page

808862
uiview	subviews	uilabel	uibutton
what you might want to do is override the touchesbegan withevent method of the uiview that contains your uibutton and uilabel subviews

808862
cgpoint	cgrect
that is does the cgpoint element intersect with with the cgrect element

808883
inherited	properties
does anyone know how to determine if the value of a wpf properties is inherited

808884
post	get
i m not sure we ll get this functionality in wix v3.5 with burn but it is on our list for burn post v3.5

808889
glut	sdl
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

808932
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
are not longer really that much in use i try to use features which work in all those browsers firefox 2 ie 7 google-chrome opera

808939
int	double
by flat i mean the most complex property you can have in a business object is a string and a number int decimal double

808963
subtract	add
i am looking for a function that will add or subtract a distance from a longitude or latitude value

809016
pop-up	dialog
when the input file get focus it should be read only or the browser should pop-up a dialog to choose some file

809118
int	chars
under 200 rows perhaps 15 fields mostly int with a couple of 20 chars varchars

809170
hash	salt
to do it properly you could send a secure hash of your bid + a random salt

809235
hide	show
basically i have a detailsview dependent on what query it is i have certain boundfields i d like to show or hide

809244
integer	unsigned
is better because 0xffffffff assumes that unsigned int is a 32-bit integer

809248
inherited	subclassing
if you look at c++ the compiler can do all sorts of fancy stuff like generate subclassing via recursion probably compute a fractal inherited graph as well as computing the numbers of pi on the fly

809281
multiplying	add
multiplying max-bid by a rather large random number if you want to use base64 encoding in the last step max-rand should be 2 24 max-bid -1 and min-rand perhaps half of that then add a-bid

809307
uilabel	uitextview	uilabel	uifont	uifont	uitextview
now in your application you can simply call uifont fontwithname customfontname size 15 to get the custom font to use with your uilabel and uitextview etcâ

809309
hide	show
so i don t just want to hide and show and panels

809313
post	get
in addition set io statistics on to get an idea of how many reads your query will generate i especially love azder s post

809317
kerberos	ntlm
i have done this and even restarted firefox and when i browse to the above sites on our lan i still get prompted for username and password and even when i supply them and the web page is loaded i have some code in the app which displays the authentication method in effect and it is still ntlm not kerberos as when ie is used

809380
memcached	apc
content delivery networks intel ssds sprites combining images to save requests page compression gzip deflate memcached apc bytecode cache for php minifying and merging of multiple css and js files conscious handling of http status codes not changed separation of static and dynamic content different servers domains step-by-step loading via ajax important content first .

809415
vim	emacs
i heard about vim and emacs which one is better

809432
vim	emacs
the editors komodo edit emacs vim and epsilon give you the power to define almost any kind of syntax highlighting

809439
bitarray	bitset
if you re using c# you have a bitarray class with the necessary operations and in java you have a bitset class

809450
post	get
if you want an event fired after the page has loaded this is usually called a post back and there are some specific ways to get that event fired off in asp.net if you look at say the button control and its on_click event

809466
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are fast and have lots of features including syntax highlighting

809488
post	get
if i don t get a resolution before then i ll post the answer back here once i get it

809500
pop-up	dialog
the link needs another attribute target _blank and the next page will appear in a pop-up dialog

809501
gif	png	tiff	png
if you have the original image as jpeg png tiff gif or any other sampled image reduce the original file size with whatever tools you have then convert to eps using sam2p

809502
put	get
if i put the jpg in it s own directory then i d have to read that directory and just get the one and only file in it and use that in the xsl

809546
extjs	qooxdoo
i ve heard and used some of the libraries like extjs qooxdoo jquery ui dijit

809577
rss	feed
i m trying to do a curl call to an rss feed from a wordpress i m not using simplexml_load_file because it s forbiden by php.ini to do such calls so i m trying to get the xml via curl so far it works for any url but not for wordpress rss feed even if they are on the same server

809598
min	max
avg count sum min max grouping

809616
stdout	stderr
the reason why your program hangs is that the read function waits for the daemon to write something to its stdout stderr

809616
stdout	stderr
if the daemon including the child process of your program and also the child process forked children who keep their stdout stderr doesn t write anything and there is at least one process holding the writable end of the pipe open read will never return

809699
nsstring	nsdata
property lists are similar to json and can only store specific types of data -- nsstring nsnumber nsdata nsdate nsarray nsdictionary

809737
ironruby	ironpython
i d be interested to hear from anyone that has had success writing tests for a .net project in ironruby or ironpython

809755
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter and kohana a codeigniter descendent are ok but also loosely mvc

809765
rss	feed
there are many rss feed that contain invalid xml usually because they were hacked together on the server side using html templates by somebody who didn t understand xml

809766
cpython	ironpython
the forgo ironpython is hard to parse -- are you thinking of using cpython

809845
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
be advised that in mysql identifiers are case-insensitive on windows but case-sensitive on linux

809857
folder	directory
1 you try to move the directory folder

809857
folder	directory
if abcde is an existing directory it will move folder into abcde

809943
subtract	add
that is to say the decision to add or subtract a tet s contribution is only questionable when the tet wasn t going to contribute anything anyway

809946
gif	png
i ve just had a go at loading jpeg png and gif

809951
put	get
you can put a sql join condition which returns all the votes on comments made by the current user for this object if you get no rows the user hasn t voted

809968
mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mousehover	mousehover	mouseleave
why not subscribe to the mousemove events in the mousehover event then unsubscribe in the mouseleave event

809968
mousemove	mouseleave
the reason for removing the mousemove events on mouseleave would allow you to only receive events while the mouse is over your control

809977
hide	show
edit forgot that the show hide animations happened asynchronously so you need to use a callback on the fade out to trigger the rest.

809982
yourkit	jprofiler
then you can take advantage of jprofiler yourkit etc

809991
cassini	iis
it works just fine on my local machine cassini and iis 7

810013
for-loop	arrays
edit oh i see when you re referencing the arrays in the for-loop it doesn t know that the arrays has prodid and name indices

810051
free	malloc
again this is how it s often implemented not how new delete malloc or free are required to be implemented

810066
mouseleave	mouseenter
okay in response to your comment basically you have to unbind the mouseenter and mouseleave events before you use scrollto

810068
mouse	keyboard
no windows are shown no response to mouse or keyboard including ctrl-alt-end

810069
switching	screens
screens is acting as a terminal emulator inside a terminal emulator and it s just not possible for screens to switching the scrollback buffer in terminal.app whenever you switching between screens

810091
spaces	delimiter
are the delimiter or spaces around the data

810106
inherited	properties
i also like to use enum value chaining when there is a concept that spans multiple classes in an inherited hierarchy such as enums representing fields properties in a class

810111
pop-up	dialog
to do that go to c c++ - additional include directories press the ... button and in the pop-up dialog press macros

810177
boost	stl
the library is written in c++ using stl and boost libraries

810193
addition	multiplication
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

810194
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a main view that manually creates a uiviewcontroller not a uinavigationcontroller and adds that controller s view as a subview

810197
inherited	properties
this class is inherited by another class d that adds another public properties

810201
int	chars
your enemy constructor should actually call the int int int chars base constructor to set the sym member

810202
pascal	delphi
delphi free pascal

810223
int	double
to do it just put your int double floats etc

810275
post	get
i imagine that page load would be slow if you have cascading drop-downs and your initial page load populates one value that causes a post to get the next list set that value another post to get the next list again and so on

810306
post	get
if the .bat file is there but you still get an ioexception opening it from you .java application then please post the code snippet triggering the ioexception and please give a full listing of file.zip get the listing by extracting file.zip to c testdir and running dir s c testdir in the command line

810330
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i can t say what it would take to generate thumbnails and use them as icons but there are several extensions that makes use of graphicsmagick imagemagick to render thumbnails

810409
haskell	sml	haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	sml	scheme	ocaml	sml	ocaml	scheme	erlang	sml	erlang	scheme	erlang	ocaml
after looking at scheme erlang haskell ocaml and sml i ve settled on either haskell or standard ml

810409
haskell	sml
both haskell and sml have pattern matching which makes describing a recursive algorithm a cinch

810409
haskell	sml
essentially sml and haskell are roughly equivalent

810422
hide	show
i understand how to hide and show elements i dont know how to make its toggle status be persistent throughout the site

810450
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
that s why releasing linux programs in binary always screwed up unless bound to some distro like ubuntu debian or rh

810455
micro-optimization	benchmarking
edit see bottom of post for benchmarking on different micro-optimization of the method

810491
textmate	notepad++
simply run the files through the handy online textmate theme to notepad++ styler tool

810495
nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception
mostly objectdisposedexception and nullreferenceexception

810511
x86	64bit
this is possibly in addition to giving the source code to them. most statically linked binaries work on most linux distributions of the same architecture + 32-bit x86 statically linked binaries work on 64bit amd64

810511
x86	64bit
and you don t have the superpower to make it work on all linux systems so this situation is inevitable. do you provide 32-bit and 64bit as well including x86 powerpc arm etc

810511
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	ubuntu	debian
if the .so file works only on debian ubuntu and red hat because you don t have time time to port the file to more distributions you ll most probably upset your suse and gentoo users and more

810521
cpython	ironpython
what would be the ironpython way of doing tasks you would normally use subprocess or os.system for in cpython

810550
pop-up	dialog
the main problem i am having is suppressing the save as dialog that the microsoft xps document writer pop-up

810550
pop-up	dialog
i can make those calls on the xps document writer fine but when it come times to complete the printing the xps writer pop-up the save as dialog box

810568
google-chrome	safari
but the same button is not showing up in safari google-chrome webkit

810570
jikes	javac
if you are using ant as build system you can easily switch between jikes and javac

810574
jikes	javac
jikes was very compelling in the jdk 1.3 days when the javac compiler was awe-inspiringly slow

810612
short	base
in short you ll create the base vm copy it s virtual hard drive to a safe place then manually generate new vms using the initial hard drive as a base

810618
queue	fifo
a fifo fifo structure is known as a queue which is what you need for the ability to pop the oldest items off the back

810625
pseudo-class	visited
you can use css to style the a visited pseudo-class

810633
folder	directory
are they actual directory or since this is a web-server virtual folder

810634
hash	md5
basing the hash either md5 or sha on the time makes it guessable if the user knows roughly when the directory is generated

810636
folder	directory
iis can often put you in a temporary directory so it may have copied all your files over to this temp folder but none of the subdirs so there simply are none

810657
integer	unsigned
the fact that i m using floats shouldn t matter since they can be considered as unsigned integer after inverting the sign bit

810701
versioning	upgrade
obviously you could always start in 3.0 and when you really need 3.5 upgrade your project to the newer versioning by that time that could also be versioning 4.0 ofcourse

810707
translation	localization
but whenever i write localization code in php and have to translation some strings primarily in russian i have to open notepad to translation all the entries

810815
versioning	upgrade
then i don t need to upgrade my jquery to newer versioning with the risk that the website doesn t work well anymore

810843
pascal	delphi
any modern pascal variant delphi will let you create dynamic runtime sized arrays

810851
children	parent
does submenu have parent and children properties

810872
mp3	ogg
i am looking for a library to read meta data from compressed and uncompressed audio files mp3 ogg etc.

810920
post	put
or your languages equivalent on the post value of the output of webhtmleditor before you put it into the database to ensure that it will not throw up any errors in the sql query

810950
vsto	add-in
the add-in does not use vsto technology and supports excel xp and higher

810984
int	chars
also to add the chars at a certain index of a string can be retrieved by using the charat int method and the unicode code point can be retrieved by the codepointat int method

810995
quicksort	heapsort
for those interested sort uses an introsort quicksort which switches to heapsort when the recursion reaches a certain depth and stable_sort uses a merge sort

811073
freepascal	fpc
there s fpcunit an implementation to xunit for freepascal i m not sure if it s compatible with dunit but i read at fpc fourms they are doing improvement to make it compatible with dunit

811137
inherited	properties
should i create a class that inherited from a membershipuser and extend it with my own properties and methods and save this in a seperate table

811155
ironruby	ironpython
and if you don t like using vb or c# you could even branch out and use ironruby and ironpython as well and pick up some new languages along the way

811157
firefox	safari
silverlight requires only the silverlight player which is available for ie firefox and safari and works on windows and osx and is much smaller than the full .net framework in terms of download size

811200
firefox	safari
ie 6 7 8 firefox 3 safari

811221
hash	md5
in php you could do it with one line with an md5 hash on a string of length 20 - 500 it should be pretty fast

811248
jtextfield	jfilechooser
however i would like to add the ability for a user to drag-and-drop a file onto this jtextfield and have it place the file path of that file into the jtextfield instead of always having using the jfilechooser

811264
public	protected
also if start is protected you will have to create some sort of public method that calls it

811266
set	bag
on my supportticket class i have an ilist supportticketnotes property and have it mapped as a bag probably really should be a set but that s not important at the moment

811275
width	height
if you don t specify any width or height to the canvas it automatically uses all the available space

811275
width	height
if your drawing algorithm already scales the content to the canvas height and width then all you need to do is to resize the canvas to fit the area i believe

811275
width	height
in that case just remove the hardcoded height width values and the canvas will resize to fit the container

811275
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you might need to use actualheight actualwidth instead of height width in the drawing algorithm after this though

811275
actualheight	actualwidth
actualheight actualwidth return the values that the layout container will give your canvas so these represents the values the canvas is drawn with

811277
addition	multiplication
multiplication addition and bitwise rotating would be much better

811279
disk	ram
d if you really want to minimize the ram used maybe you want to use your disk sort the words you can use the disk if dont have enough ram and create a temporary file with the words one after another that would do for sequential access

811292
for-loop	arrays
this however comes at the cost of computing the hash in constructor of binary objects by traversing the arrays with for-loop -

811316
width	height
have you hardcoded element sizes using width and height properties

811361
integer	unsigned
i want to set a fourcc value in c++ an unsigned 4 byte integer

811370
hide	show
the complexity of when to show hide things when to process input from which fields is way too much

811375
entity-relationship	diagram
maybe this can help you entity-relationship diagram building software

811392
getter	setter
in java we have something called javabeans properties but that is basically a instance variable that follows a certain naming pattern for its getter and setter

811478
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am a newbi in iphone development.i want to build an app which will have a uiviewcontroller first which will have a button.now on clicking the button it shud load a uinavigationcontroller

811478
uiview	subviews
i know how to build a navigationcontroller project from window-based app but i am having a tough time doing navigationcontroller as a subviews of uiview

811479
set	bag
in your course object you need to set the cascade option on what i presume will be a bag or similar with a one-to-many inside

811515
put	get
when i put print statements before each value i get blanks in both cases but if the print statements come after the increment has been applied i get a value of 1 depending on how many ipv6 resources the organization has

811544
pascal	delphi
the class was mostly focused on programming with pascal so delphi was a good next step

811550
put	get
the internal form is an object having get and opt methods for accessing the values by name and put methods for adding or replacing values by name

811586
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie firefox and google-chrome as far as i can tell

811636
getter	setter
properties are shortcuts to getter setter methods that look just like an instance variable

811691
folder	directory
the other per-application folder contain shortcuts to the executable in that directory

811702
set	bag
many valued end the set or bag

811704
crossover	mutation
i have had some success increasing the diversity of population by setting mutation and crossover from a couple of the genes from the parent chromosomes

811704
crossover	mutation
the smaller reproduction chromosome had a sensible fixed rates for mutation and crossover

811704
crossover	mutation
as an aside i tend to do both crossover and mutation for each child

811734
validationsummary	customvalidator
my problem is the validationsummary never shows the message from customvalidator

811797
firefox	safari
firefox on mac indeed understands it but safari does not

811800
treemap	treeset
treemap treeset

811801
sml	curry
sml has what you call implicit curry syntax as well

811801
haskell	sml
essentially sml and haskell are roughly equivalent

811801
haskell	sml
i like using haskell much more than sml but i would still teach sml first

811801
haskell	sml
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell

811801
haskell	sml
while your class likely wouldn t use them anyways haskell s typeclasses are still an extra bump to get over -- getting them to understand the a versus a distinction in sml is tough enough

811832
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
cvs svn perforce git all adhere to this

811832
cvs	svn
this was a confusing situation in cvs which svn fixed by allowing options specified in any order

811833
children	parent
i d like the ability to have an arbitrary level of nesting children of the same parent element

811836
kde	gnome
that would be the standard controls on windows cocoa on the mac and on linux it should ideally use either gtk or qt depending on the desktop being gnome or kde

811845
put	get
however when i try to put the object into the database i get

811856
multiplying	add
pick a number between 9 and 99 and multiplying it by 9999 then add your bid

811856
multiplying	subtract
to unseal it divide by 9999 subtract the part to the left of the decimal point then multiplying by 9999

811857
strlen	substr
strlen substr etc

811937
junit	testng
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

811951
boost	stl
i have a small single-threaded c++ application compiled and linked using visual studio 2005 that uses boost crc program_options and tokenizer a smattering of stl and assorted other system headers

811974
wtl	atl
i want to add support for searching for local outlook contacts to my atl wtl app

811990
versioning	upgrade
it will run fine side-by-side with your upgrade versioning vs2008

812014
rss	feed
rss feed

812027
width	height
my current approach is to set font size as a function of the number of text characters and the text components height and width but i can t find the right coefficients to make this work nicely

812035
integer	unsigned
i ve now changed the methods to take and return uint unsigned 32-bit integer instead - this is also in greater accordance with the c++ rotl and rotr functions

812049
width	height
most require some structure list constant width height items

812079
width	height
what i am trying to do is show a window that does not explicitly have a height width both values omitted or set to auto

812079
actualheight	actualwidth
instead i get a big window with actualwidth and actualheight values both set to 512

812161
gentoo	linux
i use python 2.5 for all my development work but only because it s the version that happens to be available in gentoo linux s package repository

812185
getter	setter
i am not sure but i think that if i call self.myinstancevariable then it uses automatically getter setter but if i would call directly myinstancevariable foo for example then i would bypass any getter setter which would be really really reeeaaallly bad

812185
getter	setter
like you see you must use self.instancevariablename in order to use the getter and setter or you do the call in brackets works too

812185
getter	setter
from the outside when you call someobjectpointer.someinstancevariable it will automatically access the getter and setter yep i tried that out too

812202
getter	setter
if you directly use the variable bypassing the getter setter you could create bugs

812202
getter	setter
the getter setter may be responsible for retain and or releasing the object as well as other things

812202
getter	setter
if you are aware that you are bypassing the getter setter and take the right precautions there is nothing wrong with accessing the variable directly

812255
persistent	transient
that s useful in scenarios where the state is effectively transient - webforms relies on it by default for control state - but the only way for it to actually persistent across page loads is by forcing a postback each time a request is made to the server

812255
post	get
although they can be forewarded to another page as part of a get query string or post request viewstate the browser will not by itself associate them with requests to separate pages nor will it update these states when returning to a previous page

812255
client-side	server-side
however hacks to make them work cross-page aside this per-page attachment generally makes cookies or server-side session state indexed by a client-side cookie more appropriate for holding state that is specific to a given user or session but not specific to any single page

812259
getter	setter
the only circumstance under which i would consider explicitly calling the underlying member variable directly thus bypassing the getter setter is when i have written the getter setter myself and know exactly what it is and isn t doing and 99 of those times is when i m just initializing the member in my constructor

812266
width	height
inside the overridden onitemschagned method reset the height width dependency properties on the popup using the clearvalue dp method

812266
min	max	width	height
you can clear the max and min height width properties if you are worried about those too

812350
soa	osb
on the other hand if you are looking for soa based integration osb or alsb should be good enough

812352
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
linux windows solaris freebsd

812354
terminate	timeout
you might want to consider using poll instead of take which will allow the processing thread to timeout and terminate when it has waited for a while with no new input

812384
wordpress	phpbb
as for database setup you might consider writing a setup form within your website that can be called once to initialize the database based on user input think about the setup process from popular open-source projects like wordpress or phpbb that perform a wizard-type function

812393
implements	modifiers
if the class actually implements the interface but does so explicitly and places access modifiers on the concrete implementation all you need to do is get that object in the context of the interface itself and you can use it

812402
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
there are several major source control libraries of which svn also called subversion is one cvs git hg perforce clearcase etc are others

812419
inherited	properties
the bold entries in intellisense are the members directly implemented on the class with the inherited properties and methods shown in a regular font

812457
voip	sip	asterisk	pbx
the asterisk pbx is an open-source telephony server that implements a number of voip protocols including sip

812475
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to write a game with support for joypads as well as mouse keyboard

812492
stdout	stderr
one of them is my trusty old exec 2 1 which in the bourne shell permently knots together stderr and stdout for the duration of the script so that logging will capture everything good and bad

812500
stdout	stderr
you can print the errors and standard output to a single file by using the 1 command to redirect the output for stderr to stdout and then sending the output from stdout to a file

812521
stdout	stderr
to redirect the stderr output of the script to stdout

812529
min	max
say i get 1000 member index numbers back now i want to split them into 10 equally sized groups by a max and min member index

812592
bazaar	git
i use bazaar so this might be a slightly different answer than a git user would give but

812616
google-chrome	firefox
if you try this code it looks smooth for handle 1 and 2 but not others in firefox 3 but still looks jumpy in google-chrome

812618
getter	setter
in objective c a property is an instance variable which can take advantage of an overloaded dot operator to call its setter and getter

812633
width	margin
add a 20px margin to the right of #test and increase the width of the dialog

812672
width	height
it is a server side report and the width is set to 11 inches and the height is set to 8 inches

812672
portrait	landscape
however when i display it in the report viewer control of my windows application it appears in portrait mode not landscape mode like it should

812687
portrait	landscape
i believe there is a report property you can set on the rdl that allows you so specify portrait or landscape

812701
getter	setter
also the property name ivar name and getter setter names can also all be different so you may find cases where it doesn t look like self.myinstancevar

812701
accessor	properties
also just as a side note you may or may not know this already but there s no point to synthesizing a properties if you re just going to write all the accessor methods anyway

812711
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
click here to see what i m talking about this looks best in firefox google-chrome safari

812711
post	get	post	put	put	get
that documentation gives examples of interacting with the system using http verbs such as get post put delete

812711
post	get
i have built html forms that have method post or method get and the request is sent to whatever is specified in the action attribute action someresource

812726
post	put
so you may have to use a post instead of put

812735
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
there are settings for openid facebook connect ldap ntlm kerberos etc

812758
solaris	aix
we use mlton to compile our sml code to native code running on windows linux solaris aix and hp-ux

812764
typedef	struct
either remove the typedef keyword or create an object of type struct person somewhere in your code

812796
post	get	post	put	put	get
you can t put using an html form the spec defines only get post for forms

812796
post	get	post	put	put	get
however any http api should allow you to put in the same way that it allows you to get or post

812797
post	get	post	put	put	get
put and delete are likely to require that you use ajax and make xmlhttprequests since the form tag only supports get and post verbs and links only make get requests

812797
opera	safari
haven t tested in safari or opera

812829
multiplying	add
the cents are integers and you can freely add them together and multiplying by other integers

812842
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog and tell the user they re screwed and exit the program

812849
folder	directory
however when i try to import the service namespace using the same name as the directory under the app_webreferences folder it doesn t recognize the name and gives me an error if i try to import it

812865
feedparser	beautifulsoup
the acceptable_elements attributes come from feedparser and beautifulsoup does the work

812874
gridview	linqdatasource
if your database is sql server and you re uzing .net version 3.5 i recommend using a simple gridview with a linqdatasource

812876
width	height
i have written a jquery extension that does the centering of a modalpopup which is called from an overridden ajaxcontroltoolkit.modalpopupbehavior._layout method based on the width and height of the iframe s parent so that it looks centered even though the iframe is not in the center of the page

812881
post	put
replace the method string of post with put

812892
launch4j	jsmooth
edit you could also use an executable wrapper such as jsmooth or launch4j instead of a batch file

812931
width	height
also in the example in this tutorial it reads the array in a way that is not streight-forward to me as it seems to work on a 5x3 height width y x cols rows structure instead of a 3x5 width height x y

812935
post	get
typically once uri s get unreadable because they are too long it s time to use a post request instead

812937
folder	directory
a great example which is sort of close to the situation i m working on is filesystem explorers windows explorer which show a hierarchy of folder directory and a list of objects within them

812961
getter	setter
i ve been trying to get my head around getter and setter and its not sinking in

812961
getter	setter
i ve read javascript getter and setter and defining getter and setter and just not getting it

812961
getter	setter
what a getter and setter are meant to do and

812995
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload and viewwillappear are out of the question because i don t know what s in the datasource to the picker yet

813002
getter	setter
defining getter and setter

813034
uiview	subviews
place this wherever you initialize the uiview that contains your uipickerview as a subviews

813051
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my issue is the consistency between ie and firefox google-chrome safari

813099
getter	setter
if we re talking strictly about php here and not about c# java etc where the compiler will optimise these things i find getter and setter to be a waste of resources where you simply need to proxy the value of a private field and do nothing else

813099
getter	setter
on my setup i made two crappy classes one with five private fields encapsulated by five getter setter pairs proxying the field which looked almost exactly like java code funnily enough and another with five public fields and called memory_get_usage at the end after creating an instance

813099
getter	setter
the script with the getter setter used 59708 bytes of memory and the script with the public fields used 49244 bytes

813099
getter	setter
in the context of a class library of any significant size such as a web site framework these useless getter and setter can add up to a huge black hole for memory

813099
getter	setter
i wouldn t use it for this if i had the choice but having said that php is not imposing any insurmountable restrictions on us and when i refactored the class library to use public fields instead of getter setter the whole shebang ended up using 25 less memory per request at least

813099
getter	setter
when you need to migrate a field to a getter setter or a getter setter to a field they can make the process transparent to any dependent code

813099
getter	setter
say we have an object which was developed using fields instead of getter setter and we want to rename a field called field to fieldwithbettername because field was inappropriate or no longer described the use accurately or was just plain wrong

813099
getter	setter
getter and setter methods in php are good if the setter has to do something or if the getter has to lazy load something or ensure something has been created or whatever but they re unnecessary and wasteful if they do nothing other than proxy the field especially with a few techniques like the ones above to manage interface changes

813114
freebsd	linux
also i have access to linux and freebsd systems no windows sorry

813152
skype	voicemail
skype has a voicemail feature which sounds perfect for this and i suppose you would need a skypein number as well

813168
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
i am not using a sqldatasource or an objectdatasource so what is the proper way to delete a row from the gridview and the underlying data in the database

813169
post	get
to get that number i could either hold it in the post record and add subtrack when a comment is added or deleted or i could use the sql to calculate the number of comments using a query each time a user hits the page

813211
configure	libtool
ideally you ll want to use gnu autoconf automake and libtool to create configure and make scripts then distribute the library as source with the generated configure and makefile.in files

813212
addclass	removeclass
its better to use toggleclass 2 in 1 instead of addclass removeclass

813218
getter	setter
if you re referring to the actual js getter setter feature eg

813227
getter	setter
getter and setter really only make sense when you have private properties of classes

813267
post	put
i put every post request through mysql_real_escape_string and when i add a string like that 70s show it gets stored as in the mysql db

813277
inherited	subclassing
the only issue i ve had is with model inherited you always have to define the manager in model subclassing just objects querysetmanager in the subclassing even though they will inherited the queryset

813350
pop-up	dialog
i think the problem is that you are moving the pop-up and calling focus before the dialog is fully created

813424
folder	directory
this includes public folder in the user s directory

813463
microchip	avr
another note meanwhile microchip pic bought avr but i assume that for the first few years that won t affect the productlines much

813487
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

813543
xna	slimdx
basically i have checked out xna and some of slimdx promit which has lots of structs

813622
hide	show
you might consider using the hide show methods as well

813626
turbogears	cherrypy
what other frameworks are out there to consider cherrypy turbogears ror ...

813635
filtering	grouping
then you filtering out the xx strings grouping on the grouping number and filtering out the empty grouping

813646
haskell	sml
much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes

813668
haskell	scheme
operating systems have been written in standard ml scheme and even haskell

813692
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
both git and bazaar has good support for svn

813695
versioning	upgrade
while one of these transitions is going on all the distros upgrade at their own pace you ideally want to release libs with abis supporting the full range of gcc versioning in use by your users

813755
int	double
i m able to work the examples but he doesn t explain exactly why he s using a class in that way nsnumber instead of int or double for example

813760
cpu	processors
regarding os - you still need processors that runs instructions and compiler that translates language into cpu instructions

813772
rss	feed
also i d highly recommend looking at feeder for constructing your sparkle rss feed

813773
mp3	wav
they are a sip provider and there are many libraries for sip in python - so you could set up a python application to login to your sipgate account pick up and incoming calls and dump the sound to a wav mp3 whatever

813824
inherited	properties
just inherited the old class and stick a tag properties in there

813836
int	double
as such it provides both primitive types like int and double and objects

813840
executable	upx
virus scanners that look for unknown viruses can flag upx compressed executable as having a virus

813845
freebsd	solaris
if you are using a macosx solaris or recent freebsd system you can throw a little dtrace at it

813851
treemap	treeset
treemap treeset

813864
post	get
i m pretty weak on linq to sql but i don t think you can t avoid 2 lookups since you re still going to need to subquery to get the count the sql generated would still have the subquery which this similiar post seems to validate linq version of top percent

813874
int	double
i m able to work the examples but he doesn t explain exactly why he s using a class in that way nsnumber instead of int or double for example .

813874
int	double
nsnumber is a much more useful type than a primitive type like int or double as it is often used in conjunction with other objects you ll run into as you program in cocoa

813874
int	double
for example in order to package a number as a value into a resizable array like an nsmutablearray or an associative array an instance of nsdictionary you need to turn the number primitive int double etc. into a serializable or archivable object â an nsnumber

813874
int	double
that s not to say you can t or shouldn t use int or double variables

813909
inherited	properties
you should inherited from classes that set common properties and create new classes when you define properties that could be used elsewhere

813933
bazaar	git
the python core development team just decided to switch from subversion to mercurial after a long discussion c period where git and bazaar were also considered

813968
width	height
edit given your goal and your statement that you have raize components already i should also point out that trzsizepanel handles resizing of the panel and useful events like oncanresize to determine whether you want to allow resizing to a particular new width or height

813984
doc	rtf
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format

813993
ubuntu	linux
i ve done light rails development on both osx and linux ubuntu and i found the differences to be almost imperceptible in terms of ruby and rails.

813993
ubuntu	linux	vmware	virtualbox
a low hassle alternative for setting up a unix environment for rails development is to run one of the easier to use linux distributions like ubuntu or fedora under virtualization software like vmware virtualbox virtualpc etc

814055

814109
postgresql	mysql
i use the navicat clients for mysql and postgresql and am happy with them

814192
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
override the paint method to draw the sizing grip and override the mousedown mouseup and mousemove methods to add resizing functionality to the control

814251
implements	extends
in you case you ve said to be a valid t a class must implements comparable the keyword is extends but in practice that means extends or implements .

814251
superclass	subclassing
actually to cover more complicated situations where a subclassing s implementation of comparable is done by a superclass the more general form would be

814251
comparator	comparable
but without the implements comparable even if the compiler knows there s a method student.compareto it doesn t know that that comparator is the comparable.compareto

814277
free	malloc
generally in objective-c memory must be managed manually via either old c style malloc free or via the reference counting system of retain release

814376
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome opera and internet explorer tested in ie7 and ie8 this will return the following

814404
pop-up	dialog
alternatively the preview could be on a dialog that pop-up when you double-click

814444
button	checkbox
i have a gridview that displays items details i added two template fields one is a checkbox and the other is a textboc what i want is simply to check all the items the customer wants to buy and write down the quantity in the textbox when i click on a button i should check all rows in the gridview and when the checkbox is checked then i should compare the value in the textbox with the value in a databound field of the gridview called quantity and then carry on my order function.

814459
firefox	safari
the best way to do browser compatibility in general is to start with completely standards-based clean semantic markup that works in for example firefox 3 and safari uses xhtml and an xhtml doctype

814464
x86	64bit
it failed to run in x86 mode on my 64bit desktop

814466
x86	64bit
on x86 there are some special cases where two registers get fused when doing 64bit integer computations

814509
move	drag
i would like to know what event occurs when user move an email from a folder to another one with drag and drop or with move to folder option

814530
set	bag
depending on how you ve created your class and your mapping i think this is the only way since a set and bag mapping represent un-ordered collections in nhibernate

814578
put	get
you should get a more detailed stack trace by sending the .pdb file for that particular release to the user to be put next to the .exe and having them reproduce the crash

814603
vim	emacs
emacs vim nano

814612
vim	emacs
if you install and use either of vim or emacs you will have a text editor that can be used on any major platform now and in the future and most of the minor ones too

814629
emacs	aquamacs
from the emacs variants my personal favourite is aquamacs because it tries its darnedest to mitigate the os x vs

814647
jsr168	jsr286
jsr168 jsr286 compliant portals make it possible to create portlets in separate projects war files and to dynamically load these into a portal page

814743
lisp	smalltalk
given those things it s hard to justify spending a lot of time on languages like lisp and smalltalk although they are interesting and perhaps educational to look at

814764
vb.net	vb6
this can be done with any language which supports com delphi vb6 vb.net c# c++ ...

814767
fortify	veracode
if you are a developer and had access to tools such as ounce labs fortify software or veracode would you object to metrics on the code you write being made publicly available

814773
post	put
don t put these dates on the form so they aren t set in the entity when you post the page

814811
actionscript	mxml
from a programmer s viewpoint the big difference between flash and flex is not so much which ide application you use for programming but whether you program in actionscript as only or use the flex framework and mxml to program your applications

814811
actionscript	mxml
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

814896
jobs	cron
i know that there is the cron service but does it allow us to execute jobs which will insert update thousands of records

814905
facade	mediator
all updates are effectively done on new copies that must go through some sort of mediator or facade that only updates the local in memory copies with the updates after updating across the cluster or the minimum number of members across the cluster for data consistency

814905
facade	mediator
terracotta again for java solves a lot of this for you - just update the memory - terracotta is your facade mediator here

814905
put	get
if i get time later i will tidy up maybe put some more detail in fix spelling grammar etc

814924
put	get
to get access to the lifecyclelistener i had to put a public static method that would execute the actions desired

814929

815002
qspinbox	qpushbutton
i have an app with a qpushbutton and a qspinbox

815002
qspinbox	qpushbutton
as i understand it the setvalue int slot of qspinbox will not work here because the clicked signal of qpushbutton has a different signature and anyway how would i pass the value 20 to the spinbox

815034
salt	md5
3 use an update query to update each row s new column with an md5 of the unencrypted password while using a 32 byte or larger salt

815041
memcached	apc
in that article it says memcached is slow and apc is fast so why is everyone choosing memcached

815041
memcached	apc
and a slow one like file sqlite... do you think using apc as the fast and memcached as the slow is a good idea

815047
memcached	apc
so you could for example be using apc for increased execution performance while using memcached for cache storage

815048
memcached	apc
memcached is a distributed caching system whereas apc is non-distributed - and mainly an opcode cache

815049
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
if all the radio buttons are part of the same radiobuttonlist you can use a simple requiredfieldvalidator

815062
int	boolean
the qspinbox setvalue expects an int and converts the input boolean to 0 or 1 as the case maybe and your spinbox increments by only 1 unit

815120
mouseleave	mouseenter
with jquery events if you want the event to apply to new elements you would use the .live method however jquery 1.3 doesn t support blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit events as live events

815128
onsubmit	onblur
you could just call the forms onsubmit function through an onblur handler

815143
width	height
in a grid every cell in a column has the same width and every cell in a row has the same height typically anyway

815176
hash	md5
hashlib is new for 2.5 so if you must use an earlier python your hash choices are the older md5 and sha modules.

815238
pop-up	dialog
for example if you want to do a lookup you can pop-up a dialog rather than navigate away from the current page

815239
width	height
setting the initial-frame-alist with appropriate height width

815261
pop-up	dialog
when i set the returning respond type to json firefox will pop-up a dialog asking how i like to handle the returning json object

815306
wordpress	phpbb
it s very possible to gain access to local files through exploits in php programs so keep any third-party applications you re running on their latest versions especially very widespread programs like wordpress and phpbb and do whatever you can to ensure that your server is running the correct versions of its services php apache etc.

815313
hash	md5
my first attempt at this was by using md5 hash

815355
rainbowtable	hash
the only thing that i have come up with is that you can re-hash a hash several thousand times and increase the time it would take to create the final rainbowtable by a factor of 1 000.

815378
int	chars
classes are very complex and mostly very large types compared to value types like structs or basic types -- int chars etc. since stack allocation should be specialized on the efficiency of program flow it is not serving an optimal environment to keep large objects

815379
super	implements
for admin or other super accounts implements a second mean of verification limit logins to certain ip ranges use client-side-ssl certificates etc

815381
hash	md5
if you did want to use a hash md5 would be my first choice as well 16 bytes followed by sha-1 20 bytes

815382
folder	directory
2 try copying the whole directory to your iis s root folder usually wwwroot common error that iuser iwam does not have rights to read the other folder

815386
hash	salt
solution use a user salt to make hash

815390
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql which are

815412
hide	show
i would still like to let the user show and hide the toolbar but i do not want them to be able to select a different display mode small icons no icons etc

815454
free	malloc
any os which supports fork will also automatically free allocations from malloc when a process exits regardless of how it does so including termination

815454
pthreads	fork
but those environments aren t pthreads and won t support fork

815482
width	height
following is the last function called in my .emacs files it sets the height and width of the screen it does work on both emacs 22 and emacs 23 on debian and mac os x

815482
width	height
set the height and width numbers according to your screen

815562
mouse	keyboard
this lets me share one mouse and keyboard across the two machines and the clipboard is also shared across the machines

815588
width	height
i believe the problem is you aren t setting a width and height for the image somehow redundant for embedded images

815588
width	height
if you specify an image you must explicitly set a height and width of the image or else it will not appear

815588
width	height
if you define a width and a height for the image proxy in your example it will probably work

815609
titlebar	window
the wm_ncactivate message is sent to a window to change the state of its non-client area border and titlebar to inactive or active

815622
hash	md5
i d like random-looking ids md5 hash but i also want them to be small

815622
hash	md5
the basis of an id is an md5 hash of the following string user-email-address | latest-counter-value

815622
hash	md5
the resulting md5 hash is then truncated initially to four characters

815622
hash	md5
md5 hash for new ids will now be truncated at length characters rather than four characters

815622
hash	md5
would the length quickly increase to near the length of an md5 hash calling into question the value of the whole approach

junit	testng
i m using junit 4 i can t use testng

817136
memcached	apc
i m not sure memcached would really help you out so much but its worth adding as is apc for your php cahcing and i would at least architect it to be able to be load balanced - check out ultramonkey for some good documentation on how to get that going transparently you ll need to ensure that any user session that comes in doesn t store its session data in a per-host way

817267
rss	feed
your web app could publish an rss feed but your desktop app will still have to poll the feed every 10 s

817278
inherited	subclassing
this approach is a lot more brittle since the junit4 internal runners are unstable and can be changed from release to release but it has the advantage of being able to be inherited down a class hierarchy and be overridden in a subclassing

817282
subclass	accessor
then i could subclass the networkmanager override the buildconnection method and add an instance variable plus an accessor for the created connection

817285
free	malloc
to me the current level of concurrency language support is roughly equivalent to the memory management support in c not integrated but some things can be delegated to the os malloc free

817285
free	malloc
i wish some language would come up with a suitable abstraction that either makes the threads + synchronization model easier or that simply completely hides it for us just as automatic memory management make good old malloc free obsolete in java

817434
equals	tostring
and this would create a bean private fields default accessors tostring hashcode equals etc

817439
equals	gethashcode
the tag class implements equals and gethashcode and uses the name property as the only signature property

if the compiler isn t inlining both operations then either poke it until it does or find the implementation for your architecture and inline it yourself

817747
salt	md5
fingerprint is some md5 encrypted string with a salt ex

817760
folder	directory
you can verify you have done this correctly by looking in your install directory for a folder named include

i have historically used cruisecontrol which has worked just fine but i also heard good things about teamcity

818168
postgresql	mysql
if you chose sqlite or mysql or postgresql does not really matter in the column index point though

818191
accessor	properties
the properties accessor syntax

818191
accessor	properties
in your case for a properties retain properties that has been synthesized the accessor will release the old object and retain the new one

818204
post	get
you need to have session.use_trans_sid enabled to have php accept a session id passed by either get or post

818210
range	min
here is a simple example for getting a min value from a table based on a range whose bounds are defined in two other tables

818210
range	min
this uses t2.value and t3.value as the bounds of the range to find the min in

818255
stdout	stderr
in a unix shell if i want to combine stderr and stdout into the stdout stream for further manipulation i can append the following on the end of my command

818265
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout to stderr by doing

818265
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to an unspecified file appending redirects stderr to stdout

818273
integer	unsigned
to get rid of the warning you should use a static cast to an unsigned integer

818284
stdout	stderr
here is one way to remember this construct although it is not entirely accurate at first may look like a good way to redirect stderr to stdout

818299
implements	extends
how would i extends or alter the above entity class and implements the acesslevels enumerator replacing the accesslevel property

818312
stdout	stderr
to answer your question it takes any error output normally sent to stderr and writes it to standard output stdout

818312
stdout	stderr
2 1 simply points everything sent to stderr to stdout instead

818320
inherited	subclassing
because linq-to-sql supports inherited for discriminated tables etc it expects an exact match to a known entity type - not unexpected subclassing

818346
apache	nginx	passenger	thin
this means they can be served by your front-end web server apache nginx etc. faster than if they were to go through mongrel thin or phusion passenger

818356
post	get
if you still have issues can you please post the error message you get that would help.

818368
stdout	stderr
that construct sends the standard error stream stderr to the current location of standard output stdout - this currency issue appears to have been neglected by the other answers

818368
stdout	stderr
you can redirect any output handle to another by using this method but it s most often used to channel stdout and stderr streams into a single stream for processing

818368
stdout	stderr
note that that last one will not direct stderr to outfile2 - it redirects it to what stdout was when the argument was encountered outfile1 and then redirects stdout to outfile2

818423
post	get
avoid using _request which is too vague it includes get post and cookie values and use the _post or _get if those are what you really mean and do check with

818424
datamapper	activerecord
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install

818435
rss	feed
there exists an rss feed with over 1000 items

818435
rss	feed
i want to create a yahoo pipes rss feed that returns a subset of the feed s items specified by the index of the first and last item

818435
rss	feed
for example i could pass in first 500 and last 600 and the pipe will return an rss feed with only the 500th through 600th itemd in the source feed

818546
width	height
i do not know how to solve it i have set 100 or auto height and width on

818584
modula-2	oberon
porting wirth s modula-2 compiler or oberon compiler should be easy

818584
modula-2	oberon
here s my bottom line on modula-2 and oberon

818584
modula-2	oberon
ada does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with modula-2 and oberon

818634
mouse	keyboard
could this be achieved by setting up a fake keyboard or mouse driver for a fake keyboard or mouse that when queried as to the current state of a key would reply giving an answer of your choice or by any other means

818667
udp	tcp
i think c# does provide a raw socket class but if you try to emulate tcp ip and udp and spoof addresses not belong to you re host it actually drops you re packets

818770
datarow	bindingsource
i have a datatable i was trying to use a datarow but it was having none of that and a bindingnavigator which seemed to be the magic ingredient with a bindingsource and i m programmatically binding controls to it

819159
ilist	ienumerator
system collections generic ienumerator this method is probably inherited from ilist class

819163
children	parent
just for your information i just did a quick investigation of the difference between validate and revalidate and it seems to be that validate will the layout for the component the method was called on and its children while revalidate will go all the way up to its highest parent and then perform layout changes and such to all its children

819167
jobs	cron
cron jobs is a mechanism to automate tasks in linux operating system

819167
jobs	cron

this is more of a pie-in-the-sky comment than a real answer to your question but i thought i d post it to get people thinking

819317
int	chars
the question was why use int why not chars why are they separate

819327
int	chars
int is usually bigger than chars â more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

819368
google-chrome	safari
this messes up the layout in google-chrome and safari

819416
width	height
i need a solution for auto-adjusting the width and height of an iframe to barely fit its content

i wonder what advantages and disadvantages have modern frameworks jsf wicket tapestry.. over old plain jsp

819688
boost	stl
so you couldn t use the stl boost etc

819688
stringstream	fstream	ostream	istream
you couldn t even use the standard iostream class and derivatives like stringstream fstream which inherit both from istream and ostream

819744
disk	ram
sometimes it takes up to 2-3 seconds but i m attributing it to my database server several years old laptop with 3gb ram and slow disk

819796
ironruby	ironpython
i like the type-safety i get in my production code with a statically-typed language like c# but for my tests i would be happy to use a dynamically-typed language ironpython or ironruby to avoid all the explicit casting

819813
width	height
properties describe object qualities or characteristics color height width etc.

819835
inherited	properties
to be able to do this we make sure the license plate number is a properties in the most general class in the inherited line probably the vehicle class

i ve used cgi php jsp struts spring mvc 1.2 bea workshop jsf seam spring mvc 2.5 and wicket in that order

819893
jsf	seam
you need another framework on top of both of them to really solve the problems as seen with seam framework which makes jsf usable

819905
mvvm	delegatecommand
it uses the delegatecommand for commanding and it should be a great starting template for you mvvm projects

819911
spweb	spsite
yet another update - based on your comment it looks like site may be a spsite instead of a spweb

819911
spweb	spsite
note that the openweb method can take no parameters which works fine if the spsite was instantiated with the full url to your spweb

820028
httpsession	sessioncontext
we use it in a java ee environment to pass user identity to classes that are not java ee aware don t have access to httpsession or the ejb sessioncontext

820030
des	aes
this is orders of magnitude faster than des aes etc. i do as many rounds as i can in 3ns which is only about 6

820064
pop-up	dialog
it turns out that to achieve what i wanted the easiest way is to set focus to something in my pop-up dialog and to set the tabnavigation property to keyboardnavigationmode.cycle

820077
postgresql	mysql
it may additionally support other databases mysql postgresql etc since our development environment often requires switching between different databases

820176
memcached	apc
you could also use objects that have been loaded in session or in cache apc memcached before

the problem was that i ve put my class into sun.java.awt package to get access to package protected members without putting it into rt.jar and exception was thrown hen calling imagefetcher.class

820351
moq	nmock
rhinomocks nmock and moq cannot do this because these libraries are simpler

820473
width	font-size
the javascript animation effects tend to want to change a couple predefined values like width or font-size

820473
width	text-align
in order to transfer from picture 1 to picture 2 using the float or text-align methods i must remove the floating text-align then set the width of the bar color but that doesn t work if i want to keep the javascript overhead minimal for such a simple task

820526
boost	stl
optimally this map should use only stl and or boost constructs

820589
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome etc

820629
versioning	upgrade
they will be forced to upgrade or maintain parrallel versioning of the project file

820630
typemock	nmock
the most common references seem to be rhinomocks nmock and typemock

820644
profiling	debugging
the provisioning profiling contains a list of devices that are allowed to run or debugging your code

820649
installation	upgrade
upgrade to 1.7.1 or follow these instructions to fix your 1.7.0 installation

820694
put	get
we have some feature branches that can get put on ice for a few weeks at a time

820709
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
in particular if you get an object reference to the spsite or spweb from the current context and try to dispose of it either with a using clause or try finally you ll get object reference error from the sharepoint stack

820709
spweb	spsite
the right way to do dispose of your sp objects spsite spweb etc is to instanciate a new sp object as opposed to using the context to get it from a site using a url

820727
int	double
the second and fourth tokens are numbers hence you will need to convert these from string to int or double

820744
openmpi	mpich
you mention that you are using openmp - you shouldn t actually need to use mpirun or mpiexec as you would with mpich or openmpi programs

820744
openmpi	mpich
openmp works in a fairly different way than message-passing libraries openmp uses multiple threads within the same process but mpich and openmpi use multiple processes

820791
doc	rtf
i think i can use the rtf generation to create a doc-readable file that can then be edited using doc and re-saved

820791
doc	rtf
however i believe the formatting in rtf is limited compared to doc

820819
int	chars
the standard mandates very few limitations on chars and int

820829
keydown	keyup
you have to use keyup event not keydown .

820861
getter	setter
there you have it -- all of the advantages of externally-generated getter setter functions with none of the mess

820861
getter	setter
this ability to painlessly incorporate future changes is actually the main reason people use getter setter functions instead of public members in the first place

820879
hex	binary
the transformation between binary and hex text formats can be done quickly and efficiently with lookup tables but anything involving decimal text format will be more complicated

820883
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
while you may not merge from the custom versioning to the head its that likely code in the mainstream head that you might want to migrate into your custom branch to upgrade the custom versioning

820919
uiview	subviews
the documentation says that the clipstobounds property of uiview will clip the drawing to the bounds or more precisely that the subviews can t draw outside of the bounds of the superview

820928
keydown	keyup
on keydown you can use this to enable the translucency and on keyup you can disable the effect again

820991
post	get
your assumption is correct the url is not expected to be modified in subequent post backs and you need to parse the query string only on the get which happens the first time the page is loaded

821054
hex	binary
let s think about half of task for a moment - converting from a string-ized base n to unsigned long where n is a power of 2 base 2 for binary and base 16 for hex

821072
mouse	keyboard
most of the time when you re doing data entry modification you don t want to drop your hands off the keyboard to move the mouse to the submit update button especially with large volumes of data to work with

821080
width	height
place the content inside a wrapper tag such as a div and set the div with a fixed width height and style of overflow hidden to ensure that a particularly long word doesn t force out the width of the cell

821096
width	height
also your svg tag may need width height attributes see svg spec

821123
hash	md5
you can do an md5 hash of both files to determine if they are identical

821140
tostring	string.format
while you could call string.format i think it s easier to just call tostring on it

821163
children	parent
you create a book parent with 10 pages children

821187
width	height
i know that i can set the height and width on the datagrid but i don t want the user to have to use the scroll bars on the datagrid as it has a few hundred records

821349
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
this cannot be done in the same way as a radiobuttonlist for a dropdownlist the correct attribute event name is onchange instead of onclientclick

821363
nspopupbutton	nsformatter
i want to use an nsformatter subclass to format the contents of an nspopupbutton i m using to display a list of choices

821391
.nettiers	codesmith
our dal uses codesmith to generate code from .nettiers templates which creates these datarepository classes that contain all the methods for crud type transaction to the datasource

821402
pop-up	dialog
ie8 has a feature that pop-up a dialog box that informs me when a web page stops responding that s a bit annoying when debugging as it steals focus from visual studio

821421
width	height
you can set the width and height properties to percentages for example a width of 100 would cause the image to stretch across your page

821434
int	chars
if your memory allocations are made in terms of sizeof tchar you ll probably be ok but if there is code where the original programmer was assuming that chars were 1 byte each and they used int in malloc statements that s hard to do a global search for

821494
post	get
2009-04-28 16 41 15 post forecast currentlineitems - 443 domain username xx.xx.xx.xx 302 2009-04-28 16 41 15 get shared error - 443 - xx.xx.xx.xx 401 1 0

821501
javacc	ragel
i have looked at the following and they might work javacc jlex ragel

821583
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that and are on different places in the text and sometimes glued to other text therefore the empty spaces as delimiter doesn t help me

821584
subtract	add
so as others have noted add a day then subtract the smallest time quantum a tick and you get the last possible time for the current day

821667
unsigned	short
and also the specific problem i am having is that i have a class which has an unsigned short array where the last space of the array changes if i do this

821670
integer	fractions
you will get a fractions result so feel free to convert the result to an integer with to_i

821675
domcontentloaded	onload
on domcontentloaded you ll have to check each image for complete to decide whether to add them immediately to the document or wait for the image s onload listener to fire

821714
pop-up	dialog
must be completely transparent to end user user must not have to change their printer settings and then change them back or deal with a save as dialog and then open the file they saved - it needs to just pop-up

821740
for-loop	loops
a touch more info i m open to all sorts of answers array_sum a for-loop a foreach loops

821811

821816
google-chrome	firefox
also this works in google-chrome in addition to firefox

821830
hash	md5
did you remember to base64 encode the md5 hash in php

821836
accessor	properties
basically if you say nonatomic and you generate the accessor using synthesize then if multiple threads try to change read the properties at once badness can happen

821836
accessor	properties
of course if you implement your own accessor rather than using synthesize i think these declarations do nothing except express your intent as to whether the properties is implemented in a threadsafe manner

821846
hash	md5
the issue is php s md5 function by default returns the hex variation of the hash where c# is returning the raw byte output that must then be made text safe with base64 encoding

821862
hide	show
on my control i want to show or hide some rows of a table

821862
hide	show
the text of both labels are show on the page lbltohide does not hide

821864
min	max
count min max elimination every execute

821869
range	minimum
the documentation says the default range for the spin button has the maximum set to zero 0 and the minimum set to 100

821879
min	max
to fix it just interchange the min and max values you are currently useing when you call setrange

821980
hash	md5
if you are trying to make restful urls for some set of unique data why wouldn t you use a hash such as md5

822032
g++	gcc
it is also not present on alternative stl implementations like gcc s libstdc++ for mingw -w64 as of version g++ 4.8.x

822033
client-side	server-side
dividing them into groups you could have them take different approaches server-side client-side database supported etc. approaches to this

822079
firefox	safari
another thing might be that firefox ignores the windows proxy whereas ie and safari likely use the default windows proxy settings - control panel - internet - connections - lan settings

822194
accessor	properties
in addition to what s already been said about threadsafeness non-atomic properties are faster than atomic accessor

822202
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
it s available in ff3+ ie safari opera google-chrome

822242
centos	linux
all software downloads are free and each comes with a development license that allows you to use full versions of the products at no charge while developing and prototyping your applications or for strictly self-educational purposes unless you re using xe on a laptop or a low-powered vm i d go for the enterprise edition on a 300 pc on linux centos

822244
vb6	vba
this is to put us on notice that vba vb6 for that matter will at some point be a thing of the past

822245
wordpress	phpbb
from keeping applications wordpress phpbb etc up to date and patched to actual attacks like sql injection and cross-site scripting

822262
try-catch	exception-handling
when i surround this with a try-catch block and breakpoint on the catch if the exception-handling was thrown the file would already be deleted from the disk

the default mtas will work fine sendmail qmail postfix exim etc.

822339
rar	zip
i am trying to batch extract some rar s that are in some zip in some directories

822341
spaces	delimiter
you probably want to require some kind of delimiter spaces quotes depends on what you re doing and disallow some characters inside urls probably the same characters and or any characters that aren t allowed in urls

822363
int	chars
using int arithmetic where is the i th chars of the string n is the length of the string and indicates exponentiation

822375
setinterval	settimeout
the eval function and its relatives function settimeout and setinterval provide access to the javascript compiler

822381
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that for uses spaces as the default delimiter

822407
nstextfield	nstableview
assuming your nstableview s columns are bound to an nsarraycontroller you can bind the value of the nstextfield label to your array controller s with controller key arrangedobjects and with a key path of count

822446
onclick	onsubmit
if so i d recommend dropping the submit mechanism and using a button type with an onclick handler and not submit button w a onsubmit handler.

822451
rss	feed
i am making an application iphone app which gets information jokes from an rss feed then populates the tableview

822451
rss	feed
and how do i receive information from an rss feed

822454
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in every browser firefox safari google-chrome except ie7 and ie8 with example input text like this

822454
google-chrome	firefox
however surprisingly to me at least this does not work in firefox and google-chrome

822454
google-chrome	firefox
the same tests passed 100 on firefox and google-chrome

822469
unix	bsd
i was wondering if there are any small bsd or unix releases

822513
rss	feed
a simple example for pulling in rss feed data is the seismic xml example on the apple developer samples site at

822547
google-chrome	firefox
note needs to be compatible with most brosers ie6 ie7 firefox google-chrome

822570
google-chrome	firefox	versioning	upgrade
probably the best way would be to detect the user s browser user-agent string and redirect them to a page asking them to upgrade or download a different browser such as firefox or google-chrome if they are using an old versioning of ie

822575
multiplication	modulo
it s fast too since it doesnt involve multiplication or modulo

822607
getter	setter
the basic idea is you would decide on some convention to tell your perl script when to generate a getter or setter

822607
getter	setter
given code like this i could write a script to look for comment lines consisting of the comment get or set on the line s before a member variable declaration and then replace them with simple setter getter

822607
getter	setter
instead scan each line individually and if you find an appropriate comment line push something that says i need a getter setter onto a stack then when you see the associated member variable pop things off of the stack and generate the code

822646
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
if you use the underscore prefix for your ivars which is nothing more than a common convention but a useful one then you need to do 1 extra thing so the auto-generated accessor for the properties knows which ivar to use

822669
inherited	subclassing	public	protected
basically you want public or protected variable to be declared in foo since these are the variables that subclassing inherited from their parent and therefore seen in baz

822676
getter	setter
if you want to be able to somehow tag your member variable and have getter and or setter skeletons automatically generated for you than a ide macro seems more appropriate

822708
rss	feed
or you can drink from the firehose and follow the rails project on github and you may even get a rss feed for that

822752
haskell	ocaml
i am wondering if i should continue to learn ocaml or switch to f# or haskell

822786
int	chars	int	boolean	16-bit	64bit	unsigned	short
java has always made a distinction between the scalar types which are not classes boolean true false chars unsigned 16-bit short signed 16-bit int signed 32-bit and long signed 64bit

822828
free	malloc
this will work if you and the user agree to use the same allocation like malloc free

822833
public	protected
in java there is the same public protected and private scopes that exist in other places like c++

822833
public	protected
note however that if you don t specify whether something is public protected or private it s none of those things

822845
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml are both mature languages with strong implementations

822845
haskell	ocaml
both ocaml and haskell are being used to write lots of different kinds of programs not just compilers and ai or whatever

822871
postgresql	mysql
i don t know if the null-out-the-source-blob trick is possible in mysql or postgresql

822884
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
if it matters i m primarily interested in this under debian or ubuntu linux

822893
firefox	safari
there are plenty of new browsers out there that don t support javascript or don t support it well and they can be just as important as the latest safari or firefox

823006
uiview	subviews
add it as a subviews -- you and the uiview owns it

823021
passenger	webrick
the reason for all of the server restarts isn t necessarily because your webserver webrick mongrel phusion passenger is flaky but because when your rails app has started up there are certain things loaded into memory load paths initializers environment data

823051
haskell	ocaml
ocaml and haskell have been surving well for a number of years which bodes well for their future

823051
haskell	ocaml
perf i don t have enough first-hand experience with haskell but based on second-hand and third-hand info i think ocaml or f# are more pragmatic in the sense that i think it is unlikely you ll be able to get the same run-time perf in haskell that you do in ocaml of f#

823051
haskell	ocaml
tooling i don t have enough personal experience to compare but i think the vs integration with f# is superior to anything you ll find for ocaml haskell today and f# will continue to improve a bit here over the next year

823051
haskell	ocaml
if you know a big long-term project you want to use it for one may stand out but i think many of the skills will be transferable more easily between f# and ocaml than to from haskell but also more easily among any of these three than with say java

823115
mouseout	mouseenter
i was using jquery and ended up hooking into mouseenter and mouseout instead of the events you are using

823151
width	height
try to set the width and height of the control to the dimensions of the image and set the scalecontent property to true

823159
width	height
this will add scroll bars to the div if the inside content grows past its set width or height

823166
children	parent
this means that the second child array you have in children of the parent node is not the same array that you add grandchild to but a copy of it

823174
mousemove	mousedown
i could not add mousemove event after mousedown with

823178
getter	setter
ie the getter is the setter as you only want to cache it when it is used once.

823186
maven	m2e
i m trying to share multi-module maven project using m2e plug-in from springsource tool suite 2.0.0 to subversion server subversive plug-in for eclipse

823207
int	chars
i know that its possible to read from a .txt file and then convert various parts of that into string chars and int values but is it possible to take a string and use it as real code in the program

823229
put	get
maybe i should just put a go button so i have something to get the focus away from the textfield

in safari google-chrome firefox 2 ie 8 and konquerer and probably others you can do it in css by using the border-radius property

823274
debian	linux
here s what happens when i compile the very same source code with gcc 4.3 on debian linux

823276
children	parent
what i was thinking to do is to extract interfaces for httpcontextextensions and httpclient make a children for each one and implement the interfaces delegating to the parent and then using the interfaces in my code

823302
g++	gcc
the files will be compiled with the objective-c++ compiler so things will behave more like g++ than gcc but since that s what you want it probably doesn t count as a surprise

823338
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml both have very consistent stories about operator overloading

823359
int	chars
function load_data int int returns a chars

823380
config	ini
the zend framework contains a config parses that parses files that are written in the ini format zend_config_ini it sounds like this is what you are using

823380
config	ini
the ini format is specialized to provide both the ability to have a hierarchy of config data keys and inheritance between config data sections

823381
object-pascal	delphi
of course the downside is if that you don t know delphi which is object-pascal you have to familiarize yourself with a new language

823401
multiplication	exponent
exp has to perform several multiplication to arrive at its answer whereas log only has to convert the mantissa and exponent to base-e from base-2

823405
versioning	upgrade
but then when i create a new versioning of the library my framework installer has to carry both the old and the new library to make sure upgrade don t remove the old library that might be in use by some application

fgets	fgetc
use some of the file reading functions fgets fgetc fscanf and pass in stdin as the file path or php stdin depending on how new your version of php is

823649
getter	setter
generally it s a good idea to keep the actions of setter or getter for that matter to a relatively small set of actions

823705
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to find a way to programatically get set the default osx system keyboard shortcuts hotkeys found in the system preferences - keyboard mouse - keyboard shortcuts tab

824160
profiling	debugging
that is necessary for the profiling to profiling my code while in debugging mode the result

824173
versioning	upgrade
i have not upgrade from 2.1 to the newer versioning so i can only talk about the relatively old 2.1 from 2001. â

you cannot set the property to unlimited or infinity or anything like that but you can use the maxvalue of the data type you are using integer.maxvalue decimal.maxvalue etc. which will give you as far a range as possible without incurring overflow errors

824704
post	get
alternatively code to conditionally redirect to the same page on another site could create another virtual site with compression disabled but need to pass all parameters get post

824782
maven	pom.xml
but are there any best practices in the maven community for how i should name this library s coordinates in my pom.xml since a standard is not already set in public repositories for it

824809
polymorphism	specialization
a data type that can appear to be of a generalized type a list with elements of arbitrary type is designated polymorphism data type like the generalized type from which such specialization are made

824815
mouseover	mouseout
the first function of hover is a mouseover and second function is mouseout

824828
getter	setter
by default these two methods return only public getter and setter risking a nullreferenceexception in a case like this but passing true as above makes them also return private ones

824837
post	get
for iis 5.1 only i setup the .resource extension in iis website properties home directory tab configuration button add to work with get head and post

824837
post	get
edit i changed the post to get and in all 3 cases it submitted the data correctly so it is not a form problem

824863
switching	screens
however i find that if i perform a lot of activities and then switching between views i end up with a blank screens and my view is not drawn

824870
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
that said if you are using only visual studio and will be doing ci builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcity i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net

824895
gridview	objectdatasource
i am using an objectdatasource with a gridview to get data from my orm class but i cannot get it to order by properly

824928
jboss	glassfish
a servlet container eg tomcat or a full-blown application server eg glassfish jboss

824930
jboss	glassfish
you can get started with a simple servlet container ie tomcat rather than a full blown application server eg jboss glassfish

824949
rss	feed
i m trying to find a library that can read a given rss atom feed and that can guess its format and abstract it as a list of items

824949
rss	feed
the idea is to build a simple rss reader that could take any feed

825057
lxml	beautifulsoup
is this possible using beautifulsoup or lxml

825061
clang	llvm
note anyways that the llvm crew also builds an own complete c c++ obj-c compiler called clang

825061
clang	llvm
so if someone says compiler llvm he really either means llvm-gcc or clang

825062
getter	setter
you might also want to look into targetnullvalue which make a certain value equivalent to null if you set targetnullvalue 5 and your user enters 5 your setter will get null and if your getter supplies null the binding will display 5

825100
submit	submission
accordingly there seems to be no consensus on whether for a submit button will stop form submission or not

825100
onclick	onsubmit
this might end up requiring the button s onclick set some state that the form s onsubmit inspects but if i can just return false then that s great

825100
onclick	onsubmit
even if not it would then be critical what order the onsubmit and onclick handlers get fired does the button dispatch the submit before running its click handler

825100
submit	submission
i have had no luck finding any sort of authoritative resource as to what browsers actually do when you interact with their elements what the default action is whether the onclick handler for a submit button fires before or after the form submission dispatch etc.

825157
profiling	debugging
that is why it is a good idea to profiling in both debugging and release modes

825157
profiling	debugging
if release mode only shows function foo using 80 of the program time you can use the debugging profiling to see that function bar which was inlined into foo is using 60 of foo s time

825164
post	get
edit do i have to post a duplicate to get an answer

825183
submit	submission
setting will keep the submit button from submission the form but it will not keep the form from being submitted

825200
button	checkbox
for checkbox radio button dynamic content i would expect these to be dynamic yet predictable

825213
jboss	glassfish
a servlet container eg tomcat or a full-blown application server eg glassfish jboss

825218
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox and webkit based browsers although beware google-chrome has bugs in this area use their css border-radius based styles for native rounded corners

the methods which require fdlibm semantics are sin cos tan asin acos atan exp log log10 cbrt atan2 pow sinh cosh tanh hypot expm1 and log1p

825263
folder	directory
or is there some way i can change the working directory to the user s root backup folder so i can simply specify relative file paths

825274
filtering	grouping
you can then use the filtering property to filtering by grouping user etc.

825278
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the getvalue function not included here is a clumsy solution it checks for various types textbox dropdownlistfor checkbox etc. and gets the string value from the appropriate property textbox.text dropdownlist.selectedvalue checkbox.checked etc.

825282
width	height
this draws a textured rectangle with width w and height h

825313
mouse	keyboard
you can alleviate this problem a little by removing the mouse keyboard and the screen and only access the buildserver through rdp or something similar

825345
versioning	upgrade
if that s not the answer you can always try to upgrade your rails versioning to 2.3 and see if the problem persists

825367
post	get
take a look at this post to get an idea about how this can be implemented

825406
try-catch	exception-handling
unchecked exception-handling are a good way to notify your clients about exceptional situations including illegal pre-conditions and yet not burdening them with the need to wrap calls to your api with try-catch blocks which most of the time basically serve no purpose other than debugging tracing etc

825413
listview	gridview
now things have changed and the datagrid has been replaced by the gridview and or listview

825445
listview	gridview
i d say that you should investigate the gridview listview to see what they can do but ultimately if you and your customers are happy with your own code and it works for you does everything you need it to then there s no need to change just because there is something else out there

825481
udp	tcp
i am trying to write rules to drop any packet irrespective if it is outgoing incoming or being forwareded which has a specific sub string in the tcp or udp payload how am i suppose to do that

savefiledialog	openfiledialog
in the application i m working on i ve been trying to use the savefiledialog and openfiledialog for their customary purpose saving and opening files.

825554
hash	md5
i am in the process of trying to user md5 hash of the urls instead but in the meantime i was just wondering if there was a way i could check on the length of a string stored in a variable

825624
mouseleave	mouseenter
or two manually setup mouseenter mouseleave events to handle your hover style

825697
getter	setter
it s not a solution rather workaround - but you might try generate equals then use encapsulate field refactoring to replace all field acceses to use getter setter it works inside class also

825700
post	get
you just need get and post versions of your action

825704
inherited	properties
you could do this by creating a new class that inherited from form and has a field properties constructor for your person

825710
textarea	textbox
how can i select all textbox and textarea e.g

825734
mouse	keyboard
there are a couple of things you can do to improve your keyboard mouse usage ratio with eclipse

825742
margin	height
wrap them around your content and use negative margin s and background positions to get the right effect that spans the height of the fluid content

825746
cos	sin	cos	exp
ieee doesn t specify the output of math functions sin cos exp ...

825787
versioning	upgrade
i don t need to have the compatibility with older versioning once it is upgrade

825793
installation	upgrade
upgrade don t exist for installscript projects but there are no windows installer restrictions to keep you from running multiple installation simultaneously

825941
prepare	execute
in the past i ve used the sqlite3_exec function to execute sql statements instead of the harder prepare statement api

825961
getter	setter
to use your example the iaccount interface you describe exposes getter and setter on the account object

825963
filesystems	ntfs
in ntfs if your filesystems is set to compress the final file might be smaller than what your actual file might be

825969
kde	gnome
my intention is to find out if the switch user under kde gnome has a similar api call i can monitor with freepascal

825991
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m going to assume if it s iqueryable it is also ienumerable

825997
button	checkbox
the togglecontrols function to disable enable all the controls inside the table this means all textboxes button checkbox radio button and dropdowns looks like this

826045
getter	setter
adding interfaces is really useful for design patterns like strategy and visitor but in those cases i don t carbon copy the getter and setter of the domain classes

826052
inherited	properties
inherited from game and override the methods you intend to use in your tests to return canned values or shortcut calculations for whatever methods properties that you need

826077
awt	swing
of course their might be some libraries that are specifically designed for java gui stuff like swing or awt

826096
post	put
however the login progess is a long process as there are many things that have to be initialized and checks to be made i have only put a few on here as it would make the code to long to post

826103
folder	directory
based on this directory structure and what you ve shown so far the service class would go in a myproject.services.service folder under the myproject.services directory

826103
folder	directory
the customerservice class would go in a myproject.services.service.support folder under the myproject.services directory

826104
uiview	subviews
then you could itterate through an nsarray myarray containing the uiview adding them as subviews in order of depth

826107
post	get
do it the same way everyone else does it pass around db-generated tokens between sites with get or post then validate those tokens back to a web service that talks to the db directly

826146
recv	epoll
experimenting i ve found that epollhup only happens in conjunction with epollerr the reason for this may be the way python interfaces with epoll and lowlevel io normally recv would return a -1 and set errno to eagain when nothing is available on a non-blocking recv however python uses nothing returned to signal eof

826146
recv	epoll
it seems that epollin and a recv that returns an empty string is indicative of the other end having closed the connection however using an older version of python before epoll were introduced and plain select on a pipe i ve experienced that a read that returned did not indicate eof just a lack of available data

826261
lisp	scheme
learn lisp or scheme

826309
put	get
here the requirement is to get the sum total of all the digits in the cells in column c and put the value in the corresponding cell in column b in my example - 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1 2.5

826373
cvs	svn
tortoisesvn works with putty to do the ssh thing--sorry if this doesn t totally make sense i m a total svn newbie i always used cvs

826373
collabnet	svn
so i downloaded the client from tigris.org--which actually redirected me to a place called collabnet which had me register a username and password just to download the svn client--still don t know what that was all about

826403
photoshop	fireworks
fireworks is my preferred tool but photoshop s also more than up to it

826453
rss	feed
what would be most efficient to cache the generation of say an rss feed

826463
pull	push
git allows you to push pull aka commit update to from an svn server too but gives you more leeway on the side

826480
int	double
the property tag is always outputting an int even when the evaluated value is a double

826510
int	double
you re doing int arithmetic because your inputs are int not double two divided by four is zero for int

826521
svg	vml
however this guy did it using vml for ie and svg for other browsers see scaled circles section

826551
aptana	radrails
i m trying to get into rails development and am using aptana radrails as a plugin to eclipse winxp

826551
post	get
going through the same exercise with another dbms selected in the new project screen worked just fine and i have been able to hack through things to get my project switched over from mysql to sql server by installing the ms jdbc driver and getting the ado.rb file copied into my ruby install ala this post

826567
for-loop	loops
so most of the time in the for-loop is spent creating strings assigning them to a variable and then overwriting them the next time through loops

826571
put	get
you take something from get and put it right into the sql query

826614
versioning	upgrade
after your database can track what versioning # it is on - it can do sql upgrade automatically

826632
allocator	stl
i haven t written c++ code with a custom stl allocator but i can imagine a webserver written in c++ which uses a custom allocator for automatic deletion of temporary data needed for responding to a http request

826635
allocator	stl
as i mention here i ve seen intel tbb s custom stl allocator significantly improve performance of a multithreaded app simply by changing a single

826694
cos	sin	cos	exp
as noted by steve schnepp the output of math functions such as sin cos exp etc

826739
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if this is your users choice leave it to their browsers most mature browsers us a zoom that magnifies their page rendering ie 7 8 opera firefox google-chrome 2.0 safari

826755
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
background we have overloads for malloc calloc free and the various variants of operator new and delete and the linker happily makes stl use these for us

826781
many-to-one	one-to-many
the only other way i can think to force it to audit is to convert the relationship to a one-to-many from person to personaddress one-to-many from address to personaddress and create another class element for personaddress that does the many-to-one mappings back to person and address

826790
yacc	bison
if you use a tool such as bison yacc for c or antlr generates a number of languages but uses java you won t have to worry much about parsing

826807
yacc	bison
use yacc or bison or the equivalent for writing the descendent recursive parser

826818
set	bag
have you specified the collection as a list type rather than a bag or a set

826849
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you can do so in firefox and safari google-chrome also

826887
cvs	svn
this is the primary advantage of switching from svn or cvs to a distributed system like git

826901
public	protected
you mean you would like to map private or protected members to the database rather than having them all public

826908
rss	feed
i created a simple rss reader and wrote javascript to get the feed using google s api then dealing with that javascript object because it came back as json

826908
hide	show
i then developed some javascript to hide show div tags

826910
rss	feed
it could use rss to monitor feed and let you know when new questions are asked with your tags

826923
hash	md5
the previous suggestion to use an md5 hash is a good one although you have to prevent that from becoming a performance problem in and of itself

826966
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup
as others have said you can use mouse.cursorpos or the getcursorpos function but you can also just handle the onmousedown or onmouseup event instead of onclick

826987
getter	setter
you can define the access modifier per property and independently for the getter and the setter

827042
freebsd	aix
my guess is that they don t have an aix or freebsd also not there machine around to do it

827049
post	get
use the hidden field on form post to get the id of the employee

827178
vim	emacs
if you plan you configure anything in a unix based system likelihood is you going to be editing a fair few config files therefore you ll want to learn a terminal based editor of which vim is one of the best sorry emacs

827178
vim	textmate
no need to post i need a textmate alternative for insert os you ll have vim instead

827210
perl	tcl
that which applies to perl does not necessarily apply to python nor does what applies in tcl apply in java or lisp or .

827224
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i have a flash movie that runs fine in firefox opera safari but not in ie

827227

width	height
set width and height to 2000

827353
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
firefox safari opera etc

827386
chown	chmod
your users will also need to chmod and chown the files appropriately

827406
haskell	ocaml
haskell currently list 144 jobs on indeed ocaml list 12 and c# list 26 000

827406
haskell	ocaml
these numbers are not perfect but i bet you that once f# ships it won t be long before it blows past haskell and ocaml in the number of job listings

827465
salt	md5
put a salt md5 with the user s agent + remoteip + your salt in the user s session and make it verify on every page load that the correct md5 is in their cookie

827479
margin	height
create an empty margin that runs the height of the page

827495
google-chrome	firefox
now the pure css one works well in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

827495
google-chrome	firefox
it is my understanding and the behaviour of firefox and google-chrome that this should not be the case because the left divs are block level elements that floats should basically ignore

827512
int	double	multiplying	modulo
write a little helper function which takes the double float and returns an int precision by multiplying by 1000 and then doing modulo 10 100 1000

827522
width	height
there is an outer box with a fixed height and width with the overflow set to hidden

827527

inherited	subclassing
described here jaxb inherited unmarshal to subclassing of marshaled class

827588
wtl	atl
from unmanaged c++ you can use either native win32 api mfc or atl wtl

827588
wtl	atl
atl wtl is a lightweight c++ template library which started as a c++ wrappers for com and later adopted some ideas from mfc thus sharing the same classes names for support of win32 windowing

827588
wtl	atl
the atl windowing support was later split into wtl which was then released as open source

827594
haskell	ocaml
should you learn f# or haskell if you know ocaml

827594
haskell	ocaml
in contrast both ocaml and haskell are being developed in extremely unproductive directions

827594
haskell	ocaml
this has been killing ocaml for several years now and i expect haskell to follow suit over the next few years

827594
haskell	ocaml
most former professional ocaml and haskell programmers already moved on to f# credit suisse flying frog consultancy and most of the rest will doubtless migrate to more practical alternatives such as clojure and scala in the near future

827594
haskell	ocaml
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

827594
haskell	ocaml
nobody has ever succeeded selling libraries to ocaml and haskell programmers and i am one of the few people to have tried but f# libraries already sell in significant quantities

827594
haskell	ocaml
ocaml is specifically designed for writing theorem provers and haskell is specifically designed for researching haskell

827594
haskell	ocaml
f# was designed to address all of the most serious practical problems with ocaml and haskell such as poor interoperability lack of concurrent garbage collection and lack of mature modern libraries like wpf in order to bring a productive modern language to a large audience

827613
innodb	myisam
note also by default windows installations use innodb tables while ubuntu installations use myisam tables

827616
hash	salt
a hash generated from the user information and some salt

827623
put	get
all the url variables get variables are put into the php variable as an array

827630
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
table names using myisam at least on windows are case-insensitive whereas it s case-sensitive on unix linux

827686
put	get
when i start the application without debugging i get an exception i put the info that i get from the exception here

827711
hide	show
do you toggle comments or slabs of code to quickly show or hide content

827711
hide	show
php - defining something like hide works well other variables could be production or dev - large slabs can then be hidden and show together with one simple variable change

827722
codeigniter	kohana
has anyone transferred code from codeigniter to kohana before

827722
codeigniter	kohana
i guess we re gonna keep this project as a codeigniter one and move to kohana as soon as our next project comes

827724
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
now since you ve changed the display mode from block implied to inline any padding margin width or height styles you applied to li elements will not work

827750
ceil	floor
mike s approach is reasonable but you can compute the number of digits directly using the log10 function and use either floor or ceil to verify that you in fact have an integer value

827778
width	height
presumably it comes from dimension the length width height of something

827787
switching	screens
for example open preview and choose file grab timed screens then switching back to the iphone simulator and hold the mouse button down on the row in the table view until the screens flashes

827808
codeigniter	kohana
see kohana s documentation - migrating from codeigniter

827808
codeigniter	kohana
kohana has changed substantially since forking from codeigniter

827859
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
sml ocaml haskell and f# use type inference algorithms based upon hindley-milner whereas scala has only local type inference like c# 3 and requires many more annotations to compile

827859
ocaml	sml
sml ocaml f#

827859
haskell	scheme
haskell mathematica and scheme

827859
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
sml ocaml f# and haskell allow closed sealed algebraic types to be defined to strengthen static typing by conveying more specific constraints implicitly

827859
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
ocaml and f# also allow open sum types whereas sml does not and haskell requires an elaborate workaround described by oleg kiselyov

827859
ocaml	sml
pattern matching is very fast in sml and vanilla ocaml but has unknown performance in f# due to active patterns and even unknown asymptotic complexity in mathematica

827895
post	get
but this passes a get request and chances are that you ll need a post

827913
vim	emacs
either of vim or emacs folding meets this need for me

827941
post	get
session_start creates a session or resumes the current one based on the current session id that s being passed via a request such as get post or a cookie

827947
post	get
if this is true then you should probably be using a get view rather than post

827954
accessor	properties
for example the windows token role provider has a lot of members that throw notimplmentedexception the token role provider is a read-only provider for ad so all of the properties set accessor throw exceptions

827960
yacc	bison
i ve not used bison but yacc allows you to override the error handling and i would hope the equivalent gnu tool was at least as powerful as our old unix clunkers

827961
equals	gethashcode
the dictionary will use gethashcode to determine if two lists are possibly equals and the equals method to determine if they actually are in other words the hash code is fast but could give a false positive but never a false negative

827961
equals	gethashcode
use your existing hashing algorithm the xor for gethashcode then just comare the two lists explicitly in the equals method

827981
range	minimum
at a bare minimum you will have to look at every line in the file up to and including the first one outside your range i m assuming the lines are in date time order

828010
hide	show
you can create a set of all possible controls in the same area of the parent window and show only the relevant one and hide all the others

828010
hide	show
when the user causes the control change you hide the active control and show the new relevant

828019
put	get
i also created a restful controller plugin to direct the different types of requests put get etc.. to the right controller action

828053

division	modulo
in python and ruby signed integer division truncates towards negative infinity and signed integer modulo has the same sign the second operand

828092
division	modulo
however in c and java signed integer division truncates towards 0 and signed integer modulo has the same sign as the first operand

828092
division	modulo
what is the simplest and most efficient way in c to perform the same kind of division and modulo as in python and ruby

828229

we created a edmx file which contains auto-generate entities

828330
google-chrome	firefox
this would work in ie firefox and google-chrome can somebody test the others please

828330
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome seem to support this property as well

828376
readonly	temporary
the create temporary table and the drop table work fine with the readonly flag - if i comment the insert line it runs fine- but whenever i want to insert or delete from that temporary table i get the error message

828398
postorder	inorder
but i think inorder postorder pre-order is difficult

828482
post	put
i m gonna piggy back on your post if you don t mind since mine seems to be less active and you already put your rep on the line

828558
textchanged	keyup
validating will fire when the user is finished typing and moves focus from the textbox so if you need to do on the fly checking you could handle the textchanged or on of the keypress keyup event handlers instead

828558
min	max
if its asp.net you could use a combination of regularexpressionvalidator to account for comma seperation 1 decimal point etc... and a rangevalidator to set the min max values for a float

828614
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
ado.net is a big topic - but the keywords to search for here are sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldatareader etc

if everything works use apc or memcached instead of files files usually work great but apc memc are faster

829312
memcached	apc
this technique works with memcached or apc too

829364
onreadystatechange	onload

829855
hash	salt
as a general rule all passwords should be hash and each password should have a unique salt

829856
hash	salt
the reason for a salt is so that a given generated attempt at a hash match is only useful for a single row of your users table in the db

829857
hash	salt
simply said use a cryptographically secure hash algorithm and some salt for the passwords that should be good enough for 99.99 of all use cases

829868
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
if malloc calloc realloc

829898
getter	setter
that s an example for dynamic getter and setter methods it allows you to execute behavior whenever an object property is accessed

829902
disk	ram
these upper limits would be defined by the amount of processing required too many and the game slows to a crawl or the amount of ram present too much and you could start frequently paging to disk which would seriously degrade performance

829903
hash	salt
a 128+ bit user-level salt random regenerated you make new salt when you make new password hash you don t persistently keep the same salt for a given user

829903
hash	salt
methodology that is somewhat different hash algorithm how many hashing iterations you use what order the salt are concatenated in something from both any standard implementation guides like these and from any other password storage implementation you ve written

xml xsd xslt xquery

830017
post	get
the controller behind it creates the object and adds it to the model on get and processes the changes on post submit

830017
put	get
i say magically because even though i put the parent object into the session on get i still never explicitly loaded the referenced object so it should be null or an empty proxy or whatever happens

830090
hash	salt
for this reason i suggest that attached to each password a version number that tells you what scheme you used salt length which hash how many times

830090
hash	salt
the stored info is cost salt hash where cost is how many times the hashing has been done

830097

i found this post and am wondering if the put get method used here would work for me

830188
width	height
apply height and width directly since you know the tables size

830193
put	get
you ll need to use the sharepoint lists web service for metadata and get put for uploads

830193
put	get
assuming there is no metadata required and the sharepoint library is being used like a file server you can do most of what you want with put get but you will probably need a call to getlistitems to find the urls to download

830202
uninstall	upgrade
is there any way to allow non-administrator users to install upgrade or uninstall an adobe air application on windows

830202
installation	upgrade
and even if the user elevates during installation administrative rights are still required for an upgrade using the automated air upgrade system since an upgrade is essentially behind the scenes an uninstallation of a .msi package followed by an installation of another .msi package

explode on spaces sort the array implode then do the levenshtein

830693
serializable	deserialization
i have to implement iserializable in a derived class to do some custom serializable deserialization but the parent class is marked as serializable

830776
getter	setter
getter and setter are vastly easier to debug especially if you institute safeguards that throw a runtime exception if the object isn t properly populated

830785
uiview	uiwindow
the uikit reference says uiview is a superclass of uiwindow but despite of this parentage a uiwindow actually manages uiview

830785
uiview	uiwindow
yet i couldn t see why they do the reverse let uiwindow be the parent of uiview

830798
superclass	subclassing
i m guessing this is due to the fact that the controller superclass does not know of the existence of the subclassing s methods

830807
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have tested this in windows xp with the following browsers firefox 3 safari ie6 ie7 and google-chrome

my current target platform is windows but i prefer to use stl and boost where possible to keep my code platform independent

830935
children	parent
i d like a query that given list mycontrols that contains all above controls with parent and children properties set as approriate can be parameterized with panela1 and return textboxa1 textboxa2 panela2 listboxa1 and listboxa2

830939
listview	gridview
i m tried something similar in wpf using a listview with a gridview and i cant seem to make it work

831031
children	parent
tablea is the parent table and tableb is the children s table it s something like a parent should have 1 or more children and each child can have only 1 parent

831039
children	parent
the parent don t depend on the children

831064
daemons	systemd
on the file systemd i have the entire repos dev tree checked on locally to dev and have created three eclipse workspaces one each in dev crontabs dev daemons and dev tools

831074
width	height
ie has in the past also had the issue that it took height and width to mean height-min and width-min thus still allowing boxes to resize eventhough they had specific limits set

831102
loops	if-statement
i could put the remaining code of loops in an if-statement

831208
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a simple page with a gridview that is bound in the aspx code to an objectdatasource

831210
pop-up	dialog
yes as long as the user grants your application privileges via the dialog that pop-up then java webstart will have access to the file-system and will have permission to use runtime.exec

831223
updatepanel	ascx
i have an updatepanel in an ascx page using .net 3.5

831300

831310
codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	cakephp	kohana
i would look at zend cakephp codeigniter or kohana

831384
inherited	properties
i didn t realize this but you can already just set all those properties on the hbox and the labels inside it inherited them

831396
superclass	subclassing
here s an analogy with oo programming 1 define a superclass 2 define foo and bar as subclassing of it

831407
mbunit	nunit
if you are using mbunit or nunit for running your tests then you can use the rowtest and row attribute to pass in different values to the test

831545
daemons	launchd
sql full-text filter daemons launchd mssqlserver

831586
width	height
also don t forget to close your src string which you re missing and that the src attribute may not be the last in the tag - for instance border width height etc

831592
put	get
my first thought is to put a try catch block around the kill call and log the exception you get if there is one

831620
many-to-many	one-to-many
a lot of blog applications use tags with a many-to-many relationship instead of categories with a one-to-many relationsip because it makes more sense to see an article as related to possibly many tags than to see an article as contained within a category

831623
dom4j	xom
i like xom more than dom4j for its simplicity and correctness

831653
spaces	linefeed

ubuntu	debian
while i can easily find the binaries for the latest version of subversion 1.6 i can t find the binaries for ubuntu or debian

831746
post	get
activerecord sometimes tries to insert a 0 value into the id and i get errors such as can t find post with id 0 etc.

831748
mousemove	keydown
couldn t you just assume it s loaded blurred and then change the status to focused as soon as you receive any type of event keydown mousemove

831751
onfocus	onblur
so you could have sounds on initially turn them off when onfocus is triggered and turn them back on when onblur is triggered

831826
width	margin
you can also add a left margin of at least 250px the width of the left_div to the right_div that way there will always be space for the left_div next to the right_div

831828
width	height
i have an ie6 absolute position div that i want to be full screen 100 width and height

831833
postgresql	mysql
s3 mysql postgresql sql server simpledb couchdb others

831857
decltype	auto
next c++ will get auto with different semantics than current auto and will be able to do that together with decltype to get the type of an expression

831861
puts	gets
however the blocking queue internally synchronizes so that when drainto is called puts and see note below gets will block

831861
puts	gets
note as of java 7 a separate lock is used for gets and puts

831910
postgresql	mysql
i think postgresql is a very viable alternative to mysql

831944
width	height
setup width 200 height 200 startx none starty none

831951
cout	ofstream
then just write to the ofstream like you d write to cout

831960
boost	stl
if you can use an external but very standard library boost s serialization may be of great help to you -- especially if you re looking to dump the contents of stl containers not obvious if this is what you want to do from your question

831968
post	get
is this paranoia well founded do i need to do this on actions attributed with the httpverb get and post or just get

831986
innodb	myisam
innodb does however it does not support foreign keys to myisam tables for obvious reasons

832017
vim	emacs
emacs or vim cross-platform

832022
interbase	firebird
firebird the open sourced and branched version of borland s interbase is pretty good it works happily on most all

i should be able to upload pictures and videos to my favourite social networking account and also post get updates from thems change status make comments and similar stuffs

832086
gif	png
if you re lucky it ll be encoded as jpg png or gif and you ll be able to pass the bytearray directly to source on the image and flash player will already know how to interpret it

832111
filtering	grouping
i haven t been able to find an attribute in either the feature.xml or element.xml files where the custom print action is defined that would allow me to filtering the visibility to a grouping

832115
cpu	processors
on sparc at least you have psrinfo to show you processors information which run on its own will show you the number of cpu s the machine sees

832133
memcpy	memcmp
i am particular interested in the functions memcpy and memcmp and how to get these functions as fast as possible

832147
width	height
stage.stagewidth and stage.stageheight will refer to the full width and height of the stage

832200
memcpy	memcmp
glibc 2.8 does not use sse for memcpy or memcmp at all in x86 or x86_64 - it uses some hand-written assembly which avoids anything not supported on all cpus of the family

832213
post	put
what would post put and delete mean in this context

832213
post	get
if i wish to use this resource do i use get or post to submit the numbers to be added

832226
memcpy	memcmp
if you compile with the highest optimization settings memcpy and memcmp might be replaced with intrinsics by the compiler and never call glibc at all

832229
richfaces	icefaces
seam + icefaces or richfaces if you need some of the robustness in exchange for the widgets is a different kind of approach but is also effective

832236
post	put
you would simply not allow post put or delete on that resource

832245
content-length	content-type
check the headers from the server especially content-type and content-length it s possible that your clients don t recognize the format of the binary file and hang while waiting for bytes that never come or maybe they close the underlying tcp connection which may cause iis to log the win32 status 64

832269
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller can be grouped by uinavigationcontroller or uitabcontroller both of which add navigation elements to navigate between different uiviewcontroller

832269
switching	screens
for example tab controller draws tabs at the bottom of the screens so you can switching between views

832269
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
have a look at uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller and maybe uitableview

832273
profiling	debugging
you can also view the script profiling with a gui and debugging interactively works with eclipse and notepad++

832290
folder	directory
adding files to a folder within the virtual directory should not lead to a re-compile unless the folder is bin or app_code

832318
versioning	upgrade
dude upgrade your jvm first to the latest versioning

832335
put	get
my interest is more philosophical how do people put software in action to practically get control over factors that otherwise would be uncontrollable in an automated way

832350
post	get
post get data might be the

832359
min	max
if you re constantly looking up the min max value of a set then use a heap data structure which provides o 1 lookup to get the min max value and o log n lookup on any other value

832362
joystick	keyboard	mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	hid	joystick	hid	keyboard
if you want to use a gamepad joystick or any hid other than the keyboard and mouse then iup won t directly help in any case

persistence s3 mysql postgresql sql server simpledb couchdb others

832391
trac	mantis
i have used both trac and mantis on real projects and can recommend both

832392
mantis	bugzilla
we started by rolling our own a bunch of years back in lotus notes... then we switched to bugzilla then to mantis and finally to jira

832450
lisp	scheme
ruby is an obvious possible target as is scheme or lisp

832463
pull	push
when push comes to shove or even pull then i use wireshark because sometimes you really really need to know what s going on

832469
getter	setter
it would require a little more engineering on your part to manually line everything up but through the use of getter and setter the behavior will be transparent outside the class

832474
bmp	ppm	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
latest check in message states that they are for native encoding decoding for bmp png ppm and tiff encoding only

832481
lisp	scheme
i grew up on lisp and scheme and love them both

832481
lisp	scheme
it s got the functional beauty of a lisp or scheme well not quite but almost and it gives you some ability to dive into oop topics as well as hook into the .net framework for ui stuff if you want to spice things up

832483
post	get
when i first started doing web development ten years ago the conventional wisdom was to always favor post over get for forms and to have the application on the server side require post for form submission for precisely this reason

832483
post	get
browsers send get requests all the time like in the aforementioned img tag example but they only send post requests in certain circumstances specifically forms with the method attribute set to post

832486
pop-up	dialog
i want to create a link where when i click on it it will download a file to a specific location the desktop on the user s computer basically the save link as... dialog will pop-up with the desktop as the default location

832495
post	get
vanilla ajax calls use get or post and it is completely up to you how to handle them

832495
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest uses the verbs get head post put delete

832495
post	get
you want to use post over get when you are worried about csrf not xss

832495
post	get
a good rule of thumb is always use post and only use get if you are absolutely sure you want to share that data with other sites or the data is not sensitive

832496
post	get
the point isn t to prefer get over post the point is to use get where the request doesn t affect the data on the server and post where data is modified

832496
post	get
for example a search form will often use get while a create x form will usually use post

832498
libjpeg	libpng
in the past i ve directly used libpng and libjpeg directly to do this

832499
post	get
use get requests for getting a resource and post for posting one to the server

832499
post	put
post or put are designed for that

832512
post	get
there are situations when you should use post rather than get but avoiding xss isn t one of them

832512
post	get	post	put	put	get
and in fact rest advocates would actually say that you shouldn t just use get but that you should use post put and delete for the corresponding crud operations

832512
post	put
use post or put or delete if feasible and appropriate for write requests

832564
ati	nvidia
nvidia and ati especially are good resources for documents on this topic

832579
ssl	https
also if i negate the https and just use http i receive a 403.4 forbidden stating i am trying to access a page which has been secured with ssl so i m pretty sure that side of it is working

832581
post	get
however post vs get does prevent web accelerators and scrapers eg google bot from modifying your site

832581
post	get
they only go to get links and thus if you don t want to have your site deleted a la daily wtf post on this make sure that delete this item isn t a get

832581
post	get	post	put	put	get
get does not post a form thus is limited to whatever you can put in a url which is not much

832586
aptana	radrails
i use aptana radrails for my ruby on rails ide

832606
post	get
the already-given answers really do answer your question - no prevention of xss is not a valid reason to prefer post over get

832606
post	get
it s just as easy to inject code into a post request as into a get

832614
affinity	processors
microsoft s sysinternal s psexec s -a flag can set processors affinity on windows xp

832627
actionscript	mxml
you can easily solve your problem by declaring your service in actionscript instead of mxml

832644
versioning	upgrade
basically the question is what is the upgrade strategy for biztalk server applications from one versioning of application to another not biztalk server itself - which also another question upgrading to 2009

832651
puts	gets
when its time for your process to perform a contentious activity it gets with wait the single message from the cookie queue when contentious work is complete it puts the cookie back on the queue

832654

832658
microsoft.build	msbuild
if you need to write code that creates modifies and runs msbuild files the microsoft.build

832682
ant	maven
it is amazing though that both ant and maven choose xml as their langauge to express build recipes with

832701
post	get	post	put	put	get
heck i ve a restful system that has various collection resources that allow get to fetch the collection and post to append a new resource to the collection and possibly other collections at the same time which then points to the newly created resource elsewhere whereas other resources support get put for updates and delete

832711
maven	pom.xml
i can take that same person and show them a maven pom.xml and they will not have any idea what is going on

832711
ant	maven
at the end of the day you cannot consider project startup with ant or maven a factor it s really the total cost of ownership

832776
inherited	properties
seems like you have covered most things here so the only thing i can think of is inherited properties sheets

832776
inherited	properties
if you do have some inherited properties sheets go have a look in the file and see if you have any vc98 lib paths set explicitly

832787
vim	emacs
most popular editors include eclipse vim and emacs

i should have probably used get but used post i guess because in the event that js isn t available the regular form works just as well

832854
integer	radix
right now i convert the string containing the decimal number to an integer ignoring the radix point for now load it into st 0 and divide by the correct power of ten to account for the radix point

832886
division	exponent
off the top of my head i m tempted by the notion of constructing the mantissa part counting the number of digits and setting the exponent directly instead of doing division

832924
allocator	stl
console guys care about every allocator and if you are doing a multiplatform title you get into the wonderful world of different platform s stl implementations behaving differently and having different bugs although this situation has certainly improved in recent years

832924
allocator	stl
game developers also like to manage their own heaps and allocator and this can be difficult to deal with with stl

832969
int	boolean
boolean resync_to_start j_decompress_ptr int

833015
google-chrome	firefox
why does this not work in firefox google-chrome

833020
hide	show
you can observe uikeyboardwillshownotification and uikeyboardwillhidenotification to determine when to show and hide this toolbar and where to place it on the screen

833088
accessor	properties
imo you should be using the properties accessor whenever possible

833103
accessor	properties	getter	setter
i always use the properties accessor because the i am safe in case i add logic in the getter or setter in the future knowing for sure that no code bypasses it

833136
accessor	properties
if you are worried about the performance overhead of calling properties accessor when they just go directly to the field don t

833136
accessor	properties
it s better to stick with properties accessor because a you can be very consistent in all of your code which makes it more maintainble and b you get the benefits pointed out by others here

833154
udp	tcp
i don t know about throttling tools for tcp much less udp

833212
swt	swing
does anyone know of a java library or application that allows for sql front end manipulation via java gui s swing or swt

833213
width	height
this is the width and height of the div in which the map has to be displayed

833231
postgresql	mysql
it can be configured to work as stand alone main memory database or as a transparent cache to mysql postgresql oracle databases

833241
jdom	xom
here is also 5-part artima interview with author about xom where they talk about what s wrong with xml apis the good the bad and the dom a design review of jdom lessons learned from jdom and finally design principles and xom

833271
openssh	jail
a google search on openssh jail led me to sshjail for openssh

833283
installation	upgrade
from this point on you need to figure out the methodology for the subsequent database installation upgrade and repairs

833332
jstl	taglib
there isn t one built into jsp or jstl but the request taglib from the jakarta project provides an isuserinrole tag

833350
verilog	vhdl
in the past i have had quite a lot of experience with formal verification although it was for hardware components vhdl verilog

833377
post	get
since this is a client-side api i did the following on the server side check for a custom session cookie holding the time offset value and if it s not available reload the page only during get and not post calls with some javascript logic added to generate the time offset and save it in the cookie

833414
setinterval	settimeout
if you re looking to scroll smoothly you could use basic javascript settimeout setinterval function to make it scroll in increments of 1px over a set length of time

833491
children	parent
the divs can have an infinite number of children and i want to be able to drag and drop all of the .maindiv s within their parent box so i have used this

833510
bindparam	bindvalue
i m wondering what the declaration of the data type in bindparam or bindvalue is used for.

833526
int	double	int	chars
the struct consists of 11 shorts 6 int 76 chars 7 floats 1 double totally adding to 158 bytes

833538
listview	gridview
i am using a listview instead of a gridview in 3.5

833542
ceil	floor
that returns a fraction which i m guessing you ll want to round in some way with ceil round or floor

833615
put	get
sun put quite a lot of effort in performance improvements in all aspects jvm as well as default libs and i see no reason why you would get it better

833641
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox this seems to be working fine - but safari opera google-chrome all had issue

833645
versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade a project of mine from one of the beta builds of mvc to the full versioning

833654
profiler	visualvm
use a profiler i like visualvm identify the bottleneck and fix it

833709
int	chars
this has probably been answered else where but how do you get the chars value of an int value

833738
int	chars
denote operator int as f operator ostream const chars as g

833745
int	chars
simply casting from int to chars only works if you want iso-8859-1 if you re reading bytes from a stream directly

833763
getter	setter
the packing problem i worked around by having getter and setter for the fields storing them in the array of byte of the class

833763
getter	setter
if setter getter are inlinable then not an option for me d6 it could be fairly cheap even

833774
folder	directory
easiest way perhaps not the best is to determine the root folder of the directory tree you are after then upon each file take the path relative to that folder and store it as another column path in the db table

833825
ubuntu	linux
check to see if you have multiple jvms present in linux you almost certainly do since ubuntu probably comes with a non-sun version and be 110 sure that you re using the expected version to compile

833838
vim	textmate
i m now switching to vim from textmate

833871
direct3d	directx
with direct3d 10 they ve split many of the functions that were in idirect3d9 relating to for example adapters into the directx graphics infrastructure dxgi

833910
vim	textmate
vim is very different from a number of other editors including textmate in this way

833927
dictionary	map
how do i write in yaml a dictionary map where one key has the empty string as its value

834032
kde	gnome
ubuntu depending on the variant comes with network managers for kde its the knetworkmanager and gnome is gnome-netstatus-applet

834069
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie8 do not have this problem so it s a ie6 7 bug i suspect

834069
background-color	transparency
i thought about using a background-color transparency on the thead th.sorted but ie6 7 just paints the body background it looks like it cuts a hole in the other layers between the body and the th

834104
glassfish	weblogic
according to oss fast infoset tools implementations are already available on several platforms including microsoft .net and .net cf sun glassfish bea weblogic

834113
disk	ram
one straightforward way to sidestep the problem is to put all the source code on a ram disk

834135
profiling	debugging
so first i generated debugging version of application retaining the debugging information then generated release version and used shark to profiling and then used file symbolicate option and selected the debugging version of application from debug-iphoneos

834153
submit	submission
defenses include things like requiring the client to request a one-use token before their can submit data by generating a hidden input when the form is served up to stop third parties using their own form with malicious data and submission users to your site with js

834181
vsto	add-in
you can do as above and create yourself an add-in using vsto

834228
width	height
render all the textboxes as children of a div with fixed height and width and set oveflow property to auto

834243
folder	directory
look for app_data folder inside your application root directory

834270
folder	directory
on a successful build i wish to copy the contents of the output directory to a different location under the same base folder

834270
folder	dir
i want to copy the output dir contents to the following folder

834284
folder	directory
if none of the targetdir or other macros point to the right place use the .. directory to go backwards up the folder hierarchy

834290
jdom	dom4j
however it is available anywhere and if you settle on it you don t run into the i like dom4j i like jdom i like stringbuffer arguments that come from third-party libraries

834359
mockups	balsamiq
i ve used balsamiq mockups and have been real happy with it

834377
getter	setter
you can do that in the control s init event to make sure you have child controls through the whole lifecycle or you can do it whenever you need a reference to one of the child controls - in the getter setter of a property of your control

834395
igraph	networkx
i saw networkx and igraph but didn t see a way to output to ascii

834405
width	height
width and height are not

834473
hide	show
could you show the window off screen do a print and then hide it again

834513
ubuntu	linux
server os a linux distribution ubuntu is probably the most popular

834513
ubuntu	linux
most of the remainder use linux again often ubuntu and a variety of text editors

834677
pop-up	dialog
we can t use a timeout to close the pop-up because there s typically a dialog asking the user how to handle the file before downloading it and there s no way of knowing how long it will take the user to handle this dialog

834677
post	get
i could not solve the problem without appending the form data to a url for a get instead of a post and i have to set the site as trusted in ie this is an enterprise app so that s a reasonable request to make of the users

834677
content-disposition	content-type
in the response to the form url the request headers include content-type application octetstream and content-disposition attachment

834680
drawrect	layoutsubviews
you may not want to call layoutsubviews all the time from drawrect due to the performance hit involved in completely recreating a complex view hierarchy but you could at least figure out specifically which of the subviews need to be resized redrawn based on the passed cgrect and modify just those

834855
google-chrome	firefox
note i m certainly interested in super-powerful edit-your-whole-workspace-at-once ide features but i m also interested in simple but elegant ui s like firefox s find bar or google-chrome s find tab

834865
public	protected
of course the easy solution to this is to always call the protected virtual functions rather than their public variants replace b with bimp in the above snippet

834932
post	get
and sending post get via http is what i thought of as the simpler albeit insecure way to do it

834936
wtl	atl
atl is not very feature-rich but there is a good extension called wtl

834938
children	parent
this is a recursive function which prints out the tags of parent elements and the tags + contents of elements that have no more children

834998
post	get
kind of confusing because i really need to catch the submit of a particular form to get the correct post values therefore the selector of the form must be unique

835022
actionscript	mxml
first the mxml files are compiled into the equivalent actionscript classes

835046
config	ini
you can easily import config data as an ini file using the functions parse_ini_file or parse_ini_string

835083
daemons	systemd
many applications do not depend on syslog 3 and it is usually possible to stop and restart the syslogd daemons without detrimental effects on the systemd s operation much unlike csrss.exe

835084
config	ini
since php is not a compiled language though i don t see much real benefit to using ini or xml config files in php

835101
hide	show
trace is easy to show hide and includes quite a lot of extra information but doesn t appear to have any kind of persistence backing it

835161
put	get
i put trace logs and the code does seem to get executed i even replaced self dosomething with a sleep 2 but the intermediate loading view is never displayed

835241
post	get
sounds like all you need is something like libcurl which is an http library and will let you do get post etc

835259
hide	show
i am trying to show and hide a few form fields depending on the value of one of my select fields

835353
hash-collision	key
when hash-collision occur the hashtable dictionary calls equals to find the key you re looking for

835362
firefox	safari
while it works great on firefox i couldn t get it working smoothly on ie or safari

835382
hide	show
then in jquery dependent on the select-menu s value you can show hide these fieldsets

835382
hide	show
alternatively you can prefix each fields name with a meaningful prefix and then hide show according to that attribute

835453
std	ostream
if no such library exists is it possible to wrap the icu up using the standard c++ classes so i can for example create a ustring which has identical usage to std string and std wstring and also implement versions of the streams optimally with them being fully compatible with the existing ones ie i could pass it to a function expecting an std ostream and it will perform conversion between its internal format and ascii or utf-8 on the fly

835479
postgresql	mysql
hosting providers will provide sqlserver mysql and postgresql but i can t even think of one that has oracle hosting

835542
rss	feed
should i cover rss feed or facebook twitter youtube integration into a web site

835542
rss	feed
you want to get clients as quickly as possible so which would you learn how to do first rss feed from other sites or grabbing data from 3rd party sites like facebook and twitter or integrating youtube videos

835626
sorting	filtering
this query will use the index on actif to avoid sorting and the index on profil_perso to find and filtering out the non-visible parrain s

835648
min	max
as a side note i believe that the answers do demonstrate that it could be a good interview question as long as the emphasis is not on the ability to remember trivia about the data type overflow and its implications that can be easily spotted during unit testing or the way of obtaining max and min limits can easily be looked up in the documentation but rather on the analysis of various ways of dealing with the problem

835658
redmine	trac
on top of version control which has been mentioned a few times already you should also look into a project management tool such as redmine or trac

835722
nant	cruisecontrol
for larger projects you will need something like nant or msbuild and cruisecontrol or teambuild

835727
for-loop	loops
to get the lowest value change the i for-loop to 0 to sizeof tbyteset - 1 and the if test in the j loops to if b shl j and 80 0

835729
put	get
the weird thing is that i ve been able to get the exact above code to display the texture in a program of its own yet when i put it into my main program it fails

835739
sharepoint	spsite
if you can offer any insight on other sharepoint objects spsite etc pertaining to my question or provide a link to further reading on this topic i would be very appreciative

835740
stateless	stateful
for instance in jboss seam the framework relies heavily on your knowledge of scope and stateless and stateful session beans where in symfony there is no such concept sort of

835755
extjs	mootools
when looking at extjs i don t get the feeling that it s meant for the same things as jquery and mootools

835755
extjs	mootools
whilst jquery and mootools help with the general workings of a site extjs seems to be focussed on tables and storing data plus manipulating it

835755
extjs	mootools
so is this observation correct or is extjs fit for the same work as jquery and mootools

835764
post	get
see this blog post for a discussion on how to get what to do about it

835769
ubuntu	linux
i just installed oracle on my amazon s virtual ec2 linux ubuntu server

835770
rss	feed
i vote for rss feed from other sites

835794
extjs	mootools
extjs is a full-fledged widget library while jquery not jquery ui and mootools are javascript frameworks that help with dom manipulation etc

835808
getter	setter
if you have some nice instance variables in your class such as an uiscrollview scrollview2 for example then why should you bypass the getter and setter by relinquishing a

835853
getter	setter
i used to bypass the getter setter too until i figured out that the bindings doesn t work when directly accessing the variable

835853
getter	setter
in other words key-value coding only works when accessing a property with the getter setter functions

835860
put	get
you put the neat stuff like a bubble dialogue box saying what it is and how to get directions to there

835878
keydown	keyup
the previewkeyup previewkeydown keyup and keydown events all fire on the textbox but alas no text shows up in the textbox

835898
int	chars
replace the first chars of that int s part of the string with a nul 0 - this terminates the combined string immediately after the course name

835918
getter	setter
if you bypass the getter or setter objects watching the value won t get the message

835960
ubuntu	linux
i need to get it working on linux rhel and ubuntu

835964
daemon	cron
the second sendmail instance runs a separate queue and its queue_mode is set to daemon or cron say every minute

836003
firefox	safari
it works in firefox safari but it does not work in ie for some reason

836006
children	parent
take an extreme case - say you have a dual core machine and you have a tree where each parent node has 4 children

836012
width	height
this is really fast because the jpeg de-compression can skip a lot of the data to fill a bitmap of only an eighth of width and height

836026
free	malloc
obviously memory that malloc allocates with mmap is free with munmap

836069
stdout	stderr
you can then watch for both stdout and stderr with channel.recv_ready and channel.recv_stderr_ready or use select.select

836095
inherited	properties
yeah it s because i m using a class for my properties profilecommon that inherited from profilebase

836137
google-chrome	firefox
in the meanwhile i still stick with firefox over google-chrome for the simple reason that firefox is i non-profit and has a ii huge addon community

836142
folder	directory
i would like to also create a folder in the layouts directory of the 12 hive and place a couple files in there

836169
pull	push
instead i need to keep one item at a time from each stream in memory and at each step compare the current item from each stream push the minimum onto the final stream and pull the next item from the appropriate source stream

836189
free	malloc
ms-dos heap managers often allowed using free memory until the next call to malloc

836189
free	malloc
new and delete in that era called malloc and free

836216
width	height	gif	png
the only solution i ve imagined so far is to make a png or gif image with 1px height and a very large width depends on your project could be like 1x2000px and do something like this

836251
getter	setter
a common jquery convention is to have .foo or .foo selector act as a getter and .foo value or .foo selector value act as a setter

836254
vb6	vba
i ve verified in vb6 that the code will in fact save some text to a file so if outlook actually runs the vba script it should be able to do the same

836278
super	implements
super simple to implements

836294
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
if you want an insight on performance with sharepoint objects you should read about spsite and spweb disposing

836366
packets	multicast
as far as i understand with multicast you d always know which interface the packets are received on since you always bind to a specific interface when joining a multicast group especially with ip4 where you bind to the interface via one of it s ip addresses

836410
children	parent
i would go with the idea of having a main table representing your parent and auxiliary tables representing the children

836445
post	get
then send the request to the function which you should be able to call by querying a php file with get or post request like that xmlhttp.open get myfunction.php true

836452
post	get
if you run into any problems down the road post your questions here and i m sure you ll get the answer you re looking for

836465
dictionary	map
another approach could be to have an application variable that contained a map or dictionary of locked items

836465
dictionary	map
so when one user hits edit add an entry to the appvariable map or dictionary with the key set to the primary id of the field being edited

836465
dictionary	map
the only real downside is 1 you would need to create one application level dictionary or map for each table that you want to lock unlock

836473
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	scheme
i m tired of seeing functional-programming advocates show how quicksort can be implemented in one line in haskell ocaml f# scheme etc

836485
unix	solaris
also a basic understanding of unix is not hard to achieve i have found my way around solaris ubuntu and os x coming from a windows background - a few simple tutorials should get you up and running

836485
g++	gcc
for writing small school projects there is not much you need to know cd ls mkdir make gcc be sure to use g++ for c++ projects - that has bitten me on my mac before...

836497
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu especially isn t really that hard to use but the lack of a real ide for development usually throws folks off

836535
builtin	isinstance
if you do want to make a special-case for an argument being a string use the isinstance builtin and compare to basestring which both str and unicode are derived from for example

836586
stdout	stderr
error messages should be written to stderr aka console.error and normal output to stdout aka console.out

836621
ienumerable	iqueryable
i understand that using iqueryable is not preferred for various reasons but does that eliminate ienumerable as well

836641
pthreads	fork
first install cygwin this provides unix like environment for windows with pthreads api that mingw doesn t provide for example fork

836678
ienumerable	iqueryable
first off iqueryable implements ienumerable so that is why you are potentially seeing both

836710
profiling	benchmarking
it s pretty much the same process as any other optimization profiling experiment benchmarking repeat

836743
profiling	benchmarking
benchmarking optimization software with performance profiling

836766
cvs	svn
i ve worked with vss cvs svn and tfs

836773
rsa	dsa
imagine some one breaking in to the database and stealing those private keys gifs or rsa dsa keys

836790
kerberos	ldap
they could for instance be authenticating against kerberos ldap nis or any other number of sources

836805
gson	xstream
i attempted to use the gson library but it cannot deserialize concrete objects when i only have it expect generic super classes xstream and jettison handles this because type information is baked into the serialization

836805
xstream	jackson
i looked at the jackson java json processor but when you were reading in objects from a stream you had to specify what type of object it was unlike xstream where it will read in any object because the serialized xstream json contains class name information

836835
multiplying	add
i have previously been using my own subclass of array i call it numericarray with added functions such as sum mean add multiplying etc

836847
postgresql	mysql
dblinq supports many other databases mysql postgresql firebird

836856
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

836856
addition	multiplication
so with all of that in mind you should be able to simplify the most inner loop using primarily addition and multiplication of integers

836860
int	chars
if you really need the chars index from the string you can deduce it by counting newlines int the string and adding the column

836875
versioning	upgrade
in versioning 1.35 boost foo was upgrade and new member was added so boost foo from 1.33 and 1.35 are

836955
jobs	cron
combine this with a cron that starts jobs as they are scheduled even if they are scheduled to run at the same time and that solves the problem you described as well

836958
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can do it by adding a .htaccess on the index or doing the configuration in the httpd.conf

836976
maven	m2e
you can execute the maven targets off the right-click run as or debug as menu and even manage custom goal execution using the maven build... shortcut -- this is all similar to m2e

836976
myeclipse	m2eclipse
if you decide you want to use m2eclipse complete you can navigate to window preferences myeclipse maven4myeclipse and check the enable all m2eclipse features checkbox

836980
addition	multiplication
for me it s the same as when you do not use parenthesis for when doing multiplication and addition in the same statement because the language documents that the multiplication operations will get carried out first

837009
folder	directory
we have a folder where our app will be potentially reading writing and creating deleting files on and while we can default to a safe location we allow the user to select a different directory

837013
disk	ram
my machine has 4gb of ram and fast disk

837061
folder	directory
i m not sure how to solve it but the reason is becaus iis is treating it as a directory which it is and doesn t have any knowledge about how to pass the folder to the asp.net isapi filter and trigger the .net handler

837067
disk	ram
i don t have the privileges to create a ram disk but perhaps something along those lines

837134
public	protected
a similar question could be asked for widening access parameters - eg overriding a protected internal method with a public method something which java supports iirc

837158
implements	extends
creating user-defined type that extends null paradigm with additional notavalue value might be an answer but i need some more guidance on how to implements it

837214
ubuntu	linux
i agree with others that if you install something like ubuntu linux it s not that hard to learn

837221
getter	setter
course as soon as you want to do something like validation in the setter this doesn t work and you have to go back to writing setter and getter and declaring a backing variable

837237
for-loop	loops
i have a basic question in the django template language how can you tell if you are at the last loops iteration for a for-loop

837277
sorting	filtering
you probably want to improve filtering or sorting capabilities of your application

837283
firefox	safari
a quick test on firefox 3 and safari 3.2 shows that an input field that is missing the name attribute but has an id attribute is not submitted

837285
x86	64bit
visual studio is x86 until at least the 2010 release comes around update this is still an issue in vs2010 there is no native 64bit cassini support

837285
x86	64bit
the first solution was to load oracle x86 in 32-bit more x64 in 64bit mode we did this by replacing the assembly reference when running under 64bit via the web.config like this

837308
implements	extends
the second one allows you to extends the number of preferred suppliers over time and you can still internally implements these as two seperate methods

837337
implements	extends
write it yourself extends implements

837460
try-catch	exception-handling
to prevent an exception-handling in a handler from propagating to the event generator the answer is to manually invoke each item in the multicast delegate the event handler inside of a try-catch

837466
hash	salt
just store a salt hash instead and use that

837466
hash	salt
for example your cookie could contain the username and a salt hash of database password hash + ip address range

837469
lisp	prolog
this may be an impossible task but i m trying to stay away from lisp or prolog and i m looking for examples that would be directly applicable to game development

837490
cgpoint	cgrect
why not just an id based on the tag and the coordinates cgpoint or cgrect

837532
ssl	https
as chochos has suggested what s wrong with simply using the existing ssl infrastructure in java and your server to set up a secure https connection and then simply pass the user password from client to the server

837602
textarea	textbox
discovered in the comments on the tredosoft site that installing ie8 breaks textbox textarea in the multiple ie browser

837646
pop-up	dialog
a very simple approach would be to add javascript to your page to pop-up a new browser window dialog something like this

837664
feedback	review
we would perform what we called code design review in-house which involved a group of individuals who independently looked at the product on their own and asked questions and or wrote comments against the product to provide the author with feedback from the team without the pomp and circumstance of a formal inspection

post	get
this post - custom query with castle activerecord had a good example about how to achieve this but i can t seem to get it to work

837748
ssl	https
do i just need an ssl certificate installed into our web server and simply access the wcf service via https and possibly be able to just use basichttpbinding

837761
versioning	upgrade
this has a great sections on side by side versioning and leveraging msis for upgrade

837762
firefox	safari
they work fine in ie8 firefox safari etc but not ie7 and ie6

837788
width	height
in my app if the user wants to resize the image a new form pops up and asks the user to input an new width and height for the image

837789
getter	setter
i d like the model to write and fetch the resource from the file system so i naturally want to override the getter and setter to do this

837855
win64	windows
one source of complexity is that the win32 and now win64 api is a subsystem that lays on top of the windows nt native system

837866
hash	md5
i m not saying ignore the issue and like i said this doesn t really have much bearing on whether or not you should use md5 sha1 or whatever to hash your passwords but i do get tickled slightly pink every time i read someone getting a bit too upset about plain text passwords in a database

837931
mouseover	mouseout
i tried unbinding on mouseout and rebinding on each mouseover

837931
hide	show
i eventually needed to add a tools row to each item and show hide on mouse over out

837976
subtract	add
no matter what every ace should be counted to sum value as 11 then when the total sum has reached over 21 subtract 10 from hand but the thing is you must make sure you keep a count of how many times you subtract 10 and how many times you add 11 an ace

837976
subtract	add
add 11 subtract 10 - must always be satisfied

838024
post	get
i get the same error described in this other so post

838032
hash	md5
hence i do recommend that you use a stronger hash function than md5 here

838032
hmac	md5
i also recommend that you use hmac instead of just md5 m+t+p because hmac has been designed for the situation that you describe and has accordingly been analyzed

838054
bazaar	git
source code management software such as bazaar git mercurial or subversion might be useful

838071
g++	gcc
you can have multiple versions of gcc on your box to select the one you want to use call it with full path instead of g++ use full path usr bin g++ on command line depends where your gcc lives

838095
width	height
is there a way to set a prototype value for column width purposes the way there is for row height purposes

838119
implements	extends
another key issue i want to consider is the flexibility ease to extends the platform either sharepoint or connections to implements customize the functions i mentioned above

838131
uiview	subviews
you can either add myview as a subviews of the current view using uiview addsubview if you are going to have a done button or something like that on myview to remove itself

838131
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
or if you want the user to be able to navigate back to the main view like in mail notes etc the most common way to do that would be to add a navigationcontroller to your window and using pushviewcontroller animated to present your views

838137
width	height
i was wondering if there was a way to determine the height width of a browser

838143
wan	lan
clients from a slow lan or wan link

838157
superclass	subclassing
in particular problems are likely to appear with instances of a subclassing or superclass

838167
serializable	deserialization
create a property that would implement serializable deserialization map that property to the desired column in hbm

838182
inherited	properties
i ve found in the past that you can use a style to set properties on a usercontrol from xaml without inherited

838187
ilist	icollection
hashtable.values is an icollection - but you need ilist to bind data

838192
getter	setter
a keyword like â œrestrictedâ where this field could only be accessed from its getter setter

838210
blackfish	interbase
we also primarily use interbase and blackfish sql as our databases but most ms-centric shops would prefer some flavor of ms sql

838210
trac	bugzilla
then you also need an issue tracking system like jira fogbugz bugzilla trac which can be used with subversion or something else

838211
int	chars
is it possible to check if a chars has been passed into a method that requires an int

838211
int	chars
are you able to find out that a chars was inputted and not an int

838211
int	chars
i know that the chars is converted into an int but i am trying to limit anything other than pure int getting through the function

838212
try-catch	exception-handling
in general a try-catch is used to catch exception-handling as illustrated in the following code

838225
int	chars
no it s impossible because java itself upgrades the chars to an int if it can

838225
int	chars
you could make an overload of your function that takes a chars parameter instead of an int which might throw an exception but that won t stop anyone from casting the chars to an int and calling the int version

838225
int	chars
there is absolutely no difference at all between the chars constant a cast to an int and the int 65 so it would be completely impossible to distinguish the cases

838225
int	chars
i would argue that explicit casting is not passing a chars it s the caller converting a chars to an int then passing the int

838235
int	chars
unless your int are confined to a range that is outside the range of a chars then you cannot do this since you cannot tell whether a value 64 is an int or a chars

838243
put	get
if you take the square root of both sides you get x 2 but now you must put in the plus or minus sign to make sure you aren t missing any possible solutions

838256
int	chars
the casting of chars to int will occur at compile-time so it won t be possible to determine whether a chars was passed in or an int was passed in

838256
int	chars
in order to illustrate let s examine the source code and the resulting bytecode of a program which has a somemethod int which is called by passing an chars and int

838256
int	chars
therefore at runtime it won t be possible to find out whether the method argument was either an int or chars as the casting is performed by the compiler

838258
vim	emacs
i am looking for an equivalent of the bufdo vim command in emacs

838298
yourkit	jprofiler
use one of the many good commercial profilers jprofiler yourkit ...

838330
accessor	properties
now when inside the implementation if you want to access the instance variable directly you could just use _label but to go through the properties accessor methods which take care of retain releases and a bunch of other book-keeping tasks you would use self.label

838340
int	chars
the fact that you use the type chars instead of the type int is because you want a number that is 16 bits instead of 32 bits

838341
unix	aix
suggestions for unix aix platform + gcc are also invited

838416
wan	lan
svn is faster because it was meant for wan as opposed to vss which is for lan

838424
hash	md5
collisions in the compression function do not imply that collisions in the hash function exist but we can t find collisions for md5 unless we can find collisions for its compression function

838489
int	chars
asking why the individual chars of a string are not mutable is therefore like asking why the individual bits of an int are not mutable

838492
webclient	httpwebrequest
.net certainly has proxy handling for things like webclient and httpwebrequest but you ll need to give more information about the situation

838500
webclient	webrequest
you can assign the proxy property of your webrequest or webclient object to a webproxy object that has the required settings applied

838616
equals	tostring
it could be done via reflection as some libraries already create the tostring or equals methods

838623
passenger	thin
app server mongrel thin passenger for dynamic requests

838648
int	boolean
the main difference with c c++ is that c c++ allows you to mix int and boolean whereas java doesn t

838648
int	boolean
but i think it s bad practice to use int as boolean anyway

838720
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer congruent to the

838768
trigram	fuzzy
one of my favorite methods for fuzzy string matching is trigram matching

838818
inherited	properties
this is because the ul li elements have inherited the zero-margin properties

838876
multicastdelegate	delegation
if you want to guarantee that each event handler gets called in the class that raises the event then you ll need to iterate over each delegation within the multicastdelegate and invoke it individually within a try-catch block

838922
postgresql	mysql
late answer but there is a new open source software for asynchronous master-master replication of postgresql also works for mysql

838925
getter	setter
if i want to read this xml into a java object i would be creating a java bean called personbean with getter setter for the attributes as

838950
children	parent
much like in a parent - children relationship

839077
range	minimum
well you can use random.nextint int specifying the range and then just add the minimum value

839113
getter	setter
the problem is that the property is public - because of the public getter - and it is writeable - because of the private setter

839116
int	chars	subtract	add
if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to chars when displaying the result

839118
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
suppose i have a ui-ready model for example implements inotifypropertychanged i use the presenter to bind this model to a view presenter knows an interface of the view keeping my code-behind as small as possible handling only bindings model and commands properties or methods or events for controls that don t have icommand and in this case immediately being delegated to the presenter

839158
post	get
so when i start the vb.net app it just simple calls the p.php get but post doesnt work

839165
nfa	dfa
lookahead - have speculative transitions use an nfa instead of a dfa

839180
public	protected
the following will return non-zero if there is at least one property with a protected or public setter

839180
public	protected
note the check for getsetmethod returning null no setter and the test for isprivate not public or protected rather than ispublic public only

839199
implements	extends
if it seems feasible at all you can implements what you need for your plugin and then hand the result over to the eclipse community to extends

839211
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a uitableview with a uisearchbar at the top of it

839219
mouse	keyboard
in mac os x you can look in system preferences keyboard mouse modifier keys

839310
alloca	malloc
new on stack instead of heap like alloca vs malloc

839349
ant	maven
i know that i can run ant form maven but if theres a maven plugin doing it i d prefer that one

839352
post	get
how would i get that to show the last post title as well

839387
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
if you re using a linux flavor you ve probably got a package management system thinks .rpm for fedora redhat or .deb for ubuntu debian

839387
ubuntu	debian
you could roll your own packages for company specific software create a repository perhaps only available on the local network and then your setup could be reduced to a single bash script which would add the company repo to etc apt sources.list debian ubuntu and then call a command like

839391
post	get
i m trying to get into unit tests for a biztalk application i m working on following the example in michael stephensons blog post and seemed to be getting somewhere

839407
int	chars
to a binary file the compiler will usually leave an unnamed unused hole between the chars and int fields to ensure that the int field is properly aligned

839495
union	distinct
note that union filters out duplicate rows like distinct

839544
addition	modulo
the answer is that for modulo addition of 1-bit values 0+0 1+1 0 and 0+1 1+0 1

839604
inherited	subclassing
the definition of subclassing is that it extends another class and inherited the state and behaviors from that class

839634
superclass	subclassing
in oop theory class cannot be its subclassing or superclass

839661
google-chrome	firefox
tested this in google-chrome 1.0 firefox 3.0.10 and ie7

839664
superclass	subclassing
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing

839665
int	chars
to configure your program using command line arguments declare your main function like int main int argc const chars const argv and use a loop to go over the arguments in the argv array

839668
put	get
and to get the start address it will work thought the whole virtual memory space to find a hole which could put the chuck of mem to be allocated

839738
jquery	scriptaculous
most commonly this can be accomplished using any popular javascript library such as jquery or prototype scriptaculous

839741
superclass	subclassing
one of the benefits of object oriented programming is that subclassing can be used in place of their superclass

839758
maven	m2e
why not import your existing project using file import and turn on all the m2e features and continue to develop it as you did before using maven commandline tools

839770
qpainter	qwidget
also it s unnecessary to call qpainter begin and qpainter end when you construct it using a qwidget parameter

839774
superclass	subclassing
in your example the size of the subclassing doesnâ t matter because you are allocating memory for the big fat subclassing on the heap then you store the pointer to it in a pointer to a superclass

839848
put	get
i have seen reports that show mysql to be faster for some simple scenarios put to single table get from single table

839848
disk	ram
my experience is that any perceptible slowness in a website is due to one of 1 insufficient hardware for the db simply not enough disk i o or enough ram or 2 complexity of database needs related to necessary contention for what you want to get done

839939
firefox	safari
i have checked this in firefox and safari only

839944
put	get
like you in the preview pane i get bogus values even though my xml file may contain actual data along with the schema but when i actually run the crystal report i get the expected out put

839967
spaces	delimiter
alternatively the below might be better if spaces is being used as a delimiter

840061
interpreted-language	compiled-language
there is no way in hell an interpreted-language can beat a compiled-language at runtime speed

840070
hide	show
i am using jquery to hide and show my forms but this should not be an issue

840085
pop-up	dialog
i have checked it does add the values to the orderstatus parameter but when the report runs the crystalreports dialog pop-up and asks me to enter values for the orderstatus parameter

840100
viewdidload	viewwillappear
do whatever you re doing in viewdidload in the viewwillappear method instead - your image property will be set when pushviewcontroller animated calls viewwillappear

840123
appdata	denied
my application vb.net sometimes throws an access denied exception when attempting to delete files in the appdata folder and i m not sure why

840138
put	get
i need to get a part of the text that is stored in that column and put it into a different column on the same row

840303
temporary	tablespace
note that ms sql unlike oracle cannot swap recursion stack into temporary tablespace so you may experience troubles when generating large datasets

840352
int	double
the issue was related to casting converting double to int

840370
client-side	server-side
to achive this you can use the jaxwsserverfactorybean server-side and jaxwsproxyfactorybean client-side classes provided with cxf see this page for sample code

840373
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce	perforce	cvs
git is used for version control of files much like tools such as mercurial bazaar subversion cvs perforce and visual sourcesafe

840383
g++	gcc
in gcc g++ compile with -s

840386
hash	md5
is there anyway to generate a hexadecimal md5 hash in objective-c for iphone

840433
atoi	atof
you could use atoi or atof and then check if the value returned by this function is not 0

840437
xna	slimdx
that has since been wrapped into microsoft xna which is probably not a good fit for you but the mdx wikipedia article recommends something called slimdx that might be okay

840440
move	drag
i m not using drag since the mc doesn t move with the mouse all the time but rather using onmousemove to update the mc location according to _xmouse _ymouse and some other calculations

840540
profiling	debugging
the development environment requires a mac but you can get the entire ide + tool chain + excellent debugging and profiling tools for free

840546
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox 3 google-chrome ie6

840568
vim	emacs
its windows style ui is probably quite quick to learn for most people compared to vim or emacs anyway

840571
rtp	rtsp
it currently supports a v capture and playback in a wide variety of data types as well as streaming via rtp and rtsp

840584
margin	height
if that element has vertical padding or margin itâ s added to the height of the block according to the css specification see the visual formatting model for absolutely positioned non-replaced elements

840596
xapian	whoosh
check out haystack search - a new model based search abstraction layer that currently supports xapian solr and whoosh

840638
button	checkbox
this is produced by an html page which i have created the one with checkbox and a create button

840638
post	get
i also know the mysql code to link with the database but not how to code to post information to the database from the web pages via php handling to the database or get information from the database

840697
post	get
in defence of rest it closely follows the principles of http and addressability read operations use get update operations use post etc

840706
rss	feed
sitemap based on rss feed submitted

840706
rss	feed
annotations sucessfully submitted based on the rss feed

840730
git-svn	svn2git
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

840758
post	get
approach 2 use custom fields for the separate content sections for a single post number of disadvantages here but it might be more straightforward to get something quickly.

840765
youtube	vimeo
our website lets people add videos by submitting a url - usually one from youtube or vimeo

840802
stdout	stderr
stderr and not on stdout as i would expect

840802
stdout	stderr
i would prefer to have the errors emitted on stdout rather than stderr

840803
hash	salt
i have some problems to understand why you include a salt since a salt is commonly use to avoid that an attacker precomputes hash of dictionaries

840803
hash	hmac
i m not sure why you want to hash the message before computing the hmac

840847
ssms	sqlcmd
while sqlcmd.exe is the best way ssms also has a sqlcmd mode where you can execute a sqlcmd script

840854
sharepoint	spsite
you need to identify what object in the sharepoint object model the directory is for example is probably a spsite with in the site you can have a directories that are spfolders splists spdocumentlibraries etc

840854
splist	spsite
you will need to identify what kind of object you are trying to add spfolder spsite splist spdocumentlibrary ect.

840888
interpreted-language	compiled-language
how does code written by one language particularly an interpreted-language get called by code written by a compiled-language

840985
atoi	atof	strtol	atoi	strtol	atof
instead of using functions like strtol atoi atof

840985
int	chars
you could define your own function which has parses chars by chars of the string and builds the output int

840989
int	boolean
so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

841024
nstextview	nsapplication
given an nsapp object aka nsapplication sharedapplication how can i get the currently active nstextview where the insertion point is blinking right now if there is one

841083
vim	emacs
it can be integrated with visual studio emacs vim and others and can format just the selected lines or with git svn to format some diff

841084
hide	show
one idea would be to apply the floating style via css then you could select on the class name and do a show hide as necessary

841096
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i have a qtreeview hooked up to a qabstractitemmodel which typically has thousands of nodes in it

841119
submit	submission
this one works partially - if no drop down is selected it will display the error message but that doesn t stop the form from submission it just displays the error text while the form submit

841135
wav	riff
seems like a combination of open ... rb struct module and some details about the wav riff file format probably better reference out there will do the job

841182
accessor	properties
i have to disagree with jaredpar on this the get accessor of the handle properties calls createhandle if the handle is not yet created you can check with reflector

841218
for-loop	loops
so the for-loop inside getcompanies won t loops over anything since total is still set to 0

841226
tolower	toupper
i ve read that it s unwise to use toupper and tolower to perform case-insensitive string comparisons but i see no alternative when it comes to linq-to-sql

841226
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the ignorecase and compareoptions arguments of string.compare are ignored by linq-to-sql if you re using a case-sensitive database you get a case-sensitive comparison even if you ask for a case-insensitive comparison

841226
tolower	toupper
is tolower or toupper the best option here

841261
ienumerable	iqueryable
to that extent ienumerable and iqueryable do the half right thing tm but they are clearly inferior in their concepts of iteration and much more to what you can do with stl retain control and so on and on but otoh they have better metadata and hence a better cleaner model

841319
google-chrome	firefox
i now support firefox and ie but google-chrome fell out because of it

841337
post	get
for the sake of testing i simplified the process by removing all post data and the success callback function but i still get different results

841342
tolower	toupper
as you say there are some important differences between toupper and tolower and only one is dependably accurate when you re trying to do case insensitive equality checks

841342
tolower	toupper
he says string.toupper â use toupper rather than tolower and specify invariantculture in order to pick up os casing rules

841352
erlang	lisp
if you think this approach would work well you could try xlloop - this allows you to easily write excel functions in java python ruby perl r lisp erlang

841364
nsbezierpath	appkit
unfortunately there s no way to just ask for each element like there is with appkit s nsbezierpath

841537
post	get
similar to a previous post you can get the same issue if you delete an entry

841542
implements	extends
third my threads should implements runnable instead of extends thread see so question below

841561
children	parent
you would do this with a combination of parent and children

841573
codeigniter	cakephp
the main ones i ve heard of are zend cakephp symfony codeigniter and one or two other ones i can t recall the names of right off the bat

841589
range	minimum
you can have large minimum or maximum values in your interval with range if their difference is small

841603
hide	show
or perhaps use collapsiblepanels from the ajaxtoolkit to hide and show the upload form

841642
xfce	kde	xfce	gnome	kde	gnome
ed also istr many desktop environments like gnome kde xfce and even cde supporting some sort of save session on logout thing

841740
udp	tcp
the raw data can be found at proc net tcp proc net udp etc

841762
width	margin
if you want to center an element you would give it a width and set the margin 0 auto like this

841817
typedef	struct	typedef	typename
you do not need typedef for struct or classes the typename will automatically be available in the namespace

841833
min	max
the bearing to the latitude min max appears to be a function of the latitude of circle-center and circle-radius sphere circumference 4

841840
post	get
but unfortunately if you follow the link to my question and then read his blog post a little carelessly you might get the impression that he is dismissing the empty delegate technique

841901
folder	directory
when i drag a folder onto the nstableview it calls adddirectorytolist - which recursively loops over all files contained in this directory calling addfiletolist on each

841985
client-side	server-side
so if you use javascript to disable the html element in the client-side onclick event the input element will be disabled when the browser assembles the post request the server won t be properly notified which element raised the postback and it won t fire server-side click event handlers

841996
ant	maven
iirc it supports the ant syntax as well as the foo maven syntax

841997
wtl	atl
the ddk samples are generally written to be free of dependencies on things like mfc atl wtl and the like

842054
children	parent
which i need to split on the minor-group element while retaining both its children and direct parent and put all that for each minor-group in an external file

842089
superclass	subclassing
creating a subclassing should mean more than just a convenient way to call superclass methods

842089
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
you should use inherited when subclassing is-a superclass both structurally and functionally when it can be used as superclass and you are going to use that

842139
stdout	stderr
it allows you to redirect stdout and stderr to files

842147
width	height
they re all the same width maybe 400px or so but different height

842147
width	height
they re all the same width but different height

842175
perl	tcl
another benefit to tk is the fact it works with tcl perl python and ruby and others so you aren t stuck with a particular language

842175
perl	tcl
for more on tk with tcl ruby and perl see

842192
hide	show
i need to programatically show hide a menuitem what would be the best way to do this

842198
qcodo	qcubed
qcubed a branch of qcodo is under active development and has been since nov 2008

842198
qcodo	qcubed
qcodo and qcubed are fantastic frameworks

842214
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
the problem with that is that if you did all that to avoid the nullpointerexception now you re going to simply replace it with unexpectedobject exception or classcastexception or what not

842238
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is a way of multiplexing a cpu between multiple threads - there is only one real cpu but it is visible to the operating system as two cpu s and thus two threads can be scheduled on it

842276
width	height
as the title says how should i go about animating the height or width of a window

842285
inherited	properties
can you override an item or inherited an item and alter add properties and methods

842322
hash	md5
the code i used for generating the necessary md5 hash is up on my github repository in the commoncrypto subfolder

842346
children	parent
just access the parent and then the children

842358
pow	sqrt
math.sqrt is probably just the c implementation of sqrt which is probably related to pow

842399
opera	firefox
however when i use ... datatype json ... the browser opera and firefox so far but i ll bet it s universal asks to save open the results of the request

842419
addition	multiplication
no if you have ever taken a parsing or compiler course you would understand that this is like saying addition and multiplication is overhyped for math problems

842422
quicksort	heapsort
copy the list to an array and use heapsort or quicksort then copy it back

842446
stdout	stderr
if you want them to instead echo to stderr you can pipe stderr to stdout with the construct

842476

842665
implements	extends
if i create a base class and it extends an interface there is an explicit contract defined for every method in the interface the base class must implements said method

842665
implements	extends
let s say i create a base class which extends vbox and implements the interface

842665
implements	extends
thus any class which extends the abstract class would then be required to implements the methods therein

842665
implements	extends
so i could create a base class which implements interface and extends the vbox and inherit from it and i could insert code in those methods which need to be extended

getter	setter
that is the purpose of your getter and setter

843331
rss	feed
you ll never be able to get a complete list of all rss feed on the internet

843331
rss	feed
your best bet would be to see if any of the big rss aggregators offer lists of feed they know about - but that is commercially important information so i doubt they ll be giving it away and certainly not for free

843332
mouseleave	mouseenter
with jquery events if you want the event to apply to new elements you would use the .live method however jquery 1.3 doesn t support blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change or submit events as live events and it s change that you will want to use

django	turbogears
if you want to get a quick glance at a nice web based orm framework i suggest django or turbogears

843650
django	turbogears
i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment

843691
rss	feed
the problem in the php code you ve presented appears to be in the part of it that constructs the youtube rss feed url

843691
rss	feed
once i had fixed up getting the rss feed url it quite happily fetched the feed pulled a youtube url out of it and got the video id

i m looking for data mining tools for a project and in line with that i have put up another post in so

843739
getter	setter
a property is a friendly way of implementing a getter setter for some value with additional useful features and syntax

843739
getter	setter
a property can be backed by an instance variable but you can also define the getter setter to do something a bit more dynamic you might define a lowercase property on a string which dynamically creates the result rather than returning the value of some member variable

843739
getter	setter
when you assign to or read from myobject.propertyname you are really calling setter getter methods on the object

843739
getter	setter
the synthesize line tells the compiler to generate these getter setter for you using the member variable with the same name of the property to store the value or othervarname if you use the syntax in comments

843739
getter	setter
along with synthesize you can still override one of the getter setter by defining your own

843739
getter	setter
the naming convention for these methods is setpropertyname for the setter and propertyname or getpropertyname not standard for the getter

843739
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it is good practice to use copy for nsstring because a caller could pass in an nsmutablestring and change it out from under you

843746
boost	stl
go for stl boost www.boost.org

843786
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

843826
hide	show
show and hide sql errors

843857
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
but once you start doing this it s probably best just to use an ordinary for-loop anyway unless you can t because the collection only implements ienumerable and not ilist icollection of course

843869
mouse	keyboard
a programmer who is typing into a code window can generally use a keyboard accelerator much faster than taking his hand over to the mouse to right click

843953
client-side	server-side
there it explains how to use json both server-side and client-side from within a web-app

843961
nginx	lighttpd
have a look at nginx lighttpd and varnish for some popular high performance http servers

843978
icefaces	woodstock
woodstock is dead and the icefaces guys are on the way to offer a migration path

843978
icefaces	tomahawk
for a more independent use have a look at tomahawk and icefaces

843978
icefaces	tomahawk
icefaces allows to integrate tomahawk components although the skinning is not really compatible

843990
hash	md5
if the number of images is not huge then a cryptographic hash like md5 should be sufficient

843995
hash	md5
md5 hash wouldn t work if the images were different formats png jpeg etc had different sizes or had different metadata

843996
int	chars
the idea is that the caller would provide a range of chars and the function would interpret the chars as an int value and return it leaving begin at one past the last-used chars

844000
content-disposition	content-type
maybe you need to set the content-type as text plain or remove a content-disposition header

844004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code works perfect in firefox google-chrome safari

844006

unfortunately all browsers i tested ie8 firefox 3.0.10 opera 9.64 switch based on my local language settings to

844006
textmate	jedit
the same happens if i manually generate the html file using utf-8 tested with textmate respective jedit although both editors display the content correctly

844075
uiview	uiwindow	uicontrol	uiresponder	uiwindow	uiresponder	uiapplication	uiwindow
if you have common event handling code why not declare a category on uiview or uiresponder which you will then be able to access from all of your uiview or uiresponder subclasses including uiapplication uiwindow and uicontrol

844087
mutt	thunderbird
then do the same with your favorite mail client recommended mutt because thunderbird is slow in strace

844139
librsvg	cairo
you can do this with using cairo librsvg python bindings

844159
rss	feed
i think the reason some databases use xml is because it s such a widely-used format especially for things like rss feed

844201
inherited	subclassing
one great feature of objective-c is that class methods are inherited by subclassing

844270
nunit	mstest
ideally i could use nunit or mstest which everone is familiar with

844270
nunit	mstest
what is the simplest way to feed msbuild information to mstest or nunit

844282
accessor	properties
as a note this example obviously assumes 10.5 using properties but you can do the same thing in 10.4 using accessor methods

844286
typedef	struct
typedef struct mytype1 mytype1handle

844314
uicontrol	uibutton	uicontrol	uiresponder
for instance in cocoa-touch the inheritance tree of uibutton is uicontrol uiview uiresponder nsobject

844314
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
also proper use of inherited requires that the implementer of the subclassing has a deep knowledge of the superclass

844314
superclass	subclassing
in addition implementation details of the superclass often leak through to the subclassing which is a big pain in the for framework builders

844339
inherited	properties
i tried to do this with inherited all sorts of ways but still need to be able to do new properties and have it set the value to null until a type gets selected when the appropriate kind of type gets selected

844348
for-loop	arrays
use a standard c for-loop and start and work backwards through the arrays

844419
versioning	upgrade
one for an upgrade from versioning .-1 etc

844423
folder	directory
is there any way to set the initial directory of a folder browser dialog to a non-special folder

844494
width	height
be sure to preload the views within one screen size distance from the current view because the user can potentially scroll one screen width or height distance in one gesture

844519
tapestry	wicket
beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them

844536
erlang	lisp
i ve recently been learning about functional programming specifically haskell but i ve gone through tutorials on lisp and erlang as well

844568
post	get
i am wondering how i can get the post data in a collection format

844568
post	get
but i am wondering when i click on submit data to post the form how i can get the collection of raw post data

844568
post	get
i want to get the post data instead of get

844569
haskell	sml
you will be gobs more productive especially if you pick a functional language that also has algebraic data types and pattern matching caml sml haskell

844623
inherited	subclassing
which leads me to my question - since moc and signals slots don t seem to know about inherited etc how can i subclassing a widget defined somewhere else and get access to the widget s signals

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
then inside touchesbegan touchesmoved etc it checks if it s interested in the event and either handles or passes it on to the inner components

844627
touchesmoved	touchesended
note that it is uiscrollview that receives all touchesbegin touchesmoved touchesended and touchescanceled events from cocoatouch because its hittest tells it to do so

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you won t be able to send touchesbegan to uiscrollview later because you cannot store the touches argument it contains objects that will be mutated before the next touchesmoved event and you cannot reproduce the old state

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
so you have to pass touchesbegan to uiscrollview immediately but you will hide any further touchesmoved events from it until you decide to scroll horizontally

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
no touchesmoved means no scrolling so this initial touchesbegan will do no harm

844627
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
given that you always forward touchesbegan you also have to forward touchescancelled and touchesended

844627
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
you have to turn touchesended into touchescancelled however because uiscrollview would interpret touchesbegan touchesended sequence as a touch-click and would forward it to the inner view

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if that does not work either or results in sloppy visuals you have to override touchesbegan touchesmoved etc and not forward diagonal movement events to uiscrollview

844640
jms	jta
really i m most interested in ws-security and jms support possibly jta

844640
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
would it be a wise decision to go with lightweight tomcat which i m experienced with or would i be better off with a server that implements the full java ee stack such as jboss weblogic or even glassfish

844641
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu does have this option so many linux distributions probably do

844645
public	protected
i believe that will work if the plot3d rotationchanged signal is public or protected

844678
superclass	subclassing
i ve seen this format used instead of writing a concrete superclass that subclassing extend

844703
public	protected
additionally are the signals public or protected and have you included the appropriate header files

844719
google-chrome	safari
if i could do that it would allow the code to possibly be ported over to other browsers safari and google-chrome in particular

844747
int	boolean
run custom validations on switch parameters and non-switch arguments including tests for regular expressions file masks int boolean enums etc

844753
int	chars
my node is a struct comprising of the variables freq int and word 128 chars

844760
put	get
i think that using that would have certainly cleared up the java.util.stack problem but it can also lead to very deep class hierarchies in order to put ensure that classes get only the methods they are supposed to have

844785
getter	setter
property is just saying there will be a getter and or setter method for that property name

844794
width	height
you need to identify the shape a user has clicked on and then change its width and height based on how far the user has dragged this could be determined by subtracting the original x y from the new x y coordinates

844797
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
just be sure that 1 the events you send to content view don t bubble back to uiscrollview through the responder chain make sure to handle them all 2 respect the usual flow of touch events touchesbegan than some number of touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended finished with touchesended or touchescancelled especially when dealing with uiscrollview

844831
jobs	cron
i am working on cron jobs for my php app and planning to use cron via wget curl

844831

some of my php cron jobs can take 2-3 hours

844831
jobs	cron
is it good practice to run such long time jobs via cron wget curl

844908
hash	md5
if the data itself is irrelevant you can create a md5 sha1 hash from these values besides the pageid of course

844911
folder	directory
each directory or folder is a namespace

844914
post	get
how do i get form data from html page using c++ as far as the basics of post and get

844919
multiplying	add
hence one can determine if an integer is divisible by 3 by counting the 1 bits at odd bit positions multiplying this number by 2 add the number of 1-bits at even bit posistions add them to the result and check if the result is divisible by 3

844953
single-quotes	double-quotes
the markup rules refer to a limited subset of csharp syntax rules declared in codegrammar.cs - those are a subset because spark only needs to recognize enough csharp to adjust single-quotes around strings to double-quotes match curley braces etc

845010
daemons	systemd
on a unix systemd such a script should really run as a daemons - have a look at the pear system_daemon package to see how that can be accomplished simply

845066
cpython	ironpython
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home

845162
int	chars
that says even though memp is a pointer to chars i want you treat it as a pointer to int and put this int where it points.

845165
int	chars
cast pointer to int not unsigned chars again

845169
ostringstream	std
alternatively you could use templates and std ostringstream or boost lexical_cast for a very flexible version

845260
dia	visio
edit2 for non-uml diagrams sounds like dia is a good open source alternative to visio

845269
listview	gridview
i have a listview wpf control with a gridview

845283
integer	unsigned
it s documented that integer.tohexstring returns a string representation of the integer as an unsigned value - while integer.parseint takes a signed int

845427
postgresql	mysql
regardless of whether you use sequences like in postgresql and oracle or if you use another mechanism like auto-increment of mysql

845470
for-loop	loops
since you defined d as always having 1 column then the for-loop is unnecessary since it will only loops once

845583
hide	show
i have the code below that hide and show the navigational bar

845663
tripledes	aes
tripledes is a very good option but you can also consider aescryptoserviceprovider aes which is a modern symmetric cipher

845713
int	chars
a chars is an int no need for conversion functions

845713
hex	binary
maybe you are looking for functions that display integers as a string - using hex binary or decimal representations

845716
put	get
if you want to get the ascii value of a character in your code just put the character in quotes

845719
hex	binary
there are manipulators for hex and decimal dec but unfortunately not for binary

845720
hex	binary
as far as hex binary - those are just representations of integers

845760
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
look closely at using icommand inotifypropertychanged the observablecollections

845760
listbox	icollectionview
by using icommand and icollectionview you could expose enough control where a designer could construct a listbox to show the animals and a menu to show the filter list

845797
jstl	taglib
yes it s well known that the uri for taglib changed between jstl versions 1.0 and 1.1

845798
int	chars
take the first chars look it on the chart compare the answer to the last chars of the int

845827
jxtable	jxtreetable
other than that swingx has a filter api which ll work on jxtable jxtreetable jxtree and jxlist

845833
firefox	safari
i would suggest getting it to work on firefox 3 and safari first then once it is working go back and add in the code to get it to work on ie8 and if you want ie7 since ms is pushing ie8 out as a critical update now

845841
put	get
you could either put your server process into the group so that the whole system with all its users fall under the limits or get the server to put each new session into a new group

845848
opera	firefox
of course it works in firefox and opera

845933
floating-point	integer
and for square specifically you might as well just multiply the numbers together yourself floating-point or integer

845955
jar	war
if what you are deploying are packaged components dll jar war ... it is wise to organize the code library as a collection of packaged set of files

845955
jar	war
that way you will develop directly with the -- dll jar war .

845979
int	double
with n being an int because it doesn t know which of float double or long double version it should take and you would get an ambiguity error

846036
vbscript	jscript
i ve been hunting for a modern replacement for jscript vbscript

846038
int	chars
for example the int 1245427 which is 0x1300f3 should result in a string of length 3 containing three chars whose byte values are 0x13 0x00 and 0xf3

846063
integer	unsigned
usually you d pack such an integer into a full 32 bits a c unsigned long and use but skip the step

846079
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
then again opera safari google-chrome all have limited or no support for event handlers on options too

846137
post	get
there are a few exceptions to that such as regularly updated blogs and forums where new threads and post get picked up very fast

846189
width	height
just try to do a full browser height fixed width horizontally centered header 2 columns content footer simple layout with css and with tables.

846189
width	height
tell me how many css stuff do you need to do to replicate a 100 width 100 height text in the middle of the screen layout simple as

846189
width	height
tell me a good reason why should i use a pure css approach to get say a 3 columns totally centered by the width fixed middle column full browser height without having css tweaks fixes hacks.

846195
post	put
it took us about 3 hours to put together a script to auto-generate the wrapper sorry don t have the script laying around handy or i d post it

848177
maven	pom.xml
realizing that maven is configurable and you can override the defaults in the super pom.xml i m attempting to determine if i should change the layout to support specific tools that are in house or attempt to make those tools recognize the maven layout

concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows

851496
min	max
select min effdate max termdate from tab1

851501
vb.net	vb6
i have some vb6 code that instantiates a class which handles events that are being raised from a vb.net component

851501
vb.net	vb6
it may or may not be relevant but the vb.net was converted from a vb6 using the visual studio code conversion tool and subsequently manually cleaned up

851525
serializable	deserialization
so i d say the problem comes from a class of yours that you changed between serializable and deserialization and that has no specific serialversionuid.

851525
serializable	deserialization
maybe you should look at this same problem description and it looks like wrong serializable deserialization code..

851676
public	protected
the first when declaring variables as protected or private they won t become part of your public api

851678
getter	setter
in java it is common to see getter and setter getcolor and setcolor in order to work with objects

851705
post	get
when i post the form i get to a result-page when i hit the back button

851744
subtract	add
yes the timestamp 0 means 10am 1 1 70 in australia midnight 1 1 70 in london and 5pm 31 12 69 in la but this doesn t mean you can simply add or subtract values and guarantee accuracy

851779
children	parent
group would have a to-many relationship children to child objects and child would have a to-one relationship parent to one group entity

851796
selecteditem	selectedindex
if you select dog from this list them the selecteditem property is the string dog while the selectedindex is 1 indexes are zero based so the first item is 0 second 1 etc.

851832
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works on all browsers ie6+ firefox safari windows but not google-chrome

851856
portrait	landscape
if the user changes her photo orientation from portrait to landscape then i want to truncate the text and then allow her to edit it so that it makes sense

851907
google-chrome	firefox
maybe i have firefox and google-chrome open at the same time

851928
vsto	add-in
i m writing a vsto add-in to add a button the standard toolbar for all new mailitems in outlook 2003

851934
i2c	spi
the usb chip acts as a communications bridge allowing the programs to communicate with the micros over spi i2c uart

851958
free	malloc
where do malloc and free store the allocated addresses and their sizes linux gcc

851958
free	malloc
so in order to still find the current one i want to check if a string i find in the memory is still used by comparing its address against the addresses malloc free know about

851972
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
see also the msdn pages for sorteddictionary and sortedlist which detail the time complexities required for various operations

851972
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
operation array arraylist linkedlist sorteddictionary sortedlist

851976
free	malloc
there are lots of ways in which malloc free can store the size of the memory area

852011
dateadd	datepart
i find it easier to pass a value as a temporal data type datetime then use temporal functionality specifically dateadd and datepart to find the start and end dates for the period in this case the month this finds the start date and end date pair for the current month just substitute current_timestamp for you parameter of of type datetime note the 1990-01-01 value is entirely arbitrary

852017
gif	png
however when i did the uploads i found that all of pdf png gif etc can be uploaded

852017
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 works because of application octet-stream whereas ie works because of application x-zip-compressed google-chrome doesn t work at all

852030
clang	llvm
if you want to compile to it you can use either gcc front end or clang which is c c++ compiler for llvm which is still work in progress

852049
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
so fast-foward 5-10 years in the future what will pypy have to offer over cpython jython and ironpython

852072
free	malloc
therefore i have provided a wrapper for the malloc free calls

852072
free	malloc
in these wrappers i need to increment a current memory count when malloc is called and decrement it when free is called

852088
calendar	gcal
they have a public access google calendar with various events on it and i want to grab the next 5 events from now onwards and display the event title when that instance of the event starts its location and a link to the gcal item

852111
free	malloc
either you can have access to internal tables used by malloc free see this question where do malloc free store allocated sizes and addresses

852132
free	malloc
you could allocate a few extra bytes in your wrapper and put either an id if you want to be able to couple malloc and free or just the size there

852208
allocator	stl
you can write your own custom allocator for stl containers

852208
allocator	stl
so compelling examples of custom c++ stl allocator

852225
children	parent
now i just want to list all those persons sorted on age and have the children grouped with their parent

852233
ienumerable	idictionary
i don t want to use ienumerable for some reason which would be the only non-generic interface implemented by idictionary

852258
width	height
it would appear that something happens with ie that causes the developer tools window to be shrunk to the height of the header bar and width of about 2 inches

852260
rss	feed
i have started debugging my rss feed because it has some strange characters in it the missing-character glyph

852260
rss	feed
the reason i believe our rss feed is having problems is because users are copy pasteing ms word documents into a textarea on the site and our php pages are using the iso-8859-1 charset which is incompatible with the special windows-1252 encodings for things like bullet points and smart quotes used by ms word

852267
accessor	properties
to work around this i ve mapped the database value to an internal properties and i ve added a partial class that implements properties accessor that convert the integer value from the database to timespan and back

852300
hash	md5
at the very least you could take and compare the md5 hash of the combined file contents file name and metadata such as creationtime lastaccesstime and lastwritetime

852304
getter	setter
you can mark the field as obsolete so that the compiler will generate a warning if you try to access it and then suppress that warning for the property getter setter

852310
profiling	debugging
for debugging profiling graphics try nvidia perfhud

852316
client-side	server-side
the best hybrid solution is generally to centralize your validation server-side and rely on client-side calls to the server-side stuff

852346
width	height
by using the above code textarea won t be visible but there will be blank space in your document having the height and width of the textarea

852432
post	get	post	put	put	get
it seems obvious and easy to map crud operations on a resource orientated restful service using http to operations such as put get post delete but how should operations that query for multiple resources be mapped - using a new operation called query or still use get that returns a collection of resources

852448
onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission
for that particular scenario you might want to experiment with different event properties as browsers act differently the onlick is for the button the onsubmit is a form event so naturally if you return false for the onclick that does not mean the on submit is not going to take effect you should handle the onsubmit separately or delegate submission to the submit button by return false onsubmit and let the onclick handler have form.submit also try it with multiple submit buttons to understand how it works

852500
postgresql	mysql
so storing 1 000 000 000 rows in postgresql will require several gib more storage than mysql depending on which storage enginge you use in mysql

852500
postgresql	mysql
but postgresql is also great at handling huge data compared to mysql

852500
postgresql	mysql
but as i always says if you re not really really sure you need a specific mysql feature you should go for postgresql

852500
postgresql	mysql
i m limiting this post to only mysql and postgresql since this question is tagged with only those two databases

852506
firefox	safari
i also got it to work with a vlc plugin in firefox and safari

852581
django	turbogears
most people seem to favour django as a web framework but there are alternatives such as turbogears

852614
afp	smb
we are using osx servers and clients with afp apple filing protocol and want to connect the only windows vista x64 client to the server shares without having to enable smb

852630
afp	smb
i d go with smb for the simple reason that i d trust apple or whoever to correctly implement smb before i d trust microsoft or whoever to properly implement afp

852651
ws-addressing	soap
the difference between the two bindings is that basic is soap 1.1 whereas ws is soap 1.2 and ws-addressing specifications in addition wshttpbinding offers more security options

852698
realloc	calloc	realloc	strdup	strdup	calloc
your program may also need to intercept realloc calloc getcwd as it may allocate memory when buffer is null in some implementations and maybe strdup or a similar function if it is supported by your compiler

852801
gridview	entitydatasource
how can i insert new record in entitydatasource from gridview

852810
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
take a look at autoresetevent and manualresetevent

852931
uilabel	uitextview
i would suggest taking a slightly different approach and seeing if you can use a uilabel instead of the smaller uitextview

852931
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel can be setup to be multi-line like a uitextview through their numberoflines property

852947
pull	push
the difference in using git clone is that it automatically sets up the origin repository so that you can easily use git pull and git push to synchronize the two repositories

852962
punctuation	words
words characters explicitly exclude white space and punctuation of any kind

853038
google-chrome	firefox
similar to ctrl + shift + t in firefox and google-chrome

853042
filtering	grouping
if the source implements ienumerable only you will not be able to sort or grouping the collection you can only filtering it

853042
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

853042
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
in addition ilist allows sorting grouping and filtering

853042
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
it supports sorting and grouping but not traditional filtering

853057
put	get
the gpl for example instructs you to put a short notice in every source file include the entire license somewhere in your source distribution and make your source distribution available to anyone who get a copy of the binary distribution

853077
versioning	upgrade
xcode will then presumably ask to upgrade the project which usually involves creating a new .xcodeproj versioning

853125
disk	ram
i don t think you can get ram hard disk size or clock speed â flash runs in a virtual machine and it s probably set up to only give you information that pertains to its little world

853133
rss	feed
i am trying to parse an rss feed using linq to xml like so

853150
collabnet	svn
i think now with merge tracking in svn the process would be quite a bit simpler assuming you follow the best practices outlined by collabnet

853153
awt	swing	swt	swing
the original code runs under swing but you can make it work under swt too using the awt swt bridge example code

853179
post	get	post	put	put	get
the only verbs allowed if you are using http are get put post delete head options

853221
coldfusion	railo
if you are designing an app that is compatible with coldfusion railo and openbd it appears safer to use remote_user

853318
rss	feed
there is a much simpler way to parse a rss feed the syndicationfeed class

853324
ssl	https
if it used ssl you would access it as https domain 4848

853377
ant	maven
for changes to serverside code that doesn t change the interfaces make sure you have an ant or maven task to rebuild and redeploy your classes without doing a gwt rebuild

853433
rss	feed
i used message digests md5 in my case to uniquely identify various items downloaded from rss feed so i didn t end up with the same item appearing many times in the list as i polled over and over

853437
post	get
but look at this post to get why regex and emails address are problematic

853450
post	get
the issue is that if i post the information i get no response and instead an error that i m denied access - however if i try to include the wikitext as get it parses with no issue

853471
ord	chr
i m new to python but there could be a way to simplify what you are doing by using the ord and chr functions to change characters to ascii values and vice versa

853475
decoder	encoder
i wonder if there is any trick allowed me to build encoder decoder in very few lines of code

853492
serializable	deserialization
you could use the .toarray property on the list and then serializable the array - that could then be dumped to disk or network and reconstituted with a deserialization on the other end

853498
mouse	keyboard
gestures low level mouse and keyboard input to control the gui

853530
int	chars
given a string of length one return an int representing the unicode code point of the chars when the argument is a unicode object or the value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string

853530
int	chars
return a string of one chars whose ascii code is the int i

853541
width	height
you can use the thumb control inside the usercontrol like you are doing and just adjust the height width of the usercontrol based on the delta of the thumb

853541
width	height
you should probably size the height width on that thumb as well

853572
filtering	grouping
attribute will pass so if i want to only allow user limited access to parts of the site i ll need to do add them to an ad grouping and use that to apply the filtering

853624
jboss	weblogic
my question is regarding developer productivity in an environment where one runs on an jvm on linux using the standard application servers was weblogic jboss tomcat etc.

853633
mktime	strtotime
you might want to use mktime instead of strtotime though

853638
accessor	properties
even though i can t change manager to be a different or new instance of person private set accessor i can change it s properties which have public set accessor

853638
accessor	properties
so is assigning a value to a properties through a set accessor via its container s get accessor a bad thing

853659
inherited	properties
the hack er...um...workaround i finally ended up going with was to create a new datacontract that inherited memorystream and decorated it with a basestream properties for holding the data i want streamed along with appropriate properties used for simple authentication

853684
button	checkbox
since the t c s will have form components radio button checkbox

853729
firefox	safari
to the button works for me in firefox internet explorer 6 internet explorer 7 and safari

853745
junit	jmock
using junit jmock is it possible to write an assertion mock expection that tests that the correct inherited method is called

853754
hide	show
update i phrased the question badly - i m looking for a general solution not just show hide and therefore toggle

853763
bash	zsh
in zsh not bash you can

853770
firefox	safari
i could only duplicate this problem in firefox and safari so far

853773
hide	show
true show all elements false hide

853781
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	idictionary	idictionary	icollection
it implements all the interfaces you might expect it to idictionary icollection ienumerable etc. and as a bonus the entire class and its members are fully commented with xml

853819
firefox	safari
i had this very issue in firefox safari before when i had a tag to submit the form without a value assigned to that button - ie 8 was fine with this but other browsers definitely weren t

853827
cobertura	emma
coverage tools like cobertura or emma will tell you whether you properly covered your code

853924
opera	safari
however due to newer phones having web browsers like safari opera and windows ie it would be advantageous to build a web application so a user wouldn t have to download some software onto their phone

853932
comparator	comparable
comparator could only be used if the set knew that it contained comparable objects sorted sets for instance might possibly do this

853944
portrait	landscape
but when it plays it flips to landscape layout and i would like it to remain in portrait layout

853967
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is not a shared storage filesystems

853984
ssl	https
set up an https server which has authentication email him the address and username from separate email accounts going to separate email acccounts call him and give him the password and have him log into your https server and download the documents over ssl

854063
for-loop	loops
another way to do this is to pass the number of items in as the first parameter to the function and then use a for-loop to loops over the variable args

854071
getter	setter
my address class is storing plain old strings with totally dumb getter and setter

854174
hash	md5
when you have an update you sign it on your site by getting the md5 or sha-1 or whatever hash you want to use

854180
comparator	comparable
same happens if not using a comparator but implementing comparable

854180
treemap	treeset
the treeset is based on a treemap which uses the compareto in getentry

854180
equals	compareto
...the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method.

854275
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that accesses data from a sqldatasource in dataset mode

854275
gridview	sqldatasource
top doesn t seem to do the same thing and i don t know how to get the paging information from the gridview into the sqldatasource either

854275
gridview	sqldatasource
or is there a better way to get effective paging from a sqldatasource in a gridview

854301
nssearchfield	nstableview
i want to have an nssearchfield that can search through an nsarraycontroller bound to an nstableview

versioning	upgrade
1 upgrade the server versioning

854417
openssl	m2crypto
sometimes the openssl documentation m2crypto wraps openssl can help

854418
fpdf	fpdi
in a class that extends fpdf fpdi appropriately use something like the following to generate a pdf from a template pdf you ve already created

854439
firefox	safari
browser zooming works fine in browsers like firefox and safari because they zoom all the content and recorrect pixel-values

854459
postgresql	mysql
you get a shell accout and postgresql or mysql and django are available as one-click installs

854499
width	height
simply is it possible to somehow capture the dimensions specifically width and height of an image using either the iphone sdk or an iphone sdk-compatible library framework

854504
restrict	shared
you ll also have to restrict access to the shared so users cannot circumvent the program

854536
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i have a rails application deployed that works fine in safari firefox and opera

854541
width	height
an array of size width height

854541
width	height
an array of size height containing pointers to arrays of size width

854550
expression-blend	silverlight
if you re using expression design all you need to do is copy and paste it to expression-blend make sure that your clipboard is set to silverlight xaml and it will automatically convert the bitmapeffect to a seperate image

854564
gridview	repeater
such as eval and bind most often found in data controls like gridview repeater etc

854585
folder	directory
i have a asp.net web application that creates a folder on a ftp site but i need to grant permissions to that folder to some users of the active directory

854594
width	height
whereas in case of #2 it has the freedom to allocate smaller chunks of contiguous memory of size width could as well be height off of areas that are free

854605
uiview	subviews
assuming you re adding the uiimageview as a subviews of the uinavigationbar view you can use the uiview method initwithframe to choose a specific cgrect to draw the image view within

854622
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the scriptmanager would output scripts only for controls which are being updated children of updatepanel that is

854631
int	double
i think you have an approximation problem dealing with int divisions try to keep it in double till you get the index

854672
width	height
in answer to your second question the common + - square controls are implemented in interface builder with square equal width and height set nsbutton s with the gradient style

854683
button	checkbox
is there a widget in django 1.0.2 to render a models.booleanfield as two radio button instead of a checkbox

854686
folder	directory
it startles me when by jsp forward ing the home page it can t access the css as it thought it was still in the actions directory whereas i know it is in the main folder and thus could access a file within the resources folder via . resources

854700
ubuntu	linux
it looks like many popular linux distros already have distcc packages ubuntu though i m not sure how they differ from apple s code

854732
post	get
somewhat tangential but if your generator is a list comprehension you can use numpy.where to more effectively get your result i discovered this in my own code after seeing this post

854768
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
typically you would use a uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller here

854768
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i d probably go ahead and subclass uiviewcontroller to handle this with methods modeled after uitabbarcontroller

854824
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
so it doesn t have to implement any specific interface like inotifypropertychanged of inotifycollectionchanged to make it usable in mvvm

854903
filtering	grouping
the problem we want to bind a hierarchicaldatatemplateâ s itemssource property to a collectionviewsource to perform grouping and filtering

854912
hash	md5
in short since md5 is a 128bit hash you need 2 64 items before the probably of a collision rises to 50

854920
versioning	upgrade
we had to upgrade versioning of that to work with the new ide framework and when we moved from vs2008 from vs2005 some our ssis package projects didn t open correctly because we are still on sql server 2005 so definitely check any dependencies you have on your 2003 ide with any 3rd party apps you may be running

854961
hash	salt
the hashing function also pseudo randomly sprinkles the salt amongst the hash string

854961
hash	salt
the hash checking function reverses the salt sprinkling and then the actual hash check takes place

854961
hash	salt
now i m aware that unique salt for each password hash good but also that having the logic to hash the passwords and create the salt stored in a db function might bad

854983
folder	directory
app is a module directory so the default and ecommerce folder create modules within zf

854986
hash	salt
edited answer because i misread the article initially and thought he was just mixing the salt together with an unsalted hash

854986
hash	md5
if the site is one with public registration the attacker could repeatedly register accounts with known passwords then use the known md5 hash for those passwords to reverse-engineer the password scrambling algorithm

854986
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
if you want to store your passwords really securely get away from md5 and even sha1 and move towards a salt slower hash function

854996
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

855006
implements	extends
bear in mind that i implements functionmapper not extends stdcallmapper

855007
hash	salt
this seems for me to just add obfuscation not any more security to the as chad birch pointed out misunderstood salt hash method

855014
hash	salt
basing the salt on the password eliminates the variability that defeats rainbow tables and trying to hide it in the hash password field is just pointless

855017
post	get
it s a bit involved to post but shows how to get maven to copy the native libs to a directory which you then point your java.library.path at

855051
pop-up	dialog
when a button is clicked to view one of the records in the gridview a pop-up window in the form of a modal dialog opens allowing the user to edit the fields

855063
cassini	iis
maybe the cassini server from microsoft or a variant of cassini from ultidev which is implemented by the same technology as used when you debug asp.net or a web service from within visual studio without iis

855067
implements	extends
frameworks aside to implements a cross-browser compatible site i recommend that you initially target a standards compliant browser like firefox and then only after it is working extends support to less standards-compliant browsers like ie6

855121
int	double
for example in the ini file i might have some double int or string type values preceded by the tag name of the value

855121
int	double
if my solution is acceptable then can anybody tell me how i can declare a set of so that it can accept any type int double string without me actually knowing which type the enum is going to be using for the value

855125
ilist	icollection
the only difference between the il generated for doone and modified dotwo is that the callvirt instructions for add get_item and get_count use ilist and icollection rather than list itself

855128
jar	manifest.mf
the problem is being caused by a jar file whose manifest.mf file contains a value for the extension-list attribute that tomcat doesn t like

855128
jdom	xerces
tomcat expects this attribute s value to be a space-separated list of extension names see the manifestresource source but it appears one of your jars has the comma-separated list dom4j-core jdom xml-apis xerces junit instead

855138
printf	getchar
each app was a simple printf followed by a getchar

855148
hash	salt
salt before you hash

855148
hash	salt
you can even store your salt right next to your hash passwords and feel pretty darn confident

855181
put	get
i thought this would work but no matter what number i put in for the stack frame the closest i can get is init

855201
accessor	properties

codeigniter	cakephp
see if you like it if not try codeigniter zend or cakephp or django or merb or..

855289
post	get
was it because they requested some different resource a get did they submit data to your server i.e was it part of a post does the user know that pagea is different to pageb are they conceptually the same resource but different views of it or something else

855302
hash	salt
i wanted to try out the article from msdn itself how to use forms authentication with sql server 2000 to hash my password but i found out that the function they used to create salt string is returning 3 more length than it is supposed to return

855320
profiling	debugging	profiling	instrumentation
logger debugging s c com c++ easily with rich symbolic info hooks profiling flexible instrumentation

855371
width	height
this is similar to how a browser cannot continue with page layout unless img tags have width and height information -- if the included javascript generates content then the browser can t continue with layout until it knows what is there and how big everything is

855397
int	double
for instance dates are actually int that represent a julian date double are actually int and you have to divide them by 10 number of decimal places on the data dictionary of that specific item and so on

855418
uiview	subviews
what you might want to do is override the touchesbegan withevent method of the uiview or subclass that contains your uiimageview subviews

put	get
if you put an index on userid username you ll have a covering index - so you won t ever need to go to the table to get the username anyway

855491
put	get
if you put your clustered index on userid you ll get a clustered index seek - which will end up at the row data anyway

855562
stdout	stderr
additionally it s a good idea to close stdin stdout and stderr but i m not sure how to do that in php

855563

try git pull first then git push

855621
hide	show
1 use javascript to show and hide parts of the form

855627
folder	directory
make sure your folder permissions are set so that a directory listing is allowed then just point your anchor to that folder using chmod 701 that might be risky though

855628
stdout	stderr
but he doesn t change his working directory to nor does it look like he closed open file descriptors i m not sure how this would work in php so that he s not connected to the stdin stdout and stderr of the original process

855635
udp	tcp
beyond that if the normal tcp socket mechanisms don t fit your application then generally you need to fall back to using udp and building your own protocol features on the basic send receive properties of udp

you ll want to provide the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods and they ll get called if the user taps the image

855685
komodo	radrails	komodo	aptana	aptana	radrails
komodo edit is one of the best ides i ve ever used and it has rails support although maybe not as good as aptana radrails

855702
postgresql	mysql
i m confident creating schema and optimizing queries in ansi-sql for sybase ms sql server mysql or postgresql

855761
vb.net	vb6
after reading the first two answers i realize it is more accurately a microsoft.visualbasic.collection which appears to be a class introduced for compatibility between vb6 and vb.net

855780
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc realloc free

855789
spaces	delimiter
given that any two people are as likely to disagree as agree on the amount of white spaces and indenting that makes the code readable i d suggest that whitespace is a poor choice of a contextual delimiter

855801
subtract	add
and then overload all operators so that you can only add subtract types with the same parameters and the you sum the parameters when doing a product

855815
pdfsharp	itextsharp	pdfsharp	itext
pdfsharp is good so is itextsharp the java port of itext one of the first pdf libraries around

855823
vb.net	vb6
while i haven t seen a head-to-head comparison of the vb6 collection vs vb.net dictionary i would expect them to be similar since the underlying algorithm is essentially a hashtable either way

put	get
trying to get parameters from a put request using httpservlet#doput

855856
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
look at tutorials regarding uiviewcontroller or viewcontrollers in general they will have discussion about uitabbarcontroller

855885
vb.net	vb6
if you are using vb.net you are not using vb6 collections

855885
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net collection is functionally equivalent to the vb6 collection but they are not the same

855885
vb.net	vb6
has a comparison of the various .net collection types with the vb6 collection including the vb.net collection

855898
free	malloc
you re unconditionally calling free without checking if the malloc succeeded so if the malloc failed and p is a null pointer then you re calling free null

855911
free	malloc
if you re doing stuff in between the malloc and free you could be overrunning a different array by accident and corrupting your own stack

855944
keydown	keyup
although you marked this as the correct answer note that you should use the keyup event rather than the change event or the keydown

855951
free	malloc
if you are running on x86 you could just run your binary under valgrind and it would gather all this information for you using the standard implementation of malloc and free

855961
integer	unsigned
this is the actual line which sets the ctypes value to an actual c unsigned integer

855978
hash	salt
it doesn t matter when you digest the salt prefix postfix infix all produce different hash but achieve the same purpose of defeating rainbow tables or other pre-hashed dictionary attacks

855981
submit	submission
if you know that there is problem that is specific to a particular version of firefox and you want to prevent it you either check for the issue when someone submit the field before you save it you remove it from the data after its saved but before you load it or you check for that version of firefox and prevent users with it from making a submission on your site which i wouldn t recommend

856037
apache	nginx
if you re planning on running it for production or non-development mode another option is to do away with apache and go with something lightweight like nginx

856050
disk	ram
in my bootloader asm code i want to load my kernel and kernel entry into the ram from cd-rom not from hard disk or floppy disk and lets assume that we know where the kernel located exactly on the cd-rom sector number

856099
button	checkbox
while rendering the view page based on some condition in the controller action i want to disable all the controls textbox checkbox button etc present in the form in a mvc view page

856150
mvp	presenter
some people though are not quite as happy with the implementation because it has a 1 to 1 relationship between presenter and views and strictly speaking this isn t how mvp is meant to be

856150
mvp	presenter
is the need to have mutliple views to a presenter the primary goal of mvp

856153
public	protected
i personally test protected parts too because they are public to inherited types.

856170
mvp	presenter
the idea behind mvp is decoupling presenter from views so that you can switch the view more easily if you need to for example supporting both web application and a desktop application but that doesn t mean you have to make it dynamic

856209
ssl	https
what is difference between https protocol and ssl certificate that we use in web browser

856234
ssl	https
https is http hypertext transfer protocol plus ssl secure socket layer

856249
firefox	safari
if you are developing for firefox safari you can always check with firebug developer console as they show the loading sequence of files

856260
division	addition
you re much more likely to get an improvement by exiting from the loop early so either store new r in a variable and compare with old r or store x r in a variable and compare that against r before doing the addition and division

856268
post	get
requestmapping has an obvious filter for whether somebody used a get or a post but i don t see any inherent support for all of the useful logic simpleformcontroller provided

856270
.nettiers	codesmith
for for a scenario such as .nettiers i d stick with codesmith for the time being

856278
folder	directory
since the wrapper dll only works with the native dll when they are in the same folder the native dll should be copied to the output directory of project a

856309
vbscript	jscript
is there a way to do this from say vbscript or jscript

856311
jquery	nyromodal
using jquery at the start of the page i set all of these hyperlinks to become nyromodal modal hyperlinks

i d avoid gate counts with fpgas here s some 4-input look-up-table estimates most of my experience is with xilinx but it ll be similar for altera and others

856896
google-chrome	firefox
using this code solved my problem and it worked in every browser internet explorer 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome

856959
memcached	ncache
further googling turns up a number of solutions ncache sharedcache velocity memcached

856971
converter	multibinding
you can use multibinding and define a converter that will join the two or more collections into one

856997
converter	multibinding
maybe you can use multibinding with a converter that will create an object for you.

857031
int	chars
am i right in thinking that it s checking for deleted chars in both words the int j i representing the length of words because a lower value will represent deleted chars

857034
addition	multiplication
this will allow you for example to do vector addition and matrix multiplication and for large arrays it is much faster than python lists

857070
integer	unsigned
the program requires an input of an arbitrary large unsigned integer which is expressed as one string in base 10

857070
integer	unsigned
the real challenging part is the arbitrary large unsigned integer

857073
multiplication	exponent
for a table lookup you can extract the mantissa in 0.5 1 and exponent from the input using a function like frexp then normalize the mantissa in 64 256 using multiplication by a suitable power of 2

857075
min	max
i m trying to get the jquery slider to have set values to slide to as opposed to every number between the min max amounts

857110

c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 temporary asp.net files root 24f69041 8efa8a35 app_web_p7uswgud.2.vb 43 error bc30154 class views_home_list_aspx must implement readonly property isreusable as boolean for interface system.web.ihttphandler

857281
google-chrome	firefox
browsers firefox ie google-chrome all show the same errors cleared cache too

857365
put	get
to get the full image path i figured out that i needed a multibinding to put the two together and have sucessfully created one

857383
spaces	delimiter
in that case just use the spaces character as the delimiter

857439
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
with other browser firefox opera google-chrome etc. we can use

857463
for-loop	arrays
it needs one less local variable uses a while and not a for-loop and uses arrays assignment instead of the function call push

857496
mouse	joystick
while they are more often used to handle touchscreen event they also map to mouse joystick clicks on emulators

857530
int	chars
is there any reason why i should choose int statusid over chars 4 statuscode

857530
int	chars
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

857530
int	chars
i guess the question is will there be cases where chars 4 is problematic and since the database is pretty small i m not too concerned about slight performance hit like using tinyint versus int but more afraid of code maintenance problems

857540
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven project using the swing application framework and would like to inject project information from the pom.xml into my application s global resources to avoid duplication

857541
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
pro if you have many branches you ll be pushed to adopt a modern dvcs my experience is with mercurial but i hear git or bazaar are also good rather than stay with a traditional centralized system like say svn

857563
hide	show
this method is nice to show and hide toolbars which got already activated via the addon manager but does not work for deactivated addons

857596
ant	maven
pass the necessary maven properties to ant and create an ant build script which modifies an application properties file or the spring context configuration directly

857603
cvs	svn
where i work we ve decided to move the files in svn after the import from cvs

857603
cvs	svn
cvs has limited history capabilities with moving while the svn repository can be rolled back to see what it looked like at any time

857603
cvs	svn
what we ve done is move the module from cvs into svn as is

857608
freemarker	velocity
if you just want a cross-platform replacement for m4 you can invoke velocity freemarker or another template library from ant

857614
int	chars
my reasons for choosing an int over a chars include

857650
serializable	deserialization
one issue is that even if it doesn t break during serializable deserialization you could be throwing away data - meaning that you can t successfully round-trip data back to the caller

857661
width	height
imagemagick is able to resize images to a specific height or width while maintaining the original aspect ratio of your picture

857674
switching	screens
earlier when we were using the ie6 browser then the text area was displaying properly on screens but after switching over ie7 browser we have seen that after filling up 20 lines a active scroll bar start displaying with text area and only 19 lines are displaying in text area and 1 line is hiding in scroll bar and to check that 1 line we have to use the scroll bar

857710
button	checkbox
generally button like this either do an action or indicate a status checkbox options etc

857758
post	put
edit you might want to put this in a wrapper see isaac s post as it s currently a private api

857806
button	checkbox
i am using two button select all and deselect all for selecting all checkbox and deselecting all checkbox

857820
put	get
i m a bit surprised that i even have to put a timer in my viewmodel since it seems like that is a function of inotifypropertychanged it seems redundant but it was the only way i could get the xaml ui to constantly once per second reflect the state of my model

857822
int	double
returns a valid int double value to postop

857822
int	double
because you are making a mathematical calculation try parsing the values into double int before you subtract them

857827
button	checkbox
i assume your select all and deselect all button are using javascript to set or unset all the other checkbox in the form

857866
isnull	nullif
besides readability is there any significant benifit to using a case when statement vs isnull nullif when guarding against a divide by 0 error in sql

857867
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

857870
versioning	upgrade
the working copy has been subjected to too many svn versioning upgrade or whatever cleanup can t repair

857900
isnull	nullif
in my opinion using isnull nullif is faster than using case when

857900
isnull	nullif
i rather the isnull nullif

857975
google-chrome	firefox
tested and working on firefox 3 google-chrome 1 and ie 6 7 and 8

858024
awt	swing
the parent logger of that logger the root logger will not get any log messages from your application but will receive messages from other parts of the jdk such as swing or awt

858028
min	max
you can also add the min and max values

858055
filesystems	ntfs
on a journaling filesystems like ntfs there is actually no way to securely erase a single file without wiping all the free space on the drive

858058
hide	show
just create divs on top of each other and show hide them using show and hide

858077
unification	inference
for info the reason i m asking is because i know that type inference also involves this unification algorithm and i d like to understand it

858090
post	get
ultimately the browser must make a http post get request of its own accord

858097
width	height
i think you only care about the height so i left the width 0

858128
width	height
we had a script to preprocess the build files which substituted the width and height into a file name splash_240x320.bmp or whatever

858128
portrait	landscape
to support screen rotation on n92 z8 etc we still needed portrait and landscape versions of some images since flipping aspect ratio doesn t give as good results as resizing to the same or similar ratio...

858162
opera	firefox
this works admittedly only tested on firefox 3.x.x and opera 9.x both on ubuntu 8.04

858162
opera	firefox
link to working example tested under firefox 3 and opera 9.x

858174
coalesce	isnull
or you need to use isnull coalesce is not null or is null in your where if one of the values you are testing can be null

858182
sorting	filtering
look at glazedlists for filtering sorting etc

858233
stateless	stateful
when i change the stateful bean to a stateless bean everything works fine except of course that the state is not preserved

858253
datamapper	activerecord
and if you are not obsessed with activerecord you can also use datamapper s imap adapter

858268
mvvm	delegatecommand
so that leaves in the wpf mvvm toolkit 0.1 project form the wpf team themselves you have a delegatecommand which also looks like an interesting way

858278
submit	submission
the aim is to avoid accidental submission just because if a developer does accidentally submit a large file trying to then get it back out the repository is an afternoon where no-one can do any work and has to fix up all local branches they have

858343
lxml	beautifulsoup
in particular you will want to look at the python answers beautifulsoup htmlparser and lxml

858391
hash	md5
the theory is that md5 creates a different hash for each input

858427
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	debian	freebsd	centos	freebsd	solaris	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	debian	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	centos	openbsd	solaris	debian	centos	centos	solaris	ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	centos	solaris	netbsd	redhat	fedora

858430
realloc	malloc
this often comes up if one of the threads is inside malloc realloc and your current statement tries to allocate some memory

858437
int	chars
this is how you can use it i ve replaced chars with int to store some values in for example but works the same with chars

858451
jsf	seam
i ve got an jsp tag that i would like to use in my jsf seam application

858455
width	height
having multiple storyboards 1 each for each menuitem with multiple keyframe animations x y height width in one .xaml is not sitting well with me

858473
post	get
ispostback is the usual way to determine get or post

858481
pop-up	dialog
if it s newer you could pop-up a friendly dialog box asking the user to upgrade

858481
vb.net	vb6
i would suggest upgrading from vb6 to vb.net for the following reasons

858500
hide	show
on a button click i want to hide one and show the other

858514
put	get
the expression tree you get represents the expression that you put in the lambda

858525
pbkdf2	salt
you can specify the password salt iv and plaintext as well as the number of rfc 2898 iterations to use in the pbkdf2

858546
hide	show
alternatively you could wrap the table in a div and show hide the div with your usual method

858549
client-side	server-side
you need to access the clientid property of the .net control server-side to get it s real client-side id

858581
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
or using oracle s oracle data provider for .net odp.net instead of the microsoft oracle driver system.data.oracleclient

858583
rss	feed
rss atom feed are not html so you cant use html entities in them

858592
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc
this has the disadvantage that for example strdup will still use the old malloc and a free may crash the program

858593
subtraction	addition
to solve this problem one could use xor instead of addition and subtraction

858597
folder	directory
yes i have created the logs directory under my application folder

858610
subtract	add
if you absolutely must remove leading zeros from the output you can subtract 10 11 do the math mod 10 12 - 10 11 and then add 10 11 back again

858661
bash	zsh
this works in bash and also zsh

858681
comparator	icomparer
it irritated me that linq gives me an orderby that takes a class implementing icomparer as an argument but does not support passing in a simple anonymous comparator function

858681
comparator	icomparer
this class creates an icomparer from your comparator function.

858708
stdout	stderr
this will work even when prints to stderr which would confuse oli s answer and keeps stdout stderr which farzy s answer doesn t

858768
postgresql	mysql
but if the software needed to work with many different databases - oracle postgresql mysql sql server and db or if the test db at work was down for refreshes a lot i d probably write the pure unit test that existed totally in isolation

858768
getter	setter
i find using terms like unit extensively then getting a definition-weenie about it leads to people doing things like mocking out the filesystem or mocking getter and setter - activity that i find unhelpful

858771
width	height
thus green div should have height equivalent to red div and width as 90 of the width of red div

858778
folder	directory
cannot remove folder text-base the directory is not empty.

858857
addition	multiplication
but if you don t need to do any addition or multiplication then you could keep 64-bit value as 4-character strings as javascript uses utf-16

858864
wordpress	joomla
if you re using a third-party cms wordpress joomla etc and you re not a programmer you re going to have to get someone to watch for the offending text and strip it out

858888
range	max
however one important thing to know is that in the case where the right range is empty it will be positioned at max first2 last1

858908
put	get
when writing services i ve often put a line like this in the beginning to get the current directory to behave like a normal application

858939
folder	directory
anyone know of a command line utility or one that can run as a command line that will collect all the .jpg files in a directory tree to a single folder only copying files that change

858967
graphics2d	bufferedimage
to rasterize it create a bufferedimage that is 4.17x 300 72 the size of your on-screen panel and scale its graphics object be the same abount and then paint the panel onto the buffered image s graphics2d object

858978
ienumerable	iqueryable
why is it that the foreach clause doesn t work or isn t available for use on iqueryable ienumerable result sets.

858978
ienumerable	iqueryable
is it something to do with the deferred execution s of ienumerable iqueryable collections

858979
openbsd	linux
if you have sophisticated networking on your workstation like openbsd s firewall or linux s traffic control then you should configure traffic shaping based on destination network

858993
folder	directory
you need to download the zlib binaries and place the items in the include folder into your c++ include directory

859165
vbscript	jscript
edit the page language is jscript too not the normal vbscript

859178
opera	safari
in addition if you ever want your greasemonkey script to work in non-gm environments such as opera s gm-esque user scripts or greasekit on safari it ll help not to use gm-unique constructs such as require

859188
bazaar	git
i am going to look at mercurial and bazaar as well as git though

859226
vb.net	vb6
this is probably why for example microsoft s style guidelines recommended that vb6 programmers put a type prefix with variable names but that vb.net programmers do not

859230
unsigned	short
this way you need to remember just 3 unsigned short integers in memory

859259
doc	rtf
are there any tools available to produce a nice document pdf doc html or rtf say from the database schemas meta data

859266
put	get
so now my question is how can i get this to work without having to put the dll in the gac or having to copy the dll into the web deployment project folder

859274
pop-up	dialog
fyi the reason i am trying to do this is because i am writing an eclipse plug-in and i would like to pop-up dialog that are not modal to the ide but that are modal blocking to my ui logic

859303
width	height
the bonus is that although i specified the height width above this technique will work for dynamic re-sizing not relying on fixed-width sizes of images or it s as fluid as your design can allow it to be

859323
swt	swing
but again i don t see how this could help you since eclipse uses swt instead of swing

859424
cifs	smb
the problem in the ruby script might be that there is no dns name resolution on your network this is often hidden if you usually share stuff between computers with smb cifs because that has it s own name discovery protocol

859449
arraylist	treeset
but i also know that the right choice between treeset hashset or linkedlist arraylist is crucial for performance and always using vector and arrays can t be right

859459
bonjour	avahi
if you run bonjour on your windows systems and avahi on your linux systems you can do away with the need to determine each system s ip address

859497
google-chrome	firefox
your code actually works in google-chrome but won t work in firefox and off the top of my head i m going to say it won t work in internet explorer either which is generally not friendly about modifying native objects and functions

859518
post	put
paste put or post

859588
versioning	upgrade
bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse

859589
post	get
today i implemented a session token authentication system for my web api http get post rpc style following this plan

859642
post	get
my question is is there a way to make mysql return the results from the bottom of a table or do i have to first get the number of post and then limit it to the very last 10 ones

859643
dateadd	datepart
finally this code is t-sql so you ll probably need to convert the datepart and dateadd to whatever the equivalent is in sqlite

859645
recvfrom	datagram
just send the datagram containing its name then use recvfrom - or equivalents - to catch it at the other pcs

859688
ready	each
if you have two teams building two components each may need to mock the other s component so that they have something the mock against which to test their own component before their component is deemed ready for subsequent integration testing and before the other team has delivered their component against which your component can be tested

859747
affinity	processors
now that i know one core is slower than the others i can get accurate benchmark results by setting the processors affinity to the same core for all runs

859747
addition	multiplication
floating point multiplication and addition

859747
affinity	processors
when i explicitly set the processors affinity then my application does not slow down on core #2

859747
affinity	processors
however if it chooses to run on core #2 without an explicitly set processors affinity then the application runs about 10 slower

859747
affinity	processors
that explains why my simple test cases did not show the same slowdown as they all explicitly set the processors affinity

859747
affinity	processors
so it looks like there is some process that likes to live on core #2 but it gets out of the way if the processors affinity is set

859747
affinity	processors
bottom line if you need to have an accurate benchmark of a single-threaded program on a multicore machine then make sure to set the processors affinity

859762
int	boolean
assume active is a boolean field tiny int with 0 or 1

859780
width	height
i m developing a swing app which suits the mvc pattern and i m wondering about the best place to store settings such as width height xml files location.

859784
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
you may have applications that have opted to be attached to the same processors cpu affinity

859815
content-disposition	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-length	content-type
i m already setting the content-type header to application pdf and i ve tried setting content-disposition and content-length

859841
wtl	atl
there is also a macro to convert from ascii - unicode ca2t and you can use these in atl wtl apps as long as you have vs2003 or greater

859850
google-chrome	firefox
you could use firefox s fireshot extension and then use microsoft s paint and alt-prtscr to add the surrounding google-chrome

859880
netcdf	proj
in a proj we are using the ucar netcdf implementation in c# using ikvm

859893
opera	safari
i know i could do this easily through the url string and a redirect but i would like to achieve this in the background if possible -- no redirects -- and needs to work on major browsers ie6+ ff1.5+ safari opera

859912
entity-relationship	diagram
be prepared to use uml entity-relationship diagram process models mockups or tap dancing if that s what it takes

860013
mouse	keyboard
specifically i would like to perform a screen grab in ubuntu and eventually track mouse clicks and keyboard presses although that s a slightly different question

860019
preg-match	ereg
have tried many different ways ereg preg-match and strpos

860055
post	get
i have looked at this post as well and get how to do it but my limitations with css are haunting me

860069
width	height
width and height sounds like properties that are only relevant to the view part of your project and should thus be stored within it

860069
getter	setter
when developing in java which i quite rarely do... i tend to set up a class named settings in which i store whatever i need as private fields with getter and or setter where it s needed

860106
webclient	httpwebrequest
the inbuilt code webclient wcf httpwebrequest etc all make use of the winhttp configuration to obtain proxy configuration

860112
junit	jmockit
so i loaded up jmockit 0.9.7 and junit 4.6

860145
content-disposition	content-type
setting the content-disposition and content-type headers should do it but you might also need to call response.clearheaders to clear other headers that have been set

860192
implements	extends
you ll most likely extends abstractlistmodel to get the listener registration and implements getelementat int and getsize

860200
equals	gethashcode
i have seen several solutions that provide base class with id and id-based gethashcode equals

860200
equals	gethashcode
i do not see a equals gethashcode benefits either since the identity map implementation should guarantee that reference equality is the id equality anyway

860203
pop-up	dialog
in aptitude the menus are correctly outlined in line drawing characters but not the are you sure you wish to exit pop-up dialog

860210
skip-lists	tree
binary tree skip-lists vs

860226
equals	gethashcode
as far as equals and gethashcode go these are for ordering in lists where you create a custom ordering

860278
children	parent
the validate method of the parent checks if at least one of its immediate children is signaled invalid or improper

860296
button	checkbox
if you change the state of a checkbox you always have to hit the submit button to postback you simply can t do a postback on checkbox state change without javascript

860312
width	height
for example say you have a mix in name coloranddimension which adds a color property and width and height

860339
public	protected
what is the difference between public private and protected inheritance in c++

860351
public	protected
protected - base class s public members will be protected

860353
public	protected
there are three accessors that i m aware of public protected and private

860353
public	protected
the same happens with public private and protected inheritance

860363
public	protected
it s essentially the access protection of the public and protected members of the base class in the derived class

860363
public	protected
with public inheritance the derived class can see public and protected members of the base

860389
mouse	keyboard
it controls the keyboard mouse pointer grabs a set of gtk.gdk.screen objects

860395
public	protected
when inheriting you can in some languages change the protection type of a data member in certain direction from protected to public

860396
serializable	deserialization
for storing the actual search i ve often serializable the nspredicate instance for the query into either a data property handling the serializable deserialization myself or into a transformable using the default nsunarchivefromdata transfer property

860405
hash	md5
since i don t feel like writing my own hash function and md5 is available my current approach is to use the first 32 bits first 8 hex digits from an md5 hash

860405
hash	md5
in other words are the first 32 bits of an md5 hash just as random as any other substring

860406
apache	nginx
if you are not tied to apache for something else i would also try nginx with phusion passenger

860406
apache	nginx
if you re concerned about memory usage you should see a smaller footprint from nginx than apache and the lastest version of passenger will download compile and install nginx for you with minimal headaches

860424
hash	md5
of an md5 hash just as random as any

860425
hash	md5
you should therefore be safe to use just the first 32 bits of an md5 hash

860509
strlen	substr
all answers so far seem to do loads of unnecessary work strlen calculations string allocations substr etc

860552
boost	allocator
as to your question about a generalized callback you can use a boost function but that essentially uses virtual functions under the covers it may not - but at least a similar concept so the performance difference you are looking for won t be there in fact boost function will probably be slower because of heap allocator

860623
daemons	systemd
the gradual increase in memory consumption lets the daemons clean up the systemd without killing my app

860676
opensuse	linux
edited os is linux opensuse running on amd cpus linux 2.6.18.8-0.1-dw #3 smp thu mar 15 01 21 48 gmt 2007 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux

860679
getter	setter
i had to fill in the getter and setter of your class and containing structure but this is tested working code

860681
jar	manifest.mf
you might want to check the manifest.mf file of the ejb s jar to verify this

860685
fgets	feof
feof f and then fgets str 1024 f when running reaches the last line it still goes in the while but then when trying to fgets it flies out with an access violation arror menwhile i just put a try and catch ... but i know it s not a good solution what shoul i change for fixing the problem

860721
folder	directory
you put it in your c python26 lib site-packages directory under your own folder

860768
mp3	wav
i wrote a front end that invokes sox with lame to translate the wav files into mp3 s then uses soundmanager2 a flash javascript tool on the client side to play them back

860768
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so far works great with ie firefox safari and google-chrome on windows and firefox and safari on macs

860787
instances	transient
if the instances is transient when it is first attached to the session your type does not need to store its db id in a field

860788
put	get
you specified c++ as tag maybe use a filestream std ifstream for input from file and the global getline function to get it line by line and put it in a std string for further analysis manipulation

860813
mp3	wav
flowplayer supports mp3 playback i know maybe not wav but you could definitely couple it with ffmpeg to do some quick transcoding depending on your setup

860819
punctuation	words
check for sentence ending punctuation that follow words that don t start with uppercase letters

860834
keydown	keyup
it watches for virtual key messages and when it recognizes a keydown keyup combination it adds character messages

860861
disk	ram
if you re prepared to relax the requirement of 8mb ram for 6 million songs or to go to disk for example by memory mapping you could generate the sequence from 1..n at the beginning shuffle it with fisher-yates and whenever a new song is added pick a random element from the so-far-unplayed section insert the new id there and append the original id to the end of the list

860963
addslashes	multibyte
basically the way the attack works is by getting addslashes to put a backslash in the middle of a multibyte character such that the backslash loses its meaning by being part of a valid multibyte sequence

860963
addslashes	multibyte
addslashes can be tricked into creating a valid multibyte character

861008
next	except
this is the xpath expression i m using to select the input next to the label with the value of choice 1 except that the a is in front of it in the html

the algorithms for this should be trivial start with p floor sqrt a and count down until mod a p 0

861101
folder	directory
installutil.exe lives in the framework folder somewhere in your windows directory

861169
public	protected
if you change it to protected or public does it then work

861277
executable	upx
executable image compactors like upx are not recommended for dlls in particular and for executable that may have many instances running because the in-memory decompression acts like relocation in preventing the in-memory image from being shared between multiple processes

861280
datalist	repeater
what i d do is get your list in alphabetical order and then rearrange such that when you use the datalist repeater default ordering it s in your desired format

861412
ant	maven
i think maven gets a bad rap because it imposes structure on your project whereas other tools such as ant allow you to completely define the structure any way you wish

861412
ant	maven
agreed also that the documentation is bad but i think primarily the bad rap that maven gets is because people are so used to ant

861425
hide	show
you ll need to write dom traversal code to find elements in the form event binding code to bind functions to the events for the form elements this differs between ie and non-ie and then use the style.display property for sub-elements to hide or show them

861426
button	checkbox
what you will probably want to do is just have an onclick event handler on each checkbox or radio button and when that is clicked then create a new div and populate it with the extra information or if that information was already populated and was just hidden using css then have the event handler make it visible

861511
rss	feed

861682
serializable	deserialization
however this imposes a lot of work on you both on the client side creating the message object you basically have to manually create the xml that makes up the generic message as well as the server side since you can t rely on the nice xml serializable deserialization anymore

861687
folder	directory
the system32 directory is always in the path so putting the unmanaged dlls there always works but i would recommend adding some other folder to the path and then adding the dlls there to prevent polluting the system32 directory

862192
filesystems	xfs	filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	ntfs	hfs+	ntfs	xfs	ntfs
since we are developing filters not a new filesystems the behavior should be the same as the underlying filesystems ntfs hfs+ xfs

862192
filesystems	hfs	filesystems	ntfs
so the tools need to check not only basic operations open read write close dir but also os and filesystems specific features like resource forks on hfs streams on ntfs security attributes etc

862209
getter	setter
the obvious way to allow editing of a position is to build a viewmodel which has getter and setter as well as a toposition method to extract the validated immutable position instance

then you can either reformat images such that the point you re interested in is in the center of the image which you can calculate easily client-side with only the width and height or send the co-ordinate with the image

863012
width	height
when creating pop-ups you can only set width and height

863012

you can then programatically produce the set children from the set of childlinks perhaps in the getchildren method of the parent class

863699
inherited	properties
see the dependency properties information section of the maxheight which does not inherited parent s value and fontsize which does propagates as you describe

863699
inherited	properties
properties value inherited

863699
inherited	properties
an element can inherited the value of a dependency properties from its parent in the tree

863699
inherited	properties
properties value inherited behavior is not globally enabled for all dependency properties because the calculation time for inherited does have some performance impact

863699
inherited	properties
properties value inherited is typically only enabled for properties where a particular scenario suggests that properties value inherited is appropriate

863699
inherited	properties
you can determine whether a dependency properties inherited by looking at the dependency properties information section for that dependency properties in the sdk reference

863741
x86	64bit
your msil project runs as 64bit on an x64 machine so for now your solution of making your builder x86 is probably the best although in the future msbuild itself may work around this

863745
inherited	subclassing
i don t think subclassing is the way to go when its just common functionality you want to get into your objects and not a real inherited situation

863757
google-chrome	safari
however on safari and google-chrome the appear on the far left of the page

863789
children	parent
so class hierarchy parent with children child1 and child2

863810
post	get
finally params is a method in rails that gives you access to get and post parameters

863810
post	get
it s actually wrapping a hash get and post parameters are symbolized to reduce memory symbols are only defined once whereas a string like foo is a new object every time.

863810
post	get
so params chat_input retrieves the value from the previous request s get or post parameters and in your case it looks like it s just displaying and sanitizing them

863842
put	get
the main reason to have a get set wrap around a private var is to be able to put logic around the access

863857
pecl	pear
php has both a pecl extension and a pear package that can do geoip lookups

863866
accessor	properties
the solution proposed by my co-worker was to refactor the name of the stuff properties to allstuff and add a properties stuff that has a get and set accessor and use the new stuff properties in the operator override

863867
postgresql	mysql
edit the rdbms will be probably postgresql maybe hope not mysql

863891
inherited	properties
anywhere outside including inherited classes should get and set the properties but within the declaring class i say it s ok to assign the private member

863898
width	height
i ve had a look and one of your stylesheets set the height and width for #logopic

863898
width	height
try the real height and width of the image in there instead

863905
post	get
the next option is the one that john saunders referenced in his post and that is to use a service such as earthtools to look up a location and get the timezone information

863964
post	get
sorting this out should probably be being done in code in a feature reciever in the page layout feature if i ever get around to writing this i ll post it somewhere.

863973
accessor	properties	getter	setter
if i have to add code to the properties i still only use the field inside of the properties accessor and use the getter and setter everywhere else including the constructor

863992
post	get
a much better solution would be to post your data instead of using a get

864074
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

864081
firefox	safari
i ve made a simple site with a centered box followed by two-columns and it displays fine in firefox 3 and safari 3 but not in ie7

put	get
before you get angry with c out please consider that the output often is something a user has put in there - potentially with some unwanted code

864513
put	get
jmp target_address won t work i am guessing so they just put it as bytes to get around this issue

864527
direct3d	directx
that s also why other directx wrappers exist slimdx comes to mind as a much more direct direct3d wrapper

864534
prepare	execute
if you re only going to execute it once a prepare statement will take longer because the database engine has to do all the setup for a prepare statement then insert the values then have it floating around in a cache until the engine decides to flush it

864561
put	get
same thing except have the windows batch job get the files instead of having the aix script put them

864579
implements	extends
since icoolengine extends iengine any object implements icoolengine can be treated as if it s an iengine without all the icoolengine -specific methods of course

864611
min	max
instead once you have decided on your step size you could potentially set your min and max like this

864616
short	base

865002
dependencyobject	freezable
cannot use a dependencyobject that belongs to a different thread than its parent freezable

client-side	server-side
another option might be to have client-side code populate a hidden form field with the filename which you would then have server-side

865108
implements	extends
except that it extends javax.swing.filechooser.filefilter instead of implements java.io.filefilter

865183
pull	push
my question is is there a documented algorithm for validating a move where the user attempts to move a handle to value v which will in turn either push or pull all of the connected bars down the chain

865188
mp3	wav
nothing too complex just some basic processing and then output the result in either mp3 or a format easily converted to mp3 such as wav

865256
boost	stl
now if you intend on learning go for the best start quickly with stl basics and jump into boost libraries right away

865276
dia	visio
it s a general purpose svg editor so you re free to be more creative and expressive in your diagrams than with dia or visio both of which i ve used

865402
integer	unsigned
size_t is an alias typedef for an unsigned integer

865432
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
the documentation says that the supported formats are bmp gif exig jpg png and tiff

865443
cgpoint	cgrect	cgpoint	cgsize	cgsize	cgrect
because a cgrect contains a cgpoint and a cgsize you use one set of braces for the cgrect then another set for each of cgpoint cgsize

865448
trie	tree
i did this not too long ago to implement a binary trie based map the key was an integer and each level on the tree was a bit position

865448
implements	extends
to implements a set you extends abstractset and supply implementations of size and iterator

865448
put	get
you will want to also implement get and put since the default map is unmodifiable and the default implementation of get iterates through the entryset looking for a match

865466
stateless	stateful
shall it be stateless or stateful

865466
wan	lan
are clients co-located in the same vm appserver or remote in the same lan or even in a wan

865469
inherited	properties
the child b usercontrol would inherited this datacontext and could therefore bind it s controls to the same properties as a uses

865478
selecteditem	selectedindex
you can try combobox s selectedindex or selectedvalue to tell the selecteditem

865508
versioning	upgrade
my advice is to perform a new update upgrade in order to catch a new versioning that may resolve this problem

865574
960.gs	fluid
css frameworks such as 960.gs go for overall fixed maximums but there s also much to be said for fluid widths in general

865599
shadowing	named
you re shadowing a ivar named with the function argument

865599
uitableview	nsindexpath
in - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

865626

865648
addclass	removeclass
in regards to whether or not addclass and removeclass can handle these

865651
post	put
weâ d probably have a better chance of helping you if you put some actual code in the post

865655
division	multiplication
division and multiplication by integers seems to work out of the box

865661

865732
strtol	atoi
aside from f scanf which has been sufficiently discussed by the other answers there is also atoi and strtol for cases when you already have read input into a string but want to convert it into an int or long

865732
strtol	atoi
strtol is recommended because it allows you to determine whether a number was successfully read or not as opposed to atoi which has no way to report any error and will simply return 0 if it given garbage

865735
unsigned	short
if the given image is n x m pixels big then the image is n x m x 2 bytes big each pixel is an unsigned short and it s a greyscale image

865754
prepare	execute
when using mysql from jdbc -- at least as of a couple of years ago when i last looked into this -- there is pretty much zero difference between prepare statements and single-use statements because the mysql jdbc driver saves prepare statements on the client side when you execute the prepare statement it fills in the values as text and ships it over to the database engine

865809
addclass	removeclass
i don t think addclass or removeclass can handle these kind of classes

when ischecked is true you move the rectangle to one of the sides show the on word and hide the off word

865891
hide	show
or do i show hide the already existing html

865907
hide	show
i think it depends on what you re planning on displaying if it s images then i d be tempted to hide them on page load and then show on hover but if it s just a block of text then i d probably be tempted in appending to the dom and then removing on hover out

865960
rss	feed
following on kevin s suggestion of rss feed you might want to check out yahoo pipes

int	double
with semantics similar to foreach in other languages x gets referenced to each element in the container so that the function actually double each value inside the int vector

866298
postgresql	mysql
i don t know if you use php or not but i ve found that addslashes works relatively well for mysql but bombs fast in postgresql

cldc	midp
we targeted midp 2.0 cldc 1.1

866610
required	placeholder
alternatively call cache.add with a placeholder object for each of the required dependent keys without first checking if they exist with a get and use an exception handler to swallow the exception thrown if it already exists.

comma spaces delimiter our own system

866658
clang	llvm
use llvm clang static analyzer

866663

rss	feed
there may be times when you want to save an article object without updating your rss feed -- you might import an archive of articles at some point

866755
versioning	upgrade
maybe there s a chance that you can upgrade to a more recent 4.x versioning

866756
int	boolean
first off if your dataset only consists of 3-digit int then a simple array of 1000 boolean will be much more memory effieicnt than a map

866856
pop-up	dialog
recording the test seems to work except there s nothing in the log when the dialog pop-up but they don t play back properly

866887
submit	submission
is there any real difference to screen reader users or any users really whether i use image rather than submit as the type attribute for my form submission button

pop-up	dialog
i can t interact with a pop-up dialog

866943
disk	ram
i ve read the database speed comparison page at and i must say i was surprised by the performance of sqlite but since those benchmarks are a bit old i was looking for a more updated benchmark sqlite 3 vs mysql 5 again my main concern is disk performance not cpu ram

866955
mouseover	mouseout
it has some buttons made up of images with mouseover mouseout events on them in javascript and a bunch of embedded .net usercontrols

866955
mouseover	mouseout
when the mouseover mouseout events fire i change the images src to something else simple rollover effect

866987
button	checkbox
ok that works fine after the checkbox are created i m trying to run some code to get all the radio button and it didn t work so i tried just getting one radio button several times and it only gets it the first time

folder	directory
appdata is a standard directory that s been around since windows 2000 that hides in the user s documents and settings or users folder depending on the version

867031
accessor	properties
the synthesize directive on properties generates accessor methods for properties so we don t have to do it manually and because

867031
accessor	properties
so when you define your properties as you did above nonatomic copy and then use you re actually calling generated accessor that will make a copy of the new variable as opposed to just assigning it

867035
accessor	properties
in the implementation of ovaldrawdocument i m trying to use the auto-generated properties accessor for ovals like so

867086
try-catch	exception-handling
this is because most of the exception-handling metadata gathering such as getting a stack trace etc. only really happens on the try-catch side not on the throw side

867107
ant	maven
you could also do all this by hand using maven or ant

867117

octal	decimal
there is an octal syntax prefix your number with 0 decimal syntax and hexadecimal syntax with a 0x prefix

867442
getter	setter
it would be nice if i could have a method which would take as a parameter method calls to setter and getter and call this for all fields but unfortunately this is not possible with java

867442
getter	setter
use reflection api to find out getter and setter

867442
getter	setter
change fields to public and manipulate them directly without using getter and setter

867469
draggable	droppable
when i make a draggable clone and drop it in a droppable i cannot drag it again

867471
16-bit	64bit
the obvious ones are pointers and pointer-diffs for different architectures but also floating-point types 16 32 or 64bit depending on the exactness checksums 8 or 16-bit depending on speed and some other non-obvious stuff

867472
getter	setter
how about providing a single getter setter pair that takes a numeric index field and then have getter setter dereference the index field to the relevant member variable

in some circumstances you can also use wct it s usually implmented by debugger s or profiling however it can be used from any code as the usual debugger requirement of being the thread which has the debugging port open is not a pre-requisit

867576
multiplying	add
also think of any non-negative number multiplying it by two then add one tack a binary one on to the end

867602

next	except
it is fine for my data except that the recommended table has a sku field i need also however i cannot put it next to recommended.productcode and have the query still work

867975

i would recommend a version management tool like svn cvs sourcesafe because it helps you understand what you did when and why and gives you more control over your code go back branch merge etc

868026
postgresql	mysql
also php first or mysql postgresql first

868030
stdout	stderr
it uses different colours for commands and program stdin stdout stderr

868046

implements	extends
you could also implements the observer design pattern but then you would have to extends the canvas class

868398
int	chars
so implicit conversions are allowed int - chars results in s containing the chars equivalent of 67 in ascii this would become c

868454
redhat	fedora
on redhat fedora centos you can just type yum install mypackagename

868457
getter	setter
no they re not if you look at the system.drawing.point struct for example it has a setter as well as a getter on its x property

868475

868680
postgresql	mysql
i need to replicate data from microsoft sql server to mysql or postgresql

868793
post	get
field on the get or post so the client s desired timezone is part of the request

868827
versioning	upgrade
if it s less than what you expect call some code to upgrade the database to the current versioning and then continue

868834
perforce	svn
one conversion to perforce and two to svn

868849
qabstracttablemodel	qabstractlistmodel
i believe that both qabstractlistmodel and qabstracttablemodel handle the parent portion themselves leaving you free to just worry about the data you want

868855
config	ini
for example if an application has simple config requirements and has strict startup time goals registry entries or a simple ini file may be a faster startup alternative

868858
folder	dir
so you could have your c++ project pointing to the main folder then create a java project in a different dir and then use the above mechanism to compile all the java source

868993
haskell	scheme
i would suggest you read up on functional programming and maybe learn a functional language like haskell or scheme

868997
width	height
i know the height and width of the rectangle but this can change during runtime

869001
apache	nginx
above will serve all existing files directly using nginx nginx just displays php source code otherwise forward a request to apache

869001
apache	nginx
i want nginx to handle all static files and apache to process all dynamic stuff

869090
free	malloc
consider changing the buffer code to a file static or a malloc free

869201
hide	show
my only solution there is to duplicate the fields in another section and hide show the appropriate section based on logic

869215
post	get
later i will get a chance to look at the bouncycastle librarys to be able to test this and will post more code if necessary

869309
g++	gcc
i use gcc g++ on linux and since my install is in spanish my native language gcc prints warnings and errors in spanish

869309
g++	gcc
i ve googled for this but every language topic about gcc and g++ refers to programming language not human language

869340
children	parent
these rownumbers let it take 10 parent even if that s really 50 records due to each parent having 5 children

869350
google-chrome	firefox
in terms of how to get the buffer to send you can use a number of framebuffers to render to and set up the framebuffer code to start a timer when a change is made and while changes are occurring send periodic changes when enough time has gone by since the last change not sent yet send an update probably shorter time than the first value and also probably include some sort of strobe that forces an update that can be invoked on certain occurrences if you can for example get a page-load-completion indication from the browser which you can with a little work in firefox by changing the google-chrome etc

869350
rdp	remote-desktop
for examples of other solutions look at remote-desktop protocols and programs like vnc rdp windows remote desktop etc - that s effectively what they re doing again with fancier compression and damage-region tracking

869365
firefox	safari
this appears correctly in safari and firefox but not in ie

869368
post	get
if you can t get to the forum and need the additional code leave a comment and i ll post the missing pieces

869449
put	get
if i put the common functionality in a base class that inherits from the common ancestor i get a class which makes no sense to instantiate so i made it abstract

869478
innodb	myisam
make sure your tables are innodb because it won t work on myisam tables

869516
xslt	sgml
you might not like xslt for its verbosiness or functionalness but it s damn helps that your template is xmllint-able xml and your output is a good sgml xml

869532
hash	md5
with a 128 bit md5 hash that s 16 bytes per hash or only about 1.6mb of memory + overhead

869541
mouse	keyboard
this still allows the indicator to appear when focused by keyboard but hides when mouse activated

869560
cublas	lapack
follow up lapack is a full featured library for dealing with all kind of linear algebra stuff and it s damn efficient at this there are also gpu based libraries such as cublas which runs on nvidia gpus using cuda

869568
hide	show
you can code your own solution with a div containing an input field and a button and some javascript to show hide the div

869576
openscenegraph	openinventor	openinventor	coin3d
openscenegraph is popular coin3d free for non-commercial use is an implementation of the openinventor spec any of them would probably fit your need as it doesn t sound like you need any cutting-edge support

869597
int	double
but an implicit conversion happens from double to int

869672
folder	directory
i created a winform that would do the following create a new local user account and add them to a group create a new directory under our ftp server s base directory create a new virtual ftp folder so that a user could map a connection to the folder and finally give the new user full control of the new directory and because the directory was a virtual folder the new user has full control via ftp

869687
prng	random
the downside is of course that these numbers are not random at all which depending on what you are using the prng for may or may not matter

869699
ubuntu	debian
if you have shell access and it s an ubuntu debian machine just do

869761

does anybody know a way for me to get notified on deserialization while still being able to use the built in serializable system to automatically serializable deserialize my somewhat complex object graph for me

869782
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
vim emacs textmate

869802
int	double
what is the best way to get these input in types like double or int

869810
serializable	deserialization
the standard non-xml serializable mechanism uses special attributes to mark methods to be used as callbacks during deserialization

869815
subtract	add
if you really want to replace all your tdatetime variables with this you probably need to overload some other operators too add subtract explicit ...

869876
getter	setter	super	implements
are implements using the getter and the setter of the super class

869908
nsscanner	nsnumberformatter	strtol	strtod
you ll then want to use either strtol strtoul strtod nsscanner or nsnumberformatter to convert the input to numeric types

869927
post	put
i have a need to do raw post put a var requests to a server and accept the results from that page as a string

869989
width	height
i would like the height width of a remote image

869997
getter	setter
you say you presently have getter and setter for all these fields

869997
getter	setter
change all the getter and setter to access the array

869997
getter	setter
then create a generic getter setter pair that use an index as well as a getter for the compare flag

869997
getter	setter
as you already have getter and setter any other code using this class should continue to work unchanged

869997
getter	setter
if there is no other code using this class then throw away the existing getter and setter and just do everything with the array

870008
tftp	telnet	ftp	telnet
curl is a command line tool for transferring files with url syntax supporting ftp ftps http https scp sftp tftp telnet dict ldap ldaps and file

curl supports ssl certificates http post http put ftp uploading http form based upload proxies cookies user+password authentication basic digest ntlm negotiate kerberos... file transfer resume proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks

870033
width	height
the height and width of an image are attributes inside the image file and you need to retieve the file to be able to access them

870033
width	height
in the event of a large image you can try something like start fecthing the image to your server and as soon as you start receiving data and know the format of the image wait until you receive enough from the image to look at the height and width information and stop the transfer

870033
width	height
if by chance you control the server where the images are you are better of writting a small script hosted in that server that given an image file identifier returns the height and width for that image

870044
cpu	affinity
i d suggest setting the cpu affinity to the slow core and see if it s just as fast that way

870044
cpu	affinity
setting zope s cpu affinity to any cpu fixed the problem

870046
cpython	ironpython
i have done this with pretty much every reflective mechanism that exists in the python world cpython on python api s and com api s using makepy jython for java api s and ironpython for .net api s

870080
union	distinct
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

870102
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
to prevent these things in google-chrome opera firefox etc

870118
post	get
besides if you are doing anything more complex than loading some x html into an element you should probably use one of the more powerful jquery ajax methods get or post or ajax

870126
put	get
on an aside this so question in a roundabout way asked if there is any way to get eclipse to put the + symbol on the new line when it splits a string for you

870133
versioning	upgrade
there might still be corporate environments where they won t upgrade for a while because they have legacy web apps that depend on the browser versioning or just won t spare the manpower to coordinate an upgrade

870137
move	drag
the objects are nodes and edges represented in datatemplate s with thumb and polyline objects and i want to be able to detect clicks and drag on the itemscontrol in order to move the nodes and edges

870160
put	get
i asked how to do this before but it seems i needed to put more code to really get an answer

870160
rss	feed
i have a reddit type site and i am trying to create a rss feed this is the code but i get a fatal error uncaught exception exception with message query failed

870174
put	get
if there is any way to get eclipse to put the + symbol on the new line when it splits a string for you

870231
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie8 is available or even google-chrome firefox safari etc

870237
width	margin
since a page can have margin for it body element so styling a div to the width of its body element won t do

870253
waitpid	fork
in unix terminology i want to fork exec waitpid and getrusage

870334
cfstring	nsstring
cfstring and nsstring cfarray and nsarray are both examples

870369
implements	extends
i ve implements a deskband taskbar toolbar using the bandobjectlib extends explorer with band objects using .net and windows forms from codeproject modified with support for the ideskband2 interface which allows the start menu in windows vista to retain transparency when my deskband taskbar toolbar is enabled

870412
versioning	upgrade
there is no script that has the straight final versioning even deploy on a clean db does the deploy via a series of upgrade steps

870427
versioning	upgrade
if you recompile the new features and thus have a new precompiled site running a new versioning of .net there won t be anything to merge unless you don t do a full deployment but if you don t do a full deployment how can you have upgrade to a new versioning of .net

870479
post	get
update ok the issue was that the browser doesn t post to get an image it gets so now my script sends a get string and it all works wonderfully

870480
min	max
so on each sample of the call stack it updates the function-level timing info but all it does with the line-number info is keep track of min and max line numbers in each function which the more samples it takes the farther apart those get

870513
width	height
if the css for the width and height were expressed as percentages rather than absolute values you could adjust the width by adjusting the iframe

870518
codeigniter	cakephp
this is the way libraries like codeigniter and cakephp handle the same scenario

870536
testdriven.net	xunit.net
we use testdriven.net with xunit.net for testing

870581
move	drag
the requirement is for the ui to perform a drag move if the server returns ok and no-op if the server returns an error

870599
folder	directory
there s also a cache folder in the ide directory

870611
qapplication	qcoreapplication
qcoreapplication s constructors require and qapplication inherits from qcoreapplication

870623
google-chrome	safari
if you try to send an ajax request a jsonp request or even a window.name request on unload safari and google-chrome run the code but the server never sees the request

870623
firefox	safari
this code and ajax and window.name creates a request for test.html in firefox and ie7 but not safari

870650
inherited	subclassing
unless you are doing some really funky inherited hierarchies and you shouldn t it is enough to know that the lookup order is left to right depth first and all subclassing of a class are searched before that class is searched

870673
hash	md5
more useful than checksums if you really need the extra application-level assurance would be a sha-n hash of the data or md5 etc

870693
nant	cruisecontrol
i ve wrestled with so many nant scripts cruisecontrol config files in the past i m almost blind from angle brackets

870735
ready	each
we have done this with cruisecontrol.net nant nunit and various power shell scripts it was pretty time consuming but each morning we come to work to find a fully compiled deployed exported and tested set of biztalk solutions ready for the test team

870744
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter mouseleave

870881
nant	psake
make a simple build script using whatever you want cmd nant rake psake ... that

870882
folder	directory
i created the directory structure as suggested with folder for logs

870898
post	get	post	put	put	get
imo there is hardly a need for a framework simply use the servlet api and implement the request methods you need aka post get put delete head

870938
margin	height
each one actually has the entire text of #page inside but the top margin is set neagtively the height is fixed and overflow is set to hidden so only the proper amount appears.

870938
firefox	safari
and it works great except for this while safari and firefox on the mac work perfectly ie and firefox on windows add an extra page

870955
mouse	keyboard
i just noticed last week that my keyboard has a right-click button between alt and ctrl on the right side so no mouse needed to mouse to a specific test

870977
jboss	glassfish
it scales differently you ve got the possibility of handling much larger loads but it s also totally different than running your own web app server glassfish tomcat jboss etc. and coding using standard java tools

870987
hebrew	turkish
the fontdialog class in c# has a property allowscriptchange that lets the user select the script western hebrew arabic turkish etc

870994
put	get
i really am starting to get what rest is about and getting into the guts of http and rooting for html5 put delete support

871088
width	height
for instance height and width can and should be grouped together because whenever users specify one they are used to specify the other

871137
int	chars
no more work needs to be done because the find method will return the page #123 automatically since the ruby to_i method will return the int that starts the string and ignore all chars starting with the first non-numerical chars

871187
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
svn on windows is dreadfully slow tried tortoisesvn smartsvn command line svn an update can take in the upwards of 5-8 minutes and it is only updating 10 small files

871196
cpython	ironpython
so i can easily switch the interpreters from ironpython to cpython and vice versa

871225
firefox	safari
in safari 4 and firefox 3.5 you can determine the progress of an xmlhttprequest as follows

871235
jar	war
any project is responsible for building and then versionning its set of files to be delivered jar war ear ...

871276
getter	setter
your title getter and setter should save the value in a _title variable to be used later for the assignment in commitproperties

871276
width	height
override the measure function and update measuredwidth and measuredheight to be the maximum width and height values of the main label and it s child

871276
width	height
override updatedisplaylist and use setactualsize on the child label to set it to the required width and height

871321
post	put
i think one of the most important things you can put in place to facilitate this are tests to ensure that everything still works post refactoring pulling out into separate modules

871322
restrict	shared
we have a server application that we want to restrict non-users from triggerring it off from other machines or even by double-clicking from any shared

871330
post	get
some of the requests will be get s and others will be post s

871330
post	get
everything works for get but i am having difficulties getting the url parameter value for post s

871338
post	get
i assume from the things that you have tried that you know how to get a handle to your main window but if you don t just leave a comment and i will post a snippet for that

871354
pow	sqrt
operator and sqrt pow etc

871372
union	distinct
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

871375
superclass	subclassing
the superclass and all the other subclassing continue to work unchanged

871375
superclass	subclassing
it is very expensive to add a new operation on things you have to add a new method declaration to the superclass and potentially add a method definition to every existing subclassing

871376
post	get
for post you will need to use something similar to below to get the individual parameters

871412
sorting	filtering
according to msdn the valuetype property is used when filtering or sorting the columns with respect to the contents of their cells. so i would be sure to set it for any column that allows sorting

871417
imperative	declarative
using a container is mostly about changing from an imperative scripted style of initialization and configuration to a declarative one

871422
put	get
i can put data into the amazon simpledb service and i can get it back

871434
hash	salt
for example one can argue that a cryptographic object providing methods to encrypt decrypt hash or get a salt value is a service provider but many group this functionality into a utility class with static methods like cryptoutil.encrypt ...

871452
cvs	svn
i m also a 10+ year mostly happy user of cvs though i also like git and with time will come to prefer it though most of the projects i work on currently use cvs or svn and we can t seem to get the bureacracy where i work convinced to let us punch a git-hole through the firewall

871458
imperative	declarative
either you encapsulate that complexity in imperative code or else in declarative code

871462
division	modulo
you can either using integer division and divide it by two and inspect the remainder or use a modulo and mod it by two and inspect the remainder

871520
webkit	gecko
webkit and gecko seem to behave similarly enough when it comes to javascript anyway

871533
webkit	gecko
when i need to look something up i use the mozilla developer network as gecko and webkit seem to be heading in roughly the same direction

871577
move	drag
i have a designercanvas derived from canvas that i can add uielements to then drag drop move group and move them around

queue	fifo
a relatively recent paper on lock-free fifo queue is this search for further papers by the same author s

871802
boost	stl
i m not particularly familiar with the boost libraries so there may be a more standard way to do this but i think you can do what you want with iterators and the stl transform function template

871867
post	get
sessions would be the only good way you could also use get post but that would be potentially insecure

871919
width	height
found out why in my method ratio it should take height and width and i put and i put 2 hieghts instead

871931
hash	salt
passwords store only a salt hash un-reversible of your passwords and compare with a similarly salt hash of an entered password

871968
ubuntu	linux
note i am using ubuntu and i am all-together new to anything linux

872018
direct3d	directdraw
those flags toggle the opengl pipeline turn of using direct3d and disable use of directdraw respectively

872035
google-chrome	firefox
the problem s cause must be earlier when oquestion.achoicerand gets assigned you think it s assigned to an array and apparently ie and firefox agree with you google-chrome is telling you that it s null instead

872055
opera	firefox
if it doesn t find that it looks for mozilla without compati or opera in an attempt to determine that the browser is firefox or opera

872083
post	get
if you want to get a notification from paypal with transaction details you have to enable ipn post

872111

872153
ant	maven
also i ve heard about maven or ant in what way can they help me

872176
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
it s implied and in fact many case tools would show you the inherited method as part of the list of the methods of the subclassing when clicking on the class at looking at its properties and some case tools even have the option of showing also the inherited methods in the diagram

872197
ant	maven
maven and ant are both build tools while maven also handles dependencies for you

872210
width	height
and have the debugger output width and height i get the results in decimal however in the directx sample the result is in hexidecimal both are actually accurate when i convert the hexidecimal to decimal it seems to be appropriate

872231
mouse	keyboard
as my drawing function is called from inside the paint event handler of the form mouse and keyboard events are handled only after the whole triangle is drawn which can take quite a while

872315
trojan	virus
you can also verify that the anti virus programs avast and malware bytes can not connect to updates for some reason sneaky trojan that is

vb.net	vb6
we are upgrading a suite of data acquisition and analysis routines from vb6 programs to a mixture of vb.net vb6 and matlab programs

872473
uitableview	nsindexpath
what i don t understand is how i can use the navigationbarcontroller from within my tableviewcontroller and e.g - void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

872501
qcodo	qcubed
the ease of use ability to quickly build complex applications and the true oo approach qcodo now qcubed uses makes it the best framework for my purposes

872505
integer	unsigned
on a 64 bit system printing this value ip_int will display an unsigned integer since we ve removed the high bit

post	get
except if you use something like sessions cookies or get post variables

872522
post	get
get and post

872553
rss	feed
the example uses an rss feed xml as the source but it should get you going

872557

872558
pull	push
i m getting confused with regards to scope and gc as i have a custom movieclip-extending class slide which i create instances of within a loop and push into an array but afterwards the items are null when i pull them out of the collection

subtract	add
let s say your coworker monkeypatches the fixnum class and redefines the + method to subtract instead of add

872722
exponent	addition
but it is a proposed addition with a 5-bit exponent and 10-bit fraction

872722
integer	fractions
if you want accuracy to the ones place as in you can represent each integer the answer is fairly simple the exponent shifts the decimal point to the right-end of the fractions

872730
submit	submission
not only are you going to restrict the submission only to people with js enabled people expect to have a submit button to their forms

872743
multiplying	subtraction
just two multiplying and a subtraction plus a function call to round are quite economic and the code is quite readable too

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
both properties are custom for firefox and webkit safari and google-chrome

872842
goto	break
for instance this was done in c# s switch statement which makes break or goto mandatory

dlsym	dlopen
if you want to dynamically link you use dlopen dlsym to resolve unix .so shared library entry points

take a look at cakephp codeigniter and or zend framework

873356
g++	gcc
the idea is to compile the cpp files using g++ and the c files using gcc then link them together

873367
floating-point	integer
for floating-point integers i ll give my answer in terms of ieee double-precision every integer between 1 and 2 53 is exactly representable

873374
g++	gcc
the easiest way to avoid undefined symbols while linking is to link with g++ not gcc

873374
g++	gcc
the link error may go away if you run all your gcc and g++ commands on the same system no matter the old or the new one

873401
width	height
you can also add a height and width to the error message

873417
inherited	properties
check that the codebehind properties in the page directive points to the .cs file and that the inherited properties points to the correct class name in the .cs file

873473
goto	break
ie i suppose goto could be used as an improv break

873508
versioning	upgrade
id like to use it for testing with older versioning of .net but it wont let me install the upgrade versioning

873508
versioning	upgrade
it just wont install to an empty vm because its an upgrade versioning

873510
inherited	properties
because properties inherited from hashtable the put and putall methods can be applied to a properties object

873541
onchange	onblur
onblur fires when a field loses focus while onchange fires when that field s value changes

873541
onchange	onblur
in firefox tabbing out of a changed field will fire onchange then onblur and it will normally do the same in ie

873541
onchange	onblur
however if you press the enter key instead of tab in firefox it will fire onblur then onchange while ie will usually fire in the original order

873541
onchange	onblur
you can t assume that either the onblur or the onchange will happen before the other one

873546
implements	extends
and it has to extends plain hashtable instead of because generics were implements in the downwards-compatibe way via type erasure so once the compiler has done its thing there are no generics

873610
width	height
i am making a photo gallery script that involves displaying an image in fixed width height box

873620
execvp	fork
then i create a new process with fork and execute that command with the associated arguments with execvp

873621
put	get
so to get zip-archive mode fully working on windows you will just need to find a windows version of command-line zip unzip and put them into a directory that is in your path see unzip package at

873624
setinterval	settimeout
i found a few solutions about using setinterval or settimeout but wasn t sure if this was the best way

873654
equals	gethashcode
these seem naturally contradicting when a mutable object because if the state of the object changes we expect the value of equals to change which means that gethashcode should change to match the change in equals but gethashcode should not change

873654
equals	gethashcode
to sum up what i ve learned from this is that the only way to achieve all goals and to avoid possible quirky behavior in edge cases is to only override equals and gethashcode based on immutable fields or implement iequatable

873691
inherited	properties
unfortunately if they were to retroactively make properties inherited from then the following previously valid code would stop working

873691
inherited	properties
what s now appreciated by most educated observers is that properties should never have inherited from map at all

873692
equals	gethashcode
if you want the lookup not to use the gethashcode or equals method of the class you can always provide your own iequalitycomparer implementation to use instead when you create the dictionary

873709
serializable	deserialization
you mention serializable deserialization which is important because referential integrity is lost in that process

873709
equals	gethashcode
these are the fields you should use when overrideing gethashcode and equals

873709
equals	gethashcode
note that gethashcode and equals should work together

873709
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode should return the same value for two objects if they are equals

873711
organization	naming
apple s document organization assumes that you start at the beginning and establish a strong basic understanding of the frameworks patterns and naming conventions

873730
caanimation	nsanimation
there s a way to do it with nsanimation on mac but there s no equivalent that i know of in caanimation

873744
getter	setter
you instantiate a new object and user getter and setter to store your data and instead of writing sql in your page code you create functions in the objects related to the query

873744
put	get
you get all the data you need and then put as little php in the display basically just echoing the variables you got in the action controller with the exception of some for loops and if statements for conditionals

873791
postgresql	mysql
not only you need php extension s dlls in order to add mysql and postgresql support to php

873791
postgresql	mysql
you also need mysql and postgresql native libraries

873791
postgresql	mysql
make sure you have mysql and postgresql client installed and their dlls into some locatable place

873799
put	get
if the goal is to get the image specific to selected option and if you want to put your own image name instead of picture +id i would modify like below

873863
int	boolean
when a method is called a block of memory is pushed onto the top the stack that memory block has space for all primitives int float boolean etc and object references of the method which includes the method parameters

873890
postgresql	mysql
the problem here is that apache has loaded php but php was not able to load its extension mysql postgresql ...

873895
portrait	landscape
i d like the view to fill all the landscape space...and for text to fill use this space rather than wrapping as much as it does in portrait

873963
portrait	landscape
if itâ s too large in landscape and you use landscape often just make it all smaller and occasionally zoom when in portrait -

873975
ubuntu	linux
i want this setup to work on linux more specifically gnome under ubuntu but i do occasionally use other distro window manager so solution on the level of x is appreciated

873975
joystick	keyboard	hid	joystick	hid	keyboard
this foot pedal does not register itself as keyboard or even joystick but as a hid device with usagepage 12 usage 3

873975
hid	keyboard
i notice that the latest ubuntu can detect and use the favorite keys on the microsoft natural keyboard which also register as hid device

873975
hid	keyboard
for those not in the know the microsoft natural keyboard registers as both a regular keyboard and a generic hid device

873978
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 530.5 k html like gecko google-chrome 2.0.172.8 safari 530.5

873978
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this with mozilla firefox and google-chrome and it works in firefox but not google-chrome

873978
google-chrome	firefox
edit 2 - so it seems that the reason it was working on firefox but not google-chrome was because firefox displays the html as its received while google-chrome waits for the connection to close before doing any rendering

873980
post	get
i use the above django shortcut from generic views where you can specify post save redirect get in your case

873986
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s limit is different than firefox s

873987
post	get
ok i have an in template function that get s submitted via method post

873988
super	self
it s a self contained library that s a multithreaded http web server and has a super simple api yet complete

873995
chunked	transfer-encoding
but since i don t know the file size iis seems to be buffering the output until a certain limit is reached packet size or time i don t know then sends a packet with transfer-encoding set to chunked

874032
calloc	malloc	strncpy	malloc	strncpy	calloc
as to your comment on strncpy not nul-terminating the string which is true if you use calloc to allocate the string rather than malloc this won t be a problem if you allocate one byte more than you copy since calloc automatically sets all values including in this case the end to 0

874032
calloc	malloc
not that there s anything wrong with saying sizeof char - it clearly shows your intention and provides symmetry with calls to calloc or malloc for other types

874032
memcpy	strncpy
also i would use strncpy or memcpy rather than strncat

874032
memcpy	strncpy
plus strncpy and memcpy will probably be a wee little bit faster more efficient than strncat

874070
ubuntu	linux
cross platform it should be runnable on xp vista osx and common versions of linux such as ubuntu and kubuntu

874070
folder	directory
for windows xp and vista i had to copy qtcored4.dll qtguid4.dll qtsqld4.dll and mingwm10.dll to distribution directory this was debug code and i copied the qsqlited4.dll to a folder named sqldrivers in the distribution directory

874092
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql select column from table limit 10

874191
uitableview	reloaddata
i have a uitableview which is populated by an array i have a button on the navigaton bar which when pressed adds an item to the array and calls self.tableview reloaddata in the uitableview

874192
solaris	bsd
it has active ports to windows linux and mac os x and has been compiled for at least some bsd variant and solaris as well

874204
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
to avoid refresh problems in firefox and forever loading problems in google-chrome and safari set the iframe s src to about blank once you re done

874227
post	get
i m doing a get and post method for an android project and i need to translate httpclient 3.x to httpclient 4.x using by android

874273
postgresql	mysql
those extensions depend on native libraries which are provided by the mysql and postgresql binary distributions

874278
post	get
when i m trying to call an ascx with jquery post i get

874318
equals	gethashcode
irrespective of the object type it will simply call the gethashcode and equals methods to allow it to put the value in the right bucket and retrieve it again

874350
installshield	orca
i m somewhat familiar with orca the tool to manipulate .msi files as well as full blown installer applications like installshield but i would like to make this using only raw visual studio and other available open-source tools

874424
opensuse	linux
tested with latest jdk 6 unter linux opensuse kde3

874427
post	get
you can do either get or post transactions too

874449
ubuntu	linux
the standard linux archive app that comes with ubuntu was used for gzipping

874559
subobject	instances
which is fine as all the custom objects only have a single instances anyway examples of subobject are the ui the tools the shared data etc.

874569
post	get
most often people choose to send data over to the server with post or get which is basically a method to transfer name-value pairs inherent to http

874579
onkeyup	onmouseup
if you don t want to do that the events you re likely looking for are onkeyup for arrow enter on the options and onmouseup for clicking on the options events

874589
put	get
when i put the table into editing mode there is a white line to the left of the reorder control that i can t seem to get rid of

874617
x86	mips
the core files might be little endian arm or big endian mips and the program to analyze them might be running on a little endian host x86 or big endian powerpc

874632
children	parent
in general the focus line will have a tree of parent and a tree of children

874635
int	double
i created a converter to convert from double to int

874635
int	double
what do i have to do so that my converter successfully converts a double and sends back an int

874660
int	double
you are attempting to cast not convert from double to int which won t work

874662
google-chrome	firefox
because some of the properties used in css are specific to firefox and google-chrome

874668
affinity	processors
set the testâ s processors affinity to run on one processors core only

874701
int	double
you want to convert but you are doing casting from double to int

874712
firefox	safari
if i remember correctly it works in firefox ie safari

874719
return-value-optimization	nrvo
is there other technique like return-value-optimization return-value-optimization or nrvo named return-value-optimization that can be use with vc2008

874766
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
i am unsure if you can set it in a web.config file but what you can do is inherited from the grid view set the properties in the constructor and use that new subclassing

874785
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket
you shoud start by using a normal web framework like wicket jsf tapestry gwt etc.. later if it turns out your servers preformance is cpu-bound you might ocnsider rewriting the most often used parts of the apllication that way

874815
stdout	stderr
capture stdout or stderr or potentially both either together or separately

874837
free	malloc
they re fairly simple wrappers around malloc and free

874851
hide	show
you could create ide macros to show hide your tool windows though

874865
stdout	stderr
you can try flushing stdout from the sub-process or using stderr or changing stdout on non-buffered mode

874871
google-chrome	firefox
my code works perfectly fine in firefox and internet explorer however it just dies in google-chrome

874923
lxml	elementtree
maybe it also helps in your case to insert an explicit from lxml import elementtree somewhere in your code

874937
inherited	properties
even if you inherited from the dropdownlist you cannot add this properties because you have to add it to the listitem control

874977
innodb	myisam
for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable

875003
post	get
you ll need to run a background thread to do the work and you ll then need to periodically post back to check the value of say session variable to get your current progress

875033
getter	setter
in actionscript 3 you can create getter and setter using the get and set keywords meaning you create a method in the class and access data through a property of an instance of that class

875033
getter	setter
is there an equivalent of actionscript 3 getter setter in java as in

875041
getter	setter
as3 getter and setter are an ecmascript thing

875042
getter	setter
in java the only option you have without exposing the internals of your object is to make your own getter and setter as you have in your example

875042
getter	setter
so as in your example the field name would have getname and setname methods as their corresponding getter and setter respectively

875045
getter	setter
the get and set patterns though are so established in java culture that you ll find strong ide support for them eclipse will make them for you automatically and if you re working in something that uses the expression language first made for jsps el then you ll be able to use the property notation to access getter and setter

875068
strncmp	strcmp
this uses strncmp instead of strcmp thus ensuring that no more than three bytes are compared

875093
getter	setter
i would consider not having the getter or setter as they don t do anything in your case except make the code more complicated

875093
getter	setter
here is an example without getter or setter

875094
bmp	png
it supports a load of file formats such as bmp jpg png pdf svg etc etc

875115
expressionengine	joomla
depending on what you re trying to achieve expressionengine is decent for a small site and joomla is pretty good for small to mid size

875159
for-loop	loops
if you loops using a regular for-loop and loops over it backwards you can remove items as you go

875170
sorting	filtering
this kind of repository pattern adds some conditions filtering sorting command .

875198
width	height
first create a div with the width you need put some characters in and request its height in pixels

875238
integer	fractions
what is a good algorithm to determine the necessary fractions needed to add sub to the number in order to round it to the nearest integer without using the inbuilt ceiling or floor funcitons

875263
portrait	landscape
that explains how to achieve automatic rotation from portrait to landscape and back again without using interface builder and without having to deal with manually implementing complex transforms

875335
client-side	server-side
it ll allow you to target client-side apps server-side app and web apps via asp.net

875375
children	parent
i don t think uasort can help with this problem because you want to attach the children to the parent

875377
floor	sqrt
i have floor sqrt floor x

875395
getter	setter
also before adding setter and getter it might be a good idea to ask yourself why are you exposing the internal data of the object in question

875407
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt floor 2 floor sqrt 2 floor 1.41...

875412
spaces	linefeed
this might be wrong - at least a spaces or a linefeed

875417
haskell	scheme
a functional language haskell scheme

875432
getter	setter
they as the name implies allow variables to be retrieved and set - specifically they are called getter and setter

875434
lisp	scheme
scheme lisp and clojure are also acceptable

875434
awk	ksh
can they combine simple unix commands effectively into scripts using a language like sh ksh bash awk lua or python

875442
floor	sqrt
obviously the outer floor is not redundant since for example sqrt 2 is not an integer and thus floor sqrt 2 â sqrt 2

875442
floor	sqrt
it is also easy to see that sqrt floor x â sqrt x for non-integer x

875442
ceil	floor	ceil	sqrt	floor	sqrt
it is easy to see that floor sqrt n â floor sqrt ceil n

875444
floor	sqrt
a sqrt x b floor sqrt x+d c sqrt x+d

875445
ceil	floor	ceil	sqrt	floor	sqrt
the inner one is redundant because the square root for any number in the interval x x+1 where x is an integer always lies within the interval floor sqrt x ceil sqrt x and therefore you don t need to floor a number before taking the square root of it if you are only interested the integer part of the result

875452
sitecore	dotnetnuke
as already given there are several content management solutions out there including sharepoint wordpress drupal dotnetnuke and sitecore

875474
floor	sqrt
if the inner floor were not redundant then we would expect that floor sqrt n

875474
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt m where m floor n

875474
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt n

875474
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt m requires that the values of sqrt n and sqrt m differ by at least 1.0

875474
floor	sqrt
thus for all values n the floor sqrt n floor sqrt n + 1

875485
daemons	launchd
according to wikipedia by definition a daemons should detach itself from the controlling tty so i think it s correct that no exception is shown and after all a daemons should keep working even if you close the shell that launchd it

875490
disk	ram
an impotant implementation detail might be what the api you use to access the index whether you store it in ram which the o s backs with the system page file and access it in-process using pointers and or store it on disk which the o s caches in the file system cache and access it using file i o apis

875500
webclient	ftpwebrequest
the webclient class doesn t allow that but ftpwebrequest does

875504
awt	swing
also you need to include the boilerplate to always access swing components on the awt event dispatch thread edt

875524
imperative	declarative
not all developers yet understand the difference between declarative and imperative programming

875530
post	get
i d like to give users the ability to get post in a random order by sending a get request with

875561
actualheight	actualwidth
- each has their verticleoffset and horizontaloffset properties binding to the actualheight and actualwidth of the child 2

875561
width	height
- topleft is offset negative the actual width and height

875561
mouse	keyboard
at the moment keyboard and mouse is locked captured by the first menu you focus on and the others are not available by hovering over them

875643
mouse	keyboard
suggestion with mouse or keyboard

875643
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works beautifully in ie6 ie7 ie8 google-chrome safari but not in firefox

875650
post	get
i am trying to get post a form to a hidden dynamically inserted iframe but in internet explorer the form submission opens in a new window

875712
getter	setter
and you may want to include getter setter for metadata and potentially attachments because they are a legitimate part of your domain an email

875717
put	get
crippling my machine without my express permission will get you put forever on the filter-with-extreme-prejudice list.

875757
debian	linux
i have a setup that builds linux arm i386 binaries and packages those into debs and maintains a debian repository from build results - run unittests and all kinds of stuff on the code

875789
g++	gcc
clarification at the moment we re using -d_reentrant and -lpthread i assume i can replace them with just g++ -pthread looking at man gcc it sets the flags for both preprocessor and linker

875801
daemons	systemd
but there s a tool called tcpwrappers which many systemd daemons also use - you know those hosts.allow hosts.deny files in your etc folder - they are part of tcpwrappers and can archive the exact scenario you described

875816
hash	md5
the md5 hash of wolfram alpha no quotes is

875886
width	height
in my flex project all width and height properties returns as zero

875915
hudson	phpundercontrol
after working for a long time with phpundercontrol we finally decided to switch to the hudson ci server

875971
uiview	subviews
what is happening is that when uitableviewcell shows the reorder control it also adds an empty 1 pixel wide white uiview to its array of subviews

875985
elementtree	beautifulsoup
invalid user submitted html content for example would need to be forced clean using something like beautifulsoup or elementtree

876048
put	get
note although when writing the question i didn t get any references to this question the current side-bar points it out so i ll put it here for reference either way the question is different but might be useful

876091
getter	setter
jpa entities being just java beans classes defining getter and setter with optional supporting code constructors hashcode equals named queries copy methods what else

876094
move	drag
however if user brings up right click menu by clicking on an area of the listview where there is no listitem showing below the last listitem then click the menu item the non-modal form shows up but the cursor seems to be stuck in a left button mouse down state in the listview the non-modal form is at the front but when i move the mouse it makes those drag area rectangles in the background listview as if the mouse button is being held down

876161
hash	md5
another method that would also shorten the string would be to calculate the md5 sha1 hash of the string concatenated with a seed if you wished

876166
implements	extends
if your object extends nsobject all you need to do i believe is to implements these example for person object

876166
nscoder	nsobject	implements	extends
they will serialize all the objects that they hold if objects implements nscoder interface - they do if they extends nsobject

876173
actionscript	haxe
i think you re referring to haxe which is an open source programming language very similar to actionscript

876214
svm	k-means
in map-reduce for machine learning on multicore chu et al describe algorithms that fit the statistical query model can be written in a certain â œsummation form â which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. they specifically implement 10 algorithms including weighted linear regression k-means naive bayes and svm using a map-reduce framework

876215
draggable	droppable
from what i ve seen about jquery apparently there is a way to make an element on my webpage draggable droppable or what have you

876218
appkit	nsapplication
appkit 0x95229630 nsapplication nexteventmatchingmask untildate inmode dequeue

876218
appkit	nsapplication
appkit 0x9522266b nsapplication run

876223
int	chars
also the sizeof operator tells you the size of an object type in terms of the number of chars s not the number of bytes octets so if you were on some weird system with a 16-bit chars and a 32-bit int then sizeof int would be 2 not 4

876229
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
provide the following operations insert remove inorder traversal preorder traversal postorder traversal

876239
stdout	stderr
to redirect both stdout and stderr to a truncated file i know to use

876239
stdout	stderr
how do i redirect both stdout and stderr appending to a file

876242
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to where stdout is currently going

876247
typedef	struct
you seem to have forgotten to typedef the type m_data that you re using in the various methods and i don t understand why you want a separate tree_node struct rather than using the class itself

876268
firefox	safari
this is the case with both firefox and safari

876286
lisp	scheme
scheme is also known to be able to handle this situation as well as give a tremendous advantage over your competition but scheme runs only on lisp machines

876297
post	get
when you post that this is what you ll get in php

876319
hid	keyboard
i have a small usb unitech barcode scanner which when plugged into the usb port works like a keyboard and the system both linux and win32 see it as a hid

876397
hash	salt
the usual way to store password is to use a hash function on the password but to salt it beforehand

876397
hash	salt
when checking if a given password matches a user you should concatenate the salt to the given password and calculate the hash function of the result string

876545
getter	setter
another solution which does not require static imports would be to create a complete applicationsettings class with fields getter and setter and pass an instance of this class to the constructor of the class that needs the parameters

876552
fadein	fadeout
i changed the fadein and fadeout to fadeto between 0.01 and 1.0

876553
allocator	stl
i understand that its not possible to call this function from c# using pinvoke because there is no way to marshall the stl string but my problem is that i cannot even write a wrapper without allocator a new array becuase the std string returned is not on the heap

876607
inherited	properties
the avm1movie object can use methods and properties inherited from the displayobject class such as x y width and so on

876632
int	double
i am interested in finding out what the best null alternatives are for the following data types in particular double float decimal datetime int long although others are more than welcome

876634
cvs	rcs
cvs is only a wrapper around rcs which runs the rcs commands over many files in a directory subtree rcs can only work on single files

876634
cvs	rcs
since cvs is based on rcs it can t version directories nor can it track renames

876634
cvs	rcs
cvs and rcs use the standard diff 1 command to create the diffs

876639
getter	setter
in objective-c the property and synthesize keywords automatically create the getter and setter methods for you

876674
config	ini
right now i would store the default currency code in an xml config file an ini file or the windows registry

876676
sorting	filtering
the collectionviewsource class can add sorting and filtering to any wpf items control

876680
switching	screens
i m in the process of switching from multiple tabs in iterm to one gnu screens session

876694
pthreads	fork
after all you will learn all you need to know about fork if you use pthreads anyway

876695
ubuntu	linux
how to set up a subversion svn server on gnu linux - ubuntu

876708
pascal	delphi
doesn t sound scary until you change installation to use innosetup which uses a pascal delphi

876748
post	get
but you could post a new request to the server and add post or get peremeters

876751
innodb	myisam
switch to myisam database instead of innodb and use full-text search on this column

876774
pascal	delphi
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable

post	get
the most common way to do this is to use php and jquery s post get ajax features to call on a page that has the php code used to insert into the database

876851
min	max
max - min + 1

876859
addition	multiplication
can the compiler make the multiplication happen on one core and the addition happen on a different core and therefore make 2 cores work at the same time

876877
post	get
can you post the code your running to get that output

876895
rss	feed
iirc trac let lets you get rss feed for each person so you can have a feed of things assigned to you

876945
filtering	grouping
select settings under filtering keys grouping in here you can switch off repeating keys for that user on that machine

877027
chown	chgrp
in that case you ll have to handle it with more chown and chgrp function calls

877052
listview	gridview
i want to have a combobox in the header cells of my gridview currently inside of a listview populated with the data from that column

877087
cvs	svn
vim 7 plugin useful for manipulating files controlled by cvs svn svk and git within vim including committing changes and performing diffs using the vimdiff system

877106
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
either write a class that implements runnable and pass whatever you need in a suitably defined constructor or write a class that extends thread with a suitably defined constructor that calls super with appropriate parameters

877115
implements	extends
you have a class that extends thread or implements runnable and a constructor with the parameters you d like to pass

877189
put	get
you could probably put a thread.sleep 15000 at the start of your main to get 15 seconds in which to connect to the application and start the profiling

877208
serializable	deserialization
if you have an object tree where there are no backwards links serializable and deserialization is simple

877208
serializable	deserialization
with a general graph the deserialization process needs to keep track of the identity of each object and use some form of mark-and-sweep algorithm to ensure that objects aren t de serializable twice

877224
rss	feed
if you wish you can subscribe to teamdev s rss feed

877254
jquery	nyromodal
im using the nyromodal plugin for jquery within an asp.net 3.5 webforms app

877254
post	get
my question is this how do i use jquery.ajax if this is not a post method but rather a get method from how i understand it

877292
ssl	https
note https support is only available if the socket module was compiled with ssl support

877299
i2c	spi
regarding spi i2c etc i haven t implemented any of them

877327
pascal	delphi
you can mix delphi pascal code with c++ code in the same project

877328
hide	show
i have tried to use the hide and show with no luck either

877330
int	chars
a lot of system types can be defined this way int chars string datetime etc

877334
jms	jta
generally speaking application server gives the administrator great tools to manage java ee resources data sources jms connection factories jms destinations jta transaction manager etc

877376
width	height
i m trying to limit the minimum height and width of a chrome xul window

877401
int	chars
the second parameter declared an int is cast to an unsigned chars

877515
ssl	https
ist of all the one thing i would like to point out here security.mode transport is used in case if your targeted service is hosted on https ssl which is not the case with your specified url

877527
ubuntu	linux
how would your determine a max value to set an alarm on the i o activity of a ubuntu linux server hosting upto 4 sites running apache mysql and upto 4 tomcats

877541
width	height
with this optimal size i then check to see how many whole tiles i can fit into the width height

877610
ubuntu	linux
how would your determine a max value to set an alarm on the i o activity of a ubuntu linux server hosting upto 4 sites running apache mysql and upto 4 tomcats

877614
width	height
in particular getscreendevices returns an array of graphicsdevice objects from which you can read the width height of the display mode

877628
hash	salt
do not store the passwords at all - just salt hash of them

877651
hide	show
they have their place but more often i choose a suitable maximum number of allowed controls put them all on the page initially and only enable disable hide show them as needed

877652
istream	getline
now i want to copy the contents of the streambuf into a string but it apparently only supports writing to char sgetn creating an istream with the streambuf and using getline

877655
int	double
you must implement a single method returning a type compatible with all of the implemented overridden methods in this case number int double etc

877692
int	double
the commented out case of methodb being implemented as returning a double however would not work while it would satisfy the contract of interfacea it would conflict with interfaceb which demands an int

877716
put	get
get and put in my applications

877726
pascal	delphi
owl mfc activex vb3 4 5 6 vb.net pascal delphi c c++ c#

877727
post	get
or this problem only happens for get and not for post

877735
int	double
double are there then int double int will get value 0

877757
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	keydown	keyup
the only things you can really rely on are keydown events and even then not so much in opera and firefox -- safari and ie both provide keydown events during ime composition with a charcode of 229 and a keyup event with a charcode corresponding to the actual key that was pressed

877757
google-chrome	safari
there is a textinput event but that is only supported by safari and by proxy google-chrome should support it as well but it s not substantially better than standard events anyway -

877784
min	max
apply max flow and or min cut will give you a set of transfers

877808
content-disposition	content-type
if the problem is the batch file is being displayed in the browser you need to set content-type and content-disposition in the http header so the user is prompted to save or run the file rather than have the browser display it

877813
width	height
you probably want to use block elements for menus because the box sizing makes it simpler to even the height and optionally the width of the menu elements - inline elements can leave you with variable height and widths - simplifying the situation greatly

877823
imperative	declarative
i suspect you re trying to do imperative things in declarative land which means you think in terms of steps

877825
lisp	scheme
i don t know what your specific problems with xaml are and i haven t used it myself but i ve found that when using xml based technologies like xslt a little lisp or scheme experience can go a long way

877826
rss	feed
i am busy writing a simple adobe air app using html jquery and some jquery plugin to load rss feed

877828
touchesbegan	touchesended
what s even stranger is if i take the touchesbegan and touchesended out of stone.m but leave userinteractionenabled yes the beachview registers both touches itself but returns the stone as the view it touched the second time

877844
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
next to #region blocks i would say the asp.net idatasource implementations sqldatasource linqdatasource that force allow you to write data-access code directly into your aspx pages

877931
mouse	keyboard
glovepie - advanced input scripting mouse keyboard game controllers

877949
maven	pom.xml
i don t understand why datanucleus required maven to download datanucleus-core-1.1.3.jar since this is not referenced in the pom.xml

877964
addition	multiplication
although you might get away with a numeric support class which would provide addition and multiplication of the various boxed number types the amount of complexity you save will be very little compared with providing two or three primitive matrices and a couple of big-number ones particularly if you use a templating system eg ant s replace task or xslt to generate the source code

877969
post	get
without knowing all of the details and assuming you implemented the restful services properly your urlrequest might be calling the service with the wrong method post rather than get

877970
subtraction	addition
even if you solve this how are you planning on solving addition subtraction etc

877970
addition	multiplication
zero can be defined as the identity in addition or a zero in multiplication but without a generic definition of addition or multiplication a generic definition of zero is unlikely

878125
gridview	onclientclick
so i wanted to attempt to set the gridview s button s onclientclick event to be the onclientclickevent of that hidden button

878232
try-catch	exception-handling
could someone explain to me why it is considered inapropriate to have a try-catch in the main method to catch any unhandled exception-handling

878238
profiler	aqtime
however maybe you can try to find your leaks with a profiler like aqtime instead

878257
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
javascript has getelementsbytagname and getelementbyid not to mention jquery

878264
try-catch	exception-handling
saying this if you have utilised exception-handling handling properly in a fine-grained and task-specific manner in the rest of your program and handled the errors accordingly there rather than juist displaying a generic error box then a general try-catch for all exception-handling in the main method is probably a useful thing to have

878264
try-catch	exception-handling
one point to note here is that if you re reproducably getting bugs caught in this main try-catch then you either have a bug or something is wrong with your localised exception-handling handling

878359
addition	multiplication
there is no real good guarantee that the i values of the two threads are the same at the same time after all multiplication and addition probably will take different amount of times to execute and that means that one thread may need to wait for another for the i values to get in sync before comparing the a and b that corresponds to the dependent value i

878409
post	get
however i can t figure out how to actually get the utility - the attachment on that post seems to not actually be there

878479
switching	screens
i guess it prevents code that would exit the full screens if there s a switching to another window from working ever

878486
dictionary	map
the tree map design pattern python folks would call it an ordered dictionary is one variation of this design pattern

878486
dictionary	map
the hash map design pattern python folks would call it a dictionary is another variation of this design pattern

878506
swt	swing
we implemented this functionality by embedding a batik swing canvas into an swt composite see here

878600
jobs	cron
does crontab have an argument for creating cron jobs without using the editor crontab -e

878645
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

878649
folder	directory
from a directory that only had folder in it

878685
folder	directory
from a directory where there are no files only folder and in fact the folder needed are imported right after

878779
post	get
we have forums on our website and daily we get 1000 s of attempts to post spam

878849
folder	directory
if you are worried about having too much to process you could try a sparse checkout with only the folder you need and then you could just commit the base directory or the subdirectories as needed without the overhead of the other projects

878981
post	get
also there are two common ways to send the data through post in the http header and through get as part of the query string the part after the question mark in a url

878981
post	get
example google search queries are sent using get but to log in to your gmail account post is used

878995
accessor	properties
obj-c 2.0 lets me declare properties in a category but the compiler refuses to synthesize accessor inside the category

879002
post	get	post	put	put	get
why don t i have to put a form tag on my page to get it to post back

879006
unsigned	short
unsigned short x

879034
set	bag
in this case you d mark the nodes and edges as being unordered which relates to a bag or set and unique which narrows it down to being a set

879049
glut	sdl
glut or sdl smfl etc does that work for you in a nice platform independent way

879109
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am using jquery 1.3.2 and the code that follows works wonderfully on firefox safari and google-chrome

879186
disk	ram
fundamentally i difference between a mmdb and a oodb is that the mmdb has the expectation that all of its data is based in ram but persisted to disk at some point

879186
disk	ram
in this way an oodb can be slower even if the entire db fits in to ram and is properly cached simply because you incur disk operations outside of the log operations during normal operations vs a mmdb where these operations happen as a maintenance task which can be scheduled during down time and or quiet time

879200
folder	directory
you can copy the files into an appropriately named subdirectory directory of the data folder as long as it is the exact same version of mysql and you have retained all of the associated files in that directory

879201
colt	jama
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt

879201
colt	jama
jama doesn t support a fraction of the things colt can do which make make more of a difference

879235
ethernet	wireless
jitter will begin to shoot through the roof as some packets have to be queued or retransmitted collisions on half-duplex ethernet or wireless

879250
for-loop	loops
i know how to picture while loops but is this acceptable to represent for-loop using while and at this point make difference between souce code and algorithm

879266
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
asp.net asp.net-mvc can generate html elements using html helpers for example html.actionlink html.beginform and so on

879285
freebsd	linux
this library works transparently with big- and little-endian elf files and runs just fine under linux despite its freebsd origins the usual . configure and make sequence is all you ll need to build it

879285
x86	mips
for grins i tried the reading a program header table example with minor modifications to get it to build on an x86 core file as well as a mips big-endian core file it appears to just work

879288
folder	dir
set svn ignore property on the root dir to ignore unneeded folder and never commit the root dir

879290
int	boolean
where b is a boolean and a is an int

879306
hash	md5
the hash algorithm like md5 takes a table of bytes of arbitrary length and converts it to a table of bytes of known length - the operation is not easily reversible and small changes to the input table cause unpredictable changes in the output table

879306
hash	salt
by introducing small changes in the input the results are change drastically so even if attacker knows the hash result and the salt it is very difficult to guess the input

879306
salt	md5
input + salt md5 output

879306
hash	salt
salting is not necessary here because you would have to publish the salt with the resulting hash so that the user can repeat the hashing operation

879380
linfu	spring.net
aye in the ioc world most tools spring.net castle windsor even linfu have methods that can take care of that for you so you define it one in a config and every time you get a copy from the container or whatever it comes preconfigured

879388
int	boolean
valid type arguments are any array boolean date numeric query string struct uuid guid binary int float eurodate time creditcard email ssn telephone zipcode url regex range component or variablename

879446
division	modulo
each time through the loop the modulo takes the last digit by returning the remainder from division by 10

879471
int	double
since you want it to take an int and return a double

879476
int	double
in this case you d have to make the functor the operator to return double and take an int as a parameter

879542
sorting	filtering
this is not a good idea for a number of reasons but for now let s just say that we should let databases perform a job they are really good at and that is filtering and sorting data

879558
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
the datavaluefield is common across checkboxlist radiobuttonlist listcontrol etc

879653
inherited	properties
there s no reason to duplicate methods and properties in an interface if you can inherited in this fashion

879672
post	put
also for the post you could append the id to the url and put the other params in json

879675
hide	show
depending on which row is clicked i want to show hide an accordion panel

879730
sharepoint	splist	spweb	splist
this usally occurs if i ask sharepoint to open an spweb or a splist that does not exist

879774
serializable	deserialization
edit found an excellent article on serializable and deserialization using datacontractserializer here

879802
folder	directory
for example if you create a group in in the project at the root of the project named foo this creates a reference to a container foo that is managed by the project settings it does not create a folder named foo in the root directory where your applications exists in the file system

879834
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
all source control systems i know at least perforce svn cvs have a server component and a protocol of their own

879842
hide	show
if the value entered into the text field is not available in the select list show the add button and hide the remove button

879842
hide	show
if the value entered into the text field is available in the select list hide the add button and show the remove button

879842
hide	show
if the select list is empty show the add button and hide the remove button

879859
ant	maven
i would like to try using maven from ant for exaple to build my java se apps that needs all dependencies stored in or just because doing anything short of dependency management in maven is too damn hard

879869
cruisecontrol	luntbuild
we use luntbuild and are quite happy other alternatives exist as well cruisecontrol hudson quickbuild

879874
ant	maven
you might find the maven ant tasks useful

879931
terminate	timeout
if the read fails due to timeout you can then safely terminate the proxy without risking the health of your application

879943
post	get
that generates a get request instead of the post request generated by the jquery .post method -- but the action method parameters should be populated nonetheless

879950
opera	firefox
you can try various browsers in some order -- firefox opera etc etc

879973
public	protected
wire the timer s elapsed event to a public or protected internal tick event

879974
squeak	visualworks
it also depends of smalltalk dialect - in visualworks for instance tools supports overrides quite well while in squeak not so

879976
stdout	stderr
file descriptor 0 is stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

879989
firefox	safari
these images are not displayed in ie6 but are displayed in firefox safari etc.

880036
min	max
this page contains the following also validates against developer-provided constraints like min max valid days of the week etc.

880050
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
how about creating your own subclass of propertyplaceholderconfigurer that would keep a reference to the its properties object and provide an accessor

880062
width	height
i m trying to write a regex expression to match the src width and height attributes on an image tag

880062
width	height
the width and height are optional

880066
post	get
as an alternative consider refactoring the rendering part into a separate auxiliary method def _render self and just ending both the get and post methods with a call to self.render

880081
put	get
i ve tried adding a runat server attribuite to each asp linkbutton tag but i get a runtime exception that controls can only be put inside a form tag with the runat server attribute

880084
folder	directory
i m guessing you ll need to create some symbolic links aliases in your root directory to the public folder of each application

880115
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
with asp.net asp.net-mvc you should use html.actionlink ... helper methods and the like

880116
tolower	toupper
noted that the entity framework recognizes toupper tolower and contains and some more - so i was to strict when i said that the entity framework does not recognize method calls

880116
tolower	toupper
further this query translates into charindex function calls using the collation of the column hence the search can be case insensitive without explicit toupper or tolower calls

880141
hash	md5
my current thought is to use a string with something like an md5 hash of the type name and member types and names

880173
profiling	benchmarking
i m with chas benchmarking and profiling your code first

880181
folder	directory
turns out you just plant the editors directory tree into your primary working folder or wherever and edit the include functions php to link the editor files to your own project files

880190
packets	pcap
pcap_sendqueue_queue - to add raw packets to the queue in pcap format

880217
children	parent
given the above tables i need to identify the parent whose children have the same records in column2 as parent s1 does

880221
versioning	upgrade
the remote versioning will be upgrade to 2005 and i am wondering if the dts packages we have in place will continue to function between the two machines

880304
hash	salt
when the user creates their password you want to create a hash of that password with some salt and store the hash

880310
postgresql	mysql
move to a real database such as postgresql or mysql

880319
sin	sqrt
if you successfully read a string pass that to a function name parser that uses string compares to generate a token that represents a call to sqrt or sin or whatever function you like

880359
profiling	benchmarking
if it is profiling your code and benchmarking your changes

880381
tabcontrol	tabitem
now i d like to specify that a given tabcontrol should add new items using closeabletabitem instead of tabitem

880391
post	get	post	put	put	get
i have the redirect working but the problem is that if i do a post put delete firebug shows my requests going to the test rig properly but i get a 301 redirect response and then a 2nd get response

880442
children	parent
nb based on matt s comment if one of your parent values was known you just wanted to list all the parent values with the same children as s1 then you can just slap and p1.column1 s1 on the end of this

880463
int	boolean
i m using a database with generic data strings int boolean etc...

880473
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
i thought a map of strings to function pointers might be a concise way to represent things like sqrt sin cos etc that take a single double and return a double

880517
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

880527
pascal	delphi
if you must use native code then i would strongly suggest rad studio from codegear embarcadero it s a studio product that ships with delphi the object oriented language that evolved from turbo pascal and c++ builder if you are already familiar with c c++ then it s going to be very simple for you to pick it up

880562
cvs	svn
if you re looking for free alternatives or if you code in other languages other than php openkomodo is a really nice ide with almost all the features no svn neither cvs that you require the only con i see about openkomodo is that sometimes it messes my code indentation but then again i don t use it on a very regular basis

880570
udp	tcp
i used tcp in one project udp in the other one

880612
gtk	cairo
_why has written shoes mostly on top of cairo which is what recent versions of gtk use for widget drawing also so it appears he purposely stepped back to the core of ui design and created a different framework from the ground up for a solidly different reason than one would use gtk for

880635
mouse	trackpad
on my trackpad your code works perfectly fine but i guess thats because it s awfully hard to move the mouse between clicks

880673
post	get
i am making a new wordpress template and i want to just get in text format the list of tags associated with a post

880673
post	get
is there any way to just get the text of tags attached to a post seperated by a comma

880680
imap	nntp
since you noted that the isp requires authentication via pop-before-smtp you should look into using something like php mailer which can facilitate this kind of interaction - or roll your own using the php functions for pop which happen to be exactly the same as the ones for imap and nntp

880684
filtering	grouping
it gives you filtering by staff status and superuser status but what about grouping

880698
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup is good but not super-fast and i believe lxml can offer the same quality but often better performance

880713
vim	emacs
what vim features did you miss in emacs and more importantly how did you get them back

880734
ilist	iqueryable
one last thing following is the code i used in aspx to retrieve the data in case of making the result tolist i change iqueryable to ilist

880758
lxml	elementtree	lxml	beautifulsoup	elementtree	beautifulsoup
if you want a faster option then use try catch to attempt an lxml or elementtree parse first then try beautifulsoup and or tidylib to parse broken html if the parser fails

880821
lxml	beautifulsoup
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

880825
post	get
i am using this code to get the tags in my wordpress post for a theme

880833
uiswitch	uibutton
uibutton doesn t do that and uiswitch is hideously ugly for all but the most utilitarian views

880955
firefox	safari
tested and working in ie8 firefox and safari win

880966
sorting	filtering
alternatively find a plug-in that has sorting accomplished but also generates simple markup so you can extend it with your own filtering

881011
factories	presenter
other frameworks that would do this include the patterns and practices web client software factories which offers a model view presenter approach

881045
mockups	balsamiq
in sketching or mockups tools such as balsamiq and wireframesketcher comic sans is used to give that sketchy hand drawn look

pull	push
pull all commits from a branch push specified commits to another where

881128
post	get
i m not sure why you would get such an error when you attempt to call a method via reflection but a little googling came up with this forum post among others

881143
interpolation	splines
i have a nice cubic splines code but it is for interpolation only

881144

881161
submit	submission
while submission the form check if atleast one or more values have changed and then submit the form

881185
cvs	svn
i ve not tried this myself but friends have reported good success converting first from cvs to svn and then from svn to git

881187
button	checkbox
as pointed out in the comments this would allow the user to deselect all checkbox even if they chose one initially which isn t exactly like radio button

881188
button	checkbox
it has been designed this way and from a user perspective radio button mean select one and checkbox mean select many

881188
button	checkbox
user interfaces work because the metaphors used checkbox button the shape of the mouse pointer colors etc. are and behave a certain way

881211
interpolation	splines
generally for splines interpolation you use a variable t to interpolation over the line

881218
pull	push
subversion and git are both free and have a variety of different ways that you can connect and push pull checkin checkout data

881249
interpolation	splines
splines are usually used for interpolation of some unknown or complex function by using of some fixed data set

881249
interpolation	splines
if you want to have ability to evaluate your splines outside of interpolation range but leave it as piecewise-cubic function with the same values inside of interpolation range then you should extend splines range by some nodes and add some logic of evaluation values at the new nodes for example you want to have your splines be not only a continuous function but also have some number of first derivatives be also continuous functions

881271
opensplice	opendds
for example opensplice and opendds are both implementations of the omg data distribution service standard

881275
put	get
i ll pass this onto the team and see if we can get some more examples put online around this space

881292
datagridview	tablelayoutpanel
rather than use a datagridview how about using a tablelayoutpanel instead

881294
inherited	properties
all my controllers in my project inherited from a base controller which has a properties with my entity model

the htmlhelper function really shouldn t know about the properties of your base controller - what if someone were to ever use it on a controller that doesn t inherited from your base

881415
daemons	systemd
according to advanced programming in the unix environment by stephens and rago the second fork is more a recommendation and it is done to guarantee that the daemons does not acquire a controlling terminal on systemd v-based systemd

881435
children	parent
the result is that the parent process doesn t need to be aware of the forked children and it also makes it possible to fork long running processes from libs etc

881452
put	get
i then put these extracted folders in to another folder and zip it back and rechange the extension to the previous xlsm format i now try and open but i get an unreadable error

881456
post	get
assuming you have some magic way to get from a to an i d be interested in reading that blog post if you can cite it - then the closest you can do is probably something like

881483
folder	directory
if for some reason your breakpoints are not hit then go and delete your bin obj directory and also your mobile deployment folder some times vs gets stucked.

881554
getter	setter
you can then generate accessor getter setter methods by using synthesize

881554
getter	setter
important if you do not specify either synthesize or dynamic for a particular property you must provide a getter and setter or just a getter in the case of a readonly property method implementation for that property.

881636
equals	gethashcode
there s no simple way for a single lambda to express the information needed for both equals and gethashcode

881636
equals	gethashcode
and if you provide a gethashcode that returns different hashes for equals elements that will cause incorrect behavior

881661
outputstream	inputstream
where output is some outputstream where the encrypted data will be saved and input is some inputstream where the plaintext data will be read

881682
installation	upgrade
you should put all of your own plugins into vimfiles to make sure that when you upgrade your vim installation you don t lose any of the custom plugins or modifications

881682
versioning	upgrade
if you were to instead change vim72 syntax cpp.vim when you next upgrade vim these files would be overwritten by the new versioning and any changes that you made would be lost

881690
post	get
you could do this using the ajax method either post or get

881696
ubuntu	linux
this is on linux ubuntu 8.10 server

881717
gridview	sqldatasource
the page contains a gridview with a sqldatasource connected to an oracle database

881717
cassini	iis
when i run the page in the vs debugger cassini webserver everything works fine but when i publish the application to my local iis server same machine i get the following error

881722
stdout	stderr
redirects the stdout and stderr etc

881722
pop-up	dialog
netbeans pop-up this little dialog and asks you to send in your report

881757
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
also something that is portable across unixes solaris hp ibm freebsd and linux and if i am not asking too much or it if does make sense all linux flavors

881772
post	get
if we re talking about web service as just a technology then you have a lot of options you can use http get this is the one using url params or http post the data is in the body of the http message

881786
children	parent
it looks like you are only adding children to the first parent

881807
opera	safari
pushing an eventqueue and checking through events doesn t work of opera and safari apparently

881815
pascal	delphi
icarus parses delphi or borland pascal source code and generates a uses report

881864
opera	firefox
firefox and opera should not be limited

881884
getter	setter
i have a dsl java object a pojo which returns this in setter plus the getter setter have an unusual naming pattern

881884
getter	setter
is it possible to tell jpa to use name string and name as the setter getter method

881927
firefox	safari
this works pretty well on firefox ie7 safari etc .

882006
solaris	aix
there are no significant differences between the linux solaris and aix distributions whereas porting shell scripts between these platforms is a real pain

882041
daemon	cron
crontabs are files read by the cron daemon

882057
stdout	stderr
you might use the fact that stderr is never buffered and try to redirect stdout to stderr

882100
int	double
i couldn t figure out what use some of the functions in the convert class had such as convert.todouble int convert.toint double until i combined them with array.convertall

882156
icomparable	compareto
i thought that it was only necessary to implement compareto when implementing icomparable msdn itself confirms this

882156
icomparable	compareto
the class is not implementing icomparable but and does impliment compareto as strongly typed

882167
dictionary	map
i m trying to map a dictionary containing lists

882175
post	get
i will post its code as soon as i get it

882234
post	get
you still have some work to do to understand it but if you post your own attempts you ll get a lot more help

882266
getter	setter
i don t think you can tell jpa which naming convention to use for getter and setter since it s a basic java beans concept

882318
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
if you return collections or instance and if you choose ienumerable iqueryable ilist list or whatever depends on your needs

882329
ant	maven
jax-ws and jax-b both come with ant tasks and or maven 2 plug-ins that are easy to use in your builds

882361
serializable	deserialization
from the db i read characters x10 and x11 triangular shapes and i want to convert them to the unicode format in order to prevent serializable deserialization problem during wcf call

882374
post	get
if you enable ipn post in the paypal settings you will get a notification with transaction status

882380
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
the openfiledialog and savefiledialog can change it for example and then you d fail to find your .dot file

882485
gridview	repeater
i want a repeater inside a gridview row

882485
gridview	repeater
so how can i assign the datasource of the repeater so that the data it uses is that of the specific data of the gridview row

882491
versioning	upgrade
is there a newer versioning of perl you can upgrade to

882524
int	double	int	chars
data d d f3 int f2 double f1 chars deriving show

882558
button	checkbox
note that nowhere does anything beyond the ui interface knows about button checkbox and the like

882572
launch4j	jsmooth
if you want a no fuss way for the end user to kick off a program with multiple jar dependencies you may want to look at launch4j or jsmooth i prefer launch4j

882605
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
how to check if specific web browser google-chrome firefox opera is installed on system

882675
button	checkbox
clicking on checkbox or button doesn t do anything

882706
borderless	panel
the window is borderless and set to the exact size of the panel for all intents and purposes it is as if the panel is free floating

882729
children	parent
with a rdbms you just have a table of terms which have parent and children ids

882785
stdout	stderr
after calling start you ll get a process object from which you can get the stderr and stdout streams

882785
stdout	stderr
especially the ability to redirect stderr to stdout which means you only have to suck down one stream

882788
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn	bazaar	rcs	cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
bazaar bazaar cvs git hg mercurial rcs scm svn subversion vcs scm vcs popularity survey statistics

882808
put	get
you can these use getinputstream to get the stdout of this process and put this input stream into a string through a stringbuffer for example

882824
boost	stl
try stl boost and loki for a start

882850
folder	directory
if i have a regular console application or any other application for that matter and drag a file onto the .exe file using windows explorer in order to use the file as command-line-input the current directory is set to some other directory my home folder

882850
folder	directory
is there a way to use the application s folder as the current directory

882916
action-filter	onactionexecuting
problem the action-filter onactionexecuting method is called after the one in basecontroller and not before

882916
action-filter	onactionexecuting
will action-filter always be called before overridden onactionexecuting in base controllers and is there a way to get around this

882926
integer	unsigned
i ve written this piece of code where i ve assigned an unsigned integer to two different structs

882930
rss	feed
subscribe to their rss feed and see what those colouring-in people get up to

882949
hide	show
you can use a javascript library to show hide that html based on if a user as silverlight installed

882954
integer	radix
my initial approach i converted each integer to its string format then added zeros to its right to make all the integers contain the same number of digits this was the messy step as it involved tracking etc making the solution very inefficient and then did radix sort

882978
graphics2d	bufferedimage
you can create a bufferedimage call creategraphics in case a graphics2d is expected and pass the result to the paint graphics method of the component that you want to capture

883000
int	chars
so in the first case the struct with the packed attribute there is an extra byte between the chars 3 and the int to align the int on a four byte boundary

883082
implements	extends
one convenient possibility is for a custom renderer to extends jcomponent and implements tablecellrenderer then in tablecellrenderer.gettablecellrenderercomponent you store the cell s state and return this

883131
stateless	stateful
what happens if an ejb3 stateless stateful bean no args constructor throws an exception

883177
imagemagick	libtiff
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker

883289
serializable	deserialization
in need to serializable an object and it s possible that the assembly version changed while deserialization

883293
lotus	sametime
a lotus notes installation domino 7x which ends up trying to start a ibm sametime 7.5.1 chat client fails on some machines

883355
post	get
it puts the command or for the sessionattributes any object in the session for the duration between the first and the last request most of the time the initial get and the final post

883367
int	double
however it is possible to perform typecasts so it is possible to cast a int type which are int values to a double type a floating type value

883376
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i don t know cruisecontrol since we re using teamcity but cruisecontrol should be able to perform a command line build just call make

883376
cruisecontrol	teamcity
oh and if cruisecontrol does not support a command line runner or project types other than java you should have a look at teamcity as a replacement

883411
hash	md5
then you hash that say with md5 though you might want to use sha256 to be more secure to get 593d5518d759b4860188158ef4c71f28

883411
hash	salt
when the user logs in append the random salt and then check if his entered password with the salt matches the hash in the database

883428
hash	salt
a salt is just a method that adds random bits onto a hash in order to complicate the process of cracking

883432
hash	salt
store the hash and the salt both as hex string base64 string or whatever you like in the database together with the user name and the other user information in the example the salt is just a plain string and the hash is base64 encoded

883432
hash	salt
firstname lastname salt hash

883432
hash	salt
if you want to verify the user password just take the user name look up the salt do the above again and see if the calculated hash and the one in the database match

883433
inherited	subclassing
for finer-grained testing of exceptions you need to roll your own with a try except else block you can do it once and for all in a def assertdetailedraises method you add to your own generic subclassing of unittest s test-case then have your test cases all inherited your subclassing instead of unittest s

883434
filtering	grouping
this should also address if a user applies a filtering on the report you may or may not have given them this option. on a field other than the grouping

883483
hash	md5
however there s one more problem and that s that generating md5 hash is fast

883483
hash	md5
so the next step is to find a slow hash function and use this instead of a fast one like md5

883490
hash	salt
a on account creation you get a username and password from the user you hash those together with your own salt and store the resultant string in your database like

883504
accessor	properties
doing magic in a properties accessor seems like my prerogative as a class designer

883504
accessor	properties
would db access code be acceptable within the normal expectations in a properties accessor

883510
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve built nib in interface builder that has uitabbarcontroller at top level and switches between uinavigationcontroller s

883519
hash	salt
secondly you should be salting every hash preferably with a different salt value

883519
hash	salt
i tend to hash the password hash the salt combine the two then hash again

883525
accessor	properties
a db read in a properties accessor would be fine - thats actually the whole point of lazy-loading

883530
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
accessors and mutators getter and setter are expected to be very light weight

883537
accessor	properties
it is just a good practice not to make properties accessor taking long time to execute

883539
width	height
the camera can see only a small portion of the world at a time about 5 width 100 height - the world is about 30 high by 1000 wide

883544
for-loop	arrays
even though arr is an empty arrays the for-loop assigns a valid value to i

883568
hide	show
i had issues with jquery and showing and hiding sliding table rows in the past in the end i had to get jquery to wrap the selected td in a div and then show hide that not nice i know but on a tight deadline it worked

883572
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in applicationdidfinishlaunching i initialize uiviewcontroller using xib s but then manually create uinavigationcontroller add navigation controller s view to window and push first view to navigation controller

883602
width	height
i do a lot of slicing in photoshop and it s tedious to manually write an tag for each of them -- writing in the filename checking height and width writing the alt tags etc

883616
width	height
first i want to commend you on having width and height information in an image

883643
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
first it looks like you have your uitabbaritem s under the navigation controllers instead of directly under the uitabbarcontroller

883657
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
considering maintainance cost options and performance which server plattaform can i decide for mysql hosting windows or unix linux ubuntu debian

883665
profiler	aqtime
did you use a profiler like aqtime to see where the bottle neck is

883686
vim	emacs
cross platform you d be looking at something like emacs or vim neither of which are particularly friendly

883687
int	boolean
there are a specific set of types i am looking for int boolean date string

883688
children	parent
my database has 7 tables one is the parent feeds and the other 3 are the children public feeds private feeds generated feeds of an isa relationship

883710
textmate	bbedit
on the mac side i have always been a fan of both bbedit and textmate but much more so of the latter especially given its lesser price tag and more modern feel

883710
textmate	notepad++
on windows i d stick with either e which is basically a port of textmate to windows or notepad++

883710
notepad++	scite
you could also look at scite but like notepad++ it has no project org features

883784
unistd.h	string.h
the inclusion of stdio.h string.h and unistd.h is omitted the colorization hides the header inclusion code

883808
hide	show
when you click on a new page link hide all div s except the one you need to show

883809
int	chars
are there some other chars which will be converted to int as well

883814
getter	setter
setter methods like that are sometimes explained in more detail in the getter method the introduction text in class documentation or one of the documentation companion guides you see linked on the bottom left

883833
dictionary	map
i am a c# developer and i don t fully unterstand your code but i would use a dictionary to map between the type of an object and something else - i assume you return a enum value

883852
mouse	keyboard
basically you are redirecting keyboard mouse input via the flex app and using it to display realtime 3d activity using a standard movie component

883855
hide	show
if trigger 1 hide or show target 1 or scrolls down to it this method would have the added benefit of still doing something if javascript was disabled

883866
bazaar	git
subversion makes that case challenging but other revision control systems such as git mercurial and bazaar make that case easy

883886
equals	compareto
you see compareto method sometimes returns 0 which should be consistent with using equals

883889
rss	feed
hello i am using libxml to parse an rss feed and i am wondering if is possible to access the content within using dot syntax or just as easy

883932
children	parent
you could use a view to pre-join the children to the parent and to get a consistent result regardless of which child type

883947
ant	cruisecontrol
our c++ projects use scons instead of make and we simply call scons from the cruisecontrol ant script via the exec ant task

883971
imperative	declarative
data-binding for all its wonders is declarative and harder to debug than nice imperative stuff where you just set breakpoints

883989
opera	firefox
of course a good text editor revision control and firebug in firefox or dragonfly in opera are also essential

884010
post	get
if you ve used the same type of solution on an earlier problem you can go through the post from other users on the earlier question to get ideas for solving the problem in different ways

884013
lisp	scheme
going further afield tcl tool command language lets you embed an interpreter in c c++ code there are many embeddable lisp and scheme interpreters etc

884019
post	get
for example to get a list of all text nodes that are children of a post node

884037
subtract	add
note that if the start day is a weekday add days to move to the previous monday and if it is on a weekend subtract days to move to the next monday since you already missed this weekend.

884078
accessor	properties
second one thing you should know is that the default model binder requires that any properties you wish to set be available via public accessor

884106
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
personally i would ignore the runtimeexception because an unchecked-exception signifies a bug in the program

884112
range	max	range	min	min	max
a slider that is with two knobs that define a range in the min max values rather than just one

884182
filewriter	bufferedwriter
the finally tries to close from the outside of any decorated stream first so if you had a bufferedwriter wrapping a filewriter we try to close the buffereredwriter first and if that fails still try to close the filewriter itself

884203
mouse	keyboard
it does not really make sense to stop execution of a window as the window only handles events that are sent to it like for example mouse keyboard or paint events and ignoring them would make the program appear hung

884225
post	get
sanitising post get variables from

884244
ioexception	bufferedwriter
whilst bufferedoutputstream closes even on an ioexception from flush bufferedwriter closes correctly

884247
pull	push
i need to host a mercurial repository on a server so that a number of people can access it to both pull changes and push their own work

884250
width	font-size	width	text-align	text-align	font-size
.sifr-root text-transform uppercase color #ffffff text-align right width 484px font-size 20px font-weight bold

884298
factors	mean
note that is not going to be the deciding factors in how your app performs but that doesn t mean you shouldn t save a little ram now and then where you know you can

884341
implements	extends
in this particular case you should follow wilums2 s advice and extends mouseadapter instead of implements mouselistener

884346
downcasting	upcasting
surely if you ve got an then you re downcasting rather than upcasting

884367
hash	salt
also be aware that sometimes the answer text is salt with a value before it is hash so the same steps would need to be taken when validating

884381
hash	md5
as you mentioned since the answer is hash you will need to md5 hash the user supplied values

884407
width	height
expanded event model when alpha visible width height scalex scaley x or y are changed an event is dispatched there is also the preinitialize initialize

884412
portrait	landscape
example the youtube app automatically goes to landscape to show a video and back to portrait to show the table view

884467
accessor	properties
they will avoid exposing public fields instead of exposing them through accessor or properties

884487
int	double	int	boolean
i dislike the fact that there is a differentiation between primitive native types int boolean double and their corresponding class-wrappers int boolean double in java

884562
exponent	modulo
you need to know the public exponent e often 65337 for rsa keys but other numbers such as 3 or 17 have been used and the modulo n which is the 512-bit number provided in the question

884599
min	max
if you don t know the order of the min max values

884600
firefox	safari
it works fine in safari but nothing appears in firefox

884624
pop-up	dialog
the solution was to open up the iis snap-in right-click and choose properties for the offending virtual directories and make up an application name under the virtual directory tab of the properties dialog that pop-up

884659
rational-numbers	base
in the special case where m are both powers of a common base or equivalently if log m p is a rational-numbers then m i will only have a few non-zero digits in base p near the front so we can safely output most of the digits we ve computed so far

884697
int	double
the problem here is that if both operands of an arithmetic operator are int then the operation is performed using int arithmetic even if it s part of a bigger expression which is of type double

884697
subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

884741
textinput	textfield
essentially what i m attempting to do here is re-implement tabbing by checking for the tab key on key_down event of each textfield and using that to move focus to the next textinput wrapping to the first textinput from the last

884808
maven	pom.xml
is there a maven client that isn t mvn the binary included with the maven distribution i could use to pull down an artifact from a maven repository without using a pom.xml

884845
apache	nginx
i am currently working on my wordpress blog which is hosted on a vps.net vps with nginx as front end to apache to serve static files while apache takes care of the php in fastcgi

884845
apache	nginx
this seems to be working great however i haven t yet managed to have nginx serve wp-supercache files as well which i would like for maximum performance i am not planning to completely replace apache with nginx right now because i ve got a virtualmin license and it does not support nginx

884845
apache	nginx
if apache is stopped in fact i can still get images stylesheets and javascript delivered to the browser by nginx directly

884845
apache	nginx
but if i try to surf the blog with pages cached for sure by wp-supercache with apache stopped all i get from nginx is a 502 bad gateway

884903
mouseup	mousedown
i would suggest changing to either the mousedown or mouseup event

884909
action-filter	onactionexecuting
in addition to what marwan aouida posted and suggested using an action-filter on the base class i don t think you re going to be able to create an action-filter that executes before the onactionexecuting overload on the base class

884951
hash	salt
edit the second wayne thoughtfully mentioned that you should salt your password before you hash

884955
hash	salt
edit always use salt for a locally stored hash

884955
hash	salt
windows continues to fail as far as brute forcing locally hash passwords because they do not salt by default

884969
hash	salt
on the server side you can do whatever you want with it preferrably hash and salt password before storing them in the database

885004
apache	nginx
it seems silly to run nginx through apache

885004
apache	nginx
set up nginx to serve up the php and dynamic pages itself and you ll have a much faster service and won t have the problem where apache dies and leaves your webserver nginx hanging

885007
mp3	wmv
you can use the ifilter interface which was design for windows desktop search there are already implementation of the interface for mp3 wmv jpeg

885123
nant	cruisecontrol
then simply get cruisecontrol to use your nant script

885127
inherited	properties
i would then inherited the propertygrid and override the onpropertyvaluechanged event in order to set the tag properties of the griditem to coincide with the pre-defined tagattribute

885135
postgresql	mysql
the first thing you need to decide is what dbms you will use mysql sql server oracle postgresql one of the object-oriented databases etc

885144
move	drag
i want users to be able to drag and move around the bg and finally they can generate final image

885166
postgresql	mysql
i d like to note that this does not happen on mysql only postgresql

885171
jruby	rubinius
also the jruby developers have indicated that they are willing to implement a rubinius bytecode emulator inside jruby if rubinius bytecode becomes a popular way of deploying ruby apps

885175
udp	tcp
regardless do the following for either your one udp socket or for each tcp client socket

885275
ant	emma
i have a problem with ant and emma a code coverage plugin it makes report but without source code

885285
listview	gridview
i have a listview with a gridview in it

885289
pull	push
i created a silverlight component and a wcf service both are communicating using a pollingduplexhttpbinding to enable push and pull functionality

885291
int	chars
i dont know a better way to check if the chars in the expression is an int without using this crude method or regular expressions

885311
serializable	deserialization
i m not aware of any projects to simplify the object serializable deserialization logic though if that was your question

885320
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	division	multiplying	subtract	subtraction	add	division	subtraction	division	subtract
for add multiplying the order of operands doesn t matter but for subtraction and division you should subtract and divide the first operand by the second

885338
wicket	smartgwt
when i combined google eclipse plugin smartgwt gwt 1.6.4 and wicket the gwt compiler would emit bad javascript

885386
stateless	stateful
you can expect to see the introduction of a flow model that compliments spring mvc s stateless controller model and allows stateful web flows to be defined as pojos

885411
nfa	dfa
build a basic finite automaton dfa nfa nfa-lambda for the language in the alphabet sigma 0 1 2 where the sum of the elements in the string is even and this sum is more than 3

885430
ssl	https
this would mean to install and enable the apache module for ssl encrypted http traffic port 433 https in the adress line of the browser and disable the standard http traffic for this directory on port 80

885523
inherited	subclassing
the different achievements are all subclassing of achievement model and use single table inherited so that they are stored in just one table

885562
vim	textmate
so my question finally is whether anyone has found an ide not textmate or vim that works with grails 1.1.x when the plugin folder is in it s default location under home .grails 1.1.x plugins

885577
filesystems	ntfs
with a modern journaling filesystems ext3 4 ntfs the only problem would be that a file could be in a half-written state

885598
cifs	smb
nfs with the right setup version and tuning is just a tad slower than smb cifs

885641
simpleadapter	listactivity
this listactivity uses a simpleadapter that i fill with items from my service

885708
persistent	transient
core data actually has explicit support for nsmanagedobject attributes that aren t persistent though â they re marked transient

885753
affinity	processors
you might also want to look into processors affinity to reduce cache thrashing

885879
implements	extends
i would argue that extends thread there was unnecessary and therefore implements runnable is preferred

885889
subtract	addition	multiplying	modulo	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	addition	addition	modulo
for example perhaps after every 6 addition operations the 7th addition returns the result multiplied by pi divided by the square root of the log of the modulo 5 of the difference of the total number of subtract and multiplying operations performed since system initialization

885897
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can add a view to an existing uiviewcontroller s view by using addsubview or by pushing a controller on to the uitabbarcontroller s view

885897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in the latter case the uitabbarcontroller must be have been a uinavigationcontroller with a rootviewcontroller

885897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this assumes you have a uinavigationcontroller as a view in your uitabbarcontroller and it s called navcontroller

885897
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you just want to add a uiview to the uiviewcontroller s view in the uitabbarcontroller overlay then you can just use addsubview as you ve already figured out no uinavigationcontroller necessary

885905
lisp	scheme
it s common lisp which is quite similar to scheme

885908
for-loop	loops
i set up a script that would run 1 000 000 000 for-loop iterations and the same number of while loops and record the time between

886020
floor	sqrt
but then i get errors when compiling because sqrt expects a floating a and floor expects a realfrac a instead of an integral a

886035
firefox	safari
note colspan is working in ie6 but not working in firefox 3 and safari i have not tested it into ie7

886059

subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
replace subtraction by addition and division by multiplication

886109
sum	floor
b k floor sum a i m i for i in 0 to p-1 n k mod n

886109
sum	floor
b k floor sum a i m i for i in z to p-1 + sum a i m i for i in 0 to z-1 n k mod n

886109
sum	floor
b k floor sum a i m i for i in z to p-1 n k mod n

sum	floor
b k floor sum a i m i for i in z to p-1 + m z - 1 n k mod n

886109
min	max
compute the min and max value for b k

886109
min	max
if the min and max are the same output b k and decrement k

886112
gina	winlogon
if you do want to replace the windows login dialog see winlogon and gina but this says gina dlls are ignored in windows vista and i haven t heard what s what for vista

886136
rank	max
while i think gbn s answer is probably sufficient i m wondering whether use of an over clause to establish a max date per id attribute with which to reduce the select in a where clause wouldn t be faster than a rank

886151
pop-up	dialog
it is possible to intercept crtl+alt+del though obviously microsoft made it very difficult to do because then you could pop-up a fake lock dialog and record people s passwords

886168
mouse	keyboard
screensavers can do more than just display pretty pictures - i ve seen interactive screensavers before that used the mouse and keyboard to provide a simple game though i can t remember which version of windows i saw this running on.

886207
int	double
using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable

886210
post	get
googling asp.net routing sitemap should get you there only just joined so so can t post link yet

886262
post	put
see this post where to put common writable application files

886273
elementtree	beautifulsoup
this looks like valid xml in that case you don t need beautifulsoup definitely not the regex just load xml using any good xml library edit it and print it out here is a approach using elementtree

886276
postgresql	mysql
to scale on the database side you can go pretty far with read slave in mysql postgresql if you go the rdbms way

886288
background-repeat	background-image
so you should set the image as the background-image of the parent div with background-repeat no-repeat

886328
getter	setter
when you have code in the header file for simple getter setter methods it s more or less just fine because you either want to save some working time because of code maintenance typing same method in header and implementation file or because you actually want the method to be inline due to function call overhead in time critical places

886338
hide	show
instead we have an asp.net listbox that controls the first parameter and when it s selection is changed we are using the reportviewer.serverreport.setparameters function to hide show parameters it takes in an array of reportparameter and the reportparameter constructor takes in a boolean to hide show the parameter

886338
hide	show
1 button hide the parameter and 1 button show the parameter using the setparameters function as mentioned above

886338
hide	show
even with this simple scenario the hide show buttons work fine in the development environment but we still have the same issue in the production environment the show button doesn t work

886345
getter	setter
i m not sure if this is exactly what you re asking but the best way to set the value of attributes or elements using xmlbeans is to use the xmlbeans-generated getter and setter

886350
versioning	upgrade
i ve read this line in vpatch s documentation --- if you want to be able to upgrade versioning 1 and 2 to versioning 3 you can put a 1 3 and 2 3 patch in one file. but how do i that

886351
rar	gzip	rar	zip	deb	dmg
7-zip can uncompress a wide variety of formats including 7z zip gzip bzip2 tar arj cab chm cpio deb dmg hfs iso lzh lzma msi nsis rar rpm udf wim xar and z

886356
submit	submission
the submission of the form is the default behavior for a button of type submit important in a form

886359
stdout	stderr
however in the python 2.6 version you can set this parameter to true if you don t redirect stdin stdout stderr

886379
noscript	meta
you should draw your script or noscript header as a page onto itself that then redirects either through a meta tag or through a script location.href to the next place you want to go based on if javascript is turned on

886401
post	put
anyway it is not a good idea to use http put or http post to upload large files

886460
rel	alt
p.s - i know about the â rel tagâ - but for the specific template i want to have the labels appear as text in the alt tags

886472
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
nsapplication nsviewcontroller nswindowcontroller uiapplication and uiviewcontroller all load nib files on your behalf

886490
ssl	https
https and ssl mutual authentication should be used for this because client already has at least corporate ca-signed certificate on its smart card stored

886490
ssl	https
when mutual ssl authentication is used instead just server authentication the client certificate is also verified by server not only the server s certificate by client which is more common set-up for https enabled e-commerce sites

886505
folder	directory
the outer folder is not a repo it s a work directory

886558
for-loop	arrays
since this could be easily checked for in the for-loop i think your problem lies in handling the result arrays

886586
ant	maven
you can do that in your build with ant or maven and in development in eclipse with the ajdt plugin

886647
put	get
the only downside is that the swf will get a lot larger so just put the settings back to mp3 or whatever before you export the final version

886681
hide	show
does anyone know of a way to trap show desktop so i can ensure my application stays visible i assume that windows enumerates all top-level windows and hide them with showwindow sw_hide

886690
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to know about the basic compatibility issues in the major browsers internet explorer google-chrome when compared to mozilla firefox such as

886738
ant	maven
i d second your factory approach and you should have a closer look at maven or ant depending on what you are using

886795
pop-up	dialog
i ve got a series of modalpopupextenders that i m using to implement pop-up dialog on an asp.net 2.0 page

886854
for-loop	loops
i know i can do this alot faster by using one for-loop to loops through the image data and set it right away

886885
folder	directory
now copy all the existing files and directory that you have been working on into the new myproj project folder you just created via checkout not the one in the repository

886906
short	base
the long and short of it all is that i need find the node base on itâ s position away from the current node

886915
int	double
as darin stated you should be always using trygetvalue - it makes the code easier to read to maintain and you won t get a keynotfoundexception and while your at it always use tryparse instead of parse for int double datetime whatever for the same reason

887001
inherited	properties
still you can hide the inherited properties with your s

887080
children	parent
then on document.onload that div s parent node can be easily located and appended new children

887110
ubuntu	linux
forgot to mention restarting tomcat app server has no effect but if i restart linux box ubuntu 8.10 everything works fine

887125
nfa	dfa
well in computer science theoretical field it s very strong and useful equipment since with it you are able to define regular languages and identify with it nfa or even dfa therefore prove some difficult theorem in computation theory or finite automate and formal languages field

887177
inherited	properties
binding the datacontext of usercontrol xaml view to its viewmodel which inherited from inotifypropertychanged and has properties which implements inotifypropertychanged functionality

887187

onclick	onkeydown
i have access to source code of target application but i would like to not override methods like onclick or onkeydown in every winforms control i m using if it is not necessary

887255
getter	setter
in .net properties are supposed to be first class citizens however in the il code property getter and setter are implemented as get_ propertyname and set_ propertyname

887256
int	chars
the problem is the primitive types int chars double.. don t have a native tostring function

887271
width	height
object id sifr_replacement_0 class sifr-flash height 61 width 1238 type application x-shockwave-flash name sifr_replacement_0 data style library sifr cartonnage-alternate.swf style

887285
implements	extends
fyi a type loaded into a child applicationdomain can be cast to a type that it extends implements in the parent applicationdomain

887297
std	ostream
c++ already has tostring that is called to std ostream

887409
implements	extends
or else if you want to implements a dd library of your own you can take help of their methods or extends them as both the libraries are following object oriented paradigm

887466
debian	linux
i can t answer all of your questions but there s a full port of debian gnu linux on arm

887492
debian	linux
you can install a arm-based debian linux distribution and tinker around with it

887502
wan	lan
assuming i have a cluster of n erlang nodes some of which may be on my lan while others may be connected using a wan that is via the internet what are suitable mechanisms to cater for a different bandwidth availability behavior for example latency induced and b nodes with differing computational power or even memory constraints for that matter

887519
inherited	properties
many of the dependency properties will be shared by all these controls and therefore i want to put their common methods into a basedatatype and have each of these usercontrols inherited from this base type

887526
perforce	svn
is there an equivalent mechanism to a perforce job in svn for grouping related changes

887527
inherited	subclassing
ensure that the subclassing inherited from the base class both in the cs code-behind file and in the first tag of the xaml as shown above

887534
post	get
dummyresult is a simple class that has the same fields as a post or just enough of them to get away with it

887551
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code that is working on ie but not on firefox google-chrome

887594
int	chars
my question is if i want to do some data manipulation work very simple like add some prefix to some chars data type rows multiple int data type rows by 100 or something and display in grid view the manipulated data on page what is the suggested best practices solution to do data manipulation

887637
google-chrome	firefox
this appears to be an issue with firefox and google-chrome s interpretation of the specifications rather than your code

887637
google-chrome	firefox
the w3c specifications show that table cells should support onkeydown but this doesn t appear to be supported by firefox google-chrome currently you could try reporting this as a firefox bug through their website

887663
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
confused by this versus say java.util.date or java.util.calendar

887736
.htaccess	httpd.conf
look at the acceptpathinfo directive used in apache directly in httpd.conf or via .htaccess

887742
merb	ruby-on-rails
it s where frameworks like ruby-on-rails merb sinatra and others take place and its -arguably- it s most known mode of operation

887862
postgresql	mysql
is there any formal performance and stress test reports of open source database specially sqlite mysql an postgresql

887869
metaphone	soundex
unlike soundex or metaphone or nysiis edit distance algorithms make you compare your misspelled composer name to every other composer in the system

887889
cos	sin
is there any use of sin 720 or cos 1440 angles in degrees

887892
union	distinct
using union all means that the server won t perform a distinct which is implicit in union operations

887980
ienumerable	iqueryable
for example check this blog post which shows how the sql generated by ienumerable and iqueryable are different in certain scenarios

887983
udp	mtu
3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

887983
udp	mtu
in case #4 i m pretty certain if you meet the udp max message size then you should be ok but there very well could be some older hardware or custom device with a small mtu that your data is going through

888007
post	get
then if you re still stuck post code here and get help specific to your problem

888036
ilist	icollection
generally expose only an interface icollection ilist or similar and make it readonly

888054
ant	maven
just configure your job to run whatever ant or maven targets unix shell scripts or windows .bat scripts in the order you wish

888080
profiling	debugging
but if this is the case there is no auditing as it is a shared account and also our dev profiling which you will appreciate are vastly different from a shared one cannot be used to debugging production

888084
cos	sin
in that context taking the sin or cos would tell you something about the ultimate position of the dial but you would lose the information about how many turns were involved

888144
teamcity	ncover
i m trying to apply a fix to allow ncover v1.5.5 to run on windows server 2008 x64 via my teamcity continuous integration server as outlined on this blog

888145
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to convince my web server admins to upgrade our versioning of the .net framework from 2.0 to 3.5

888165
versioning	upgrade
it should not be a major deal for them to upgrade the .net framework versioning because it is not going to affect what you already have there such as 2.0 apps

888195
rss	feed
that is not a hack for rss feed not a hack of an external search engine

888198
inherited	properties	public	protected
lets say i inherited a class that has several public properties and or methods however i do not want them to be public properties methods of my class - in other words i want to make those properties protected properties of my class

888204
hash	md5
i have some code i m revewing which is used to convert some text into an md5 hash

888204
hash	md5
well imagine it s the home page of stackoverflow - for each post generate an md5 hash of the user so we can generate their gravatar url

888212
folder	directory
this is because you do not know if the site will be deployed as root under a folder in root web or in a virtual directory

888288
int	chars
you can enhance the above by extending the fieldtype structure to include information about the type of value stored chars int float etc and then write accessors for each type which checks the required type against the defined type

888289
uitableview	uisearchbar
when the user types into that uisearchbar it will automatically filter the results in the uitableview that is below the search bar

888294
int	double
because the compiler will promote the int argument to a double

888389
deselect	multi-select
you can multi-select with shift and then select deselect the group

888448
width	height
for all positions from 0 0 to width - 5 height - 5

888524
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
the default icomparer and iequalitycomparer for tkinterface simply compares the pointer values as four byte integers so there is on queryinterface done to get back to the aggregate

888524
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
you can avoid this problem yourself by supplying a icomparer or iequalitycomparer when you construct the list

888605
free	malloc
i believed that malloc calls boil down to checking if there is enough free space on the os so malloc would be inexpensive

888624
rss	feed
what would be a good way to create a dynamic rss feed

888624
rss	feed
for example i create an rss feed that lists all the items that occur today and i would like it to populate at 12 01 am

888624
rss	feed
i also have another rss feed i wrote that lists the next item to occur

888661
hide	show
i found this - - which is helpful but in the example he has a finite number of columns and he just hide or show them according to which ones have values

888688
vbscript	jscript
theres also the windows scripting host that uses vbscript and jscript

888744
webrat	cucumber
i d like to have some cucumber webrat integration tests of my search features that use but the problem is that the data is loaded and then rolled back in a transaction during a typical cucumber test so there is no way for thinking_sphinx to index it

888759
post	get
this way you ll have both get and post data in your search server-side handler

888762
put	get
in each of those cases the same view code might be being used however the controller is the one who knows to call different functions on the model to get the data to display and put it into the right collection name so the view can find and display it even though the view is actually ignorant of what it is displaying

888775
next	except
never looked back except when i think about the time i naively thought i would be the one developing the next big thing

888834
stdout	stderr
i believe this has something to do with the fact that basehttpserver sends log data to stdout and stderr

888842
post	get
coalesce is not the answer to string concatentation in t-sql i ve seen many post over the years about using the coalesce function to get string concatenation working in t-sql

888842
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is the version of isnull which can take more than two parameters

888932
tinyint	boolean
like last seen on ... then leave last activity and just add a boolean flag tinyint logged_in to your users table

888957
put	get
when storing this information as a string make sure that all numbers are the same length so if the formatter returns 15 you store the string with 015 so that you just divide by 3 later to get the byte to then put into the array

888960
post	get
also you could point your rss reader to sharepointblogs.com and get some pointers to a load of semi-active bloggers who are happy to answer questions posted as comments on their blogs as long as they re related to the main post topic

888962
haskell	ocaml
later i discovered functional programming via mozart oz ocaml later scala haskell and clojure and then i understood that many of the patterns were just boilerplate or additional complexity because the language wasn t expressive enough

888993
put	get
idealy you should never use properties to get data from your object compute things and put data back in the object

888997
width	margin
in sum up i want to put the titles using setting the width attribute plus a negative margin but the width doesn t take effect

889097

obviously it will take some time to get to know the players but joel oleson has put together a good blog article to help get started in the sharepoint twitter community

889378
cvs	svn
in subversion i can simply do svn ls in cvs how can i do this

889456
put	get
i m not sure if this will meet your exact requirement but if you put both the canvas and the content inside a grid as peers it will get you a centered result

889504
globalization	localization
i ve already set the globalization tag in web.config with appropriate uiculture and culture values and they work great for days of the week and other localization settings unfortunately they did not adjust the clock what is the easiest thing i can do to achieve the adjustment so when in the application i do datatime.now i get the current time in timezone b not a

i want to read and change the title of sharepoint site both spsite and spweb using sharepoint web services

889623
vbscript	vba
if at all possible i would like help in doing this query in vbscript vb.net vba etc

889626
min	max
then you can use the min max x y coordinates to get a simple bounding box and rotate that by the angle to get your final result

889638
ant	cruisecontrol	ant	maven
all unit and integration tests work automatically best on a continuous integration server like cruisecontrol done by ant or maven

889670
maven	pom.xml
look into composite maven projects where there is a top level pom.xml that defines a number of child modules

889692
min	max
find max and min in every eigenvalue space

889705
dictionary	map
we have decided to use a cache table that will store a dictionary of guids that map to friendly user information

folder	directory
i have this happen alot where people hardcode their version numbers 1.0.0.0 and then have 5 different copy of dlls on their machine local directory shared folder gac etc.

889986
postgresql	mysql
sysbench is a great utility for benchmarking mysql and i believe has plugins or the capability to test postgresql

889986
postgresql	mysql
regardless of performance if you really know what you are doing with rdbms software and need an open source solution you ll probably want to go with postgresql -- otherwise stick with mysql

890038
yacc	bison
i m writing a grammar in yacc actually bison and i m having a shift reduce problem

890068
children	parent
so i will different modules who can be parent or children

890079
width	height
now the problem is that if the element contains only floated elements or absolutely positioned elements it itself takes no space it has zero width and height

890079
width	height
you can work around this by giving the element some non-zero height and width

890093
public	protected
i think people conceive of internal protected and private as restrictions from the natural state of public

890093
public	protected
rather internal protected and public are weakenings of the natural state of private

890110
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
in the .net world you have svcutil.exe or in the asmx days wsdl.exe to digest .wsdl files to produce proxy classes

890206

890248
width	height
another alternative is having the grid inside the canvas as you ve specified in your xaml with the height width set to or bound to the height width of the canvas

890253
division	modulo
based on robert s code here it can even be done without the division or modulo replacing them with one shift and one and like so

890273
n-gram	words
generate some vector representation for each answer words count using text n-gram

890279
emacs	textmate
however you can extend emacs to work like slickedit and textmate that is copy cut the current line when no text is selected

890322
octal	hex
one option is to directly input the character you re interested in using hex or octal notation

890342
boost	stl
once you got these basics sorted i would recommend to concentrate on getting to grips with the stl and eventually boost

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary and sortedlist both have o log n for retrieval

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary has o log n for insert and delete operations whereas sortedlist has o n

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

890463

890907
hash	salt
now i have several fields that are not printed on the ticket and not known to the user that i can use to encode part of the ticket code so i could use the eventid orderid eventdate and some salt to create a small hash for part of the code ideas

accordingly most perhaps all of the value types chars short long int biginteger bigdecimal float double even string in java are immutable

891044
sequence	permutation
the actual process of summing longer sequence will become very expensive more-so than generating a single permutation on a step basis most architectures have simd vector instructions that can provide rather impressive speed-up i would provide examples of such implementations but i cannot post urls yet

891055

891250
gif	png
all png fix methods require that a transparent gif be available to replace the png image it s part of how the substitution works

superclass	subclassing
discriminator is used to identify a subclassing or superclass mapping when a database record is fetched from a database

891360
superclass	subclassing
however when it comes to mapping of a transient java object to a database row only class name of the object or provided to the save or saveorupdate method entity-name is used to find subclassing superclass mapping

891360
superclass	subclassing
the userproperty entity is a superclass mapping but there are subclassing with their own entity-names and hibernate does not resolve subclassing identified by entity-names this is actually noticed in the hibernate s code

891581
mouseup	mousedown
i ve tried a few solutions mainly involving returning false from the mousedown or click events and although they disable text selection in some browsers they also seem to disable the mouseup event entirely ruining the drop bit of the script and leaving this perma-floating icon hanging around the mouse-- not fun

it s just as easy to pick up the nodevalue of the firstchild as it is to get the innerhtml or innertext which someone mentioned which is less supported

891901
srp	principles
you want to extract code from one class and put it in a class of its own probably to keep up with the single responsibility principles or srp

891908
inherited	subclassing
inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s class implementation that s why it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation in a sense that you really need to focus on interfaces only not implementation so reusing by subclassing is not always preferred

891908
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the tight coupling provided by inherited makes the implementation of a subclassing very bound up with the implementation of a superclass that any change in the parent implementation will force the sub class to change

891908
inherited	subclassing
excessive reusing by subclassing can make the inherited stack very deep and very confusing too

891918

your gridview is linked to an objectdatasource

892057
inherited	subclassing
i have a basic class that derived subclassing inherited from it carries the basic functions that should be the same across all derived classes

892066
equals	gethashcode
i recommmend simply overriding the gethashcode and equals method as the compiler warns but as you seem to want to supress them you can do that as follows

892071
gridview	objectdatasource
you need to find and capture the entered data in the gridview footer then directly add into input parameters of your objectdatasource

892079
disk	ram
remember ram disk and often batteries are changeable

also note you should be using the eventqueue.invokelater boilerplate to ensure that swing components are only ever used on the awt edt

892269
solaris	aix
not familiar with aix but the following works on linux and solaris

892274
cpu	affinity
you could try to set the interpreter affinity to a fixed cpu and see if this issue still comes up

892296
sorting	grouping
as a hopefully related aside last time i looked the implementation of group_by preserves the relative order of the data fed to it which can be useful to remember as it allows you to sort the data in the flat list of posts and then when you grouping them the order is maintained within the grouping rather than dealing with sorting withing the nested data output by group_by

892307
int	boolean
in c# int values are not implicitly casted to boolean so yields a compiler error and does not compile

892489
ssl	https
https ssl are the most common ways to do this

892499
ssl	https
to stop interception of the network communication make sure you use ssl ie https not http

won t properties and methods of car be inherited when i do

892625
hide	show
the viewcontroller class simply show or hide the imageview depending on whether data is available

892649
folder	directory
if the program you re using is installed correctly it should already be in the program files folder so you could just refer to the configuration file as . config_file.txt if its in the same directory as the program or .. other_program config_file.txt if its in a directory different than the other program

892946
inherited	properties
the uicomponent class from which canvas inherited has a minheight and a minwidth properties

892946
width	height
you can bind a s minheight width to the width and height of b so whenever b is resized the minimum dimensions of a also change

892946
width	height
b will automatically show scrollbars when a grows too large to be shown all at once you just need to supply a fixed height and width or some other size constraint

893017
children	parent
even if many children there will only be one parent and combining the parent child creates a globally unique key even though the child key is only unique within its parent

893041

hide	show
to have two buttons and hide one and show the other

893210
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in firefox ie6 and google-chrome and have seen the same issue

projects like apache s activemq or rabbitmq are already widely used and highly tuned and should be able to support the type of load you are talking about outside of the box

893300
wmv	asf	wma	asf
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv

893323
inherited	properties
basically your generic type becomes a base class and il is dynamically written creating a concrete class that inherited from the generic but with the new properties added in

893342
serializable	deserialization
basically any class not interface that implements serializable should define serial version id or you risk deserialization errors when the same .class compile is not in the server and client jvms

893383
updatepanel	formview
the form exists in a formview control and is wrapped by an updatepanel like so

893472
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
are you going to add subtract multiplying divide zip codes

893483
serializable	deserialization
note - it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected serialversionuid conflicts during deserialization causing deserialization to fail

893484
subtract	add
zip code is a not a number in the sense that you add or subtract against it

893489
subtract	add
zip codes don t add or subtract or participate in any numeric operations

valgrind	callgrind
i use valgrind and its tool callgrind

893584
profiler	callgrind

893983
ssl	https
https establishes an underlying ssl

893998
ssl	https
i believe an https connection requires an ssl certificate even a self-generated one if you don t want to buy one

had the struct been int int chars chars then the same object could have been 12 bytes because chars has no alignment requirement

894074
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i always use safari and firefox for development and occasionally opera if i feel like a change

894074
opera	firefox
by the way don t blindly expect opera to work even if it s good in firefox webkit

it is not 100 relevant but i use poe to write proxy between stateless protocol http and stateful protocol telnet session and more specifically - mud session and it was rather simple - you can check the code in here

894602
public	protected
your best bet is to learn the meaning of the public protected and private keywords

894832
int	boolean
if so a common way of doing this is with a boolean flag or sometimes an int counter

894856
multiplying	add
other classes rectangle that have a combination of fields often use a combination of the string technique of multiplying by a small prime number and adding in but add in the various field values

894884
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
in java in particular certain exceptions descending from runtimeexception such as illegalargumentexception are really meant to signal programming errors conditions that should not happen if your program is correct

894909
google-chrome	firefox
the closest thing that i found catches the context menu in ie but not in firefox and google-chrome shows the context menu and then shows the custom event

894924
lan	intranet
webforms are great for corporate lan intranet sites where development speed is critical upstream bandwidth to the web server is plentiful but memory on the server is more constrained

i hate using gridbaglayout in general so i ll add a version using boxlayout but it s a bit trickier due to the preferred size settings

895171
submit	submission
i have a survey on a website and there seems to be some issues with the users hitting enter i don t know why and accidentally submission the survey form without clicking the submit button

895237
put	get
as developers many of us rely on the output of the computer science world to further our development tools in fact without them many developers would be left floundering but put a computer science graduate in front of a user and get them to design a meaningful piece of software for them and the academic intellect is going to fall to pieces because the two speak completely different languages

895237
imperative	declarative
it would be way more helpful if programmers learned at least one functional language one imperative language one declarative language

895237
xslt	xquery
communication devices - xml xquery xpath xslt xsd as these seem to be used so extensively

valgrind	gprof
use valgrind if you can along with the kcachegrind visualizer otherwise use the venerable gprof

895747
getter	setter
if i have a class with an attr_accessor it defaults to creating an instance variable along with the corresponding getter and setter

895758
swt	swing
on the other hand if this represents 20 of the application with the other 80 being the user functionality around providing this conversion then perhaps having to do the work to get the manipulation done is a worthwhile trade off to not have to deal with your own memory management and to have whatever other apis java is giving you for user interaction web swing swt whatever you are using

895764
calloc	malloc
it s an error that will lead you to dynamic allocation calloc malloc new etc

895819

width	height
images that are a 1x1 alpha transparent png and you use the height and width attributes in to tell it how much you want to space

895857
appendto	each
if you look at the way appendto is written it s essentially taking each item in the items array and running a ul .append items i

895884
octal	decimal
the 033 will get replaced with 33 octal which is 27 decimal by the compiler

895885
put	get
it seems for the moment the best way to get an interlockedswap is to put a critical section around to ensure the steps don t get split

895900
distance	polygons
so i was trying to get point distance the point is within the polygons to the edge of the forested polygons

895913
distance	polygons
if you want to find the nearest edge you basically want to iterate across all of the line segments the polygons defines doing a line-segment-to-point distance calculation

895923
distance	polygons
google has a wealth of results for distance from point to polygons edge

895947
puts	gets
note scanf with unadorned s is as bad as gets because it puts no limit on the amount of data that will be slurped in

896013
pull	push
you have to have control of both apps of course and change app1 to support either on a push or pull model the data transfer to app2

896055
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if the view controller is added to a view hierarchy through code the view controller will not get viewwillappear or viewdidappear messages

for clarification i was working on rss version 2.0 that was also the version number i found in the feed

896122
serializable	deserialization
this assumes that most of the time all you need to do is reconstitute the original event from the database like serializable deserialization and not search efficiently on every possible property

896131
versioning	upgrade
i have used beast to sponsor a forum and would like to upgrade and move the deployment from ubuntu to os x on a more recent versioning of ruby on rails

width	height
i currently have an image that i want people s annotations to show up on where the annotations actually have an x y coordinate relative to the image as well as a width and height

896288
maven	pom.xml
if your java project is mavenized it s even easier grails 1.1 works with maven so you can create a pom.xml for your grails app and add your java project as a dependency as you would in any other java project

896288
getter	setter
this could be pretty straightforward if your classes are already written as proper beans with getter setter methods for all their properties

896288
inherited	properties
grails will see these inherited properties as it would if they were written in the simpler groovy style

896295
cpu	processors
this is discussed because the cpu will automatically store accessed memory in cache close to the processors

896298
int	boolean
there s nothing special about boolean or int they were just convenient types

896332

post	get
more precisely how to get total data transfer while using post and get method

896380
hash	md5
why not use encryption to store the passwords in the database such as md5 because they will return different hash versions for example

896401
for-loop	loops
if data is a as you suggest you can use a for-loop rather than a for each loops

896408
udp	tcp
hand roll your own tcp or udp protocol exchange

896473
getter	setter
they have a lot of properties with getter s and setter s and not much else

basically what i need is to take a path to a file or directory on a local machine or preferrably on a share on a remote machine and get the list of users groups and the corresponding permissions for this file folder

896640
ant	maven
use the maven ant task to run jarsigner from the jdk against all the dependencies

896664

so you have most everything in place but in your controller action that handles the post you ll want to get the value of the drop down list load the entity associated with that value then attach that entity to the object you re trying to update

896685
children	parent
children should also know their parent so we have like a doubly linked tree

896685
children	parent
to make disbanding parent from children easier i model the link between parent and child as a relationship with properties parent and child

896685
children	parent
so a parent has a collection of relationships not of children

896685
children	parent
but indeed parent and children actually do share a relationship so why not model that and use it to help disbanding double links less imperatively

896687
rss	feed
planetemacsen is a good rss feed with lots of tips

896690
width	height
resizeby width height

896764
folder	directory
then simulate an update with directory of that folder

896779
mvp	presenter
when using the mvp pattern i often come across methods and members which don t seem to fall nicely within the view or presenter classes...my question is what rules do you use to decide what functionality lies which classes

896815
margin	height
the problem is that the definitions are not the same height they range between 0 up to 5 list items so i cannot apply the same margin on the dd tags

896820

the app runs on ie firefox google-chrome opera safari

896836
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
it s more lightweight than anything else and still manage to do the job right so for linux i don t think there are any other options and for ubuntu and probably debian and the rest of them there is even a package vim-rails that contain a lot of scripts to ease up the development

896839
google-chrome	firefox
i ve come to the conclusion that it seems it is possible based on my use of telerik s context menu which works fine on ie google-chrome and firefox

896874
stdout	stderr
in addition i want to be able to read the stdout stderr of these processes and search for keywords in the output

896877
cruisecontrol	jenkins
hudson update jenkins 1 is extremely easy to set up and managing jobs projects in it is certainly a breeze compared to cruisecontrol

896911
children	parent
the relationship object keeps a one-to-many relation between a single parent and a certain number of children and it ll keep a reference to each person object

896911
children	parent
this specialization lets you have parent s and children to link between other hierarchies in a completely traversal way

896914
pascal	delphi
free pascal lazarus can compile some forms of delphi apps to wince arm

896924
put	get
instead use jquery live events and put regular html in the info window then use ajax calls with jquery to get the interactivity you want

896942
jsf	seam
this is one of the features of seam where they have tried to improve on standard jsf

896986

stdout	stderr
for each process i actually ended up redirecting the stdout and stderr to a temporary file then periodically checking the file for updates and dumping the output into a textview

897085
folder	directory
beacause maven didn t get the workspace.html from the war directory but got it from the public directory i had to remove the folder from the path of the script block

897097
keyup	mouseup
would mouseup and keyup do for this purpose

897118

897120
webclient	webrequest
many upload classes is not using like webclient webrequest webresponse

897162
getter	setter
this is a little confusing behavior for those who know java-like getter setter where you have to define them for every class member you want to access

897162
getter	setter
when it s comfortable to use java-like getter setter - you may write something like this

897162
getter	setter
and then use this code by defining custom getter setter

897164
post	get
i think responding is nice if you watch something like gmail you ll notice a lot of post that get

897176

hide	show
if so the hide show toggle would be an opportunity to describe why one should hide their password

897311
apache	lighttpd
this works with apache and lighttpd out of the box and no rewrite rules are needed

897320
pascal	delphi
both work fine with delphi up to version 2009 and with free pascal

897331
hide	show
in the following code i set up a change handler on a select box to show and hide some follow up questions based on the value of the selection

897346
hide	show
basically give classes to indicate what to show and hide and then there is no tracking required

897378
fdt	swc
if you re using fdt you have an option to auto add the swc as arguments

897390
width	height
you can set a fixed height and width for the div

897398
post	get
to make things worse the complex object graph was being saved to viewstate so every time the page refreshed a cell was updated all the grid and viewstate would get passed from the client to the server in the post back and with a viewstate size of nearly a meg performance is pants

897448
gridview	repeater
according to me using an updatepanel wrapped around a repeater datagrid gridview will be a much more easier-to-implement approach

897462
inherited	subclassing
then define the methods and operators in a base class with a protected constructor and define point and vector as leaf subclassing of this base class so that they inherited its functionality

897472
children	parent
on linux there s a prctl call which is explicitly designed to send a signal to all of a process s children when the parent dies for whatever reason

897472
children	parent
however if you use kill -ppid note the minus sign then so long as the children are still in the parent process s process group then the kernel will deliver any signal to all of the children

897477
fink	macports
i m trying to avoid the macports fink route

897540
minix	linux
if you re still put off by the linux kernel then there s always the minix kernel.

897598
children	parent
and when i try to serialize a parent object which agregates some children - children with links to parent do recursion forever

897733
hash	md5
one more thing relying on md5 hash alone for identifying files is not safe you re better off using the file name as the identifier which is guaranteed to be unique within the folder

897733
hash	md5
there are collisions in md5 two distinct files could have the same md5 hash the probability is small but existent

897828
post	get
it depends on whether you re sending a get or a post request

897831
ssl	https
if you use https the whole communication after establishing the connection will be transfered encrypted over ssl

897846
vb6	vba
here is a code snippet from excel vba should work in vb6 with some tweaks

897849
fast-forward	merge
as i described in rebase vs.merge if your development branch is not too far in term of modifications from master another strategy would be to rebase development on top of master make the split and then merge development back to master fast-forward merge at this point

897862
bazaar	git
than in bazaar or git

897862
bazaar	git
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

898011
klocwork	coverity
i have not had direct experience with findbugs or pmd but have met plenty of people who have compared them with klocwork and coverity

898011
klocwork	coverity
not surprisingly klocwork and coverity which cost money tend to be more solution oriented that can also scales better to work with teams has a more efficient easier to use ui and tends to be less noisy

898011
klocwork	coverity
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd

898041
hide	show
if they need to edit again just show the textarea hide the div

898046
post	get
php treats all get post cookie variables as strings until you do something with them

int	chars
however in the web server world isnt it up to the browser to take this int and turn it into a chars based off character-encoding

898126
mouseleave	mouseenter
however jquery 1.3 doesn t support blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change and submit events as live events

898141
vmware	esx
i ve read about the vmware-cmd tool but believe that is only available with vmware esx not workstation

898148

entity-relationship diagram with in-place schema editing

898305
solaris	aix
we have steps that execute across win32 linux64 linux32 hp aix solaris and even steps that are pushed across the world for remote execution

898305
solaris	aix
each of the steps can be setup to run in parallel or series so when hp aix solaris and linux are all doing the same thing they can all run in parallel and the win32 follow-up will wait until everything finishes before continuing

898379
range	minimum
to find the possible price range of item x set your objective function to the price of x and solve for the minimum and maximum separately

i do not have a need to publish it to a running iis instance just to put the web content together with bin folder on some local dir

898428
jms	jta
just to set the scene this is a java ee application that uses messaging jms a lot persist data in relational database jdbc and relies on global transactions xa managed by the application server jta

898432
int	double	int	chars
if i declare a static variable of a fundamental type chars int double etc. and give it an initial value i imagine that the compiler simply sets the value of that variable at the very beginning of the program before main is called

898483
freebsd	solaris
if most frequently means the actual number of calls in some run of the program dtrace could be the tool you are looking for assuming you have a solaris freebsd or osx box for development work

898527
apache	cherokee
i used to use mod_geoip but recently dumped apache for cherokee which has its own geoip logic

898635
put	get
also if you ever want to put any other control in your tooltip it won t be focusable since a tooltip itself can get focus

898671
post	put
once you have the command right you can put it into the post build actions so it automatically fires after a build

898677
put	get
also i have noticed that visual studio unit test projects sometimes put a deploymentitem attribute on each of the test methods pointing to your target dll and if you switch between debug and release visual studio can get confused if the dll is no longer in the expected location

898696
sorting	filtering
im very ho using the current version of mvc to build for example data entry systems with lots of tabular data inline editing sorting paging filtering etc is quite a lot of work when compared to using webforms

898724
hide	show
when an admin fieldset is given the class collapse it is rendered with a show hide link installed by collapsedfieldset.js which collapses or expands it

898732
ienumerable	iqueryable
the other 2 ways in involve joining in-memory ienumerable which means your pull all records for each before doing the join above and doing an iqueryable join using a contains method which has limitations.

898739
portrait	landscape
i want to set the text direction for some cells in a texttable so that they are vertical the text is landscape instead of portrait

898763
subtraction	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	modulo	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

898793
free	malloc
it s not impossible but it s pretty darn close if you re using the standard malloc free new delete calls

898850
width	height
you need something to contrain the size of the wrappanel and the scrollviewer - you could set the width and height of the viewer then use an element binding on the wrappanel

898864
folder	directory
everything else in this scenario has stayed the same essentially a new website with a static ip address was created pointing to a new folder where all of the files from the virtual directory were xcopied to

898867
implements	sealed
when implements a sealed class that doesn t use unmanaged resources you simply implements a dispose method as with normal interface implementations

898867
suppressfinalize	finalizer
also note that even though b doesn t have a finalizer it still calls suppressfinalize to correctly deal with any subclasses that do implement a finalizer

898870
allocator	stl
i should point out though that things like stl containers which allocate memory on the heap should almost never be passed by value if avoidable because heap allocator is very slow compared to stack allocator

898876
ferret	sphinx
most people i know have ditched ferret and replaced it with sphinx

898886
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
as per chad s post to crack attempt 4 all one has to do is crc32 loads of passwords and then reverse the function he s coded up leaving you with a salt md5 hash and the salt which you would then test for validity

898886
salt	md5
simply test this pair by calculating md5 password+salt where password is the password you are trying and salt is the salt you have calculated by reversing the algorithm

898886
hash	md5
if the md5 equals the first 32 characters of the hash you ve cracked the password

898907
firefox	safari
i think some of the nightly builds of safari and firefox can do this but i suspect this isn t what is being asked about

898984
maven	m2e
m2e maven plugin

899035
hide	show
the easiest way to manage all this is to create a class that derives from uiviewcontroller and have it implement a show and a hide delegate method

899035
hide	show
but with a standard show hide interface it should make it easier to manage the flow between screens

899058
int	double
this presumes that your double fall within the range of an int

899061
hide	show
if all your manager is asking from you is to show and hide some elements or fade in and out a couple of images or request some data via ajax and display it then learning jquery and its api is perhaps all that you need

899064
google-chrome	safari
css3 supports rotation however at this time only google-chrome and safari support css3 rotation with webkit

899064
google-chrome	safari
in the future or with safari or google-chrome you can do this

vbscript	jscript
i want to be able to run vbscript or jscript on a server using cscript.exe to manipulate sharepoint through the object model

899213
addition	multiplication
a simple example expressions involving numbers addition and multiplication this illustrates operator precedence

899215
tetris	pacman	tetris	pong	pong	pacman
you may want to start with a simpler project such as recreating something like tetris pacman or even pong so you can get an idea of all that goes into creating a game

899226
put	get
a good habit that some c programmers get into is to put rvalues on the left-hand side of comparisons so that the compiler will generate an error if you accidentally use the assignment operator instead of the comparison operator

899249
postgresql	mysql
mysql versus postgresql adding a last modified time column to a table

899274
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven pom.xml with a plugin that i want to be able to control on the command line

post	get
this will contain the post variables in a raw format--i was able to use php s parse_str function to get the post variables out of that raw string

899300
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop is idiomatic and easy to read especially if you know the size of the arrays user-defined macros are non-standard

899356
hash	salt
i can t view the link in the original question the website just returns a 404 not found error but the method described in the question is not really using a salt hash

899356
hash	salt
in a proper implementation of salt hash when the passord is created a random salt is combined with the password and hash

899356
hash	salt
then random salt used and the hash are stored

899356
hash	salt
even if i know the password i cannot predict what the hash will be since there will be a different hash for each of the many possible salt values

899359
google-chrome	safari
pelms made some further investigations and pointed out that ie8 on win7 and google-chrome 2 safari 4b allows you to style br somewhat

899375
ubuntu	linux
i recently jumped from mac to linux ubuntu and have been missing bbedit

i ve looked at several unit testing frameworks phpunit simpletest and phpt

899414
base-class	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
so please explain to me why the base-class superclass can t access private protected variables from its subclassing

899414
