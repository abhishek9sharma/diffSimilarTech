101381
hex	binary
pattern7	
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

102924
actionscript	mxml
pattern10	
...except that the code generated by the mxml to actionscript conversion is longer as it has to be more general

105287
nunit	mstest
pattern7	
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

105339
int	double
pattern10	
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

107883
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
pattern10	pattern8	
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

113331
wxpython	pyqt
pattern4	
wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library

115620
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	pattern7	
until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

115838
gif	png
pattern7	pattern0	
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

115838
gif	png
pattern7	
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

116210
gif	png
pattern0	
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

116461
gif	png
pattern0	
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

116739
hash	md5
pattern0	
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

116767
pbkdf2	hash
pattern7	
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

123076
metaphone	soundex
pattern0	
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

124248
rsa	aes
pattern0	
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

124248
rsa	aes
pattern10	
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

124248
rsa	aes
pattern7	pattern0	
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

127152
int	chars
pattern0	
schema is simple like hell one table with autoint as primary index and less than 10 int tiny int and chars 10

127922
mbunit	nunit
pattern7	
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

128055
quicksort	shellsort
pattern0	
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort

128221
g++	gcc
pattern0	
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code

132841
solaris	bsd
pattern4	
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

133271
inline	inlining
pattern0	
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

134346
hash	md5
pattern10	
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

135543
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	
the subversion versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server

139120
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0	
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

139478
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern3	
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue

140359
mantis	bugzilla
pattern0	
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

140501
width	height
pattern7	
if the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width then

140502
pop-up	dialog
pattern7	
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying

141340
floating-point	integer
pattern0	
but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

142240
cpu	processors
pattern7	
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors

142427
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not

144494
profiling	instrumentation
pattern4	
select profiling from the product menu in xcode 6 to launch apple s instrumentation tool

145433
maven	buildr
pattern0	
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven

146871
lisp	scheme
pattern4	
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common lisp so that narrows it down a bit

147392
vim	emacs
pattern0	
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

148152
nant	cruisecontrol
pattern0	
think about project management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant

148194
apache	nginx
pattern0	
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

149212
cpu	hyperthreading
pattern7	
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one

149409
3des	aes
pattern10	pattern8	
3des is more expensive than aes for example

150964
range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern4	pattern4	
so you can either pick a date range run a select max and select min against your db or execute your query and then add the missing dates

151399
ogre	irrlicht
pattern7	
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than ogre in my opinion

154057
inherited	subclassing
pattern10	
inherited is more useful when a new subclassing wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

157238
lwjgl	jogl
pattern10	pattern7	
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

159944
cvs	svn
pattern4	
seriously why would you prefer cvs to svn

159971
cvs	svn
pattern7	pattern0	
svn is better than cvs

160021
cvs	svn
pattern7	
so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better

160037
cvs	svn
pattern7	pattern0	
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

161193
mouse	keyboard
pattern0	
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

161202
cvs	svn
pattern8	
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

161216
cvs	svn
pattern0	
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

161216
cvs	svn
pattern8	
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

161559
cvs	svn
pattern2	
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

162047
int	chars
pattern4	
then you need a function called int scanback const chars s const chars matches int start which starts at start goes down to z as long as the chars being scanned at s id contained in matches return the last index where a match is found

162785
post	put
pattern3	
you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer

162991
swt	swing
pattern4	
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

166196
des	aes
pattern10	
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

167539
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
select dateadd dd 1 getdate will return a current date + 1 day

167922
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

170948
lisp	scheme
pattern0	
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern4	pattern2	
i personally prefer merb over ruby-on-rails as it adopts more ruby conventions

172177
apache	lighttpd
pattern10	pattern10	
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content

172992
disk	ram
pattern4	
but it basically matches ram blocks to disk blocks

173548
accurev	svn
pattern4	
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev

176144
firefox	safari
pattern7	
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

177532
verilog	vhdl
pattern4	
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why

177565
verilog	vhdl
pattern10	
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us

178555
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
pattern4	
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

178555
verilog	vhdl
pattern8	
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

179294
post	get
pattern4	pattern2	
further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get

179520
google-chrome	safari
pattern7	
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

181450
coalesce	isnull
pattern0	
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls

183126
inherited	properties
pattern10	
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

183290
ant	maven
pattern10	
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

184056
ant	maven
pattern4	
i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.

184381
webkit	gecko
pattern0	
my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

186645
perforce	svn
pattern4	
i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it

186990
configobj	configparser
pattern7	
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

190913
subclass	abstract-class
pattern0	
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them

191616
cvs	svn
pattern8	
in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq

192156
coalesce	isnull
pattern4	
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

194130
ant	maven
pattern0	
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration

194197
lxml	elementtree
pattern4	
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

194489
xstream	xom
pattern3	
if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom

195398
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

195398
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195415
postgresql	mysql
pattern2	
you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

196705
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
pattern7	pattern0	pattern0	
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

197210
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

198565
post	get
pattern10	
neither one of get and post is inherently more secure than the other just like neither one of fax and phone is more secure than the other

198565
post	get
pattern10	pattern10	
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

198624
nfa	dfa
pattern7	
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

199290
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
pattern0	
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

199835
vim	emacs
pattern4	
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference

201030
csla	.net
pattern4	
i would recommend csla .net by rockford lhotka

201171
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	pattern0	
quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

201950
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

204778
django	web.py
pattern4	pattern2	
also this post by the web.py author is a very good explanation of why i much prefer web.py over django

205364
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

206134
pop-up	dialog
pattern0	
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

209147
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
pattern0	pattern0	
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

213157
vb6	vba
pattern7	
granted its been a while since i ve done classic vb6 and my vba experience is even rustier.

215539
antivirus	norton
pattern0	
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove

217708
config	ini
pattern0	
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions

218031
mouse	keyboard
pattern7	
unless it s a usb keyboard mouse and 8042 emulation is disabled where you would need a usb stack but you can use the boot protocol for the keyboard mouse which is simpler

218544
centos	linux	centos	solaris	solaris	aix
pattern7	pattern7	
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

219506
mouse	keyboard
pattern0	
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs

220922
elf	coff
pattern0	
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others

222513
kate	kde
pattern4	
i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace

222513
vim	emacs
pattern4	
many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories

223029
interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0	
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

224223
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

226515
division	multiplication
pattern10	pattern10	
multiplication is faster division is more accurate

226593
cruisecontrol	teamcity
pattern7	
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol

228750
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

229915
for-loop	loops
pattern10	
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops

232055
clistctrl	ccombobox
pattern0	
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl

234378
accessor	properties
pattern0	pattern0	
specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well

234591
tolower	toupper
pattern8	
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

234639
tolower	toupper
pattern10	
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though

237472
vim	emacs
pattern4	
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth

241621
nstableview	nssplitview
pattern0	
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc

242546
kerberos	ldap
pattern0	
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server

242991
rss	feed
pattern2	
i produce a feed reader and when scraping feed always prefer atom over rss

245323
cvs	svn
pattern10	
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

249589
perforce	svn
pattern4	
i agree with the previous yuval - having worked with perforce and svn both in gui and command-line mode i prefer svn

249617
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
pattern4	
for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days

251995
getter	setter
pattern10	
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.

254023
aptana	radrails
pattern4	
i prefer aptana radrails on both mac and linux

256092
bazaar	git
pattern7	
bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

257953
width	height
pattern7	
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height

259080
bluej	greenfoot
pattern7	pattern0	
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old

259460
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

259517
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern8	
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

260148
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
pattern10	
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

262798
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

263966
ubuntu	centos
pattern10	
in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions

269117
swt	swing
pattern10	
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui

270764
xsl-fo	xslt
pattern4	
you can also use apache fop if you prefer xslt and xsl-fo

277306
boost	stl
pattern10	
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions

277511
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

277564
bluecloth	rdiscount
pattern8	
rdiscount seems to be much faster and more reliable than bluecloth

281802
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
pattern3	
firstly i d recommend using tortoisecvs as it has better cvsnt support

282643
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4	pattern2	
on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter

283151
coalesce	isnull
pattern4	
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

283405
jboss	glassfish
pattern7	
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss

283405
jboss	glassfish
pattern7	
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand

285023
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

288440
salt	md5
pattern4	
get md5 js implementation and compare salt

288727
floating-point	integer
pattern7	pattern0	
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

289468
children	parent
pattern7	pattern0	
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

289841
inherited	properties
pattern4	
to access those properties or methods i need to make them public which defeats encapsulation or re-write them into my class which defeats inherited

291267
lisp	scheme
pattern3	
if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

292975
domxpath	domdocument
pattern10	
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable

294097
redmine	trac
pattern0	
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

294103
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
pattern4	
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

294978
int	double
pattern7	
if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider

298978
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
pattern4	
gimel and tim recommend lxml which is a nicely pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

303277
mapguide	arcmap
pattern0	
i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap

303480
kate	kde
pattern4	
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor

304069
ant	maven
pattern7	pattern0	
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

305216
ant	maven
pattern0	
i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet

307238
getter	setter
pattern7	
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method

311896
lisp	scheme
pattern0	
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too

315407
cos	sin
pattern0	
using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos

317990
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
pattern7	pattern7	
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

319433
gif	png
pattern0	
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

323429
trac	bugzilla
pattern4	
i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla

323542
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	redmine	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
pattern0	
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis

323542
redmine	trac
pattern0	
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac

323893
mantis	bugzilla
pattern4	
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity

324355
lxml	libxml2
pattern4	
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested

327393
union	distinct
pattern4	
as other users said union is used to select distinct values from two tables

329742
vim	emacs
pattern4	
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs

330657
post	get
pattern3	
security wise i prefer using post than get as it gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around

330918
min	max
pattern4	
does hibernate hql queries support using select min max count and other sql functions

332211
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

332459
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

333440
activemq	rabbitmq
pattern10	
apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine

337764
int	chars
pattern0	
for lookup tables with a low volume of rows you can use a 3 chars code as the primary key as this takes less room than an int but the performance difference is negligible

338537
config	ini
pattern4	
i am using zend_config_ini config adapter i prefer ini for base config

340054
width	height
pattern7	pattern0	
add a new row until height is greater than width

340054
width	height
pattern7	pattern0	
add a new column until width is greater than height

344281
folder	directory
pattern7	
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for

344492
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	
used to be firefox but google-chrome is nicer out of the box

348306
wordpress	phpbb
pattern7	
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems

348548
codeigniter	kohana
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv

354420
listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview
pattern4	pattern2	
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

356602
innodb	myisam
pattern4	
if your application generates a lot of updates you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam

360494
cpu	processors
pattern7	
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors

361372
moq	typemock
pattern4	
so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq

361681
range	min
pattern0	
grid min value should be either 0 or a nice value lower than the min value of the data in range

365630
for-loop	loops
pattern7	
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops

365804
dlsym	dlopen
pattern0	
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits

365834
innodb	myisam
pattern7	
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

365945
firefox	safari
pattern0	
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

367387
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system

368466
directx	gdi
pattern10	
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

369779
entity-relationship	diagram
pattern3	
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram where you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description

371821
apache	lighttpd
pattern10	
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

373983
rtp	rtcp	rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp	rtcp	sdp
pattern0	
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.

375160
getter	setter
pattern10	pattern10	
if the getter setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x

377519
int	double
pattern7	
i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority

380074
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	pattern7	pattern10	
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

380092
int	chars
pattern0	
well then an int field may just be a better bet than a chars 50

380757
redmine	trac
pattern4	pattern8	
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

382518
imperative	declarative
pattern7	
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

384083
googletest	cppunit
pattern2	
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework

384102
tortoisegit	svn
pattern0	
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk

386826
ati	nvidia
pattern0	
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this

386835
redmine	trac
pattern0	
redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer

388146
free	memmove
pattern8	
the compiler is free to choose a method that is more efficient than memmove

388422
fink	macports
pattern10	
i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	pattern0	
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern10	
if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

389824
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

389824
innodb	myisam
pattern2	
innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other

392733
haskell	scheme
pattern0	
some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure

393362
perl	tcl
pattern0	
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

396601
ienumerable	ilist
pattern2	
i would choose between ilist and ienumerable and wouldn t consider array at all

396838
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
pattern4	
you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

399122
int	chars
pattern7	
there have been machines where sizeof int will be one value probably 4 but where sizeof chars is larger

400867
mouse	keyboard
pattern7	pattern7	
getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation

401279
vsto	add-in
pattern10	
vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so

402030
width	height
pattern0	
if the distance between the center of the circle and all of the vertices is greater than the radius of the circle and all of those distances are shorter than the width and height of the rectangle then the circle should be inside of the rectangle

402806
trie	tree
pattern10	
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

404634
freemarker	velocity
pattern4	
i actually slightly prefer freemarker to velocity just in case you re open to exploring other options

405022
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

405022
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

406288
getter	setter
pattern10	
i feel like the getter setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are

406323
google-chrome	safari
pattern4	
in this benchmark safari 3.1 2 actually beats google-chrome despite having a js engine that is clearly much much slower this is basically due to more efficient bindings between jsc webcore the dom rendering etc of webkit and v8 webcore

406426
lisp	prolog
pattern0	
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think

408820
awt	swing
pattern10	
are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa

408853
vim	gedit
pattern4	
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim

408981
pyopengl	pyglet
pattern7	pattern0	
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl

409563
int	boolean
pattern7	
returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one

410176
photoshop	fireworks
pattern7	
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill

410465
profiler	perf
pattern10	
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems

411994
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
with that said if you are worried about sql server licensing costs i d recommend postgresql first or mysql second as your database of choice

413752
ant	maven
pattern0	
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well

414289
mouse	keyboard
pattern0	
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

414763
subtraction	modulo
pattern0	
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction

415743
vmware	virtualbox
pattern7	
i managed to use andlinux + wine to get this working but honestly i think the vmware virtual pc virtualbox route is simpler

415785
django	web.py
pattern0	
simpler than django and stand-alone although just about everything i start in web.py eventually gets rewritten as a django app...

416947
awt	swing
pattern0	
i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components

417342
multiplying	subtract
pattern8	
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

419590
gif	png
pattern4	
the web favors gif jpg and png mostly

421566
minimum	max
pattern0	
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

422343
intersect	contains
pattern7	
given two ranges a a b and c c d do they intersect is one greater than the other or does one contains the other

425058
tiff	png
pattern4	
tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs

425355
width	height
pattern7	
for a cross-browser experience its either scroll width height or offset width height whichever is greater

430730
post	get
pattern0	
or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem

430883
junit	testng
pattern10	pattern8	
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example

431398
apache	nginx
pattern0	
so you can do a django redirect_to urlconf entry but you d be better off with an apache or nginx or insert-your-webserver-here redirect so the initial request never has to hit django at all

432306
lisp	scheme
pattern4	
if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme

433998
int	chars
pattern0	
note that in c++ literals having more than one chars still have type int although their value is implementation defined

434277
post	get
pattern0	
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them

436503
google-chrome	firefox
pattern2	
currently there s somewhat of an arms race between google-chrome firefox and webkit s javascript interpreters which has really improved the speed situation with javascript

436535
division	multiplication
pattern0	
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus

436535
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
pattern0	
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

436535
division	multiplication
pattern0	
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

439818
postgresql	mysql
pattern2	
i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql

440239
int	double
pattern8	
this shouldn t come as any surprise - there are more long values than double given the nan values and plenty of double aren t int so we can t expect every long to be exactly representable

442181
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

446962
ati	nvidia
pattern4	
are there any third-party reports that compare ati s stream framework to nvidia s cuda framework ie not from ati or nvidia talking themselves up

448892
mp3	flv
pattern3	
i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need

449516
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
select dateadd d getdate 8 - dow getdate

449918
webclient	webrequest
pattern7	
webclient is simpler to use than webrequest

453751
kerberos	ntlm
pattern7	pattern0	
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

454121
x86	mips
pattern8	
x86 have more complex instructions than mips

455359
int	double
pattern8	
int and string are really quite different certainly more different than int and double

456500
freemarker	velocity
pattern4	
i prefer freemarker here over velocity

460360
springsource	grails
pattern4	
i also choose grails over simplicity and there are lots of java lib such as jasper report jawr etc and i am glad that now they join with springsource which makes their base solid

462567
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object

462722
textwrangler	bbedit
pattern4	
if the text editor in xcode doesn t suit you i d recommend bbedit or its free little brother textwrangler

463420
freemarker	velocity
pattern7	pattern0	
velocity is simpler than freemarker

463420
freemarker	velocity
pattern10	pattern8	
freemarker is more powerful than velocity

463954
firefox	safari
pattern7	pattern4	
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

465728
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern0	
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

466508
inherited	subclassing
pattern4	
if you still want to favor inherited without necessarily thinking in terms of base class and subclassing you can simply define an interface ex

467418
int	double	int	boolean
pattern4	
the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

467696
vmware	virtualbox
pattern4	
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

468724
equals	gethashcode
pattern2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

470267
int	double
pattern10	
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable

471259
trac	bugzilla
pattern0	
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible

471804
rss	feed
pattern4	
i have used it for several years to grab rss feed

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	pattern0	
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

472283
for-loop	loops
pattern7	
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops

472333
disk	ram
pattern7	pattern0	
ram is much faster than disk

475026
crypt	hash
pattern4	
also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere

476792
cvs	svn
pattern4	pattern2	
i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

480067
ftgl	freetype
pattern4	
id recommend ftgl as already recommended above however i have implemented a freetype opengl renderer myself and thought you might find the code handy if you want reinvent this wheel yourself

482268
hash	salt
pattern0	
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

482412
ftp	smb
pattern10	
push log files to a central location ftp is faster than smb the windows ftp command can be automated with -s scriptfile

484066
hex	binary
pattern7	
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

484840
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
pattern0	
note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available

484849
hex	binary
pattern7	
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

486951
nunit	mstest
pattern8	
attributes are used in a more meaningful manner than mstest or nunit

487454
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

488946
superclass	subclassing
pattern10	
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

488978
mockito	easymock
pattern7	
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work

491263
union	distinct
pattern4	
depending on the number of rows returned you may be best using union all on the selects with a select distinct query around it

492954
hash	salt
pattern4	
hash salt password that matches username and see if password matches hash

493221
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4	
of the frameworks i ve tried cakephp and codeigniter i prefer cakephp

495528
vbscript	jscript
pattern10	pattern8	
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

496124
toolbar	docking
pattern4	
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other

497794
quicksort	mergesort
pattern0	
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

497819
quicksort	mergesort
pattern0	
previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort

497849
mergesort	in-place
pattern7	
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

497967
quicksort	mergesort
pattern4	
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway

497967
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	pattern0	
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

498069
inherited	properties
pattern0	
if a browser s stylesheet does define a style for all types of element and this style has a higher precendence than inherited then inherited properties values should never be observed

498840
integer	unsigned
pattern7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

502658
vim	jedit
pattern4	
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim

502970
calloc	malloc
pattern4	
just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

503943
bazaar	git
pattern4	
as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar

505839
width	height
pattern10	
my fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it displays correctly in the viewer as landscape

505901
vb.net	vb6
pattern4	
if you want to learn more about tdd and unit testing you should apply it to functions or procedures in vb6 -- although i d recommend vb.net or c# and doing object-oriented development

506241
division	multiplication
pattern0	
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details

506252
division	multiplication
pattern0	
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit

509703
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
pattern0	
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction

511928
int	double
pattern7	
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

511966
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

512569
xsl-fo	xslt
pattern7	
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo

514184
floating-point	integer
pattern7	pattern0	
they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

515325
wxpython	qt-designer
pattern10	
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade

515501
union	distinct
pattern4	
so there is no need to use select distinct combined with a union

516941
disk	ram
pattern0	
disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram

518893
vim	emacs
pattern4	
i am capable of using vim in a pinch but i really prefer emacs

519191
emacs	jedit
pattern7	
jedit is still pretty good but emacs is quite better

521392
maven	pom.xml
pattern7	
sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml

522537
goto	break
pattern4	
a much simpler way of inspecting the code in msvc is to simply set a break point and inspect the disassembly right click on the line and select goto disassembly from the pop-up menu

522964
gif	png	tiff	png
pattern4	
other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

525029
backtracking	greedy
pattern4	
it doesn t show how to do greedy nongreedy matches backtracking matching within a line instead of the whole line and other more esoteric features of state machines that are easily handled by the re syntax

526070
int	double
pattern7	
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

526070
int	double
pattern7	
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

526337
lisp	scheme
pattern4	
ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

530086
freebsd	linux
pattern10	
just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does

531772
x86	64bit
pattern7	
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

535933
apache	nginx
pattern0	
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

539857
translation	localization
pattern7	
localization it s easier to translation text than images

542234
awt	swing
pattern7	
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple

544898
northwind	adventureworks
pattern0	
what are your strategies best practices when it comes to dealing with a reasonably sized sql server database anything larger than northwind or adventureworks - do you use multiple filegroups

548312
int	chars
pattern0	
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

548356
int	chars
pattern0	
when an int is declared using a chars constant of more than one chars it is sensitive to the byte order of the machine for which the constant was developed

548827
boost	stl
pattern8	
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

548848
boost	stl
pattern0	
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

550564
int	double
pattern7	
even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match

551068
datamapper	activerecord
pattern4	
if what you want is to compare activerecord rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start

551342
vim	emacs
pattern7	
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

559225
cvsnt	svn
pattern7	
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints

559937
trac	bugzilla
pattern8	
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

560114
accessor	properties
pattern7	
and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable

562990
boost	stl
pattern0	
.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

563472
lisp	scheme
pattern7	pattern0	
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp

565933
disk	ram
pattern7	
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

568703
opensuse	linux
pattern0	
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse

569500
width	height
pattern0	
there is no automatic clipping performed so you have to ensure that parameters top and left are not smaller than 0 zero and left + as well as top + are not greater than the width or height of the destination image respectively

570223
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysql to support them

570247
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

572622
ubuntu	debian
pattern4	
i highly recommend debian or ubuntu server for domain-0

575934
opera	firefox
pattern4	
most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better

576296
skip-lists	tree
pattern0	
so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists

579589
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

584128
udp	tcp
pattern0	
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

584131
udp	tcp
pattern10	pattern0	pattern0	
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

584198
pdfbox	itext
pattern0	
start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s

584890
yslow	pagespeed
pattern0	
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow

585100
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
pattern7	
i d suggest having a look at openrasta which is much closer to http semantics than asp.net asp.net-mvc is

585102
mockups	balsamiq
pattern4	
i d still recommend balsamiq mockups

585442
hudson	bamboo
pattern4	
i ve administered both bamboo and hudson and i would recommend hudson

586834
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

592265
vim	emacs
pattern2	
you will always be using the best editor for the job if you re able to choose between vim and emacs

592640
kerberos	ntlm
pattern0	
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

592640
kerberos	ntlm
pattern0	
for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm

593094
lift	wicket
pattern4	
however i strongly prefer wicket and or lift especially the latter

594466
int	double
pattern0	
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

595351
stateless	stateful
pattern4	
one thing i ve learned over the years is that stateless trumps stateful for maintainability

595693
for-loop	loops
pattern4	
i would choose for-loop when there is known number maximum number of iterations before loops starts

597265
division	multiplication
pattern0	
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc

597847
northwind	adventureworks
pattern7	pattern0	
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind

598774
ant	maven
pattern4	
there are plenty of articles on the net that compare ant and maven so you can look at those but from my experience its always worthwhile to consider how you can improve a project

599070
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
pattern3	
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

599070
ant	maven
pattern7	
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

600969
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
pattern4	
personally i prefer odp.net but system.data.oracleclient will get the job done

601626
getter	setter
pattern7	
or if your getter takes parameters or your setter takes more than a value parameter

601651
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
pattern4	
you just need very basic functions mostly the standard toolchain. you could pick centos ubuntu fedora debian whatever

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
pattern7	
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases

602804
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
the advantage with sphinx is easier integration with mysql and postgresql however lucene is more feature-rich

604314
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
pattern0	
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

605544
int	double
pattern7	
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

605544
int	double
pattern7	
casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1

605547
int	double
pattern7	
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

610260
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strncpy
pattern7	
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

610494
strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

610542
gif	png
pattern7	
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

610565
gif	png
pattern0	
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

610573
gif	png
pattern0	
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

610597
gif	png
pattern4	
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

610769
gif	png
pattern4	
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

611303
ostringstream	std
pattern4	
i prefer std ostringstream for complex concatenation

612937
spaces	delimiter
pattern0	
awk uses a comma surrounded by 0 or more spaces as field delimiter

613917
opera	firefox
pattern4	
i do it with firefox opera but i prefer firefox because of firebug

614696
telerik	componentart
pattern7	
although it depends on your project size and requriments i recommend devxpress and telerik web windows .i ve used componentart telerik devxpress and i think telerik is better if u are developing web applications.and devxpress are better in winforms.by the way while developing in some cases i came across especially performance problems in telerik products.nevertheless telerik is good choice for web development

614786
nginx	lighttpd
pattern4	
this is all done with outer webserver which listens to the world i recommend nginx or lighttpd

618881
shadowing	named
pattern4	
it is much more complicated at higher levels at deciding which function class choose named shadowing ambiguous named between namespaces etc. or when compiling to bytecode running ast

619544
cpython	pypy
pattern0	
part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython

620976
cpython	ironpython
pattern10	
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython

628270
haskell	scheme	imperative	declarative	lisp	scheme
pattern10	pattern8	
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

630233
vmware	virtualbox
pattern0	
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

630233
vmware	virtualbox
pattern10	
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

630770
uiview	catransition
pattern8	
the uiview class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than catransition

636004
subtract	add
pattern4	
it handles leap years leap seconds invalid dates times it can output dates in any format it can compare add subtract etc.

638446
udp	tcp
pattern10	pattern7	pattern0	
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

638446
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
pattern0	
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

640303
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

645799
disk	ram
pattern0	
writing to a local database or handling a data structure larger than ram will impact the disk making network calls will impact the network hardware cpu bound calculations will impact there

646086
rsa	aes
pattern4	
from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this

646461
vim	emacs
pattern4	
i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree

646610
trac	mantis
pattern4	
i d recommend mantis or trac

649736
vim	emacs
pattern4	
i have only used emacs briefly and while i prefer vim i am jealous of some of its features

651200
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
pattern7	
with a gui interface along with a command line one subversion has tortoisesvn rapidsvn which is more of a traditional ui or ankhsvn for visual studio integration

654112
svg	vml
pattern2	
i m writing a bit of javascript and need to choose between svg or vml or both or something else it s a weird world

655564
multiplying	multiplication
pattern10	
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

655581
division	multiplication
pattern0	
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases

655584
division	multiplication
pattern0	
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication

656377
entity-relationship	diagram
pattern0	pattern0	
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

656559
keystore	jks
pattern4	
command summary - to compare jks keystore to pem file

665023
postgresql	mysql
pattern2	
i ve heard a lot of postgresql but i always wanted to know why you d choose it over mysql

669875
min	max
pattern2	
you can restrict the number of times a pattern matches with min max

669924
jquery	scriptaculous
pattern2	
jquery is light weight especially in compare with scriptaculous

673046
folder	directory	folder	dir
pattern4	
i d recommend folder directory or even dir

674037
hash	salt
pattern7	
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content

674849
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
pattern3	
i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup

677447
gif	png
pattern4	
i prefer png for any internet image work i m doing as gif has a limited palette and jpg doesn t handle transparency

677459
config	ini
pattern0	
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

680030
spaces	delimiter
pattern3	
the following should do the necessary but it s inefficient doing two full table selects and it also relies on your exact match being delimiter by spaces

680382
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
pattern4	
i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win

680613
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	pattern8	
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

681760
trie	dawg
pattern10	
it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes

683028
joomla	typo3
pattern8	
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla

686138
innodb	myisam
pattern2	
for instance myisam is widely held to be faster at selects than innodb

686982
width	height
pattern0	
the padding on the #variablesize would have to be equal to or greater than the width height of the images

688135
disk	ram
pattern0	
vs.net makes tons of i o calls and ram disk are much faster than real disk

688567
disk	ram
pattern0	
you might want to investigate more than creating ram disk

690380
firebird	dbisam
pattern10	
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly

691900
post	get
pattern8	
eval is more dangerous than get post because the submitted content can run functions like include which can access any file apache has read privileges for or shell_exec which can do anything in the shell the apache user can do etc

694874
cobertura	emma
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer cobertura over emma

698048
post	get
pattern0	
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

698780
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern0	
addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication

699357
int	chars
pattern0	
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

706428
bazaar	git
pattern0	
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git

706457
bazaar	git
pattern0	
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

709465
nunit	mstest
pattern4	pattern2	
i strongly prefer nunit over mstest

710493
int	double
pattern7	
this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double method is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int

712054
haskell	sml
pattern0	
it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta

713801
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
an alternative would be firebird which is not so flexible but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysql and postgresql

714814
public	protected
pattern0	
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope

715836
vim	emacs
pattern2	
i would recommend trying out vim or emacs

718625
ienumerable	ilist
pattern3	
i recommend using ienumerable instead of ilist with it you will have more flexibility

720746
boost	stl
pattern3	
i would really recommend using stl vector or boost multi_array containers for this

721224
int	chars
pattern7	
an implicit cast is disallowed as an int is wider has a greater range of values than a chars

721563
gridview	repeater
pattern10	
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

723329
goto	break
pattern0	
labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose

724260
nunit	mstest
pattern3	
lastly i would recommend using nunit with testdriven.net - a very useful plugin whether you re doing nunit or mstest

724272
post	get
pattern7	
sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments

724365
free	malloc
pattern10	
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use it

725366
min	max
pattern4	
select min value1 max value1 from values_table

725366
min	max
pattern4	
select min value2 max value2 from values_table

726875
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
upgrade_250 the wordpress 2.5.0 upgrade will be run if the database versioning is less than 7499. each of these functions run their own data migration and population procedures some of which are called during the initial database setup script

728426
filtering	grouping
pattern2	
certainly if your select with grouping by has no where clause it s going to be a lot more efficient if you run the report with filtering values

728716
width	height
pattern7	
unfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow lines

731695
hash	md5
pattern4	
ldap signon should select md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password

734559
typeerror	attributeerror
pattern7	
many times catching an attributeerror or typeerror is simpler and apparently faster

738996
readonly	temporary
pattern4	
when an ie user clicks the link of a file residing in sharepoint and user selects readonly access the file is copied to temporary internet files my application is opened and passed that filename as a parameter

741341
subtraction	addition
pattern8	
although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms

744070
cdr	cons
pattern0	
hons generally runs slower than cons because in creating a hons an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and cdr

746301
junit	testng
pattern7	
you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework

748094
jquery	jqmodal
pattern3	
i would recommend using jquery with the jqmodal plugin instead of using a â popupâ

752002
sum	coalesce
pattern4	
update users u mines m set u.mana u.mana + coalesce select sum m.mana_rate from mines m where m.user_id u.id 0

752002
sum	coalesce
pattern4	
update user u set u.mana u.mana + select coalesce sum m.manarate 0 from mine m where m.userid u.id

752002
sum	coalesce
pattern4	
exception in thread main org.hibernate.hql.ast.querysyntaxexception unexpected ast node query update mm.user.user u set u.mana u.mana + select coalesce sum m.manarate 0 from mm.map.buildings.mines.mine m where m.userid u.id

752147
union	distinct
pattern0	
union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct

754021
vb.net	vb6
pattern4	
if your already familiar with vb5 and vb6 and your just building small desktop utilities then i would recommend vb.net

754723
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

755202
union	distinct
pattern4	
select distinct table.column from table where column like union

756327
gridview	datalist
pattern10	
gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist

757699
telerik	radwindow
pattern10	
telerik has a control called radwindow which is more or less a modal window

761581
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

761596
codeigniter	kohana
pattern10	
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better

761864
public	protected
pattern7	pattern0	
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

763284
swt	swing
pattern4	pattern2	
i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app

763764
apache	nginx
pattern10	
it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant

764074
verilog	vhdl
pattern8	
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl

764490
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern8	
this will be made less onerous by ruby-on-rails 3 which is intended to be orm agnostic after the merge with merb

765929
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning

766479
inherited	properties
pattern7	
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

771139
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu

771892
quicksort	heapsort
pattern8	
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

772710
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux

773225
hide	show
pattern0	pattern0	
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content

774381
ferret	sphinx
pattern10	
i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better

778807
django	turbogears
pattern4	
you ll want some kind of framework i d recommend django or turbogears

780111
cout	cin
pattern10	
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

780156
free	malloc
pattern0	pattern0	
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free

782375
cvs	svn
pattern8	
in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn

782494
cvs	svn
pattern4	pattern2	
there are arguments for keeping cvs if you already have it but for virtually any other case i d recommend svn over cvs and so would most of the people who use either heavily

783534
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
pattern4	
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

784328
int	chars
pattern0	
for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so

784719
pop-up	dialog
pattern0	
use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up

784951
fiddler	charles
pattern4	
if you use a transparent echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles

786330
aggregate-functions	sum
pattern4	
you cannot nest aggregate-functions - select sum max x will always error

788881
width	height
pattern7	
what would be perfect is keeping the percent height and width while child width is smaller than parent a width

790473
rar	zip
pattern0	pattern0	
it s much better compressing than zip rar

790744
rsa	dsa
pattern4	
a practical introduction to gnu privacy guard in windows recommends dsa and elgamal but i would like to know if rsa is good enough to use these days and if so what minimum key size should i use

792460
floating-point	integer
pattern7	
the difference between each floating-point number and its corresponding integer is less than 1 or equal to 1 if you really must

794801
put	get
pattern10	
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

798046
floating-point	integer
pattern7	
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable

799142
udp	tcp
pattern7	pattern0	pattern10	
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

803700
nginx	lighttpd
pattern10	
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

804829
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0	
lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup

805392
ssl	https
pattern10	
if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet. it can use those keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server

808889
glut	sdl
pattern10	
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

810193
addition	multiplication
pattern7	
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

811801
haskell	sml
pattern0	
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell

811937
junit	testng
pattern7	
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

813646
haskell	sml
pattern4	
much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes

813984
doc	rtf
pattern7	pattern0	
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format

814811
actionscript	mxml
pattern10	pattern10	
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

816576
camping	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	camping
pattern0	
i would like to use a lighter framework than ruby-on-rails sinatra ramaze camping but am concerned that by doing so i will not be able to use a lot of shared libraries that have been tailored to ruby-on-rails in the form of plugins

817327
xslt	xquery
pattern4	pattern2	
i use and recommend xquery over xslt

818424
datamapper	activerecord
pattern4	pattern0	
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install

819327
int	chars
pattern7	pattern0	
int is usually bigger than chars â more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

824870
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
pattern3	
that said if you are using only visual studio and will be doing ci builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcity i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net

827594
haskell	ocaml
pattern7	
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

828631
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
pattern4	
it s much more difficult in 2.0 until you get your rythym down as previous poster i d recommend sqlconnection and sqldatareader etc

830892
cpython	ironpython
pattern4	
for example cpython beats ironpython hands down start up time

831519
aggregate-functions	sum
pattern2	
i want to take an ado.net datatable and perform the equivalent of a sql select query with aggregate-functions such as sum on some columns and group by set for the remaining columns

832483
post	get
pattern4	pattern2	
when i first started doing web development ten years ago the conventional wisdom was to always favor post over get for forms and to have the application on the server side require post for form submission for precisely this reason

832496
post	get
pattern4	pattern2	
the point isn t to prefer get over post the point is to use get where the request doesn t affect the data on the server and post where data is modified

832606
post	get
pattern4	pattern2	
the already-given answers really do answer your question - no prevention of xss is not a valid reason to prefer post over get

836856
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern10	pattern10	
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

839116
int	chars	subtract	add
pattern4	
if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to chars when displaying the result

839664
superclass	subclassing
pattern7	
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing

840730
git-svn	svn2git
pattern0	
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

840989
int	boolean
pattern0	
so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

843650
django	turbogears
pattern4	
i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment

843733
qcodo	qcubed
pattern7	
qcubed community is much stronger at the moment so you might want to check in qcodo forum for your answers on basic problems but post on the qcubed forum

844519
tapestry	wicket
pattern2	
beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them

846356
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

848039
for-loop	loops
pattern7	
the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loop

848572
disk	ram
pattern7	
memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow

851210
range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern7	
and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

851468
strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	
concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows

851496
min	max
pattern4	
select min effdate max termdate from tab1

853042
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
pattern7	pattern7	
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

857530
int	chars
pattern4	
is there any reason why i should choose int statusid over chars 4 statuscode

857530
int	chars
pattern10	pattern8	
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

857900
isnull	nullif
pattern10	pattern10	
in my opinion using isnull nullif is faster than using case when

859588
versioning	upgrade
pattern4	
bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse

862585
button	checkbox
pattern4	
okay lets ignore safari for a while skinning input and button are rather easy but how to completely skin select checkbox radio etc

864659
des	rsa
pattern0	
des code is 8 times larger than rsa

870080
union	distinct
pattern7	pattern0	
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

871372
union	distinct
pattern7	pattern0	
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

874977
innodb	myisam
pattern4	pattern2	
for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable

876774
pascal	delphi
pattern7	
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable

876945
filtering	grouping
pattern2	
select settings under filtering keys grouping in here you can switch off repeating keys for that user on that machine

879201
colt	jama
pattern8	pattern0	
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt

880821
lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10	
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

882318
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
pattern4	
if you return collections or instance and if you choose ienumerable iqueryable ilist list or whatever depends on your needs

882572
launch4j	jsmooth
pattern4	
if you want a no fuss way for the end user to kick off a program with multiple jar dependencies you may want to look at launch4j or jsmooth i prefer launch4j

883177
imagemagick	libtiff
pattern7	
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker

884697
subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
pattern10	
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

885598
cifs	smb
pattern0	pattern0	
nfs with the right setup version and tuning is just a tad slower than smb cifs

886136
rank	max
pattern0	
while i think gbn s answer is probably sufficient i m wondering whether use of an over clause to establish a max date per id attribute with which to reduce the select in a where clause wouldn t be faster than a rank

886207
int	double
pattern10	
using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable

887983
udp	mtu
pattern0	
3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

888389
deselect	multi-select
pattern4	
you can multi-select with shift and then select deselect the group

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	pattern0	
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern0	
if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

893300
wmv	asf	wma	asf
pattern4	
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv

896482
webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern10	
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false

897118
disk	ram
pattern0	
if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access

897862
bazaar	git
pattern0	pattern7	pattern0	
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

898011
klocwork	coverity
pattern4	
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd

898763
subtraction	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	modulo	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
pattern0	
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

899887
division	multiplication
pattern10	
multiplication is faster than division so the second method is faster

899929
division	multiplication
pattern7	pattern0	
if the latter yes floating point multiplication is generally faster than division

899967
firefox	safari
pattern0	
in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case
