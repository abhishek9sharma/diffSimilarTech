afaik the quake3 engine which is used for urban terror implements a custom dynamic opengl loader system the binary doesn t link against libgl.so directly but uses dlopen to load libgl.so then dlsym to retrieve all the opengl symbols

7702251
dlsym	dlopen
i recommend also intercepting the dlopen and dlsym calls and for functions you intend to hook into return your trampoline which will ultimately call the requested function instead returning the function pointer directly

another alternative to get the toolbar put your table into a uinavigationcontroller

7702838

the following will get you the error you described in your post

7703351
super	self
the expected thing happens self.super will just hold a super object that acts just like super caselessdict self

7703351
super	self
you could name the attribute __super so it gets mangled but i recommend just calling super caselessdict self as everybody else does

7703373
getter	setter
going through self.name will call getter or setter functions which you are attempting to override

7703446
getter	setter
they have been declared private declare them as public or even better create public getter setter for encapsulation

7703468
getter	setter
also at least from whatever we see there seems to be missing getter setter for accessing it

7703468
getter	setter
while a quickfix for this is to add getter setter and access the field using them or an ugly way is to make the field public

screens	mdpi
if screens compatibility is turned on by setting minsdkversion to 3 it works correctly even on the s2 because it s emulating an mdpi screens

7703592
mdpi	hdpi
does it actually fall back onto mdpi if it cannot find the resource in hdpi

7703592
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
is there a way to force an hdpi device to emulate mdpi without using screens compatibility

7703595
getter	setter
this implies that 90 of all getter setter exposing in class must be deleted and replaced by behavior-contained method

7703595
getter	setter
indeed it corresponds to tell don t ask philosophy because client is not expected to treat behavior itself through help of poor getter setter methods

7703595
getter	setter
one visitor implies class structure to provide getter setter so that visitor can modify object s states without touching to class itself

7703595
getter	setter
when can we consider that a class is closed for modification and thus stop adding behavioral methods on it and so prefer to add them in a newly created visitor with the great risk that client use getter setter instead of behavioral methods already exposed before in initial class

super	self
how this relates to super is that as of python 2.6 super aclass self added the check to make sure that the self reference was indeed an instance of aclass

7704304
super	self
the a.a class had changed to something that my existing instances of a.a were no longer instances of and so super a.a self would begin to raise typeerrors

7704313
post	get
i get a 404 on the post since the cakephp security component is trying to validate the form

listview	gridview
i ve got a listview whose view is switched dynamically in runtime between an icon mode and a grid mode the latter implemented with a gridview

7704706
pow	sqrt
one naive way to do this would be to select sqrt pow tablename.x - x 2 + pow tablename.y - y 2 + pow tablename.z - z 2 as distance for each row in the table and then select the row that has the smallest distance

7704720
pow	sqrt
order by pow tablename.x - x 2 + pow tablename.y - y 2 + pow tablename.z - z 2 without the sqrt

7704767
getter	setter
use of getter and setter is very discussed

7704767
getter	setter
some people like me say you should always use getter and setter to follow the encapsulation principle while others say that you shouldn t since your application would become unmaintainable

7704771

jboss	glassfish
this copy can come from tomcat as in your case or from another servlet-compliant application server such as glassfish jboss jetty or one of the many other existing ones

7705249
rtp	rtsp
since wowza understands only rtp rtsp streams can i just add rtp header infront of each frame data and stream it to wowza

7705277
rtp	rtsp
if wowza requires support for rtsp you have to implement rtsp server and implement rtsp protocol to manage your rtp stream

7705277
rtp	rtsp
you might want to check out vlc if it can acquire video from your camera directly or through your application and re-expose it with rtsp rtp protocol

i have a pretty large directory var www on my linux ubuntu server

7706011
sorting	filtering
for filtering and sorting a good approach is to use json for the ajax response then sort filtering based on that on the client side if you are talking about a smallish number of items probably upto 1000 items

7706037
firefox	safari
the user agent of safari and also firefox in lion is something like

7706127
ssl	https
charles is an http proxy http monitor reverse proxy that enables a developer to view all of the http and ssl https traffic between their machine and the internet

7706136
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
note that the uinavigationbar does not deal with the controllers it should be the other way round rather it deals with the uinavigationitem s which will look different according to if they are on top of the navigation stack or not

7706154
hide	show
the svn ignore pattern hide stuff in the output of svn status only if the item is unknown to svn and would show up as

7706187
translation	localization
in practice you would rely on localization to provide whatever text includes quotation marks and for example a string would get translation to une â chaã neâ in french

7706199
disk	ram
most computers have larger disk storage than ram and in many cases can support a single file too large to fit into ram

7706210
inherited	properties
when building each node it will compose the methods from the code with the inherited properties schema and any non-default properties from the node defined in the mybar struct itself

7706210
inherited	properties
the goal is to create a a system that given a node from an instance of tree can self-analyze its own properties inherited path and identify at which level the properties is defined

7706210
inherited	properties
this is to allow editing of the mybar structure and indicate which properties are inherited as defaults from the base schema and at which level and which ones are explicitly defined in the mybar structure

7706240
16-bit	64bit
the only guarantees are that size_t and unsigned int are both at least 16-bit but likely to be bigger uintmax_t is at least 64bit assuming c99 rules and uintmax_t is at least as wide as any other unsigned type

7706246
post	get
what will happen is that you first call server with your get post request and if the server requires authentication and credentials were not provided inside htttp header it will hopefully respond with 401 response

7706254
typedef	struct
note that it may be anything from a typedef to a class it may also be a simple c-type struct or an enum or a #define

7706276
clang	llvm
except perhaps for a few high-level as in aware of high-level language features or details that aren t encoded in llvm ir optimizations clang s backend does little more than generate straightforward ir and run some set of llvm optimization passes on it

7706284
folder	directory
try changing directory to the folder that git has created

7706307
sorting	filtering
in this case datedisplay column will be shown in original data and filtering will be done by this column but sorting will be done by the values in the datesort column

7706321
avro	thrift
you could use a library such as apache s thrift or avro to handle the binary serialization for you --- in this case you won t have to worry about your raw data being inconsistently encoded in binary

7706334
translation	localization
you would need to store a content id as well as a language id for each the compound key paweå dyda refers to in a separate localization table that provides the translation versions of each content

7706354
ubuntu	debian
i want to build an application that will be compatible with say debian lenny libc postgres oracle and other libs on a different debian ubuntu release

7706406
mdpi	hdpi
it runs brilliantly on real-life phone hardware at both mdpi tested on 480x320 and hdpi tested on 800x480 with the gui staying perfectly proportioned and text staying sharp

7706406
screens	tablet
i ve recently decided to migrate to tablet my intention is to have the app run on tablet with the same screens proportions with crisp graphics but at the very least for 9-patch drawables and text

7706406
screens	tablet	screens	mdpi	tablet	mdpi
i tried to deploy the app on an asus transformer tablet running honeycomb 3.2 it has has a 10.1 screens at 1280x800 which i think is xlarge mdpi

this seems to work fine in ie and google-chrome but firefox 3.6 does not seem to work every time

7706418
firefox	safari
using safari instead of firefox works

7706434

keep in mind however that a you don t know whether the image will be portrait or landscape and b that if you allow to take an image from a photo album you don t have control over the resolution ratio at all

7706438
google-chrome	firefox
is much faster in firefox and google-chrome than

7706440
free	malloc
how do malloc and free work

7706440
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
does the heap always allocate contiguous memory when we call malloc calloc realloc

7706444
hide	show
there is just one annoying problem when the player show the video it sometimes show the top panel and sometime hide it

7706451
free	malloc
how malloc and free work is implementation defined

7706451
free	malloc
the great thing about malloc and free is that you don t need to know how they work

7706451
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
does the heap always allocate contiguous memory when we call malloc calloc realloc

7706470
webclient	httpwebrequest
maybe you should use webclient or httpwebrequest instead of sockets

7706485
capistrano	bundler
is capistrano supposed to install the bundler gem for me or am i supposed to do that myself

7706486
folder	directory
you are trying to create a filestream object for a directory folder

7706624
slideup	slidedown
i m having an issue with jquery and it s slideup and slidedown functions

7706634
background-color	transparency
the background-color of the other tabs is set to transparency padding and borders lost too

7706656
folder	directory
the reason for this has something to do with sqliteopenhelper copying the database from the assets folder in the apk to the application s data directory on the phone if it doesn t already exist

7706665
listview	gridview
on the listview gridview are 3 coloumns name age grade

7706683
submit	submission
you need the grade function on the form s submit handler and it needs to be with grade returning false when it doesn t pass to prevent form submission

7706709
getter	setter
as others have said what you ve shown there is a property which is implemented as one or two methods behind the scenes one for each of the getter and setter

7706712
post	get
this is my first post so lets get into it

7706722
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this with a larger paragraph in ie9 google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 and it looks like only ie9 works as expected

7706770
sysv	systemd
the sysv init systemd in modern ubuntu is legacy support the main startup systemd is upstart which allows you to specify a dependency on mysql

7706770
daemons	systemd
start and stop are controls for daemons managed by the upstart systemd - the control configuration files for these daemons go to etc init

7706840
width	height
in the first example the width and height are from the uicomponent class which actually represents a measured value as provided by the flex framework

7706840
width	height
in the second case the width and height are the actual size of the rendered shape as provided by the flash player

7706840
width	height
if you open the uicomponent s implementation you will notice that it is actually hiding the original meaning of width and height into width and height and provide their own implementation to it

7706840
width	height
every time you draw something in a graphics context the width and height will update accordingly

7706840
width	height
compute the width and height yourself

7706849
multiplying	transpose
instead of multiplying by your transformation matrix you have to multiplying by the transpose of the inverse of the matrix matrix4.transpose matrix4.invert transform there s a good explanation on why here

7706854
uitableview	reloaddata
i think you need call reloaddata method for your uitableview after assigned jokesarray

7706858
min	max
there will be 20 max 10 min users per game

7706858
min	max
specifically how do i poll for a room to have met the requirements i.e 20 max 10 min users

7706864
inherited	subclassing
i ve done this successfully with pages the most base class had authentication logic that all subclassing inherited

7706870

7706872
decoder	encoder
here an encoder decoder in asp

7706886
speex	ogg
i m looking for examples on how to wrap the speex format with the ogg format

7706941
min	max
in the getintwithinrange method you should allow min and max to be valid

7706952
getter	setter
i don t get why i can do all this without having made any setter getter beforehand

7706973
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my php versioning on my host and i think it is causing this error

7707023
getter	setter
the synthesized methods getter and setter are needed to access the instance variables from outside the class

7707060
min	max
diff max angle1 angle2 - min angle1 angle2

7707083
folder	directory
in fallback location you can either put a path like c temp or if you leave it blank then vs will use the temporary directory in your appdata folder

7707085
getter	setter
in objective-c getter and setter are collectively called accessors

7707085
accessor	properties
you don t need to define accessor for simple properties

7707085
accessor	properties
defining a properties will cause the compiler to generate accessor

7707085
getter	setter
for more complex properties getter are nullary methods with typically the same name as the property and setter are unary methods with set prepended to the name

7707085
accessor	properties
the actual accessor may use locks rather than synchronized blocks which can have an affect with recursive properties and exceptions

7707085
accessor	properties	getter	setter
you can override the default accessor names using the getter and setter attributes in the properties declaration

7707092
hide	show
but if i hide the batch.. panel and show single.. panel changeviewbutton click event then the requieredfieldvalidator dropdownlistfieldvalidator doesn t fire up and page is always considered validated

7707102
width	height
however the element i need to style is a textarea box with variable height width

7707130
google-chrome	firefox
after i add google-chrome using browse with.. in visual web developer 2010 express it dissappears from the list of browsers almost right away although browsers like firefox remain in the list

7707146
post	put
i can put the name using post method but i must check if the user is registered in the database and only then i send it s schedule

7707172
int	chars
however this conversion from chars to int is cumbersome and fragile

7707192
superclass	subclassing
superclass implementation is only visible to direct subclassing

7707207
for-loop	loops
you shouldn t need a foreach loops for this if the for-loop is providing the indices

7707245
lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme
lisp and erlang atoms ruby and scheme symbols

7707321
loops	if-statement

7707324
folder	directory
i then store the msbuildcommunitytasks folder in a tools directory in source control

7707360
children	parent
what i m struggling with is the fact that both the child and parent elements are surrounded by another element children and parent respectively

7707363
superclass	subclassing
putting the convergence functionality in a common superclass would mean that the associated behavior and its performance impact would now exist in all subclassing which is definitely not what i want

7707438
post	get
i will post an update once i get further along..

7707521
getter	setter
there is class that makes a string name int age int grade and has getter and setter methods

7707568
jobs	cron
the cron log will tell you when cron jobs are run and changed

7707603
min	max
format is min avg max n number of timer samples in milliseconds

7707614
lisp	smalltalk
sure symbols in ruby come from symbols in smalltalk which in turn gets them from lisp

7707657
rss	feed
everything seems to be working fine but the results show as rss feed in both ie9 and firefox 7

7707657
rss	feed
so apparently browsers have xslt template that makes it appear as rss feed

7707733
pseudo-class	visited
pseudo-class allow it to add and a css name to an element like in a.menu visited

7707736
int	chars
how this works is that the functional part of my program parses a line of input and puts it into the item chars int object

7707755
put	get
edit also player is abstract and i get an error in the child class when i put some of your code in

7707807
int	chars
i want to convert it to the int associated with the chars value of extended ascii code 0-255

although i agree that velocity or freemarker may be a better choice if you really need to render a jsp and capture the output as a string which you could pass to a javamailer check out my tutorial on capturing jsp output

7713152
stdout	stderr
the heroku docs say that anything written to standard out stdout or standard error stderr is captured into your logs

7713411
postgresql	mysql
for the stress testing i ve heard about but haven t used super smack which is a benchmarking and stress testing tool for mysql and postgresql

filtering	grouping
it does this so that there is a notion of a selected item s filtering grouping etc none of which are supported by the ienumerable assigned to the itemssource

7713939
listbox	icollectionview
upon further investigation it appears as though setting issynchronizedwithcurrentitem really only applies to the selected item and all other properties across the two icollectionviews are still synchronized even though each listbox has its own icollectionview - changing the filter or adding a sortdescription to one will add it to the other you learn something new everyday

7713939
listbox	icollectionview
to change this behaviour you need to create the icollectionview for each listbox yourself and then directly modify the filter property for example

7713945
onitemlongclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i have tried to register some listeners directly on the listview instance onitemlongclicklistener oncreatecontextmenulistener onitemclicklistener but none of them is called

you ve already touched upon the test the public api not private thought process and you ve also already mentioned the technique of inheriting from the class and then testing its protected members that way

7716212
public	protected
beneath it all the simple truth is that you consider this implementation detail as that s what a private or protected member is important enough to test directly rather than indirectly via the public api that would use it

7716215
min	max
use the min function insead of max to return the first row in a group vs the last row

7718274
haskell	scheme
since you don t have those benefits with haskell lists its main raison d ãªtre is gone and you might as well use merge sort which guarantees o n log n whereas with quicksort you either have to use randomization or complicated partitioning scheme to avoid o n 2 run time in the worst case

inherited	properties
every function has a prototype properties it s assigned when the function object is created it points to a newly created object that inherited from object.prototype and it has a constructor properties that simply points back to the function itself

7719184
inherited	properties
the purpose of the prototype properties is to give a way to implement inherited using constructor functions

7719184
inherited	properties
this properties is inherited by the instances of foo so you can know which constructor was used to create an object

7719184
inherited	properties
another similar case is when you have two or more levels of inherited using constructors the most common way is used to denote the inherited relationship between the functions is to assign the prototype properties of the second level

7719184
inherited	properties
the above code has several problems first it executes the logic of the parent constructor to create the inherited relationship but that s another story in the above example the constructor properties is also affected since we replace completely the child.prototype object

what your code is doing is continue to work with section 2 without reseting max and min to appropriate values

mouse	keyboard
i want the dialog to remain open for at least 30 seconds and close 30 seconds after the last user input mouse or keyboard is received

7723104
pop-up	dialog	mouse	keyboard
i can implement this by checking the value returned by getlastinputinfo and closing the dialog when this is more than 30 seconds ago but if the dialog pop-up when the user hasn t been at the mouse or keyboard for 30 seconds the getlastinputinfo test passes immediately and the dialog closes again immediately

7723149

google-chrome	firefox
well all of this works properly in every browser google-chrome firefox ie6 ie9 except ie8 the nivoslider loads only the first image shows no caption no navigation

7725021
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would suggest that you add a mouseenter and mouseleave callback to you element as well and have them set a global variable that tells your other callbacks how to handle their events if global variable is true don t hide the popup on mouseleave otherwise hide popup or something like this

7725112
public	protected
i couldn t think of a good naming convention for a protected property with a public getter so i tried to do this

7725133
implements	extends
another differnce between the two is that a class my implements many interfaces but can extends only one abstract class multiple inheritance

7725253
post	put
it definitely is much better to write a php script which the iphone app can interface to with a simple api and sending the details as parameters in a post request or put request rest style api rather than interfacing with the server directly

7725253
post	get
in your iphone app you would then create a native register form using uitextfields and the like and then once the user hits the register button it will execute a post request to send the data to the server and will get back a response which you can see if the data the user entered is valid

7725266
implements	extends
remember a class can extends only one class where as it can implements more than one interface

7725266
implements	extends
you can t extends more than one class in java where as you can implements any number of interfaces

7725267
queue	fifo
in the case of a priority queue the elements are sorted so the first element off the queue is the element with the highest priority or if all the elements have the same priority it leads back to your first question which is no it will not be guaranteed to be in fifo order since many implementations use a heap-sort and the results of the sort will be ambiguous for objects of equal priority since a heap is a linear-representation of a binary tree for two equal child objects there becomes an ambiguous choice between the two children of the root to choose as the new root node when removing the root node from the queue during a pop .

7725267
queue	fifo
in other words objects of the same priority will be grouped together but the order they are popped from the queue may not be in fifo order

7725351
children	parent
pushing and popping any item on a heap simply updates the elements in it in such a way that there is no node where its children are larger than the parent for max heap

7725351
children	parent
in the case where both children have the same priority and one of them must take the place of the parent there is no distinction made on choosing which node to promote

7725362
folder	directory
it is easier to just change apache virtual hosts to point your project folder as the base directory instead of having 2 copies of the same thing and syncing

7725415
boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
however swapping std search for an implementation of a non trivial algorithm boyer-moore as mentioned above or knuth-morris-pratt should have an impact that is larger by several orders of magnitude compared to fine-tuning the return mechanism

7725495
mouseleave	mouseenter
i believe the problem with your implementation is that the mouseenter on the div will fire shortly after the mouseleave from the a

7725501
post	get
i would not recommend this for the simple reason if you are integrating with other systems web services in different parts of the organisation or third-party vendors you ll end up having to deal with strings and int s anyway and you ll have to make your code even more complex by having to wrap names in name objects when you get them from other systems and unwrapping them when you want to post them to other systems

7725507

portrait	landscape
landscape and change layout but when again change mode then simulator change in portrait mode but layout is not change it is used landscape layout

7725684
post	get
first of all lets get your example running your post data is json and the datatype is json but your ci implementation is accessing post variables

7725692
union	distinct
union already returns distinct results so there s no need to do it explicitly.

7725700
textview	imageview
i need to rotate a layout has a textview and imageview and it should be placed align right and top in relativelayout

profiling	debugging
a common approach to debugging memory leaks in .net is to use the sos -extension you ll find some tutorials like this if you do some research or to use a memory profiling like this one

7725791
profiling	debugging
i would try debugging managed memory issues with the clr profiling

7725920
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
cakephp is pretty straightforward like codeigniter and kohana

7725929
post	get
however this always goes through as a get request not a post request and the api server consequently rejects it

7725990
swt	swing
toolkit--like swing or eclipse swt

7726034
integer	fractions
i agree with this for integer numbers of seconds and for format flag s but i think the behavior should be different for format flags that are designed for fractions parts of seconds

7726034
integer	fractions
this would not affect anything for integer numbers of seconds because those are always represented precisely but it would more naturally handle round-off errors for fractions seconds

7726034
integer	fractions
this is how printing of fractions parts is handled in for example c because integer casting rounds down

7726034
integer	fractions
most constructs are designed for integer numbers of seconds and the fractions parts are an afterthought

7726130
post	get
i m pretty sure most of what i did there is wrong so any help would be appreciated even if it is some directions to post which treat simmilar issues so i can try and get it from there

7726145
typemock	moles
you could also use typemock to do the same thing although the licence cost is prohibitory for most people and moles works just fine

7726160
ilist	icollection
secondly arrays implement ilist of t and icollection of t but the methods are implemented explicitly you have to cast and the add insert remove throw not implemented exception

7726168
pop-up	dialog
when the dialog pop-up i click on a file having chinese characters in its path

7726175

7726280
queue	fifo
1- if you want to enforce the fifo ordering when elements have the same priority add a field t to your class it s says when element is added to the priority queue and in operator compare t if two elements had the same priority

7726330
width	height
that is something with a width and height

7726330
width	height
you ll have to pass along the width height with the pointer for safe use

7726330
width	height
you can also avoid this by simply creating a struct to store your image being sure to always initialize maintoin the width and height correctly

7726330
width	height
another trick could be to overallocate float to store the width and height in the buffer itself

7726331
width	height
you can get the browser viewport width and height with javascript and submit them using ajax to the image creation script

7726344

7726349
int	double	int	boolean
is it a boolean an int a double or a string

7726416
post	get
as i understand from the question below it should be possible to use different models for get and post actions

7726416
post	get
related question using two different models in controller action for post and get

7726437
post	get	nsdictionary	restkit
it seems to me that restkit is the easiest way to do this i m trying to avoid converting objects into a set of nsdictionary objects and then using some json encoder to get json which i can post to the server

7726503
post	get
get and post controller actions can easily use whatever types they need to

7726530
post	get
however in development mode i m having trouble doing so - it seems that every post request i make is somehow turned into a options one so i never get the response i want

7726563
post	get
right now all my attempts show either duplicate dates - if there are 3 post in october then i see october 2011 3 times or i only get back one month year combo say oct 2011

7726583

it might be jpeg png or gif

7726600
hash	md5
by default amazon s3 objects have their etag set to the md5 hash of the object

7726600
hash	md5
we can then specify the md5 hash of the xml document inside the getobjectrequest.etagtonotmatch property

7726600
hash	md5
this ensures that when we make the amazons3.getobject call or in my case the async version amazons3.begingetobject and amazons3.endgetobject that if the document being requested has the same md5 hash as is contained in the getobjectrequest.etagtonotmatch then s3 automatically returns the http status code 304 notmodified and the actual contents of the xml document is not downloaded

7726603
x86	64bit
i can t remember exactly but the tortoisesvn version might have been 32-bit version and the tortoisegit version was 64bit located in program files not program files x86

7726628
equals	gethashcode
note that for this to work you need equals and gethashcode implemented for the workingjournal object

7726641
equals	gethashcode
if you have proper equals and gethashcode implementations inside your class you can simply invoke distinct

7726641
equals	gethashcode
this will have you defining equals and gethashcode methods for the t that can then be used by a dictionary or hashset and can also be used in overloads of distinct in linq

7726647
int	boolean
each productgroup has a collection of productgroups called children an int parentid field and a boolean isenabled field

7726832
width	height
i have many divs on a page that the height and width are altered based on the user

7726832
width	height
i know i could manually apply the height and width back to the default but didn t know if there was a way to have jquery apply the class values back to the element that s been modified

7726841
subtract	add
the solution is not only to add the length of externalreferrer to the starting position but to subtract it from the ending position as well

7726857
portrait	landscape
the only downside of this approach is that while it works extremely well for the portrait orientation on iphone you ll need to do a bit of work getting things to look right in landscape and on the ipad

7726858
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working in firefox + google-chrome but ie is proving a pain

7726880
width	height
if you are only having width and height modified try

7726881
uiview	subviews
or a uiview that has two uibutton subviews or at least one uibutton subviews to contain a widget graphic that looks like the disclosure accessory

7726897
int	chars
as currently written this will simply return a vector containing the int representations of the chars themselves not their positions which is what you really want if i read your question correctly

7726911
int	chars
you call the vector you are going to return characterlocations which is of type int when really you are pushing back the chars itself which is type chars not its location

7726912
addclass	removeclass
check out addclass and removeclass

7726936
min	max
i want to group this data by deviceid into buckets of size one day and take the min max and average of the values for that day

7726943
ant	maven
in addition to this you can also use team build to call out to ant or maven using the team foundation server build extensions

7726981
tinyurl	bit.ly
this example adds two context menu items one for shortening a link with bit.ly and one for using tinyurl

7727037
maven	pom.xml
if you declare the compile plugin before the code generator plugin within the pom.xml maven will execute them in the same order. you would use the include filter of the compile plugin to compile only the config classes

7727118
oursql	mysql-python
i tried timing the above oursql code versus similar code using mysql-python

7727145
alertdialog	progressdialog
for dismissing an alertdialog keyboard progressdialog back button is still ok

portrait	landscape
my app is in landscape mode when i open the email sheet that is in portrait- and its ok the keyboard is opened in landscape so i have portrait email sheet and landscape keyboard

7727166
post	get
it works great but the first time i authenticate an user with my app when i request the token i immediately want to post a link to the users wall but then i get this error

7727166
post	get
the second time i try to post something to the wall i get a success there i don t need to request the permissions again

7727194
post	get
and i ve read several post about limits on http get requests which i also think i understand

7727316
children	parent
breaking an association between a parent and its children doesn t kill the children

7727337
post	put	post	get	put	get
however a form submission that is meant to create or update a resource should always be a post or put request not a get

7727339
free	malloc
2 use malloc free

7727353
post	get
i m trying to do some thing like a simple curl function that can do like sending a get post request and set the response text in a label

7727369
factors	matrix
one way is to replicate the names out by row number and index directly with the matrix then wrap that with factors to restore the levels

7727388
git-rebase	amend
you can use an interactive git-rebase in stead of an amend and edit an earlier commit

7727410
int	chars
obviously however these rules apply to pointers to objects not primitives like int or chars

7727411
children	parent
you can solve this issue if clean the collection list set that presents your children elements in parent class

7727425
post	get
all works fine but i am trying to build in a message pre-the server post so is there a way that just before my jquery function returns true to get it to pause for 5 seconds and display a message

it isn t fun writing a bunch of javascript that show hide fields based on type

7727583
jqgrid	datatables
you could look into jqgrid or datatables my favorite

7727589
hash	md5
if a pki solution is too heavy an alternate strategy without using encryption could be for clients to ship with a secret guid which when they login which will send an md5 hash version of the guid and the current time as well as the unhashed version of the time

7727589
hash	md5
if the time is within a specified threshold and the md5 hash is valid then their using an authenticated client

7727607
versioning	upgrade
i know the newest php build has a shorthand for arrays but unfortunately that won t do because my web hoster won t let me upgrade to that php versioning

i know jpql is a subset of hql

7727620
jpql	hql
are there any practical usecases please give examples that really need hql specific features to be used that means it is impossible or considerably difficult with jpql to implement them

slideup	slidedown
i am doing a small slideup slidedown animation here

7727930
mouseleave	mouseenter
but the problem is if the user do mouseenter mouseleave continuously after he done with it the animation is still happens

7727933
min	max
i am more interested in excel like features like if else sum min max not just simple arithmatic

7727960
scatter	graphing
this seems like quite a common use case - basically i want to display a scatter graphing along with its line of best fit

7727967
hide	show
so if you re attempting to call show or hide from another thread you do indeed need to invoke it

7727992
maven	pom.xml
pom.xml rfproj1 line 1 maven configuration problem

7727994
int	double
ok so double corresponds to class real and 2 corresponds to int dim

7727994
int	double
sure enough double is a type and 2 is an int so that works properly

7728027
ant	maven
i am not a maven user i ve always got away with using ant and don t feel i should need to mavenise my project purely in order to be able to use spring batch

7728056
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
subclassing of the abstract-class can extend the superclass and so on and call a method through using a base type variable

7728056
superclass	subclassing
i was reading the book and the author said using a superclass variable to reference a subclassing and calling a common method calls the correct method

7728068
awt	swing
you re trying to do awt graphics in a swing program -- don t do this

7728068
awt	swing
here s an sscce that shows awt vs swing animation though unfortunately i don t see much difference between the two as i d hoped

7728073
ant	maven
use the maven ant tools or ivy to connect an ant built to the maven dependency repository system

7728092
width	height
create a matrix containing quadrant elements where each quadrant represents an n m space within your system with n and m being the width and height of the widest and tallest rectangles respectively

7728108
superclass	subclassing
you can decide what have to be declared in subclassing and what you want declare in the superclass

7728169
subclass	abstract-class
you would use an abstract-class in cases where you do want to specify certain behaviour but don t want anybody to instatiate it directly but having to subclass it

7728209
subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class can be full bodied or the skeleton for the subclass

7728209
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing	implements	extends
you define your template in the abstract-class and its left for the subclassing to extends and implements the methods defined in the superclass

7728226
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
you can only free what you malloc calloc and possibly realloc later on

7728256
vb.net	vb6
they re using vb6 and occasionally vb.net

7728259
put	get
you use the stadardoutput and optionally standarderror to get the output and put it at the screen any way you want

7728281
switching	screens
if you didn t want to switching to a relativelayout i would think you could use android layout_weight attributes to distribute screens real estate

7728334
google-chrome	firefox
so the question is how would i get this rather simple animation to work smoothly in firefox and google-chrome

7728385
put	get
none of the code is tested but i just hoped that i could use information from the web to try to put something basic together that with a little bit of tweaking might get something working for you

7728385
post	get
from then on once the user has accepted you can make simple api calls get and post as shown in the example at the moment it s showing

7728394
prepare	execute
prepare statements are execute server-side in two calls a prepare call and an execute call

7728412
uiview	subviews
would making custom uiview added as subviews be the best approach

7728454
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have this div and i have set its z-index 99999 its working fine on firefox and safari but when i ma testing it on google-chrome the footer is not the top element

7728456
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
try it in ie and you ll hit the same-origin policy instead as ie doesn t implement cors on xmlhttprequest but on a ie-specific xdomainrequest that gwt doesn t try to deal with â too much runtime overhead for something cross-origin requests that s very rarely used and that everyone thinks ie should fix insteadâ

7728531
inherited	properties
if you have a static properties in a base class that is inherited and you are trying to determine the type of the child class that you are in you can t do this with a static properties

7741023
width	height
i m trying to split a large html page into smaller fixed height and width chunks pages

7741033
width	height
but one important thing i noticed here thanks to matthew steeples answer here is that since the block of code that i have tested has not used the variables height and width except for assignment in the if-else and if blocks of code block-1 and 2 respectively the compiler has optimized the il code by completely removing the if and if-else blocks in question thus showing invalid results for our test here

7741033
width	height
i have updated both the code blocks to write the values of both height and width to a file thus using them again and forcing the compiler to run our test blocks i hope but you can observe from the code that the actual file writing part does not effect our test results

7741081
ready	each
it explicitly shows in a ready format what the strings should be for each case

7741116
width	height
as per performance in block #1 height and width are initialized with null values but then assigned anyway regardless of condition

7741136
portrait	landscape
why would an additional landscape version of the custom sectionheaderview be added in the portrait view only on the iphone 3g

7741154

swt	swing
it contains functionality we need but depends on swt and eclipse rcp so it might be too much effort to embed it into existing swing application

7741273
x86	64bit
a simpler solution was to recompile my assemblies with the platform target set to anycpu instead of x86 thus making them acceptable for a 64bit system running sql server

7741276
accessor	properties
also there is only a get properties accessor not a set

7741285
hide	show
depending on the country selected i want to hide show certain fields

7741285
hide	show

7741291
post	get
i think someone who wrote a definitive post on using jquery plugins with wordpress would get a lot of very grateful traffic

7741347
mouseover	mouseout
you are going to have to create a custom component and write mouseover and mouseout handlers for the component that is supposed to trigger the tooltip

7741361
dictionary	map
however if you press another tab bar item i.e news go back to the map and press the list button the dictionary is empty

disk	ram
without knowing a lot more about your tables amount and distribution of data etc. and your system ram disk etc. it s really really hard to give a globally valid statement

7741422
mouseover	mouseout
you would use a timeout instead of an interval and just clear it on mouseover and reset it on mouseout

7741433
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when using google-chrome firefox or safari the form does appear

7741444

mouseover	mouseout
i m trying to make an ajaxcontroltoolkit accordion control change the header style on mouseover and mouseout

7741471
inline	member-functions
without reading the passage it s a little hard to say exactly what s going on here but if squarematrix is a templated wrapper class around a template base-class squarematrixbase and the purpose of squarematrix is to basically pass the appropriate template parameters to the base-class as well as provide a couple non-static data-members for the functions of the base-class to operate on then you can since the member-functions of squarematrix will basically be simple functions that are just calling the functions defined in the base-class inline all the member functions for squarematrix

7741471
int	double
so will only need to be instantiated for types such as int double etc

7741489
chunked	transfer-encoding
this works perfectly fine if content-encoding is specified in the response headers but some servers instead return transfer-encoding chunked and no content-encoding header

7741499
scraper	web-scraping
however i would say since what we need to acquire via web-scraping is application specific most of the time it may be more efficient to scraper whatever you need from a web response stream

7741531
int	double
the conversion operator template in the following code works for int float and double but fails when used with std string .

7741539
imperative	declarative
jquery is an imperative library not a declarative one â as a rule it only operates on currently existing elements with the exception of live event handlers but that s not your use case

post	get
on well-behaved browsers we catch the beforeunload event and post a message to our front-end that says this client is going away. on other browsers we may not get the event or we may not be able to listen to it for various implementation reasons like the browser sends it too often fffuuuu ie or once we get the event the xhr we send may get swallowed

7741737
post	get
it can get post from a url asynchronously and for storage if the data set is small enough look at nsuserdefaults

post	put
i have a page where users put their own post users are able to markup their post with tags like

7741902
for-loop	loops
the for-loop initializes i 1 first before starting loops so it s more like writing a while loops like this

7741930
getchar	fgetc
i know that getchar just ultimately calls fgetc stdin

7741943
getter	setter
instead you can do it with object members through getter setter or properties

7741943
getter	setter
defining getter and setter

7741949
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
using getelementbyid to get select and getelementsbytagname to read options

7741959
int	chars
the complexity comes in the fact that if your framing bytes appear in your array of int you must escape the bytes prepend and escape chars

7741964
google-chrome	firefox
at any rate the glow doesn t appear in firefox or google-chrome it just seems to be appearing in ie

7742011
rss	feed
i have the following code which works well when i try to get the date from any rss feed using universal feed parser

7742012
xapian	whoosh

this is simple to do using tcp so i have used tcp multithreading just wanted to grasp how udp works this way

7742037
coalesce	isnull
you could use isnull or coalesce depending in which context you need it

7742038
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
i want the thrown exception to be the original one i caught if it was nullpointerexception then i want the throw to be nullpointerexception and not runtimeexception as it now

7742089
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
it will be - runtimeexception is just a reference to the original object which will be whatever subclass of runtimeexception was originally thrown e.g nullpointerexception

7742100
getchar	fgetc
i know that getchar just ultimately calls fgetc stdin

7742100
getchar	fgetc
getchar and getc might as well expand to the actual procedure of reading from a file with fgetc implemented as

7742103
hide	show
i ve gotten a radio button hide unhide system done to just show either one table or the other but now i m stuck on how to populate my tables with data from some files

7742149

you will need to have an ssl certificate purchased and installed to handle https you should be able to get one from your domain name provider which you will then need to install on your hosting server

7742160
submit	submission
this sort of thing can also happen if the user double-clicks on the submit button and triggers two form submission

width	height
width or height could be less but not more

7742188
fflush	gets
on the sender side create the output stream send the data as you have done and then don t forget to close the stream again this will also perform a fflush which ensure the data gets sent over the wire and informs the other end that there is no more data to come

7742189
google-chrome	firefox
for an example you test whether text boxes for username and password on login page appear exactly same in firefox and google-chrome as they appear on ie

7742208

the more default security you remove the more you have to think about what you do with the input provided through urls get request querystrings post request data http headers and so on.

7742216
ubuntu	linux
my operating system is linux ubuntu 11.04

7742229

pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario

7742262
width	height
note if a width and height are provided that violate the imageâ s

7742262
portrait	landscape
landscape square or portrait and then

7742262
width	height	portrait	landscape
landscape or square uses width portrait uses height to recalculate

7742262
width	height
in your case the primary dimension will be a width of 77 and thus your height limit of 57 will be ignored

7742309
versioning	upgrade
on numpy 1.4.1 this was giving me the error but i just upgrade to the git 2.0 versioning and it works fine

7742312
maven	pom.xml
yes log4j is not explicitly declared in this pom.xml and i think it should be but i would like to better understand the way maven works

7742344
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
nginx lighttpd and there s also a module for apache allows you to pass a header with a filepath name to the server and it will send the file directly from the server itself and so not need to use php resources to do it

7742372
int	chars
the data type for your primary key will make a slight difference 200m still fits into a 4 byte int but an 8 byte bigint will be slightly larger and a chars 100 would be more wasteful etc

7742383
folder	directory
download httpproxypackage.jar copy it into web-inf lib and configure it like so in web-inf web.xml this is for the stockwatcher tutorial assuming your web root is the folder that contains the stockwatcher directory

7742399
ceil	floor
also checkout floor and ceil as alternatives to round as they are often useful when writing pagination calculations

7742401
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
i understand and enjoy the meta-game of arguments that explain why construct x in lisp scheme or any object-oriented language isn t necessary in haskell because one just does y

7742403
accessor	properties
msdn says if the text properties contains nothing the get accessor returns the value of the value properties

7742488
getter	setter
the selectableapple class is just a plain c# class without logic and public getter and setter for all the properties

7742489
centos	linux
i install jenkins on a new machine linux centos

7742493
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i have read about problems that onclicklistener will consume onitemclicklistener events like here or here

7742548
versioning	upgrade
you can t force autoupdate but you can pass api versioning along with the server response and have extension notify users to upgrade if it is outdated response versioning doesn t match hardcoded into extension versioning

7742559
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is best seen on a google-chrome browser safari and firefox take care of this

7742560
hash	salt
1 client sends hash hash password salt salt2 timestamp and timestamp

7742560
hash	salt
2 server retrieves hash password salt from the database and compares

7742560
hash	salt
note that if you are on the network where attackers can not only sniff but also modify the traffic as paulo pointed out you should sign every message hash hash password salt salt2 timestamp message and check it at server

7742569
folder	directory
inside the linux server i entered into a folder which is a web application this is consisting of a number of sub directory with in it

7742615

public class msurface extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

7742615
width	height
public void surfacechanged surfaceholder holder int format int width int height

7742639
put	get
no matter what the load impact is i would still compile it to css before you put it online otherwhise people with js disabled will get nothing

7742670
ienumerable	icollection
if you re going to expose something expose an icollection or ienumerable and resolve it internally to an array

7742720
margin	height
possible solution thanks for the help add a padding-top 1px and a margin-top -1px this way the 100 height doesn t gets ruined with the scrollbars and your are avoiding margin collapsing

7742726

i want to select rectangles and drag them in canvas move and resize them

7742825
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome crashed and firefox was slow not tested on others browsers

7742826
children	parent
and now i had only the parent node the children doesn t be coleected.

7742835
profiling	debugging
if it is for debugging or profiling purposes you could use the unmanaged clr profiling or debugging api

7742852
rspec	capybara
i m writing some automated tests using capybara rspec i choose configure the driver by using this little bit of ruby

7742868
post	get
you need to use to get parameter from a post form

7742882
inherited	base-class
if you want to make the interface for ifastcar drive call your inherited car drive function then you will need to delegate that inherited function as you ve done within a version of fastcar drive that specifically calls its base-class version of drive

7742912
vim	emacs
both of these integrate with emacs and vim

7742936
versioning	upgrade
and while you can not upgrade system library to versioning 4.1 you can include httpclient jar to your android project as the additional benefit this would allow you to not depend on google bug fixes and vendor updates

7742947
mouse	keyboard
select isn t meant to be used this way â there are hacks you can use to get this kind of behavior in most cases like tracking mouse and keyboard events on the select but thereâ s no guarantee theyâ ll keep working or work on every platform

7742956
ienumerable	ilist
if you want to preserve changes you have to materialize your data first using tolist and then return the list as an ienumerable or ilist

7742962
mvp	presenter
this is similar to the presenter interface called back by the view in the mvp â part ii article to notify the presenter

7742973
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately the latest version of firefox 7 and possibly some earlier versions do not allow adjustment of the margins at least not in the ubuntu linux version

7742985
pull	push
the samples i read all work in a pull manner whereas my scenario would require a push approach

7742989
implements	extends
or you could make a superclass of where your method is implements and extends all your activities from it

7742999
width	height
your input image should have the same width and height like the video output

7743003
move	drag
to achieve the simulation of a drag enter event when a thumb object is move over another component i ve had to do this

7743096
draggable	droppable
i created a widget builder app where you can drag widgets draggable onto a widget builder droppable

7743109
getter	setter
this behaviour in the case of byref vs byval usage is easily solved by choosing appropriate byval keyword however hase recently noticed a more insidious behaviour one that has caused a stack overflow of repeated calls since the setter call would update a value that called the getter only

7743109
getter	setter
in the previous example calling dosomething would fire the aproperty getter method but then after that usage would fire the setter method which by program logic calls dosomething again

7743114
range	min	range	max	min	max
for example if you are going to only have integers between a range of min and max values as a criteria then the problem becomes simpler

7743114
min	max
you only need to know the field name and the min max values to describe a criterian not the full where statement.

7743205
put	get
that said you can put an opc server client architecture on top of that to get a bit more powerful communication

7743262
awt	swing
addendum this overview suggests how pervasively the interface java.beans.propertychangelistener is used throughout awt and swing

7743340
jtextfield	jlabel
i have created a jtextfield and inserted a jlabel above it and defined the lock icon for the jlabel

7743340
jtextfield	jlabel
if the jtextfield is editable then the jlabel appears fine as the image above shows but if the jtextfield is not editable then the image does not appear at all

7743383
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization can be tricky especially when you have lots of nested components

7743402
versioning	upgrade
before i ve been using carbon emacs as the versioning 1 of starter kit recommends but versioning 2 does requires me to upgrade emacs 24

7743449
width	height
i have the width and height set with vertical-align middle

7743470
hash	salt
hash hash password salt salt2 timestamp where hash password salt is stored in the database and salt2 is newly generated makes sure than an attacker can t get the password or any data which will be useful for logging in after the timestamp expires it alone does not prevent an active attacker to hijack the session after the authentication and send any soap requests wanted and intercept the responses

7743470
hash	salt
if you have only one message to send you can instead use the mac as a kind of symmetric signature using the password hash salt and generated with a slow hash function as a mac key

7743491
zend-paginator	zend-db
loosely couple zend-paginator to other zend framework components so that users who wish to use it independently of zend-view zend-db etc

7743543
pop-up	dialog
usually my wpf dialog are all contentcontrols that get displayed in a pop-up

7743595
hide	show
i usually try avoid global variables within jquery plug-ins for functions like your show and hide but the critical part is elements

7743597
int	chars
unsigned chars will be promoted to unsigned int

7743617
isnull	nullif
or isnull something nullif ... 0 0 to get null instead

7743667
int	double	nsinteger	double
otherwise use a pod like nsinteger int or double

7743742
weka	libsvm
you can also use svm directly from libsvm which weka actually wraps

7743743
lisp	scheme
i m baffled by trying to create the equivalent of this trivial in common lisp macro in mit scheme

7743743
lisp	scheme
also references to good tutorials not references on scheme s macro system that start with small simple examples and build up with ample commentary and in particular show how to convert backquote-comma style lisp macros which to me are highly intuitive to scheme s syntax macro system would be great

7743762
put	get
i just need to get my welcome message to stay put on every page

7743842
int	chars
it s only a modifier for int short chars

7743842
int	chars	unsigned	short
the unsigned keyword can be used as a modifier for int short chars or long

7743852
stdout	stderr
the standard streams stdout and stderr cannot be closed and you silence the warning with quiet

7743855
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie9 google-chrome firefox and safari but client is stuck on ie 7 and 8

7743859
int	double
the precise size of these variables depends on your system s architecture 32 bit verses 64 bit so you need to confirm the correspondence between int floats and double in c and fortran on your system

7743865
int	chars
i think it was chosen as a separate keyword since it can be applied to any int type chars int long long long thereby achieving with one keyword what would have required four more

7743876
intersect	contains
two arrays contains objects is not returning intersect when using between the arrays

7743980
google-chrome	firefox
edit this seems to be firefox specific a quick solution is to use google-chrome instead

7744033
unsigned	short
the keywords signed unsigned short and long are type modifiers specifier and when one of these type modifiers specifier is used by itself a data type of int is assumed

7744047
opera	firefox
unfortunately firefox and opera do not easily support multi-line tooltips

7744067
public	protected
is auth_person_2 a private function or public or protected function

7744168
spaces	delimiter
in fact i just now ran it and it also read the line that you indicated would not work and it reads just two words since the operator in that case will use white spaces as a delimiter for the string

7744168
spaces	delimiter
a possible reason for the failure is if the line preceding the +lda #5 line has more than three words delimiter by spaces

7744192
inherited	properties
in the real world as commenters have stated you would typically not use inherited in this scenario but instead use properties to differentiate based on age or gender

7744193
public	protected
in this case auth_person1 2 would be private check_person1 2 would be protected and get_person would be public

7744197
eazfuscator	dotfuscator
you could also use .net reactor another obfuscator service that goes well beyond both eazfuscator and dotfuscator in capabilities but it does have a cost

7744220
put	get
i ve tried a variety of different things but i really don t know what to put in for data and keyfunc and get it to return the groups of data i want in a print statement

7744229
ssl	https
the browser does a lot of work for you regarding ssl certificates when you visit a site using https

7744236
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i recommend you try different web browsers safari firefox google-chrome and see what results you get

7744263
public	protected
everything bellow the method private is private until you call one of the other methods private public or protected

7744350
client-side	server-side
however as detailed here dart is intended for server-side as well as client-side use

7744382
stdout	stderr
a simple way can be redirecting both stderr and stdout to the file like this

7744400
ubuntu	linux
i work in my office on ubuntu linux operating system

7744414
post	get
for example what if the feed includes a paragraph of text it ll be impractical for me to post that as a get request and then urldecode the entire thing

7744432
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i html validated it and it looks just the way i want it to in firefox but in google-chrome and safari the #main div doesn t have the background color showing and the break tag with css set to clear both doesn t clear the way it does in firefox

7744436
int	double
also i would like to receive different var types int long double and still be able to use the same code

7744479
jar	manifest.mf
if it were a jar file then it had to be specified in the class-path entry in jar s meta-inf manifest.mf file

7744489
rtsp	sdp
i ve tried sending the same rtsp packets to a port 5006 on localhost over udp then providing ffmpeg with the sdp file that tells it which local port the video stream is coming in on and how to decode the video if i understand rtsp streaming correctly

7744493
oncreate	ondestroy
the safest bet is to cancel the notifications you have running in both the ondestroy and oncreate methods

width	height
you can see that to handle sizing child views which supply match_parent as the height when the linearlayout is set to wrap_content the linearlayout pretends to have an absolute height recalculates the child height and then reuses the child width from the previous measure pass

7744498
width	height
basically your image is calculating height and width unconstrained and getting default width and height and then having height recalculated but being forced to use the old width

wordpress	mybb
it utilizes mybb as the base forum package but integrates seamlessly with wordpress

7744575
unsigned	short
note what s missing no signed or unsigned keywords no short long or long double

7744575
unsigned	short
when other types were added later it made sense to add specifiers like unsigned short and long to the existing type names rather than introducing new keywords which might have broken existing code

7744575
integer	unsigned
perhaps there would be a single keyword for each fundamental type that s the approach taken by c# for example or perhaps the fundamental type names would use some more coherent scheme rather than a jumble of keywords say int 2 for a 2-byte integer unsigned 4 for a 4-byte unsigned integer

for-loop	loops
my guess is in the parser there is a for-loop over the csv file that constantly updates the session on the bright side at least they realized to comment out initializing the models in the iteration loops and add them before

7744713
width	height
canvas .attr id options.id .css width options.width height options.height

7744713
width	height
you are setting the css width height of the canvas when you need to be setting the width and height attributes directly

7744713

detecting whether the text is wrapping is easy enough in principle -- you set the iframe width wait for the fb code to adjust the content and then read the height

7744920
range	minimum
however i wish to add another condition of minimum stay if the date range has a date in it and rateid form another table called minimum stay

7745752
post	get
before the block where you get the data from post and replace every equal sign after the where in your query with the keywork like

i think the underlying issue is with the way dictionary are handled after the map definition has been compiled

7745810
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and ie9 but for some reason firefox sees the input elements as undefined

7745818

also it would probably be better practice to show and hide your content rather than adding and removing html

7745823

for deleting something via a collection a post or put to that collection would be more appropriate

7745869
hash	salt
i am storing the password in my database using a sha2-512 hash with a 128 bit random salt

7745919
ssl	https
the best thing to do is to perform this action over ssl https so that the entire transaction is encrypted and the authentication only happens on the server

7745919
hash	salt
the web server decrypts the data and passes it to your server-side authentication function where you look up the user and associated salt perform password + salt + hash and compare it to the stored hash for a match

7745919

7747077
realloc	fgetc
fgetc gets anything else and line is already completely filled then you realloc new memory for line and grow the current line to be more specific it is practical to double the size of line in this step

7747077
realloc	fgetc
so basically you need to inform yourself about fgetc and realloc and combine these two functions and some auxiliary functions to get what you want

7747133

int	chars
i thought shift operator shifts the memory of the int or the chars on which it is applied but the output of the following code came a surprise to me

7747410
getter	setter
the only alternative way i can think of would involve editing or extending and creating your own db set the db_result class to use getter setter instead of direct fields - perhaps with call_user_func_array

7747451
put	get
but because there are 100 settings and their respective get set functions i didn t want to put them all under the circuitcontroller class

7747468
waitpid	fork
fork is thread-safe as long as you only execute async-signal-safe operations such as execve and _exit in the child process and only call waitpid with an explicit pid to avoid stealing a zombie from another part of the program

versioning	upgrade
the best would be to upgrade to the latest versioning if possible

what you do need to do is make the a the same height and resolve the padding and margin to taste

7747646
filtering	grouping
seems like grouping table has only 1 field gid as indexable which makes it impossible to filtering user grouping in fql

7747684
post	get
i am confused about php post redirect get

libpcap	wireshark
actually i was trying to parse pcap file to display its content in almost similar manner to wireshark without libpcap library purely in haskell by opening the pcap file in binary format and read byte by byte but i could not get any further

7747924
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
if you use the defined library functions malloc and free instead of new and delete then you can use realloc though in most cases that you would care about the size difference it s just going to copy for you anyway

7747925
hash	salt
when you first store the password hash the password with a stored salt as is commonly done

7747925
hash	salt
the client will hash the plaintext password with the stored salt then the random salt and send the hash to the server

7747925
hash	salt
the server will hash the stored password with the random used in that request salt and compare

7747925
hash	salt
this is secure because it ensures that the hash being transmitted is unique to the request it uses a single-request random salt so a login cannot be faked in the future simply by sending the hash again

convert the mixed wav to mp3

so would generate an nsarray of random int would generate an nsarray of random chars etc

hash	md5
i ve done some searching and found that most people suggest setting a hidden field in the form and a session variable with a md5 hash value and check for it on form submission

7748349

but that doesn t seem very secure because the md5 hash value can be seen in the source of the form in the hidden value

7757048
width	text-align
the difference in the way text-align center works between the two is down to the width

7757048
width	text-align
in a block element because the element s width is independent of the content the content can be positioned within the element using the text-align style

7757048
width	text-align
once you specify a width for it you will be able to center the text within that width using text-align center

7757079

for callgrind the profiler in valgrind there is an option --toggle-collect function to allow you to collect information inside a particular function and all its children

7757276
qtableview	qtablewidget
try to use qtableview instead of qtablewidget

7757292
pow	sqrt
jared s right and in this specific case the cycles spent in the pow calls and the sqrt call would be in the range of 2 orders of magnitude more than the cycles spent in the call to distance

7757323
stringstream	fstream
note the left hand side of the operator can be any stream type such as std fstream or std stringstream so it becomes a generalized mechanism for serialization of objects

7757346
getter	setter
when you use properties calling self.property actually calls the generated setter and getter and those work as specified on the property

7757359
std	ostream
a better and probably sane overload would be for std ostream as

7757367
std	ostream	ostream	istream
they re also commonly overloaded as streaming operators then means stream out stream in â with stream type on the left side std ostream or std istream and any other type on the right side

7757369
put	get
if other people view your webpage in a browser that does not have the console.log function they will get an error and your js will stop running it is normally a good idea to put calls to the console.log function inside a conditional that checks for the existance of that function

lseek	ftell
calculate the size using lseek ftell

7757518
innodb	myisam

7757724
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome co but doesn t work in internet explorer - the image returned is too large

7757724

equals	gethashcode
dictionary uses gethashcode of the key to determine in which data bucket to store an object and then equals to make sure that the objects are actually equals

7757783
equals	gethashcode
in other words for this to work you will need to implement gethashcode and equals for your type

7757795
equals	gethashcode
you need to implement gethashcode and equals in the key class or provide an implementation in the constructor of the dictionary

7757795
equals	gethashcode
in the case of the comparer you would define proper gethashcode and equals methods inside the comparer for test with the benefit that these implementations are not universal for all test objects but can be used at will when necessary such as for use in dictionaries hashsets various linq queries etc. by decoupling the equality and hashcode functions from the class you are then free to use different implementations of the comparer as the need arises

7757809
spaces	delimiter
for the above i might say threshold .3 and delimiter are spaces and

7757882
width	height
i don t know how you re placing the image size you may need to change the height and width by and

7757935
put	get
so you should then also check for sql injection if you are going to put entered text into your queries. hopefully by adding more content and reproducing a previous answer maybe i ll get more upvotes.

7758027
subtract	add
to answer the second part of your question if you want to add a padding of say 5px around the edge of your .ad-basic-cell divs you ll need to subtract at least 10px from the width in order to do so

7758033
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is completing before any of the divs are clicked so i is equal to the final value from loops for all the click handlers and as a result all the id s are set to the same value

7758057
fgets	getchar
instead use fgets to read data from stdin into a string and then parse that or use getchar to read a character at a time

so i am using opengl which typedefs unsigned integer - gluint

7758285
integer	unsigned
for some reason it feels wrong to sprinkle my program with gluint instead of the more generic unsigned integer or uint32_t

7758356
width	height
the ipad is always reporting its width as 768px and its height as 1024px so you have to find out how it is rotated with orientation and use min-device-height 1000px like so

7758486
bash	subshell
reading multiple lines in bash without spawning a new subshell

7758524

7759440
stdout	stderr
as described in chapter 17 of the python library reference communicate opens pipes for stdin stdout and stderr starts up the subprocess and waits for the process to terminate

7760129
google-chrome	safari
and this works perfectly in google-chrome and safari

7760130
setinterval	settimeout
because of the nature of requestanimationframe you should never queue animations using a setinterval or settimeout loop

7760130
setinterval	settimeout
if you continue to queue animations via setinterval or settimeout while animation is paused all of the queued animations will begin playing when the window tab regains focus

7760156

7760353
munin	cacti
also look at monitoring tools such as cacti munin collectd so you can understand the load on your servers

7760409
google-chrome	firefox
the reason why your original code works in google-chrome but not in ie and some versions of firefox is that the tag has a click method in the latter two but not in google-chrome

7761564
public	protected
i thought that a public inheritance would still give me access to protected methods and variable and assumed the same would be true for structs

7761564
public	protected
i checked to see if this was the only issue by changing the protected to public but the same errors still pop up

7761571

7765037
punctuation	words
the levenshtein distance has been suggested to me but this seems like it wouldn t cope well with longer strings considering differences in punctuation choices whitespace etc.--missing the first words would wreck the entire algorithm even if every other words were perfect

7765043
int	chars
i think you can use atoi to get the chars converted to int

7765059
awt	swing
the first advice i would offer is don t mix swing awt components

7765059
awt	swing
try updating the oracle forms jar to a swing version or failing that use only awt components in your code

7765086
ant	maven
what i am currently considering is using fabric with cygwin on the windows machines and use ant tasks in maven to orchestrate it all

7765093
width	margin

this number can be either a int double or any other numeric type

7765903
ccscene	cclayer
so you might be able to create a cclayer to use as your root layer and add two children to it - a root ccscene and a cclayer for your gui with a higher z order

7765903
ccscene	cclayer
if you give it the ccscene child of your root cclayer it may not draw the cclayer and its gui child

use instrumentation with the time profiling instrumentation or the sample process button in activity monitor to get a profiling of your app during the period and see what s keeping it busy

7766231
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason this works fine in google-chrome but it wonâ t update in firefox

7766231
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome but just wonâ t change anything on firefox inside the updatepanel

7766246
range	max
else if you need max performance and if it is acceptable you can document your setter and state that all values outside the range are just ignored

7766256
int	double
hence arithmetic double int will fail

7766298
mouseleave	mouseenter
using jquery prototype or probably several of the others also gives you the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are normally ie-only but they re emulated by libraries like jquery and prototype on other browsers which are useful for hover effects because they don t bubble

7766303
google-chrome	firefox
my code must work in firefox google-chrome and ie8 - i experimented with sendasbinary but unsucessfully

7766331
selecteditem	selectedindex
unfortunately selectedindex selecteditem are not virtual so you would need to hide them with the new modifier and reproduce the logic from the base class

7766424
put	get
get the one navigation controller and that put into appdelgate.xib and which view after loading to display that class is set on them after into appdelegate.h file you create the object of the navigation controller and then after into appdelegate.m file following code to implement

from the page i need to post the data from jquery ajax and i have did if data s are valid then my django valid get true and perform the task and return the json value

7766644
width	height
the weights are just relative ratios of the entire span width height

7766644
min	max
in this case you must set the layout_height of the linearlayout to wrap_content and you will be subject collapsing depending on the whim of the layout system meaning you need to then use min max constraints

7766670
decoder	encoder
i think i need some decoder encoder

7766673

how does tension relate to cubic splines interpolation

7766857
interpolation	splines
i am referring to this article for cubic splines interpolation

i love stackoverflow.com because i can post questions and get

7766968
put	get
anyway i want to thank those who put in the effort to get past their paranoia as somebody said in the comments

7766968
put	get
just to get things clear and put some people s hearts at ease i know the reasons for not using goto

7767262
pylons	pyramid
i know python quite decently and some of its frameworks pylons pyramid django tornado

7767287
folder	directory
you ll have to move into into another directory mate everything in the initializers folder will get included at boot time

7767307
width	font-size
when styling fluids layouts and resizable text web pages you must have always in mind the relevant font-size for em s units and containing block width percent units of current styled elements

7767307
width	font-size
that s a loose of time to always have to be alert of which is the width of the parent element or if you have modified the font-size for the current element or one of its ancestors

7767323
datamapper	activerecord
implements something similar to datamapper instead of activerecord

7767342
free	malloc
are you sure all elements you are trying to free have been allocated with malloc

7767424
hide	show
why does firefox show and hide text so slowly

7767447
jobs	cron
so currently i can not setup cron jobs to run my code as php5

7767450
int	chars
note that there is no need to convert anything to hex - you can just compare chars or int values directly since a hex constant such as 0x3f is just another way of representing an int value

7767463
google-chrome	firefox
my web app works fine on firefox or google-chrome but not in ie

7767539
width	height
i accomplished this by determining the window dimensions then setting the dialog width and the iframe height accordingly

7767539
width	height
the following code may not be the nicest but it works and can easily be altered to make the width and height a percentage less than the window

7767582
put	get
try to get file from resources then put in uri.fromfile

7767610
implements	extends
try having your activity extends the below abstract class instead and then implements the abstract methods next and previous with the functionality you want for the fling

7767622
google-chrome	firefox
i have used xdebug pugin for firefox and google-chrome extension but both seems not working after i have installed them

7767633
uilabel	uibutton
using uibutton instead of uilabel might help

7767673
int	chars
in addition if the expression is a constant expression â 15.28 of type byte short chars or int

7767686
int	double
so structs fall into the same category as int double etc

7767772
httprequest	httpresponse
this isn t fun to hand-code you may want to look at using httprequest and httpresponse classes instead to handle this for you

7767789
iprincipal	iidentity
the attribute works when the thread principle and the httpcontext user object are set with a suitable iprincipal and iidentity

7767789
iprincipal	iidentity
also since thread s iprincipal and iidentity are used by microsoft it could have been any large company with a large user base it s battle tested code

7767792
profiler	yourkit
i think a good practical approach is to use a memory profiler such as yourkit

7767811
portrait	landscape
i have a view controller in cocoa touch that detects when the device rotates and switches between the views of the 2 view controllers it has landscape and portrait

7767811
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i want the uiviewcontroller in it to be able to access the frrrotatingviewcontroller in a similar way as all uiviewcontroller can access the uinavigationcontroller they re in

7767861
installation	upgrade
i m changing my installer from nsis to msi using wix and i need to copy configuration files from the old installation to the new one in case of upgrade

7767908
octal	decimal
so is octal 10 which is decimal 8

7767985
folder	directory
what should i change in the build file to get the project to look for the lib folder in the correct directory

7768006
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome has both google-chrome and safari inside useragent string

7768063
move	drag
so for example sort by price ascending on one column in the table however for some reason the user wants to manually move a more expensive option to the top so they then drag that to the top of the list

7768093
textview	imageview
the custom title bar contains a textview and an imageview in it

7768134
int	chars
in the string.java file we can see that internally a string instance has four fields a reference to an array of chars values and three int one is the index of the first string chars within the array the second is the string length and the third caches the string hashcode

7768141
width	height
instead of giving height and width as wrap content give height and width according to your wish using dip

7768182
put	get
you could put the links in a string array and get them by position according to what language it is

7768200
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
in opera google-chrome safari works too

7768226
google-chrome	firefox
works with google-chrome wasn t in firefox

7768250
put	get
make a new string then where ever you get n put the characters to new string up till this n and append required spaces after n

7768253
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie8+ google-chrome and firefox but the alignment is off in ie7

7768276
cpython	ironpython
i know there are other languages that may be better suited but i am only curious about python jython cpython ironpython etc

7768300
serializable	deserialization
see now you now longer have to worry about any manual serializable deserialization

7768395
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a scenario where i have user controls on tabitem of a tabcontrol in the view

7768396
min	max
or to show the first time they ordered that product choose min instead of max

7768436
children	parent
the only way to get a collection of parent with a filtered children collection in a single database roundtrip is using a projection

7768436
children	parent
ef s context will also populate the children collection of the parent automatically if you don t disable change tracking using asnotracking for example

7768436
children	parent
will contain your filtered children for each parent

7768436
children	parent
the code above would return all parent and include only the children with age 5 so potentially also parent with an empty children collection if there are only children with age 5

7768442
getter	setter
the advantage is pretty much the same as getter and setter methods it allows you control over when a property is requested and when it is set

7768477
put	get
the advantage over a simple public field is that if you at a later point decide that you want to put additional logic in either the get or set method you can do that without having to recompile the dll s that use your class

7768509
nscache	uiimage
uiimage does a lot of this for you already but nscache would allow you to free all the data rather than just the uncompressed data

7768518
int	chars
attrname and attrvalue are both pointers and chars is a type of int so the assignment operator will simply copy the value of the pointer the address not the content

7768522
datediff	difference
you can then trivially figure the difference between start and end times with datediff

7768523
textview	imageview
you can access the textview and imageview by declaring them public static in the tabactivity

7768523
textview	imageview
then in the sub-activity you obviously access the public static textview and imageview like

7768590
int	boolean
the compiler expects datarow int boolean

7768603
width	height
and set the width and height of the wrapper and let the other divs float

7768629
min	max
a third option is to simply store on the front end the min and max values for whatever your sorting column is in the list

7768655
implements	extends
how i currently achieve this is by having an interface for the settings which are common to all pages and then extends classes which implements the properties specific to the type of user

7768697
spaces	delimiter
selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given word delimiter by spaces

7768750
filtering	grouping
i have three ad grouping that the users can potenially be a member of and i d like the global filtering to check for one of those three grouping as well

7768753
inherited	properties
and when i save for example an instance of customerorder that inherited this properties

7768759
nfa	dfa
i have a scenario where i have designed the nfa and using jflap i have converted it to dfa

7768759
nfa	dfa
i have seen some examples which do this using switch and if statements but i can t see any relation to dfa nfa design and how to use it to implement in java

7768789
nfa	dfa
this java package contains a dfa nfa finite-state automata implementation with unicode alphabet utf16 and support for the standard regular expression operations concatenation union kleene star and a number of non-standard ones intersection complement etc.

7768802
width	height	subtract	add
if it s one of the corner points subtract add half the view s frame s width height to the coordinates

7768806
ant	maven
we re currently using ant with ivy for build and dependency management but there s an interest in providing template starter projects like maven provides using archetypes

7768806
ant	maven
however we don t want to go the maven route for building and dependency management as ant ivy suits our needs currently

7768806
ant	maven
alternatively are people just using maven archetypes in a way that complements their ant ivy projects

7768839
jobs	cron
there is also a cron job that runs hourly and processes the jobs - i would need to query the queue for items that need to be processed at this exact hour minutes are not important

7768864
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in ie firefox and google-chrome and all seem to be happy

7768891
postgresql	mysql
if you dont t know this database i suggest you use mysql postgresql or some database you are familiar with

7768987
uiview	subviews
add this new uiview as a subviews

7769011
versioning	upgrade
this up is upgrade from a rails 3.0 versioning so without asset pipeline

7769039
hide	show
hide first then show

7769058
google-chrome	safari
now google-chrome and safari have corrected thier behavior and then they changed spec nice move

7769102
jtree	jtable
in my swing application i would like to display the same date using jtree and jtable

7769102
jtree	jtable
if button is pressed then jtree should be shown if not then jtable

7769123
sequence	permutation
i am sure there any many valid sequence according to your criteria once you switch to a random permutation i doubt you ll have to do many rejection iterations

7769181
int	chars
using int or fixed chars type for storing dates like 14420101 for 1 1 1442

7769186
sorting	filtering
being queryable the data tables produce faster results with sorting and filtering with their defaultview dataview

7769219
nsurl	nsstring
when dealing with uploading and download files from a server to my apps i m constantly torn between using nsurl or nsstring for all things path related

7769219
nsurl	nsstring
if someone has the deeper insight for when to use nsurl instead of nsstring for your own classes handling file paths and remote urls please do share

7769264
jboss	glassfish
and besides the easiest way can this also be done at the web app level so i can use try different app servers glassfish jboss etc. for each computer or must it be the same app server glassfish+glassfish or jboss+jboss

7769265
sequence	permutation
generating random sequence according to some rule like hop by twos or threes then fill in the blanks will probably be faster than generating random permutation and testing and the chance of overlap will still be small if the number of toes is large

7769314
hide	show
i am trying to achieve an image switch effect using the animation function in jquery and two nested show hide functions

7769314
hide	show
my problem is that the images show hide perfectly fine when kept outside of the callback function however when i put them inside the show hide function does nothing at all

7769314
hide	show
hide and show callbacks work correctly

7769314
hide	show
if i put those those show and hide calls inside the animations callback nothing happens to the images

7769325
portrait	landscape
as soon as i go back to portrait the width stays the same as it was in landscape and the layout gets jacked

7769338
equals	icomparable	equals	gethashcode	icomparable	gethashcode
note also that unlike iequatable t which is logically bound to implement semantics very similar to equals since objects whose gethashcode implementations return unequal must compare unequal there are a number of cases where icomparable basetype should logically return equals even though icomparable derivedtype should compare unequal in such cases a derived type should typically implement icomparable derivedtype but not reimplement icomparable basetype

7769338
equals	icomparable
note that if icomparable t .compare returns zero that does not imply that the objects are equals but merely that neither one definitively ranks above the other

7769339
nsurl	nsstring	nsurl	nsfilemanager
generally for path related operations you should prefer nsurl over nsstring because the path information can be stored more efficiently in nsurl according to the class reference for nsfilemanager

however this does not work with server-side code only client-side code it throws an error saying that gwt.create is only usable in client-side code

7769693
ostringstream	std
one thing that pops up immediately is that you are doing both input and output with the std ostringstream which i believe is only meant to do output

7769748
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
also if you have specified all 4 screens density drawable folders xhdpi hdpi mdpi ldpi then what is the point of the normal drawable folder

7769752
width	height
put the image inside your div or similar and then use css to position absolutely set the z-index to force below the content and stretch the image to the width and height of the element

7769760
getter	setter
i m writing a small api to deal with objects that have specific traits in this case they all have an interval of time and a couple of other bits of data so i write an interface timeinterval with some getter and setter

7769760
put	get
b and one dumb question the collections framework guarantees i always get out the same instance i put in the collections are really a collection of references correct

7769791
superclass	subclassing
now i know why this happens it s because the field of the superclass is initialized and then the constructor of the superclass is called before the field of the subclassing is initialized

7769799
folder	directory
i am a little under educated in the issue but from what i read i need to make a blueprint folder and add a blueprint.css file both within the app assets stylesheets directory

7769815
post	get
as an example i m trying to get this values name john lastname smith from the post request body

7769819

afaik ldpi devices use the mdpi resource if a ldpi resource isn t available xhdpi uses hdpi resources

xhdpi hdpi mdpi ldpi then what is the point of the normal

7769959
implements	extends
i have my view controller extends and implements mapview viewforannotation i m close but must be missing something

7769966
post	get
a redirect will always to be a get not a post

7770011
inherited	properties
to check i looked at the template properties in the properties grid and the origin of the value is referenced as defined in style instead of the classic inherited when a custom control is defined in the same assembly

7770024
hide	show
if you are wanting to hide show the views based on this condition you should already have the appropriate frames set before the conditional and just call sethidden on the views with the appropriate argument

7770058

be able to support it but most other browsers firefox opera google-chrome seem to say that the filename is supported but the path is hidden for privacy security reasons

7770080
range	min	range	max	min	max
i m using a jquery mobile slider and i have a problem when the value that is entered into the text part of the control is outside of the range of the min and max values that i ve set

7770080
min	max
when the control loses focus it resets it s value to either the min or max value whichever is closer to the invalid entered value

7770080
min	max
however because the slider resets the value to either min or max as soon as it loses focus when the submit button is clicked this is the value that is actually saved and not the user entered value

7770093
post	get
in this post the excellent balusc pointed out the use of c foreach to get the parameters at build time

then you need to tie this class into the respective inputstream and outputstream objects

7770167
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven and you are using maven aren t you just add this dependency to your pom.xml

7770194

7770323
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome handles it just fine

7770336

qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
a qpushbutton and qtoolbutton have a number of states that can be styled so you want to make sure that you make your button noticeably different for each state so that the user can tell the difference

7772575
nhibernate	queryover
query caching is explicit you have to tell nhibernate to cache that queryover using the cacheable method

make sure theuserid the same type int double dec... as the field it s pulling from or you will have to parse it

7773235
strlen	strcpy
then allocate strlen + 1 for each string null terminator use strcpy to copy the strings and uppercase them afterwards less error prone

7773250

7773453
width	height
i would like to get the netstream width height when receiving a rtmfp stream

7773455

latest ok i have played around with safari and google-chrome and the issue is not to do with the caching

7773807
implements	extends
i haven t tested this but i believe that if you implements the reflection code in the abstract class in runtime you ll get the info of the actual class that extends your abstract if you use something like this.getclass .

7773848
put	get
i didn t have time to put together a working demo webpage but i hope you get the idea

folder	directory
don t do any copying of the boost folder to your compiler s include directory because it may make upgrading boost harder in the future

7774025
gridview	radiobuttonlist
the problem is that you are setting the text of the gridview table cell to an empty string rather than setting the visibility of the radiobuttonlist control to false

7774025
radiobuttonlist	rowdatabound
clearing the text property is removing the markup for the radiobuttonlist on the first load but on postback the rowdatabound event is not fired and the radiobuttonlist control is recreated and displayed again

7774058

7774247
postgresql	mysql
my mysql database fails to push to herokus postgresql datbase

7774251
post	put
as then put will mean update post will mean create

7774263
ppl	tbb
concurrent_vector works with std sort and both tbb ppl in the sample pack offer parallel sorts that can be used with this

7774267
children	parent
if you have to sort them manually all you need is a simple recursive function to check the parent for children based on their id with 0 as root in this example

7774290
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
could be add subtract multiplying divide

7774294
children	parent
relationship 1 parent to many children

7774295
put	get
so for example if i put certain context component-scan tags into configuration files that are below applicationcontext.xml it could cause certain classes to not get scanned

7774301
lisp	scheme
does scheme lisp provide any lib

7774308
post	get
post is usually used to patch but it is not rest-standard as far as i know but you can implement it if you get that convention in your environment

7774326
folder	directory
hi guys i recently accidentally removed all folder files from my .vim folder in mac os x home directory

7774328
post	get
use a post http verb instead of get

7774328
post	get
pekka suggested to serialize data and break into chunks if post is not an option sending a large parametrized data set as a get request

7774338
int	chars	int	boolean
basically you can t use primitives int short long chars boolean byte with generics

7774355
pop-up	dialog
both the login and fb.ui dialog are being blocked by the pop-up blocker even though they are working on every other website with facebook login

7774361
irc	xmpp
you should consider implementing or using a library for an already existing protocol such as irc or xmpp

7774402
min	max
if i use the histogram data command then i get a nice enough histogram plot where the x-axis is the divided evenly into ten buckets midpoint values of the ten equal intervals between the max and min values of the data and the y-axis records how many occurances occured for each bucket

7774404
intersect	contains
to return not only the features that are contains by the bounding box but also those intersect with it

7774414
hide	show
the issues are that when you hide rows and the height of your grid is set to auto it will not adjust the size properly also if you show rownumbers in your grid they are not sequential anymore

7774420
cos	sin
you should first normalize each vector so each point is in cos t_n sin t_n format

7774420
cos	sin
then calculating the cos and sin of the angles between each points and you reference point

7774542
vundle	pathogen
another tip is that you really should look in to using a plugin manager such as vundle or vim-addon-manager or at least the runtimepath manager pathogen

7774558
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari there is about 20px worth of space between the left side of the ul content box and each of the li content boxes

7774574
client-side	server-side
it s of course client-side check and not server-side one

7774579
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie do not automatically run a declared function unless called but firefox apparently will run the declared function onload even if it is not called all in lowercases

7774597
put	get
therefore--i m just guessing here--if you loaded all your beans into the dispatcherservlet context as i described above but put the in the root context you might have a bean in the root context that s correctly transactional but it s not the one being used because the duplicate is closer to the servlet in the parent child hierarchy and the context it s in didn t get a configuration

7774667
post	get
i ve seen other post where they create the navigation controller and do everything in the app delegate but i ve used the interface builder so it s not obvious to me how i can get access to it

7774689
memcached	apc
memcached or apc

7774697

switching	screens
this screens manager would be in charge of adding removing switching between views while making sure that all your view controllers are released properly when done with

7774715
put	get	pull	push
the correct way to resolve this is to first pull to get the changes that someone else put out there and then push the result

7774722
atomic	interlocked
however if your platform does not have such a guarantee you need to synchronize access to the variable using a lock an atomic variable or an interlocked operation

7774744
mouseleave	mouseenter
i really would prefer to avoid using codebehind mouseenter mouseleave events

7774752
post	get
i assume that facebook determines that this is a local url and therefore sends a get in place of the post that it would normally send to a public url

7774761
folder	dir
my solution is that every time before you want to install something new make a copy of dir in the path and then upgrade or install something by excecuting android.bat in the copied tools folder

7774773
post	get
you can use java.net.httpurlconnection or maybe apache http client to send a post get request to the other servlet

7774819
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if not the web inspector in google-chrome or safari is great as is firebug for firefox and you ll see it complaining

7774889
setinterval	settimeout
i m not sure about the details but replacing all the instances of setinterval with recursive functions using settimeout -- that also checked to make sure the animation wasn t already running -- solved the problem

7774927
squash	merge
you can squash the commits with git rebase -i or git merge --squash see squash my last x commits together using git

7774930
urllib	httplib
or should i be using something even more lightweight like httplib urllib

7774983
matplotlib	scipy
in general i highly recommend using ipython when doing interactive work in python with numpy scipy matplotlib etc

7774986
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in firefox and google-chrome because the edit boxes you see in them are rendered by the html engines in the browser and not by the operating system

rsync runs on posix systems including linux bsd unix and windows via cygwin

7775100
put	get
but then we get to the last problem you should put this line inside the event handler

7775165
int	double
solution in that case is to use a wider floating point type double although technically you may find an implementation that has a 256-bit int type in which case you ll have to find another way -

7775217
implements	extends
the main problem is that you are having router extends service while you aren t actually implements a service

7775218
google-chrome	safari
this works in safari google-chrome and ie but not ff7

7775291
put	get
you should get the value from the form put it on the php mail + your new values hidden value

7775318
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but different browsers ie firefox safari and google-chrome return different values probably viewbox scale not inches

put	get	getter	setter
the second thing will be to put getter setter these are methods who has access to your private values and will be used to assign get the values from them

7775492
lua	scheme
you could also use an interpretative language like embedded scheme or lua

7775497
post	put
4 this is un-oo related and just a preference but i would put both pre and post conditions before the methods

7775506
children	parent
you can see in the activerecord code there is a ton of logic surrounding the issue of how to handle children when a parent is saved

7775506
datamapper	activerecord
otherwise spend time studying the activerecord association code directly or consider datamapper which afaik gives you an activerecord-like interface including associations with the ability to change data stores

7775538
folder	directory
it s assuming the form was posted that it was successfully populated that will contain only the strings 1 or 2 and that your script is running in a path which is one folder deep to a directory containing config.php...and that regardless of the condition the same config.php will be loaded and miraculously know what it needs to do

background-image	background-size
and my current background-image workaround using css3 s background-size

7775599
int	chars
i recently asked a question here on stack overflow about how to cast my data from a 16-bit int followed by an undetermined amount of void -cast memory into an std vector of unsigned chars for the sake of using a socket library known as netlink which uses a function whose signature looks like this to send raw data

7775599
int	chars
for reference here s that question casting an unsigned int + a string to an unsigned chars vector

7775623
jgrapht	jung
jgrapht jung jts are very good but again for concurrent access i will have to synchronize it externally which is becoming a pain

7775624
put	get
my question is if it s possible to put a unique constraint on the combination of the fields instead of having to use a composite key and thus having to implement the get and other functions

7775649
folder	directory
the vimclojure directory should either be extraction on top of your .vim folder or in a bundle folder if your using something like pathogen which you should

7775695
children	parent
how can i use a jtree with parent node as object a and children node as b s and populate it

7775733
move	drag
having grown tired of writing functions to move sprites and characters diagonally and assigning keys that do not flow with the 4 main directional keys up down left right such as w a s d is a bit of a drag and a bore

7775755
put	get
he suggests a few options to get around this normally i d put some code here rather than just a link but he explains is in some good detail and external links

7775771
put	get
just put your setupdatelistener method on the service and call it once you get onserviceconnected with the service

7775790
implements	extends
edit i also tried changing the implements runnable to extends thread then changing the .run in the server to .start but that gives me this error

pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up perfectly it has the link so no problem.

7775981
screens	mdpi
with different devices you should have same image but with different size and density.for you can search in internet the specifications of devices.if density is less than 160 then put image in ldpi if 160 then use mdpi and if 240 or above use hdpi.also change the size of image to the screens size of corresponding device.hope it will help

7776000
innodb	myisam
in light of these differences innodb and myisam have their unique advantages and disadvantages against each other

7776000
innodb	myisam
because innodb has to take care of the different relationships between tables database administrator and scheme creators have to take more time in designing the data models which are more complex than those of myisam

hash	md5
in an example is given how to calculate an md5 hash of string

7776116
hash	md5
i get the same result for example using dac2009 response in how can i generate an md5 hash

7776116
hash	md5
why do i get something which looks like a md5 hash but isn t

7776137
hash	md5
md5 is a hash not an encryption mechanism

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
both firebug the extremely popular addon for firefox and web inspector built into google-chrome and safari the de facto web development tools for each browser include complete performance profilers

7776198
yslow	pagespeed
yslow and pagespeed as plugins for firebug for example i think there is an extension for chrome as well or you can install firebug lite on chrome can also prove useful if you haven t found them already

in this my image is show but when the nstimer is called image get blink or get hide i need the image until the touch the method called

7776285
getter	setter
and get set will be run through a magic getter setter

7776295
hash	salt
for the hash you could use anything dynamic like the date combined with a salt

7776367
int	chars
so what it s trying to do is index on the string but the index is not an int so it tries to convert the string to an int yielding zero and then it s accessing the first chars of the string which happens to be f

phpgraphlib	phplot
so far i have tried two tools one phplot and phpgraphlib

7776387
google-chrome	safari
then check the page in google-chrome or safari

7776393
width	height
you can do this on browsers that support the new file api from the w3c using the readasdataurl function on the filereader interface and assigning the data url to the src of an img after which you can read the height and width of the image

7776393
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently firefox 3.6 supports the file api and i think google-chrome and safari either already do or are about to

put	get
if i put that while loop outside of the keyboard input loop i ll never get anything back from the server

7776436
for-loop	arrays
it is usually a better idea to use the size of the arrays in the for-loop

7776463
post	put	post	get	put	get
first off you ve got to figure out whether you re using get put or post and in the latter two cases what is the content type or types that you are consuming as both put and post are typically dealing with a document incoming

setting width and height using css will actually crop the image

7776544
width	height
but if you use img tag the image will be re-sized to value of width and height

7776575
accessor	properties	public	protected
i think this is bad design you should declare name as private and create a properties with get set accessor where you can chose if get or set could be public private or protected otherwise protected will allow any classes of the same namespace to access a field or properties

7776607
nsinvocationoperation	nsblockoperation
use nsinvocationoperation nsblockoperation with a completion block

there are multiple companies selling products that do exactly what you are describing among them vericode coverity fortify klocwork and grammatech

7776651
hash	md5
how can i generate an md5 hash

7776651
hash	md5
you need 128 bits to represent the md5 hash and i would suggest to use the tostring 16 method of biginteger itself to create a string representation of the biginteger instead of using that format

7776675
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the not selector is only supported by modern browsers firefox safari and opera not ie

7776720
folder	directory
you can create a directory named binaries in ogre folder

7776796
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie users don t need to upgrade to windows 7 to get the benefits of html5 and css3 they can instead simply switch to firefox or google-chrome or opera or safari

7776814
memcpy	memmove
well this post is the reason for why is memcpy and memmove faster than pointer increments

7776829
777	tmp
by this i mean for example not requiring any app tmp directory with 777 access

7776831
implements	extends
plus you don t have to extends implements any special classes interfaces

7776895
int	chars
since copying an int is typically not slower than copying a chars on most machines i suspect this will give you roughly a speed increase of a factor 3

7776896
int	double
the specifier d expects an int and you are passing the address of a double

7776896
int	double
because printf takes a variable number of arguments a + b which is a double can t be converted to an int

7776900
int	double
d is for reading int use f or lf for float double

7776904
int	chars

the answer provided by n rohler works well only in internet explorer with some bugs prior to ie8 - but i guess it won t be a problem for you since you re using a canvas and pagex and in opera if the padding is 0 and in safari google-chrome if the border width is 0 too

7781229
subtract	add
all you have to do is to calculate the position of the canvas which is a pretty simple task using .getboundingclientrect also don t forget to add scroll offsets if necessary and subtract it from pagex and pagey

7781246
integer	unsigned
you then subtract 1 from this getting -1 which translates to a very large unsigned integer

7781247
onresume	onpause
you should unregister the receivers in say onpause and register them in onresume

7781326
post	get
because your form method is set to post and not get

7781367
getter	setter
if there isn t special operation in getter setter i usually write

7781375
put	get
you need to put the text underneath into it s own div and use a css height or min-height attribute to get this to work

7781381

so it can happen as a fractions value rather than an integer

7781499
udp	tcp
many attempts to use udp for speed wind up re-implementing many of the things that tcp provides for you already -- but most re-implementations are not done nearly as well as the real thing

7781505

extjs	ext.net
ext.net is a .net specific implementation of extjs allowing very easing integration with webforms

7782003
extjs	ext.net
in a nutshell if you re a .net developer and you want to save a good deal of work you might checkout ext.net otherwise extjs is the product you want to use

7782003
extjs	ext.net
that said extjs can be used with .net just fine without using ext.net

7782003

portrait	landscape
i have two layouts for portrait and landscape in layout and layout-land

7782886
width	height
but it doesn t scale the width and height of the images proportionally so the result is a very distorted image

7782886
width	height
using the example in the answer below from kyle i think the problem is occurring with images that have embedded width and height attributes

7782886
width	height
modified with width and height added to the first image link

7782886

when i get that right it is trying to say you cannot overwrite synthesized getter setter like you did the past 3 years even though it worked perfectly

7784105

so i strongly suspected that it was that my write operations in the for-loop didn t have enough time to complete before next loops starts

7784983
int	chars
however worth saying that fscanf has some drawbacks see so another approach is to use fgets to get each line the advantage of fgets is that you get to specify a maximum number of chars to read so there s no danger of overrunning a string buffer length and then sscanf to read from the string into your int variables

width	height
this way you ll have a image resized proportionally dependson what you need first the width or height

7785736
width	height
leaving only width 100 in css it means that image will be resized to fit the div by width and height will be resized the same times as the width so the scale will be respected

7785736
width	height
well..if want them resized by width and height then you ll have a image distortion due to different scale

7785736
width	height
you can paly with width and height of img style to change them and fit one image but when another one is added with different sizes you l get again a wrong displayed image

7785736
width	height
i would go for width to keep it resized cause in the height there is always space under the screen

this happens because the default filter effects region as defined by the x y width and height parameters on the element is 120 of the bounding box of the filtered element not 100

daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
the problem is that launchd daemons started by the systemd don t have access to aqua so your daemons process can t access the desktop environment

7786261
daemons	launchd
have the agent connect to your root daemons or have the root daemons look for an instance of the launchd agent

i don t need more than 2 localization now english and portuguese but i might need more later so it should be easy to add a translation if my app gets used by an russian site it should be able to send welcome emails in russian and with the name of the site brand that uses my app so i supposse what i want to do is something like a whitelabel product

7786782
jobs	cron
however my experience says that it s much better to make 2 cron jobs one for each translation than one cron job for many translations since a request could accidentally get the wrong cookie due to cookie cooruption or likewise

7786782
translation	localization
so this translation task is also for completeness and consistency even though the first attempt works for english and is easily exandable to 2 languages a complete localization with gettext is something i think is good to have

it turns out that when things are written to the parcel that is sent to the email intent textutils.writetoparcel does some special checking to root out the bold italic stuff by first checking if the charsequence is an instance of spanned and then asking for the spans via spanned.getspans

7787171

textutils.writetoparcel charsequence cs parcel p ... will if cs is an instance of spanned write those spans only if they implement the parcelablespan interface.

7789217

as for how to implements this you might want to try extends the database class or better create you own library which in fact just checks for whether a connection exists or not and load this instead of the database library

7789639
int	chars
let s say you start with a void pointer or a chars pointer or an int pointer or whatever you would like to name

7789639
int	chars
does this mean we are basically casting a void pointer to a chars pointer doing some arithmetic casting that to an int pointer and then de-referencing it to store 5

7789639
int	chars
or do we need to cast the chars pointer back to a void pointer before it is safe to cast it to the int pointer

7789639
int	chars
also before casting from chars to int does there need to be a de-reference somewhere before the conversion

7789660
int	chars
casting a chars pointer back to a void pointer before casting it to an int pointer won t be any better than just casting a chars pointer to an int pointer

if i try and push another view i have one with a webview on it then it works fine or if i go into interface builder and link the file owner s tableview to the tttableview object it will work fine and push the controller except the pull down to refresh function wont work so i am assuming that the deletage isn t correct when doing it that way

7789704
hash	salt
then when a user logs in you create a hash based on their id and maybe a random salt store that in the database as well as the session variable

7789767
equals	gethashcode
since gethashcode should return the same hash code for instances that are equals and should be immutable after construction any general-purpose tuple implementation that overrides equals and gethashcode will necessarily have readonly properties for the wrapped items

7789767
equals	gethashcode
it s not clear to me why you would want both mutability and the equals gethashcode overrides but if you do and understand the risks you ll probably have to roll your own

7789768
pull	push
this way you can push your changes how you want to your repository and then make a pull request to have them included in the official repository

7790065
serializable	deserialization
the eclipse warns that in order to adhere to the serializable specifications arraylist is serializable so all its subclasses are too you should define an unique serialversionuid in the subclass from which the deserialization process can ensure that the class definition has not changed significantly since it was serializable significantly you yourself have decided that the new definition is incompatible with the old one so you can express the fact by changing the serialversionuid

7791311
queue	fifo
at any one time there could be around 600 images that need this processing so i do around 40 on app launch using a background thread and cache them into a fifo queue

7791352
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if you think that storing passwords as hash for example md5 is not secure enough because of well known md5--cleartext tables then one add a salt before and hope that password+salt is not in that tables

7791361
postgresql	mysql
also i m currently using sqlite while developing but would happily accept any suggestions specific to sqlite mysql or postgresql

stdout	stderr
i want to create a program that can create a process for any arbitrary exe file while having that exe file s stderr and stdout captured redirected to my program

7793475
stdout	stderr
if it sends 10 char to stdout then 10 char to stderr and then 10 char back to stdout my program needs to recognized the fact that the child is alternating between stderr and stdout rather than simply treating stderr and stdout as 2 independent streams

7793475
stdout	stderr
stdout 10 bytes stderr 10 bytes stdout 10 bytes stderr 3 bytes .......

7793475
stdout	stderr
i know the standard way to redirect stdout and stderr is to create 2 anonymous pipes and having that 2 pipes inherited by the created child process

7793475
stdout	stderr
if i use 2 threads in the parent one for reading the child s stdout and another for reading the child s stderr i cannot tell the fact that the child is alternating between stdout and stderr the sequence information listed above is lost

7793475
stdout	stderr
i have no idea what the mozilla build system is doing nor why it needs to use some python scripts to invoke cl.exe which apparently analyze the stdout stderr of the cl.exe command

7793475
stdout	stderr
but all i know is that it must invokes cl.exe lib.exe and link.exe in the end and the interfaces to these commands must be command line arguments env variables and stdout stderr

7793475
stdout	stderr
so i need to write a proxy cl.exe which calls the real cl.exe and supplies my own command line arg s and returns whatever stderr and stdout to the caller as transparent as possible

7793475
stdout	stderr
the characteristics of cl.exe is that it may return error messages in stderr and normal messages in stdout

google-chrome	firefox
this all works great in firefox and google-chrome but in ie i get the message the requested content cannot be loaded

7796416
mouseleave	mouseenter
using jquery mouseenter and mouseleave only fire when you enter or leave.

7796431
textview	imageview
but to use something other than textview for the array display for instance imageview or to have some of data besides tostring results fill the views we override getview int view viewgroup to return the type of view you want

7796463
children	parent
how can i get the parent and children at once

7796468
pop-up	dialog
but what happens is the dialog box pop-up and the new activity is fired by the intent

7796581
express	node.js
i m writing a node.js app using express and mongoose-auth

7796592
children	parent
as usual when adding or deleting widgets you need to call layout on the parent which in this case is the scrolled panel that is getting new children

7796614
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
mouseover and mouseout have been replaced with mouseenter and mouseleave

7796645
put	get
if i can get it to work then i will put the additional coding before the return statement

7796663
background-color	transparency
android webview style background-color transparency ignored on android 2.2 it appears to be a bug that has been reported

7796674
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to create a big selenium suite in firefox but i m also wondering how difficult would be made all these tests working in the google-chrome or ie even because the page is simply rendered in a different manner and is already difficult link them and make the other drivers working

7796681
firefox	safari
i am creating some new layouts which would work on both desktop ie firefox safari and mobile browsers mainly tablets like ipad

7796830
google-chrome	firefox
if it didn t then it cost less for the user to install firefox or google-chrome just for my app than for me to write my site twice which is pretty much what ie 6 support will push you into

7796836
width	height
y values of the rectangle origin and the width w and height h of

7796891
pdfsharp	migradoc
you could have a try with pdfsharp y migradoc

7796925
int	double
if pos_type were signed and off_type were unsigned -- which makes no sense but bear with me -- then at best this double cast would shove some huge value into pos_type and at worst it would invoke implementation-defined behavior by assigning a too-large value to the signed pos_type int

7796952
portrait	landscape
i have a simple app that has two fragments and when in landscape mode both fragments are shown side by side and in portrait i show fragment a and then if they select an option start an activity that shows fragment b

i have to override the equals hashcode and tostring methods in hashset

7796969
vsto	add-in
i m using mef to help compose an excel 2007 add-in vsto that can create an entity from spreadsheet data and a creep requirement exposed a shortcoming in my architecture that i m trying to reconcile i am now needing to identify columns on template load rather than on worksheet submit

7796969
dictionary	map
on submit i reflect on these attributes to identify which property maps to that worksheet column and create a dictionary of pairs that map a propertyname to a column ordinal

7797016
rss	feed
i am currently working with a third party who provide product information to us in an rss feed

7797016
rss	feed
our drupal 6 site imports from each feed categories essentially the rss stories products and displays the resulting nodes in our shop pages

7797016
rss	feed
my question is how would i go about extracting more of the rss feed content

7797016
rss	feed
to clarify we currently use the feed 6.x-1.0-beta and map the rss title description date etc to cck fields

7797037
portrait	landscape
therefore my view becomes completely messed up and the only way to fix it is to rotate the device in landscape and then back in portrait orientation

7797054
hash	salt
you will need to hash salt the passwords yourself using a library such as cryptacular or passlib both found on pypi

7797066
wmv	asf
here you can find the wmv asf specifications

7797093
rss	feed
consider the following function prototype for caching object from cached rss xml feed

7797128
rss	feed
i need some help with rss feeds.we have a sharepoint site and we have used the rss viewer webpart to show feed

rss	feed
my requirement now is to filter rss feed according to user requirements such that the user can search for only those feed he she thinks is relevant.the search should be keyword based

7797158
getter	setter
the getter setter utility methods omitted for space

7797161
min	max
depending on your size constraints i would lean towards a less error prone implementation and give yourself enough leeway on min max values

7797199
google-chrome	firefox
that you said that it works in firefox google-chrome is beyond me

7797242
post	get
i ve tried everything i can think of to get the post to work

7797243
int	chars
i want to store each chars on line 1 of points.dat into a which i can later invoke atoi on to store as an int

7797263
twitter	myspace
otherwise if you are building application using php then you can use a hybrid authentication library like hybridauth which is not only free+open-source but also supports openid facebook google twitter myspace and aol based authentication system

7797269
ubuntu	linux
experimenting on my ubuntu and win7 dev box s i see that os.environ is case sensitive on linux but not on windows this mirrors the behavior of set on both platforms

7797277
width	height
width height are approx in the img above...i need to know how to get the gradient as per the 2nd fig

7797322
client-side	server-side
would it be okay to save the same navigation data in a session server-side and in a cookie client-side so that a user whose browser allows cookies can have the same advantages that one whose browser is

7797333
onfocus	onblur
the issue has more to do with how the browsers cache the current activeelement and handle the tabindex and when each browser processes the onblur onfocus between tab presses

7797333
google-chrome	firefox
when you use display none to hide elements firefox and ie remove the tabindex from the list of tabs altogether whereas google-chrome does not appear to

7797350
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
hence companies currently running exchange server on 32-bit hardware will be required to replace or migrate hardware if they wish to upgrade to the new versioning

7797350
migrate	upgrade
companies that are currently running exchange server on 64-bit capable hardware are still required to migrate from their existing exchange 2000 2003 servers to a new 2007 server since in-place upgrade are not supported in 2007

7797389
switching	screens
i have an app with two screens and buttons that switching between them

7797394
int	chars
thus a 32 bit int will require an array of 9 + 2 11 chars

7797394
int	chars
do you need to read the input one chars at a time and then convert to an int value

7797394
fgets	strtol	fgets	atoi	strtol	atoi
alternately you could use fgets to read an entire text string at once and convert the text using strtol atoi doesn t give you the same error handling capability as strtol

7797542
post	get
i did write a query based off of this guy s post which let me filter out most of the unused fields but there was a lot of picking through the fields in the localizedlabelview to get what i wanted and even then it wasn t easy

7797559
bids	ssis
i have an ssis package that runs fine in bids visual studio but in sql agent i get this error

7797569
dictionary	map
i am defining a dictionary to map day numbers to their respective word

7797616
width	height
the width and height x and y are just the display objects properties which are based on the bounds of it

7797626
hash	md5
it turns out that node s crypto uses md5 to hash the key and padding is apparently got that one with trial and error done using pkcs7padding

7797642
inherited	properties
there are only two identities and both have properties inherited from the person base class

7797652
width	margin
that s because the width you set is the width of the content excluding padding margin and borders

7797653
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for me the first column is 200px + padding on firefox google-chrome and safari

7797704
post	get
i have found various fql querying solutions on other post here on stackoverflow post 1 post 2 to extract a list of all a user s friends that have authorized my application but when i try to demo these on the facebook graph api i get the following query parser error

width	height
where the background div shows a google maps and it fills the screen exactly width 100 and height 100

7797711
versioning	upgrade
changed design a bit implemented jquery ui theme and upgrade jquery to the latest versioning

7797755
rss	feed
i have two db tables designed to generate rss feed to the browser channel and item

7797755
rss	feed
now i have seen scripts where an rss feed can be displayed thru php and it works great - the main problem is all examples i have seen assumes you have only one channel to attach your items to

7797791
outputstream	inputstream
object of this class is connected to the server through inputstream and outputstream implementations

7797792
rss	feed
when viewing this custom view you should see a link at the bottom of the page that says rss feed on my system the resulting url looks something like this

7797796
google-chrome	firefox
this problem only occurs in google-chrome - internet explorer and firefox present links correctly

7797814
width	height
you don t have to define the height in pixels or the width i just used it as an example

7797833
children	parent
also have a look at system.security.allowdomain and try allowing the domain in either the parent or children swf or both

7797842
debian	linux
i need to be able to run my application through cron on a linux debian machine

7797877
post	get
access-control-allow-methods get post

7797894
getter	setter
in that case hope that space is defined as a getter setter it should be if the class is implemented properly

7797908
virtualbox	parallels
it also appears that virtualbox also doesn t yet support parallels ports

7797913
cassini	iis
the solution is to change the project s properties to use a local iis web server instead of using cassini

7797913
cassini	iis
why cassini doesn t like periods and full iis does

7797927
put	get
so for a get this would make sense...is there an alternate function for a put - to set the active directory of the local machine

7797951
stdout	stderr
that s because part of the output is going to stdout and part is going to stderr

7797962
min	max
how could one patch the d3 zoom behavior to add min and max values

7797981
wadl	wsdl
the other is pushing wadl a rest analog to wsdl soap services

7797999
user-controls	tabcontrol
build a user-controls for each state and expose them to a tabcontrol through a listcollectionview

7798001
google-chrome	firefox
you can see the correct effect in the jsfiddle link via firefox moz however it doesn t work in google-chrome webkit

7798001
google-chrome	firefox
looking at the firebug code in firefox the -moz-animation 2s ease 2s normal none 1 ooze appears in the css of the .logoanim - it doesn t appear in the webkit version in google-chrome

7798041
junit	powermockito
you have to ensure that on your test project if you go to properties and then java build path that the junit jar associated with the full version of powermockito you downloaded show up on the order and export tab above the android.jar

7798088
pull	push
it is a short 34 page pdf document that helps change paradigm from pull subscriptions to push or moving from ienumerable to iobservable

explode	substr
use explode to make an array eefs 23232323 then select last part using end finally substract 3 chars using substr

7798099
put	get
i put all my carefully crafted rewriting rules in a .htaccess file in public_html and tested it out ...only to get a 500 server error

unfortunately the web host is still using apache 2.2 and they declined my polite request to upgrade to the beta versioning

7798140
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview commiteditingstyle uitableviewcelleditingstyle editingstyle forrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

7798146
onfocus	onblur
as such i thought it would be best to just use onblur and onfocus

7798169
button	checkbox
example utilizes .browser from jquery and assumes jquery is included on the page. same example would work for radio button substitute radio for checkbox

7798175
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in latest versions of google-chrome firefox opera and safari on mac osx

7798213
jqgrid	datatables
datatables has better customizations as far as clientside bells and whistles where as jqgrid is a little harder to make look as pretty but can do some pretty good serverside interaction from what i understand

7798218
uitableview	reloaddata
have you tried calling uitableview reloaddata after you change the arrays

7798234
content-length	content-type
the idea is to get the content-type so you don t break any non-text responses and any cookies present so you don t break authentication clear all the headers to clear the content-length then set the content-type and cookies again

7798242
mouse	keyboard
i m wondering how to accept keyboard and mouse input in c++ using visual studio 2010 for windows 7 32-bit

7798242
mouse	keyboard
--edit i forgot to mention that i need keyboard mouse input without interrupting the flow of the program

7798263
mouse	keyboard
if you re writing a gui application you ll build the app out of standard windows controls that have built-in behaviors for mouse and keyboard input

7798267
post	put
it would stop the post and say the word list wasn t allowed however if i put

7798280
equals	gethashcode
your gethashcode implementation must be consistent with your equals implementation

7798324
pascal	delphi
ps i prefer delphi pascal but tutorials in any language are welcome

7798332
google-chrome	safari
this will only work with webkit browsers google-chrome safari etc

7798349
jgit	gitblit
if you were to only use gitblit s http https jgit servlet for cloning pushing then you can restrict repository access by user

7798352
inherited	properties
the background properties is not inherited by children by default

7798359
hgrc	hgignore
then you can use the main repo s hgignore as the main one by including this in each subrepo s hgrc file

7798359
hgrc	hgignore
the reason why doing didn t work for you in your global .hgrc and won t in repo hgrc is that having simply hgignore is a relative file path and its resolution to an absolute path depends on the current working directory used when invoking hg

7798369
maven	m2e
also you say when you build tycho from github does that mean you are using the m2e embedded maven tycho inside eclipse

7798377
width	height
as you can see only difference is that one is a hyperlink in my case with fixed width height and background img and second one is hyperlink with img

7798385
children	parent
also children can t override parent so if there were more content you d see yellow around the p add padding to the div

7798390
addition	multiplication
the basic arithmetic operations include matrix addition and multiplication matrix norms and selected element-by-element array operations

7798393
jtree	jtable
it would also be a shame really to turn my back on jtree and jtable having spent so much time tearing out what was left of my hair about them

7798403
google-chrome	firefox
i have an aspx web page that works perfectly with firefox and google-chrome but not on ie9 don t feed the troll

7798403
google-chrome	firefox
here is my problem with firefox and google-chrome the timer provokes the reloading of the image but with ie even ie9 the image is only displayed after hitting f5

7798418
post	get
in our post we redirect to the get passing in the route values we need in the url

7798420
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing involves inherited which means you can override method implementations such as drawrect

7798473
nfa	dfa
since a regular expression is a representation not a description of a regular lenguage you can not tell that regex1 is equivalent to regex2 just by looking at the expression to prove it mathematical proof you can convert those regular expression into a nfa nondeterministic finite automata or dfa deterministic finite automata and compare the diferences

7798501
dpkg	aptitude	dpkg	apt
basically i need a apt aptitude equivalent of dpkg --force-confnew

7798501
sudo	passwd
also i am passing the sudo passwd in a pipe to execute the command

7798596
put	get
this is generating a headache to me because i have to put a utf8_encode in label var otherwise i get problematic chars in the output

7798684
width	height
i have used px-s as width and height paddingtop etc

7798684
width	height
it has 4 images with wrap_content width and height settings

7798686
punctuation	words
using instead of will also match words surrounded by punctuation or the beginning end of the string

7798689
move	drag
in addition if you are letting users drag stuff around i highly recommend you do not move the panel unless the drag exceeds a small threshold

7798760
mouse	keyboard
at the very low level the keyboard and the mouse are hardware devices that generates some interrupts in the form of electric signals to the cpu

7798760
cout	cin
in a c++ program the standard library -at program startup- associates to that file the std cin and std cout stream objects so you can read the input character sequence using the std istream functions and operators

7798760
gtk	fltk
these libraries can be either os specific like mfc wtl ... or multi-platform they exist in different version mapping the api of various oss into a same c++ interface like wxwidget qt gtk fltk .

7798765
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the output looks right in opera google-chrome safari and ie even ie6

7798824
mouse	keyboard
keyboard mouse input without interrupting the flow

7798835
pop-up	dialog
in the jqgrid delete a row approach the code is hiding the pop-up delete confirmation dialog manually

7798835
pop-up	dialog
what i noticed is that when the dialog pop-up jqgrid de-emphasizes the background page makes it light greyish

7798875
int	chars
the problem i am at now is that file scanutils.cpp calls a function open chars int mode_t and this isn t defined anywhere

7798957
isotope	masonry
but then i have additional code that modifies the size of one so i need isotope to fire the following on the click of any - isotope is a dynamic page layout tool that uses masonry

7799000
addition	multiplication
the calculations include multiplication and addition of pixels from images taken by the camera

7799004
mvvm	delegatecommand
usually i use a relaycommand or delegatecommand in the viewmodel or in the code-behind if you re not using mvvm

7799042
oncreate	onstart
first why onrestoreinstancestate isn t firing according to the documentation onrestoreinstancestate gets called after onstart which according to the activity lifecycle diagram only gets called after oncreate or onrestart

7799043
width	height
width 320 x height 480

7799069
maven	pom.xml	put	get
to cut to the chase this is all you have to put in your maven pom.xml to use tycho and then next time maven uses this pom.xml for a project it will get tycho if you don t already have it and use it for the build

7799077
pascal	delphi
what s the free pascal equivalent to delphi s anonymous methods if any

7799094
portrait	landscape
you would need to set your wrapper width to 320px for portrait mode although the user will have the option to view the web app in landscape mode so if you can get away with using percentages you ll be better off

7799104
children	parent
sheep can be made children of other sheep by selecting an id from the jcombobox editor of the parent id column in the jtable

7799107
ssl	https
we ended up getting an ssl cert and using https to register the user and it was approved

7799110
int	chars
it s converting the chars to a short or an int then inserting it

7799114
getter	setter
sometimes i ll have a block of public member functions that belong in a member group and that i feel are self documenting getter setter so i don t want to write doxygen syntax for each one

7799148
fadein	hide
so either use display none css rule or hide function to hide it first and use the fadein effect

7799152
getter	setter
all you need is a separate datastore property to store the actual value much like with other languages that use getter and setter

7799152
getter	setter
however i ve found that using getter and setter on existing dom properties often simply won t work due to the special handling of these properties internally

7799205
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
if you d like to sort something not discrete use optimal n log n algorithms quicksort heapsort mergesort

websphere	ibm
we are using myfaces 1.1.7 and tomahawk 1.1.5 running on ibm websphere 7.0 patch 19

7799231
websphere	ibm
issues with session replication on ibm websphere when running a jsf application

7799266
disk	ram
another would be to install gcc to a ram disk

7799269
aggregate-functions	sum
i changed the aggregate-functions from sum to count

7799273
int	boolean
extension method public function where predicate as system.func of review int boolean as system.collections.generic.ienumerable of review defined in system.linq.enumerable value of type boolean cannot be converted to system.func of powellcasting.models.review int boolean

7799273
int	boolean
extension method public function where predicate as system.linq.expressions.expression of system.func of review int boolean as system.linq.iqueryable of review defined in system.linq.queryable value of type boolean cannot be converted to system.linq.expressions.expression of system.func of powellcasting.models.review int boolean

7799290
piston	tastypie
i ve been using the pbs-education fork of piston and tastypie trying to get them to work the way that i want

7799290
piston	tastypie
this has got to be a result of how much tastypie does for you unlike piston and django-rest-framework

7799290
piston	tastypie
so piston is very flexible but kinda dead tastypie is not flexible but great if you ve got a very simple graph and i haven t touched django-rest-framework yet

7799317
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in ie but bombs in firefox and google-chrome

7799323
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that has a larger number of objects in it than the photo frame it s destined for can handle

7799325
clojure.test	midje
i don t know if the facility that you are looking for exists in the regular clojure.test but midje has some pretty extensive fixture facilities this link is maybe worth checking out

7799336
next	except
everything works fine except the counter to progress the loop to the next row doesn t seem to be working

7799347
typedef	struct
i ve defined a struct network typedef to network which contains a pointer to an array of doubles and a pointer to an array of pointers to neurons which is another struct

7799363
oncreate	onstart
from my understanding of application lifecycle including services it should go oncreate onstart onresume

7799363
oncreate	onstart
based on this understanding if you shut down the cycle with a this.stopself in the oncreate it should never fire the onstart

7799363
oncreate	onstart
however logcat clearly shows that the onstart still runs in spite of the service being terminated in the oncreate

7799383
folder	directory
your home directory must be set to some value while running from netbeans probably pointing to your src resource folder but you specify a different home location or none at all when running outside netbeans

7799391
hide	show
alternatively you can add a framelayout to your activity programmatically instantiate the fragments and attach show hide them when needed

7799422
google-chrome	firefox
using the tags proved difficult for me in google-chrome 14.0.835.202 specifically although it worked fine for me in firefox

7799422
google-chrome	firefox
the following works in firefox and google-chrome

7799422
google-chrome	firefox
incidently both firefox and google-chrome are playing the ogg format although google-chrome recommends webm

7799422
post	put
i put the check for browser support of ogg first only because other post have mentioned that firefox prefers the ogg source first

7799440
google-chrome	firefox
if you re on firefox google-chrome pop up the error console shift-ctrl-j and it ll tell of you any parse errors its encountered

7799445
ready	each
also when i m finally ready to submit how do i traverse the table and read the email from each row in which the is selected

7799459
background-color	transparency
if i set a background-color it works like it is expected to but with no background-color or transparency it does not work

7799459
mouseover	mouseenter
i have also tried using mouseenter instead of mouseover but with the same results

7799466
google-chrome	firefox
surprisingly this works very well in google-chrome and ie but miserably under firefox

7799466
google-chrome	firefox
apparently google-chrome and ie are able to optimize if you only want a small pixel area but firefox doesn t appear to be optimizing at all based on the desired pixel area

7799474
width	height
create a container element and set the width height of the container to whatever you desire

7799474
width	height
then embed the swf with 100 width and 100 height inside your container

7799478
folder	directory
functions.php in the same directory as img folder

7799486
interpolation	splines
you first get a set of splines that will generate your data points and then you interpolation the control points of these intermediate curves to get the control points of the surface curve

7799514
pop-up	dialog
comes into the software and i click answer it pop-up the flash dialog

7799533
google-chrome	firefox
my flex application has a very bad load time approx 5 to 8 wasted seconds but only for firefox and ie google-chrome appears fine

7799533
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome consistenly works very fast ie and firefox have this strange lag

7799534
coff	omf
windows dmd produces omf while coff is more popular now

7799569
put	get
so i was able to get it to work with camel velocity but we didn t like how we really couldn t use the request object directly in the jsp afaik you have to put everything in the header of the exchange and in the jsp you would do header.somereqvariablename

7799586
post	get
how do you get the right information that is page id and post id

7799605
versioning	upgrade
this separation also provides the basis for clean upgrade between versioning of tomcat as well

7799605
folder	directory

portrait	landscape
so i decided that maybe android just wasn t recognizing that it was in landscape since i overrided it but changing the layout to something ridiculous like a layout for a dialog doesn t cause a force close or anything it stays the portrait layout which is stretched as a result so i know there is something wrong with how i m inflating the layout

then simply hide and show the textfield from the textfielddid methods but show the actual display value in the label

getter	setter
now since you have written property getter and setter methods for uilabel you can set its value from your first class only where you create object of second class

7803456
children	parent
you can make regenerating the path caches more efficient by only updating the changed node and its children using its parent s cached path

7803934
width	height
but if you use the realtocomplex or the complextorealfunction pay attention to the fact that the image will be stored in a matrix of dimensions height x width 2 +1 and if you want to do some intermediate calculations in the frequency domain they will become a bit harder.

mousemove	onmouseup
chrome on the other hand handles this perfectly well while the drag operation is happening the mousemove handler works its job and the point is placed only after the onmouseup event fires

7807013
mousemove	onmouseup
my theory is that explorer might be single-threaded in which case he picks up the mousemove events but performs them only after the onmouseup event has completed which means that esentially nothing is done for the duration of the drag operation but i don t know how to check if this is true or how to fix it

7807946
google-chrome	firefox
apparently ie8 has builtin support for this while for firefox google-chrome you may be able to get a plugin

7807975
mouse	keyboard
one when the enter key is pressed if the user selects the value using the keyboard and an other when the use select a value with his mouse

7808003
inherited	properties
i m not absolutely sure it s supported by jpa but the way to do it in hibernate regardless of the inherited strategy and thus even if you don t have a discriminator or didn t map it as a properties is to use the implicit class properties

7808047
postgresql	mysql
yes there are a lot of open source cluster relational database based on linux which include mysql cluster postgresql cluster and a newly zvents releases open source cluster database based on google i m not sure if it is an open source

7808055
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this behavior only happens in google-chrome tested as well with ie9 safari and firefox

7808099
trie	tree
to have an easier time working with prefixes you could use a trie or a patricia tree to store the dictionary

7808103

7808129
mdpi	hdpi
what i want for devices running on hdpi is for them to use the mdpi image the bigger one available and use it as it is without scaling

7808129
mdpi	hdpi
how can i have ldpi and mdpi images being used in their respective densities but have devices running hdpi pick up the biggest image available which is the mdpi ones and prevent any scaling just fitting the image in the center of the imageview

7808149
fast-forward	merge
since you can fast-forward merge a branch commits from one branch can be part of another at any time

7808157
int	chars
primitives like int string chars are not references

7808196
int	double
a primitive data type int long float double etc. can not be null only objects can be null

7808324
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in delegate s didfinishlaunchingwithoptions method i added a viewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller and added uinavigationcontroller to uitabbarcontroller which use presentmodalviewcontroller to display another view

7808337
typedef	struct
second i want to ask is how to use a typedef struct in opencl better how to pass it

7808346
getter	setter
where principal is actually an instance of myuser so firstname can be any of my custom getter and setter

7808365
websphere	ibm
i am attempting to post an xml message to an ibm websphere mq queue via hermesjms

7808381
int	double
the gpu i m using doesn t support double so i m stuck with 32-bit int and floats and vectors arrays of floats up to 4 in length

7808381
division	multiplication
i have had a look at the q number format however the problem i have is that if i use 2 32bit ints i need a 64bit temporary variable for multiplication and division

7808485
textview	imageview
one that contains the listview and the other xml file contains the textview imageview and button

7808608
width	height
i need a way to change an image width and height inside an svg based on the orientation of the device using javascript or ecmascript inside the svg

7808608
portrait	landscape
i just want the image size adjusted to the width of svg box in both cases landscape and portrait

7808636
firefox	safari
there are similar ways to do it for ie firefox and safari

7808644
hide	show
i ve been working on a page where we hide a tr table row using display none and later need to show it via display table-row

7808672
post	get
i realized that the problem with some sites not responding was actually that i was using post instead of get

7808711
aggregate-functions	sum
how can i use aggregate-functions like sum avg on that nvarchar column

7808729
width	height
what i need is to be able to detect the width and height of an iframe from within the iframe so if the iframe src is iframecontent.html i need to be able to surface the values on this page

7808733
post	put	post	get	put	get
if you want to be able run different code for different http verbs e.g get post put delete creating rest web services than you want to inherit from restservicebase instead and override its onget onpost onput ondelete methods

7808747
jar	.war
insert dependent jar file into final .war file

7808747
maven	pom.xml
and as i expected when i remove the provided scope form the pom.xml maven includes dependent

7808747
jar	.war
jar file on final .war file it is correct until this point

7808747
jar	war
but when i set provided scope for dependency again maven still includes the dependent jar file in war package

7808761
maven	pom.xml
then in the pom.xml enable filtering for src main resources as outlined in the maven resources filtering documentation linked above

7808776
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
my question is viewcontroller which were used in navigation controller in that viewdidappear does not call while viewwillappear calls

7808785
ilist	icollection
also the icollection interface doesn t have an add method -- you ll need something that implements ilist or for that

7808806
integer	fractions
note to use fractions either the numerator or denominator needs to be a floating point number otherwise ruby will automatically cast the answer to an integer and throw off your math

7808830
setinterval	settimeout
if you are using setinterval to execute the outerfunc function every 20 seconds this can be fixed by using settimeout calls to simulate the setinterval function

7808847
inherited	properties
but it seems that it is not an inherited properties as string.hasownproperty replace returns true

7808897
textview	imageview
for this you need to create custom list view that will displays textview imageview and button

7808943
width	height
you can fake a resize by setting the image s height width zoom css attributes

7808954
onresume	onpause
onpause and onresume are not working

7808959
children	parent
try to trace the children of your stage and the parent of your textfields

7808996
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
if you would use a logger library and requests are small then you could read whole inputstream into memory into bytearrayoutputstream then log it then construct bytearrayinputstream as the method result

7809009
for-loop	loops
right now i m using a for-loop to loops through any number of latitude and longitude values and create markers are those points on the map

7809011
websphere	ibm
i have been facing issues in pasting an xml message to a ibm websphere mq queue via hermesjms

7809011
websphere	ibm
i had found out openjms but that is an implementation of jms similar to apachemq rabbitmq ibm websphere mq etc.

7809035
stdout	stderr
note that by calling child.waitfor before reading the stdout and stderr streams you re guaranteeing that this won t work if the output of the process gets too large

7809054
hide	show
trying to get a div that looks like to show and hide another div on hover but no luck

7809073
google-chrome	safari
i have an app that i have fully tested in safari 5 ie 9 ff6 and google-chrome 14

7809116
hide	show
fixed the initial selector to not use find only need to supply and single function for the hover and use the toggle function to show hide the content

7809126
post	get
but you already send id like an get request in so why send it again with post

7809137
jquery	simplemodal
the plugin uses the jquery simplemodal plugin so you can look through the documentation there for more help

7809190
onresume	onpause
you have to save your listview in onpause and rebuild it in onresume

7809211
put	get
i put this into a helper because you may want to access that logic elsewhere in the system and i generally prefer to put that kind of logic into a helper in fact i am pretty sure you are going to want to use this on the product and category pages since you are modifying the way pricing is working for some products and customers get mad when prices change up unexpectadly

7809252
skip-lists	tree
using a self-balancing binary search tree or a skip-lists you could get to o n log k

7809258
int	chars	unsigned	short
and accessing the value as a signed or unsigned chars short int int

7809258
int	double
long int long long int float or double or as a bool

7809285
yslow	pagespeed
i also ask this cause using both firebug pagespeed and yahoo yslow pagespeed tools they conflict in this google says to separate files yahoo says compress all in one |

7809287
super	abstract
are there any style conventions for such abstract or dull because their implementation in the super class would be either pass or raise a nonimplemented exception methods and attributes

7809291
hide	show
i use this javascript in order to achieve a very simple thing show hide two s

7809333
vimclojure	counterclockwise
i have tried la clojure for intellij with the align clojure forms by the second element does not align by the second element vimclojure emacs messed up the indentation of the part enclojure in netbeans does not align by the second element and counterclockwise in eclipse does not align by the second element

7809343
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind that some browser upgrade are not 100 backwards compatible with previous versioning

7809392
children	parent
i want the delegate function to be able to modify the values stored in container for the parent and its two children

7809392
children	parent
what happens right now is that a delegate function can modify the parent since i pass a reference directly to container parent but not the children since i have to process them first and thus pass a reference to leftchild and rightchild

7809414
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in many platforms the result thumbnail image looks very pixellated pc google-chrome pc firefox ios safari but in others such as mac firefox the resize does a much better job of interpolation

7809441
hide	show
basically you can remove the tab from the tabbedviewnavigator to hide it and re-add it to show it again

7809458
mouse	keyboard
if there is a function that isn t made available then there is gui scripting scripting the actual mouse and keyboard clicks to get to something in the menu system but that there are many new issues that will have to be worked around

7809490
des	rsa
i m doing a project where i need to either find or build an rsa and an elgamal algorithm a triple des algorithm and a digital hashing signature algorithm

7809496
exponent	modulo
do i need modulo exponent too

7809508
yslow	pagespeed
make sure you have the pagespeed yslow and firebug addons installed then use them

7809514
queue	fifo
use a queue fifo linked list

7809514
queue	fifo
circular queue fifo 2d array

7809519
salt	md5
long lecture answer md5 is weak constant salt is bad no need to escape the password prior to hashing etc

7809526
put	get
i haven t checked the source code of concurrenthashmap to make sure that put and get trigger an happens-before but it is only logical that they should

7809526
put	get
there is still an issue with your method however even if you use both put and get

7809526
getter	setter
1 synchronize all accesses getter and setter to your objects everywhere in the code

7809540
button	checkbox
i m using a radlistview and i want to click a checkbox button it displays as a checkbox but its designer code shows it as a button

7809542
hash	md5
as long as you do the exact same md5 salting process on passwords everywhere they re used and only store compare the resulting hash in the database then your comparisons will be valid

7809548
csv	tsv
tsv or csv parsers in python will be able to parse it

7809567
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome and firefox

7809578
vb.net	vb6
i recently uninstalled vb6 necessary for clean installation of vb.net and i think this may be at least part of the problem

7809598
portrait	landscape
if the user physcially rotates the device then layoutsubviews gets called and works correctly -- so a user starting the app in landscape draws incorrectly rotates to portrait draws correcty and then rotates back to landscape now draws correctly

7809601
client-side	server-side
if you are concerned enough to do validation you must always do server-side validation in addition to client-side

7809612
do-while	goto
the you cannot derived from classes that don t have a virtual destructor litany if that s the reason you say you cannot extend it it like the dont use goto dont use do-while don t multiple return don t use this or that feature

7809612
goto	break
like it is stupid writing dozens of nested if to avoid a multiple return just as its stupid introduce dozens of state flags to avoid a goto or a break

7809622
accessor	properties
the reason i know is that i added a messagebox.show ... on the set accessor of the properties and i don t see any message boxes

7809622
put	get
if i put break points - they never get reached

7809692
width	height
it s quite useful because it s easy to use fast and you don t have to calculate text height width

7809757
width	height
the cells have different height width depending on the content

7809757
width	height
i would like to constrain them to exactly 50 of the width and height

7809779
getter	setter
then you can assuming you ve set up standard getter and setter use where is a managed tag entity to get the number of articles attached to that tag

7809780
hash	md5
your particular query is safe but realize that when you run a string through md5 any sql escaping you did on the original string is destroyed - md5 s output character set does not include sql metacharacters so if a user s password does contain any of the metacharacters you ve now hash not only their password but any escape characters that were added in

7809781
pop-up	dialog
when i run the code in ie9 a file save dialog pop-up asking if i want to save the file

7809795
stdout	stderr
it looks like your error message is coming from stderr not stdout

7809816
pow	sqrt
b sqrt exp pow sigmaeta 2 -1 sigmanu

7809817
hash	md5
my solution is to hash the url using md5 or sha256

7809897
hash	md5
the reason i d go for md5 is because you are very unlikely to run into collisions and even if you do you can structure your queries with where urlhash hash and url url

7809909
factors	mean
otherwise i d now need to scale down all my images by some constant factors 1.6 which would mean resizing all the 45 levels which took days and days of designing and testing repositioning gui elements etc

7809914
vtk	paraview
vtk is good for scientific visualization plotting values onto a mesh with a given colour scale and all that goes with it axes filters and so on it has quite a few tools for mesh processing and other things which paraview gives a front end to if you want to experiment

7809933
getter	setter
i m not sure what you mean but if you re trying to set the circle colors from an outside class then make the array a property of the class with a setter and if needed a getter

7809967
subtract	add
you need the bitwise-not and add subtract

7809993
versioning	upgrade
if ezpdf is however recreated magic_quotes behavior then it s definitely time to upgrade versioning or switching to something better

7810017
hash	md5
in your case i wouldn t use any of the cryptographic hash functions md5 sha since they were designed with security in mind they mainly want to make it as hard as possible to finde two different strings with the same hash

7810034
subtraction	addition
you ve still got to use an addition or subtraction to produce the correct result though

7810045
background-color	transparency
nsstring embedhtml body background-color transparency

7810064
cloudant	couchdb
there may be an obvious answer to this but i can t seem to find it anywhere what s the best way to query couchdb databases stored on cloudant servers

7810071
writetofile	nsdata
save data to nsdata and then with writetofile save it to main bundle

7810102
put	get
i m developing some asp.net website and i m trying to run it on my iis i published the web under build option and put it under wwwroot but i get this parser error below

7810143
google-chrome	firefox
but i can only get it work in firefox or google-chrome wich is useless cause they already support border-radius

7810150
gif	png
pagespeed probably refers to static resources like js css png gif etc

7810180
button	right-align
2 assume your menu system calls for various button and images to be right-align exactly with the right border of the screen

7810180
button	right-align	width	height
instead of figuring out the individual positions for each image button it is easier to simply right-align them by modifying the anchorpoint to 1.0f 0.5f and then position the images button at exactly the screen width and variable screen height position screen width 100

7810180
width	height
let s assume the following image s position is at screen width screen height 2 with a default anchorpoint 0.5f 0.5f

7810180
width	height
the position remains the same screen width screen height 2

7810180
button	right-align
just for comparison if you wanted to right-align this image menu button or label without modifying the anchorpoint you would have to set its position according to this formula

7810184
fast-forward	merge
for the same reason git has the concept of fast-forward merge something that does not apply to mercurial because you wouldnâ t have created a separate branch in the first place

7810192
outputstream	inputstream
eunfortunately there is no easy way to use a randomaccessfile as an inputstream outputstream looks like aix may have a good suggestion for adapting randomaccessfile to inputstream outputstream but there are various example adapters available online

7810192
outputstream	inputstream
you can set the position of the filechannel directly then use the channels utility methods to get inputstream outputstream adapters on top of the channel

7810199
post	get
when i post something from my iphone app to facebook everything works great except the part under the post where it has like comment get my app name

7810213
profiling	debugging
i can not override the physical path for the file on a configuration profiling basis so i need to add a new sqlcmd variable that i can specify the physical path on a configuration profiling basis but need to alter the schema to use the variable instead of the string the string of the physical path in my debugging environment.

7810229
toggleclass	slidetoggle
however on the iphone the slidetoggle works fine but the toggleclass never removes the class

7810258
button	checkbox
i think one tricky part of this is that the entire list item is a button meaning you don t have to press directly on the checkbox to check it you can press anywhere on the list item

7810290
rss	feed
if you are getting data from a feed aka rss xml then you should be using an xml parser like nokogiri to process the xml

7810292
subclass	abstract-class
maybe create an abstract-class instead and then subclass the full access and read only behavior

7810306
public	protected
you can call their public and protected member functions and for that to succeed their data members certainly have to be initialized - which is just what base class constructors do

7810311
ubuntu	debian
i know is an old question but actually the example that you found is the recommended way to do that start stop restart in ubuntu and debian

7810321
inherited	properties
if that s the case then you d create a base class to include methods and properties that will be common to the classes that inherited it

7810321
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
then maybe you d maybe create a sportscar subclassing that inherited the car class and adds properties such as spoiler turbocharger etc

7810414
freemarker	velocity
you re looking for a template engine like velocity freemarker sitemesh etc

7810426
x86	64bit
exit code -1 message to after alot of google search i found out that my eclipse was only for 32 bit europe 3.3.2 and i had windows 64bit so the path to my jdk was to my 64bit programfiles folder not to programfile x86 folder and i changed that in my eclipse.ini to

7810475
actionscript	mxml
but i want this button as an itemrenderer to be written in actionscript and not mxml

7810484
post	get
if i set up as post and call it as an ajax call with jquery this is the end result i am hoping for as i need to pass some data to the service if necessary i can pass the data points in the url and use get

7810504
folder	directory
this time downloaded jogl-linux-amd64.7z fresh within it opened java-jogl-src.zip and copied the contents to librambo jar again to see if i could just get it to work in this folder 100 errors because the directory structure didn t match

7810525
arcgis	proj
i could solve the problem for the display in arcgis by using the proj tool data management toolbox projections and transformations toolset raster

7810554
hide	show
what you are looking for is asynctask where you can show hide the progressdialog in onpreexecute onpostexecute

7810567
min	max
dbcp let s you specify a min and max number for idle connections see link

7810567
min	max
i can specify a max and min pool size but that appears to be it

7810567
min	max
if not does anyone know if c3p0 has a default for max min idle connections or does it not limit them

7810688
versioning	upgrade
if you are willing to upgrade to delphi xe xe2 you might have an included light versioning of aqtime already if so check it out

7810700
getter	setter
making the various setter synchronized or the underlying references volatile still doesn t let you publish consistent state it just means that the object will always see the latest value for each getter on each call

7810701
getter	setter
i would like to save the getter and setter in prop any suggestion for this approach is welcome

7810745
folder	directory
the only caveat is that you have to be at the top level of your working directory the same folder that contains your .git folder for this command to work since the paths you pass in to git diff -- at the end via xargs are relative to that

7810823
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
an uiviewcontroller has a property called uinavigationcontroller

7810826
rubygems	rvm
but recently i switched to using rvm rubygems current as per the rvm site but as of this writing rvm doesn t know about rubygems-update 1.8.11

7810826
rubygems	rvm
site says i could use rvm rubygems head but i m a bit afraid irrationally

7810826
rubygems	rvm
can someone who knows more about this than i chime in and either alleviate my fears or tell me how you approach rvm rubygems when they fall out of sync...as it seems to be happening more an more.

7810835
google-chrome	firefox
we could throw in the portable version of firefox or google-chrome and customize the xul for firefox or open google-chrome in app mode

7810873
post	get
i have a facebook application and when i try send a post to wall of some users i get this exception from faceboo last api for php

7810876
post	get
are there performance differentials between get and post

7810885
submit	submission
so for the first time while submission form by clicking its coming in this method and it is preventing form values to submit and after fixing al those values when i am again trying to click on submit button then its not working in console i am getting this error-

7810941
post	get
a useful pattern is post redirect get aka redirect after post

7810942
google-chrome	firefox
you can see the correct effect in the jsfiddle link via firefox moz however it doesn t work in google-chrome webkit

7810942
google-chrome	firefox
looking at the firebug code in firefox the -moz-animation 2s ease 2s normal none 1 ooze appears in the css of the .logoanim - it doesn t appear in the webkit version in google-chrome

7810983
post	get
as for the difference between get and post it is as simple as get is used to send a get request

7810983
post	get
there is hardly any tradeoff in using get or post

7810991
post	put
changing the state on the server adding changing deleting stuff altough recently some web applications use post to change put to add and delete to delete.

7810991
post	put
however you should use post put when transferring data

7810991
post	get
get and post are very different

7811037
int	double
the input parameter for this should not be double int

7811037
int	double
it should be double int

7811037
for-loop	arrays
if you declare this function with just a double like you did then the program will allocate enough space for one double on the stack and your for-loop will be writing on important memory and by that i mean it will most likely just crash for arrays sizes bigger than one

7811037
int	double
void inmatrix double matrix int n

7811041
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

7811192
versioning	upgrade
an aspect oriented approach so that we can back out when you upgrade it to the versioning of spring which fixes this issue

7811199
int	double
double have 52-53 bit precision whereas a long has 64 bit precision for int only

7811199
int	double
your number is 19 digits long whereas a double can only store roughly 16 digits of decimal int data

7811215
onresume	onpause
it happens that when the activity is no longer visible because the notification window is on top of it it doesn t call the onpause event as i expected and when the notification window hides again and the activity goes foregrond the onresume method is not called either

7811239
range	median
my original code with stack 1 size stack 2 1 size stack 3 1 3 didn t make any sense it is exactly the same as stack i was just lucky with median s default option of using the 1st dimension for its working range

7811258
client-side	server-side
i m looking for specific code on how to send a file from the server-side of a gwt application so that the client-side user can save it on his machine

button	checkbox
it is perhaps a clue that the checkbox and button i have in the layout do not return null

7811310
put	get
i can interact with my views and put content into them and everything but i can t get a reference to them in my code

7811311
draggable	droppable
best use the jquery ui draggable droppable

7811315
implements	extends
all you need to care about is that it s something which implements the given interface or something which extends the abstract class

7811324
folder	directory
i am trying to modify the mine craft launcher to check for a minecraft folder in the current working directory and if none exists then use the established routines to crete and download the needed files

7811401
error-handling	exception-handling
the usual error-handling for these exception-handling is simply to retry the connection

7811434
hash	md5
an md5 hash is a 128bit number 16 bytes of raw binary data

if your xml result set is still being truncated even after changing ssms options use the sqlcmd utility with xml on option prior to running your xml statement

7811535
mouseleave	mouseenter
the location is confusing the mouseenter mouseleave event used in hover

7811544
put	get
c anyways once the conversion into expression tree does happen i assume when sql provider receives the expression tree of our where clause and tries to convert it into sql command this sql provider doesn t have the power to execute ids1.first in order to get the result back which it would then put into sql query and hence the exception

7811578
processors	hyperthreading
until now i wrote a mapping n_th thread to n-th logical core but it s not the most smart thing to do due to multi-socket processors and hyperthreading

7811596
teamcity	jenkins
this proved to be easy to do in teamcity and i m thinking it should be just as easy to do in jenkins as well

7811603
hash	md5
i need to put an index on a md5 hash column in the database

7811603
hash	md5
will storing a md5 hash work better in a binary column or a char 32

7811639
int	chars
the binary type will likely be smaller whereas the chars type will encode the values as int

7811649
post	get
this is because the browsers only support two http verbs get and post

7811649
post	put	post	get	put	get
rails uses tricks javascript - i think to pretend the browsers are sending put and delete which would be routed to associate with different actions to those of get and post

7811656
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
i m trying to interpose malloc free calloc realloc etc with some interposers via ld_preload

7811656
free	malloc
in my small test only malloc seems to be interposed even though free is detected see output

7811672
content-length	content-type
i ve seen this happen with proxy servers in 2 conditions when the mime type content-type is set incorrectly in the web server and when the http headers content-length don t correctly include the length missing or wrong values

7811699

7811814
int	chars
guids are in the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx where x is an hexadecimal chars but are internally stored as 128 bit int so they occupy very little amount of space and are very very fast for queries

7811814
int	chars
guids works much better than chars or binary they are fixed size and are often used as keys indices instead of int when more bits are needed due to their very high speed and low space consumption

7811818
free	malloc
this will pull in declarations for malloc and free with an extern c wrapper telling the compiler not to name-mangle

7811818
free	malloc
the reason malloc works is probably because or pulls in a declaration for malloc but not free

7811818
free	malloc
thus malloc is unmangled but free is mangled

7811822
coverity	pc-lint
static source code analyzers for example pc-lint under some configurations coverity prevent grammatech code sonar etc. detect most cases of undefined behavior like you have illustrated

7811831
subtract	add
the same way that you can add or subtract integers or divide floating point numbers without truncation the functions you put in your class determine how it is used by your program

7811879
int	chars
they happen to be strings containing chars also used to represent int in other contexts but they are strings nonetheless and so this is valid json

7811895
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this should show it if the browser has the capability firefox google-chrome opera

7811895
opera	firefox
demo here updated to work in firefox and opera

7811904
postgresql	mysql
worth to mention is that heroku uses postgresql and i use mysql locally if that matters

7811915
hide	show
use the version of toggle that takes a showorhide parameter to show #test when the selected option is not 3 and hide it when it is 3

7811934
google-chrome	safari
latest google-chrome safari are even worse they hide both boxes behind the iframe

7811963
yourkit	jprofiler
two good options are jprofiler and yourkit

width	height
you can check the width height of the view with the visible part of it

7812022
hide	show
there is no builtin hide show column way in listview as much as i m aware of so one of solutions can be just remove that column form ui

7812037
folder	directory
i m trying to get xcopy to copy an entire directory tree and all its files however one of the directory paths includes a hidden folder and although you can use the h parm to specify copying hidden files this doesn t seem to apply to hidden folder

7812078
gridview	sqldatasource
what you should be looking at are gridview and sqldatasource from web forms

7812078
gridview	sqldatasource
sqldatasource is where gridview get the data from and sending the data to which has to connect to the database using a connection string

7812108
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
but i can t find any api on either uitabbarcontroller or on uinavigationcontroller with which to access these children and uimorenavigationcontroller is not a public class so i can t rely on any methods exposed on that class

7812144
post	put
you need to call update on the spcontext.current.listitem that s where the post data gets put

7812152
ocean	petrel
currently this is not supported by ocean for petrel

7812179
button	checkbox
but i need to know when for example someone checks one of the checkbox in the list view or when someone clicks on a button

7812183
cpu	hyperthreading
if the first number is equal to the cpu number 0 in this example then it s a real core if not it is a hyperthreading core

7812183
cpu	hyperthreading
however we are checking cpu13 and the first number is 1 so cpu 13 this is an hyperthreading core

7812205
for-loop	arrays
.subscribe could take an arrays of publishers and push it through a for-loop to subscribe to multiple points of data

7812205
implements	extends
you re just using some dude s widget and one day your widget crashes because you were extends it or implements it based on non-interface methods or non-interface data which happened to change as of v1.2.1

7812230
inherited	properties
if called this way this will refer to an empty object which inherited from the constructor function s prototype properties somefunc.prototype

7812232
16-bit	64bit
since 64bit versions of windows do not support 16-bit programs natively you will have to find another way

7812232
16-bit	64bit
your friend could install the so-called windows xp mode which is microsoft s supported method of running old 16-bit programs on a 64bit operating system

7812247
postgresql	mysql
heroku uses postgresql which has some specific quirks - so if you are working with sqlite or mysql in dev then its possible you might get different behaviour on heroku

7812272
awt	swing
i m just starting to learn awt and swing

7812283
folder	directory
i deleted the derived data folder in the project directory

7812307
profiler	yourkit
there are open source profilers available such as or commercial profilers such as yourkit java profiler

7812317
sorting	grouping
i do see that if you use it sorting them becomes disabled for any column that is in a grouping

7812317
sorting	grouping
does anyone know if there is any work around to this as i can t turn off sorting as its being used today but i would like to be able to leverage this new feature to grouping sets of columns

7812347
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m not a javascript or jquery guru but i have it working perfectly in ie7+ firefox google-chrome and safari pats self on back

7812364

where s is the signature or the message e is the public exponent n is the modulo and m is the encrypted message or decoded signature

7812365
inherited	properties
it is a simple inherited properties

7812366
google-chrome	firefox
the reason it appears to work in google-chrome and firefox is because they support border-radius natively which does work on img elements

7812493
javassist	cglib
other options for handling interfaces would be dynamically creating an implementing object using jdk dynamic proxies or a mock framework like mockito and for handling abstract classes javassist cglib or again mockito

7812502
maven	pom.xml
for reference the needed change is to the compatibility library dependency in the maven pom.xml file to be like this

7812511
width	height
with a set height and width and have its text be vertically and horizontally centered

7812584
versioning	upgrade
is is also possible to upgrade to rails 3.1.1 just using bundle and go back to 3.0.6 if something does not work in the rails versioning

7812805
free	malloc
i am trying to malloc and free a small array table of single letter strings

7812805
free	malloc
i know that this can be done in an array but i want to try and do this with a malloc and free

7812886
division	modulo
you need to use division and modulo

7812902
comparator	comparable
if the java treeset is set with a comparator to deal with the objects sorting logic but the objects class also implements comparable and have valid comparator method implemented on it

7812906
google-chrome	firefox
any reason why this would only play in google-chrome but not firefox 7.0.1 or ie8

7812933
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have several uiviewcontroller loaded via a uinavigationcontroller where i override loadview and setup a custom view to display

7812933
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i think that either the uinavigationcontroller or the uiviewcontroller is able to force it s view to fill the screen when displayed

7812957
put	get
since earlier ios versions ignore public.text our solution is to put all three versions on the pasteboard public.text and public.utf8-plain-text will both get you the plain text and public.html will get you the html text

7812980
chown	sudo
try sudo chown ben ben eclipse_indigo to set yourself as the owner as well as the group-owner

7813053
put	get
you ve to manually put get the values in from the map yourself and or use the reference in el which basically refrences the map

7813053
jsf	seam
seam faces has however hijacked the jsf specific javax.faces.bean package for its flashscoped annotation but this is definitely not from standard jsf api

7813073
codeigniter	pyrocms
i have been using pyrocms and codeigniter for quite some time and truly love it

7813086
nsstring	nsdata
i suspect if you are detecting a limit it is really a limit on the size of an nsstring or nsdata or whatever it is you re supplying to uipasteboard

7813124
admob	inmobi
other providers like admob inmobi mopub all have similar listeners you can set

7813147
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade but i can already tell this is going to be a nightmare and i can t find any definitive source of the compatibility issues between each versioning from 1.2.6 to 1.6

7813178
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size

7813196

void something float a int b chars c

7813196
int	chars

vsto	add-in
i have an outlook add-in project that was first developed in visual studio 2008 using vsto 3.0 and targeting outlook 2007

7813460
mdpi	hdpi
the answer my question though i just need to do 2 things a set the imageview scaletype to centerinside and b duplicate all drawables from the mdpi folder into the hdpi folder as explained above the will make it work

7813460
mdpi	hdpi
in my opinion if the device emulator is running in hdpi and there isn t a matching drawable in the hdpi folder it should be pick the drawable from the mdpi folder without scaling it allowing the scaletype attribute to do it s thing

7813463
width	height
the html element s height and width are controlled by the browser window

7813466
strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup
if you don t want to change the original string you should copy it with strdup or malloc + strcpy and return a pointer to it

7813579
fadein	hide
i tried adding hide fadein 2000 after the append html but this didn t work

7813581
int	double
because of that you can store any object type and if you want to store primitives you ll need to do it with them as int double string ect. instead of int double string

7813604
fadein	hide
if you add hide and fadein after append the problem is that you will be hiding and fading the container not the element you are adding

7813615
folder	directory
this returns the directory name including the folder name so it is returning this

7813656
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly on google-chrome and firefox but it doesn t on ie9

7813656
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox the survey list look like this

7813674
url.action	actionlink
but if you are pretty sure that your route names will be solid and nice you can use routelink instead of actionlink or url.routeurl instead of url.action and specify route name of route you want to use from generating url

7813685
rtos	qnx
i would strongly suggest that you consider qnx neutrino it is free for non-commercial and academic use and has the most robust intrinsic mmu support available in any rtos and all the development tools you need including the eclipse based momentics ide are included

7813685
x86	mips
it runs on arm x86 sh-4 powerpc and mips architectures

7813726
width	height
the width and height are there just so you can see something

7813748
jruby	mri
i have ported my rails 3.0.10 mri app on ubuntu 11.04 to jruby 1.6.4 on ubuntu 11.04

7813748
jruby	mri
those gem statements were gotten using the brute-force method by creating dummy rails apps with different combinations of mri jruby and sqlite mysql and then taking the gem statements from the generated gemfiles for each combination

7813748
jruby	mri
is there a way to tell the database.yml file or the system initializer to pick the adapter based on whether the ruby environment is mri or jruby

7813783
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
take a look at this jsfiddle in safari or google-chrome then in firefox

7813857
margin	height
change the 5px to the desired margin height

7813889
int	chars
i have a tablea id int matchpid chars pid chars set int num chars qid chars qstatus chars

when i tried displaying it would any rescaling of the image it wound up still 4 times smaller than the original when it should have displayed at the same height and width

7813998
folder	directory
there are a couple of options here changing the build directory on the build agent in team explorer right click on the builds folder and select manage build agents

7813998

nsstring	nsdata
i need to convert this nsstring object into an nsdata object without changing its contents at all

7814027
google-chrome	firefox
however some of the users using the system prefer google-chrome or firefox

7814027
google-chrome	firefox
how can i do the same as above get the urls of any open tabs in the browser for google-chrome and firefox

7814086
public	protected
to be honest though such a method would presumably always be private - so it doesn t matter nearly as much as for public protected methods

7814100
width	height
one way to do it would be to create your vc throw a scrollview in it whose x y and width are the same as your backing view but whose height is the height of your backing view minus however high you want your titlebar to be

7814165
width	height
to do this pass a querystring to the url which renders the height and the width of the image at 100

7814165
width	height
if you load the image directly into the webview you can set the height and width of the image

7814222
centos	linux
i ve read about jsvc and am currently operating on the assumption that this is the best way to write a daemon in java for a linux box likely running centos

7814241
google-chrome	safari
so this question applies to safari google-chrome and any other webcore consumers

7814242
pull	push
git is one of the best tools for version management and egit for eclipse provides nice user interface for commit push and pull

7814296
int	chars
if you re using a plain chars perhaps your environment uses a signed chars as allowed by the standard and the int 0xdb is going to be positive while the signed chars value represented by the byte 0xdb is going to be negative

7814356
multiplying	add
similarly in your case even if you get a list like add multiplying sell go take.

7814371

7814404
ubuntu	linux
i run linux ubuntu with the sun version of java

7814407
range	minimum

7814407
google-chrome	firefox
tried on both google-chrome and firefox same problem

7814416
pull	push
you need a branch to push and pull and track your commits

7814423
google-chrome	firefox
in a browser tested in google-chrome and firefox i get no errors or warnings

7814428
getter	setter
if you don t use the setter getter methods for anything don t rely on key-value observing for those properties and don t anticipate that a subclass would benefit from overriding those properties then there s no real downside to just using ivars for iboutlets under arc

7814538
hide	show
i have an org chart using slickmap.css which i modified with toggle show hide

7814575
autocomplete	autosuggest
i have an existing autocomplete function which worked when called from a coldfusion autosuggest input

int	boolean
i have a user model created with devise that has an admin boolean field and a roles int field

7814658

7814808
hide	show
is there a way to hide show the keyboard

7814845
ant	maven
i notice that clojure itself is built using ci and since it s a java dialect i m assuming maybe if no such options exist then maybe i could wrap a clojure build as a maven ant task..

7814857
division	modulo
modern computers tend to have fast division and modulo instructions making the standard euclidean algorithm hard to compete with

7814917
profiling	instrumentation
i ve tried setting breakpoints everywhere and stepping through running it in instrumentation under the zombies profiling but it just bombs out and doesn t tell me where

ant	maven
you want to do all the work in either ant maven gradle etc

7814941
ant	maven
once you can build locally with a well known build framework you just call the same tasks goals in jenkins and its super easy at that point since jenkins integrates nicely with most build frameworks like ant maven gradle

7814966
qgroupbox	qscrollarea
one of the widgets is a qscrollarea containing a qgroupbox

7815032
std	ostream
the problem is that is overloaded for std ostream and returns a std ostream

7815083
yacc	bison
to do it properly youd need to define some sort of grammar and then maybe use a lalr parser or some tools such as yacc bison or lex to build a parser

7815106
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview which gets populated from an sqldatasource via datasourceid

7815154

7815191
width	height
the problem is the canvas height binded value which cause the image not to be shown although it has beec defined same as the canvas width which works and the convertor returns the corect value

7815192
keydown	keyrelease
you could use the keydown event and push every keys in a list array stack etc. then clear it on the keyrelease

7815206
put	get
can i just put the icontainer i get at the application initialization from builder.build in a static variable

7815213

iboutlet	ibaction
i ve managed to setup other applications following simple tutorials to achieve interactivity with iboutlet and ibaction

7827488
uiview	calayer
on ios every uiview is backed by a core animation calayer so you are dealing with calayers when using a uiview even though you may not realize it

7827488
uiview	calayer
uiview s animation capabilities have grown as the ios sdk has matured but there are still a few things that are best done by interacting with the underlying calayer

7827489
build.gradle	gradlew
add to arguments the switch -b filename.gradle if you use a gradlew build file other than build.gradle

7827695
ubuntu	linux
i m using eclipse indigo on ubuntu linux 11.04

7827701
googletest	gmock
in short simply add_directory with your googletest or gmock source code and then you can depend on public library targets defined there

7827711
google-chrome	firefox
what makes it worse is that if you look at this in a browser firefox or google-chrome before deploying it to the device it renders perfectly

7827731
width	height
or you can use createcompatiblebitmap to create compatible bitmap providing width height from obtained bitmap

7827753
getter	setter
data with no encapsulation has getter setter allow public access to them

7827781
post	get
also you can use the get method insted of post to send the data to the other place and make sure the other place redirects you back

7827795
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie

7827801

this is postgresql syntax but you can easily translate it into mysql

7827806
tablet	galaxy
honeycomb tablet support this -- i have used the xoom and galaxy tab that way

7827834

you could use a virtual machine vpc vmware or virtualbox and tune the memory down

7827836
rsa	aes
for the project i just need rsa aes and sha

7827914
x86	64bit
set the target platform on your exe project to x86 if you have a 64bit operating system

7827928
width	height
the width and height of the presented view are smaller than those of

7827930
put	get
i think it could be put into one regex but idunno - i might get around to it

7827967
bash	zsh
printf is probably available as usr bin printf and or bin printf and it s also a built-in in some shells bash and zsh anyway but its behavior is much more consistent

7827994
submit	submission
if you are going to trigger form submission using js and there is almost never a time when doing so is better than having a submit button then you need to manually fire any other functions you want to run at the same time

7828059
codeigniter	fuelphp	codeigniter	kohana	fuelphp	kohana
either way take a look at fuelphp a framework inspired by both kohana and codeigniter

7828119
put	get
having looked around the web a bunch i ve struggled to find a definitive answer on how to get mvc mscharts working in .net 4 so i ve picked up bits and pieces every-which where to put in my web.config

7828121
keydown	keyup
i can use the mousewheel event with a flag set by the keydown keyup events to keep track of when the shift key is pressed

7828140
google-chrome	firefox
you can check information about indexeddb which is already implemented in webkit google-chrome 12 as window.webkitindexeddb and also firefox has implemented it

7828159
many-to-many	one-to-many
imho the missing link in your understanding of modeling data with an rdbms is grokking one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

7828172
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this link works fine on google-chrome firefox internet explorer and safari on windows

7828208
client-side	server-side
you could do this easily client-side with pycassa but cassandra does not support server-side filtering

7828216
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i am trying to populate a qtreeview from sql data - using qabstractitemmodel and having a great deal of trouble understanding it tbh

7828232
int	double
so i have placeholders here and no actual int double values

7828232
put	get
i am searching for a library which allows me to get the first placeholder put via a database query for example a value into the placeholder and proceed with the next placeholder

7828263
post	get
i will post the resolution if get a resolution from apple

7828279
put	get
in your controller you will need to get the values from the database and put them in your model or the viewbag

7828280
post	get
from there you would query the stream table for the post to get more information

7828315
hide	show
so far i am able to use javascript to show hide the correct elements but what i am not sure how to do is highlight the tab that is active and how to draw the lines surrounding the tab

7828316
int	chars
depending on the range of chars expected you could create one or more arrays of int initialize all indexes to 0 and set them to 1 for each found chars using character.getnumericvalue

7828329
quicksort	mergesort
i pick up some algorithms and code them in the target language i did this for python for instance my main background is java mergesort quicksort tree search etc

7828346
folder	directory
in your root solution directory there is a folder called test results following the test runs

7828372
int	double
and division always does double division in powershell anyway even if int are given so enforcing type double won t stop int usage and will make sure the input type is what you expect

7828388
lxml	elementtree
if you don t have lxml installed you can use elementtree which is included in the standard library

7828402
udp	mtu
the ideal is that of the mtu of your network for normal ethernet that means an udp payload of 1472 bytes

7828419
xstream	jdom	xstream	dom4j	jdom	dom4j
other options include xstream or xmlbeans for higher-level abstractions and dom4j or jdom for lower-level ones--you have to do more work with these but have a lot more flexibility

7828473
mongohq	mongolab
so instead of using amazon simpledb i am now using a combination of mongohq mongohq.com and mongolab mongolab.com

7828497
implements	extends
public class settingsactivity extends preferenceactivity implements

7828502

7828522
voip	sip
i have a voip application i am working on using the opal voip sip stack

7828537
min	max
both the min and max function declarations in the implementation file receive the errors

7828580
puts	gets
the application makes use of regular html gets as well as ajax gets puts and posts returning both html and json

7828592
try-catch	exception-handling
in netbeans and probably eclipse if you simply enter the code without any try-catch block the ide will hint to you what exception-handling will be thrown and offer to wrap the statements in a try-catch block

7828611
prop	each
i managed to temporary sort of workaround by setting condition above on hidden prop on details band of each table and it kinda worked except it shows me department header categ header for all dept categs combinations no matter they have or no details records - which obvious is not good

7828646
spweb	spsite
the creation of my spsite spweb objects is wrapped in a call to spsecurity.runwithelevatedprivileges and i have other code that runs which finds deletes updates attributes on folders etc.

7828660
sorting	filtering
sql by itself is not very efficient but the storage engine for sorting filtering presenting is

7828669
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if you are really really paranoid you could catch runtimeexception that should get all unchecked-exception that you would want to deal with--it s not a recommended tactic but can prevent your program from failing from some unknown unseen future bug.

7828772
inherited	subclassing
for example if there is a single table inherited base named actors and a subclassing commenter the actor factory file could require a nested file for commenter

7828792
postgresql	mysql
i noticed that postgresql has a new create foreign table function for connecting to a mysql database

7828806
pull	push
it said it failed to push some ref to the server so i googled it and someone said i needed to do a git pull first

7828849
flip	slide
however since the upgrade to ios 5 these core page transition animations slide left slide right and flip have become very jerky

7828865
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
on the site i have a calculator that does combinations and permutations and now i am trying to include a matrix calculator that will add subtract multiplying and inverse matrices

7828915
integer	unsigned
if your compiler supports an unsigned 64-bit integer type unsigned long long or whatever microsoft calls it use that

7828915
hash	md5
if there s some kind of order non-randomness predictability in the uuid values that makes that unsuitable you can compute an md5 or sha-1 hash and discard all but 64 bits

7828915
hash	md5
if you re restricted to a 32-bit integer you can xor the four 32-bit quarters of the uuid together or discard all but 32 bits of the md5 or sha-1 hash

7828924
hash	md5	openssl	libcrypto
through experimentation i found in openssl 0.9.8r that libcrypto has 2 algorithm dependencies md5 for the random-number generator s algorithm in crypto rand_lib.c and sha-1 for printing certificate hash in crypto asn1 t_x509.c

7828924
rsa	aes
i also successfully built it with everything except aes rsa sha and md5 as the question asked

7828981
cpython	pypy
no you can t embed cpython inside pypy afaik

7828981
cpython	pypy
you can however use distributed parallel execution systems to make pypy talk to cpython

7828985
ssl	https
if i connect to the https server from outside my app using a browser i get an ssl warning which i can ignore and then the video player starts

7829005
ubuntu	linux
i m running a command in my linux server ubuntu

7829017
free	malloc
also avoid locking a mutex when performing any long running operation such as calling new malloc delete free or any system calls

7829052
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
using view-scoped beans is almost always going to happen when using ajaxed jsf 2-based gui toolkits like richfaces primefaces icefaces etc

7829052
primefaces	richfaces
are for components used solely at the presentation layer here by richfaces primefaces etc

7829127
gmail	hotmail
the latter is also consistent across gmail hotmail and outlook 2010 and likely others those are just the ones that i tested

7829141
setinterval	settimeout
why not use settimeout or setinterval to handle the timing for you

7829181
int	chars
because int comparisons are more efficient and simpler than unicode chars comparisons

7829181
filtering	grouping
and then do the grouping on a join of the kind catalog table and a subquery of the log table that first filtering by date

7829186
folder	directory
doesn t matter what it is named and which directory is selected though i use rails.dev and the folder i keep my rails apps in

7829247
put	get
since i had to parse through several of these answers to get things working with xcode 4.2 i thought i d put it all together

7829271
min	max
also i m not very fond of the max min solution i was not the one who came up with that idea and i would like to avoid that if possible

7829291
tablet	galaxy
i m developing my first android app for the samsung galaxy tablet

7829293
direct3d	gdi
so no you cannot have both hardware opengl or direct3d acceleration and gdi support for the same window

7829310
touchesbegan	touchesended
1 in the touchesbegan of your view controller iterate thru your array of buttons to see if perhaps the touch fell on one of them and then track the touch until the touchesended call

7829312
put	get
correct me if i m wrong but it seems i can t get an app access token unless i have the app secret and it seems obvious i should not put the app secret in javascript

7829324
coldbox	fw1
this is with coldbox but you should be able to implement something similar in fw1

7829329
min	max
mongodb is slated to get native aggregation functions for things like sum avg min max in version 2.1.1 currently slated for nov 1 2011

7829361
many-to-many	one-to-many
i see this as a one-to-many relationship as each item in the second table can have many comments but no two items can be associated with the same comment entry in the itemcomments table so a many-to-many relationship does not apply

7829387
udp	tcp
i then usually read random values of ports tcp udp whatever and paste it into random places in my router setttings page and repeat this process until the damn thing starts working

7829394
width	height
if the height or width attribute isn t set on one of the images or isn t a number then trying to divide with it might result in a nan result

7829415
tablet	galaxy
again i am pretty sure none of the galaxy tablet can make or receive a phone call

7829451
bazaar	git
subversion mercurial bazaar and git all support moving files around while keeping it s history

7829468
getter	setter
since groovy creates a public field into a getter and setter under the hood spring sees the setter and grails is configured to inject by name so as long as the field setter matches a spring bean name it works

7829473
let	curry
ecmascript 5th edition introduces the function.bind method that implements partial application or more specifically curry that would let you write this the following way

7829508
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie but fails in google-chrome and firefox

7829517
listview	gridview
how could i make the focus switching between views moving faster in fact i have a gridview and a listview when i press the right button to move from the gridview to the list it takes more than 2 secondes

7829592
express	node.js
i m currently building an app using .post to connect to my api backend which is powered by express and node.js

7829606
rss	feed
so far i ve found the only non-deprecated way to access google news data is through their rss feed

7829607
subtraction	addition
you can reduce a long string of combinations anyway you want as long as you don t change the left-to-right-order of objects addition is ok 5+3 +1 5+ 3+1 but subtraction isn t 5-3 -1

7829607
multiplying	add
3 - 4 6 add 1 to input and multiplying input by 2 and wrap the multiple results

7829607
multiplying	add
3 - 4 6 - 5 8 7 12 add 1 to input and also multiplying input by 2 keeping both results then do it all again to both results and then wrap the final results in a list.

7829624
fseek	fread
a good approach is to write a consumer function that acts something like fread and fseek which maintains its own state

7829669
debian	linux
i am using debian linux

7829678
qgraphicsview	qscrollarea
qscrollarea for some reason is ignoring the contentmargins setting when i set qgraphicsview as its widget

7829685
firefox	safari
i see this in safari but not in firefox

7829724
filtering	grouping
i have applied a filtering expression for grouping level like this in ssrs 2008 r2

7829725
jar	war
i have a legacy war project that depends on a jar project the jar project needs to add a few unmanaged jars to the classpath for compilation

7829733
put	get
i imagine that i will also have an issue with the second parameter not having quotes around it as well every time i put quotes around it i get an xml error

7829745
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you cannot for some reason use toggleclass you d have to bind to mouseenter and mouseleave individually

7829803
textkit	uitextview
now uitextview uses textkit internally it s much easier

7829805
ubuntu	mint
environment is mint 11 not sure if this is based on ubuntu maverick or natty running mono 2.10.5 from badgerports

7829810
nexus	artifactory
there are many free open source ones i recommend artifactory or nexus

7829823
width	height
i just wanted to clarify something here for cocos2d does setscalex and setscale y adjust the width and height of the object

7829849
uiview	subviews
i have a uiviewcontroller with a uiview as a subviews

7829852
apache	nginx
you can either set to that true or use a real server like apache or nginx which will serve the static assets

7829854
boost	allocator
what s the best way to store a bit array in c++ no boost just standard containers representing for example a volume allocator bitmap

7829878
for-loop	loops
and iterate through the vector with a while loops or a for-loop until myitr reaches myvector.end

7829891
put	get
i imagine that i will also have an issue with the second parameter not having quotes around it as well every time i put quotes around it i get an xml error

7829912
uiview	subviews
the solution i used is to create a container uiview then add the uiimageview as a subviews then add the buttons text boxes etc

7829936
bitarray	bitset
the std bitset will do as long as your bitarray is of fixed size

7829965
writetofile	nsdata
will writetofile atomically for nsdata nsarray etc

7830009
mbunit	mstest
if you are using mstest xunit mbunit etc

7830029
oracle10g	oracle9i	oracle10g	oracle11g	oracle11g	oracle9i
questions involving xmltype should be tagged with a specific oracle version when possible oracle9i oracle10g oracle11g

7830044
ssl	https
i forced the load of all pages to https with .htaccess so that the flex app loads with ssl

7830077
client-side	server-side
say i wanted to factor out some common code between my client-side .cljs and my server-side .clj various data structures and common operations can i do that

7830124
int	chars
i m guessing that one of your callvisit components isn t an object but a scalar int float chars etc

7830135
debian	linux
in debian and related linux distributions this can be done with

7830145
gtk	gdk
i would instead like to make it a semi-static drawing platform that display one or more images using gtk gdk and i would like to imitate the excellent api principles of tikz the latex package

7830145
gtk	cairo	pygtk	pycairo
unfortunately the cairo gtk pycairo pygtk documentation that i found --- i don t know who it s written for but not for me

7830145
gdk	cairo
the point is that gdk make a temporary double buffer when you draw things in gdk including using cairo

7830145
gdk	cairo
so it would be much nicer if cairo could write to a permanent double buffer rather than a temporary one and then that permanent double buffer would be exposed with gdk

7830145
gtk	cairo	gtk	gdk	gdk	cairo
what i really care about is creating a permanent double buffer pixel array between cairo and gtk gdk instead of a temporary double buffer pixel array

7830145
gtk	cairo
it seems that the easiest way to do that is to make the gtk window a cairo surface and make the double buffer another cairo surface

7830147
hide	show
like pretty much all of the apex visualforce tags apex outputlink has a rendered attribute which can be used to show or hide it and this can use a merge field formula for the value so you ll be looking for something along the lines of

7830166
isnull	nullif
you can use isnull and nullif to manipulate the nullability of view columns thereby forcing ef to pick the pk you want

7830175
ubuntu	linux
either writing a long value in java has different result on 64 bit macos and 32 bit linux ubuntu

7830177
cgi-bin	httpd.conf
in the httpd.conf look for the scriptalias directive that has an entry for cgi-bin should be something like

7830287
explode	implode
as a more direct answer you could fix your current way by getting the list of wishes explode ing them removing the one you don t want from the array and implode ing it back to a string to update the database

7830292
erd	diagram
and i believe that class diagram is different from erd

7830370
apache	nginx
nginx lighthttp apache or other

7830388
int	double
your now shown the price when reaidng since you write it as a floating field or double cant see the definition and read it as an int

7830404
jruby	mri
i have a web app which works for the most part with mri ruby and jruby

7830487
apache	nginx
i have read and used apache for this purpose but apperantly based on the benchmarks nginx and lighthttp serves static files better

7830513
factors	matrix
then you want to do an eigenvalue decomposition on you can use 1 size amm 2 -1 as a scale factors if you want an interpetation as an unbiased covariance matrix with

7830529
memcpy	malloc
you can either declare an array of a really large size that would not possibly be filled by the user input then use scanf or something like that to grab the integers until you hit n or you can grab each integer at a time allocating memory as you go using a combination of malloc and memcpy calls

7830534
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
you can clear the previous interval using clearinterval or use settimeout instead of setinterval

7830543
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is not settimeout

7830620
pop-up	dialog
i get this error when i am selecting a contextmenu item to pop-up a custom dialog

7830693
post	get
i tried merging the corresponding jade files and arranging the get post register and login paths in my server file to be the same

7830718
ubuntu	linux
this works fine on my windows development machine but when i deploy to a ubuntu linux server for further testing it throws the error templatelookupexception template uri .. js fund_page.js is invalid - it cannot be relative outside of the root path

7830720
right-align	center-align
you can choose whether to left-align center-align or right-align each object in the linear layout

7830732
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it is implemented in firefox google-chrome ie 11 edge opera after 12.1 and the android browser from 4.4.4 see the caniuse prefetch page for more and up-to-date details

7830732
opera	google-chrome
prerendering caniuse spec ie 11 edge google-chrome opera

7830732
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
preconnecting caniuse spec firefox google-chrome 46 opera 33

7830732
opera	safari
dns prefetching caniuse spec ie9 see note below ie10 every other browser except opera mini and perhaps ios safari and the android browser

7830766
.htaccess	httpd.conf
remember if you put these rules in the main server conf file usually httpd.conf rather than an .htaccess you ll need to use .

7830867
portrait	landscape
bottom controller only supports portrait device is in landscape and a view controller that supports landscape is presented. however this is arguably a misfeature

7830899
gtk	cairo
do you mean to ask how to use cairo drawing to draw onto gtk widgets

7830899
gtk	gdk
firstly there is nothing called gtk pixbuf i think you are referring to gdk pixbuf

7830899
gtk	gdk
most the drawing stuff in gtk is done at gdk layer

7830899
gtk	cairo	gtk	gdk	gdk	cairo
although my experience with python bindings for gtk gdk cairo is nil but i think that google will provide you with some good resources if you look up gdk-cairo sample

7830927
rdf	owl
what is the relationship between rdf and owl

7830927
rdf	owl
it seems like rdf is used to describe web resources does owl can do the same thing

7830954
free	malloc
i am currently having to write implementations of malloc and free and am given a driver program that will run my two implementations

7830954
free	malloc
i have the line and line number from running gdb but i need to know if malloc and free have been called more than once to confirm that there is indeed at least one case where it runs smoothly

7830957
cout	cin
do not suggest that i use c++ strings or cin cout because that will not help me for this assignment

7831001
width	height
there is also many other cvpixelbufferget methods to enquire width height etc for knowledge of the size of data to be transmitted

7831037
unicorn	webrick
if i place it into the initializers it works once then it won t continue to work on any rails server webrick unicorn but it works fine in the console

7831059
multiplying	add
you combined the add and multiplying delegates so both get called when you call c x y

7831092
klocwork	coverity
i am only familiar with two commercial products coverity and klocwork

7831096
accessor	properties
keep in mind that properties are really just to quote apple a syntactical shorthand for declaring a classâ s accessor methods. in fact by itself the properties declaration doesn t even work

7831103
ubuntu	linux
how can i disable os-level keyboard shortcuts alt-tab ctrl-alt-left right etc. on a ubuntu linux machine

7831117
autocompletetextview	spinner
so that you can use use spinner to select the category and use autocompletetextview to type and select items

7831130
width	height
like he she can say that the html table its tr its td have this height or width

7831173
awt	swing
note that swing is built on top of awt so this will work for swing. however i m not sure how to do this

7831177
disk	ram
create a ram disk using software appropriate to your os

7831177
disk	ram
use create tablespace to create a db cluster on the ram disk

7831177
disk	ram
obviously your ram tables will not persist across system reboots unless you save the ram disk

7831203
int	double
you can think of delegates as a cross between value types like int or double and arrays of method addresses

7831203
multiplying	add
when you then call something like c 4 2 you are effectively calling both add multiplying and because the delegate returns a value you only get back the final delegate s value - in this case from multiplying - and that s what makes it appear that the pointer changed to the multiplying method

7831203
multiplying	add
now if you change your add multiplying methods to look like this

7831230
jar	war
i put rebel.xml in src hot but it doesn t work i tried modifying build.xml to copy rebel.xml to the war s web-inf classes and the root of jar i opened the .ear file with winrar checked the war and jar files are in those locations but still nothing

7831237
post	put
if there is difference of one or two properties i would still use the same viewmodel and where these properties are not needed i will put them in hidden inputs so they travel back with the form post not allowing unwanted results

7831265
hide	show
i could simply hide and show the sheet another time or two

7831437
google-chrome	safari
this only take place in google-chrome and safari

7831454

since strtok carves up the original command array you don t have to allocate extra space with malloc

7831669
strncpy	malloc
note that if the path leading to the command name is 50 characters or more you won t have a null-terminated string - the space allocated by malloc is not zeroed and strncpy does not write a trailing zero on an overlong string

7831708
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
it differs with the answer below in that it subclasses qgraphicsscene not qgraphicsview and it uses so there isn t a need to manually map coordinates

7831708
qgraphicsview	qmouseevent
you need to subclass qgraphicsview to be able to do something with mouse presses or with mouse releases using qmouseevent

7831708
qmainwindow	qwidget	qgraphicsview	qmainwindow	qgraphicsview	qwidget
if you don t use a qmainwindow and a form you can add it to a qwidget if you set a layout for it and then add your qgraphicsview to that layout in a similar manner

7831708
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
be sure to read and study about qt s graphics view framework and the related examples to be effective when using qgraphicsview and qgraphicsscene

7832188
mouseover	mouseout
use jquery.hover instead of mouseover and mouseout

7832203
post	get
so this is what i am doing for get data if it is in post method

7832233
hide	show
this will hide all show divs except the one you clicked

7832268
dictionary	map
as far as why this is good the reason should be simple when you have a design where things map from one thing to other and this mapping will always be static it is obvious to represent it as dictionary rather then if else or switch case which hides the intention that it was just a mapping

7832273
inherited	properties
i have a view which inherited the navigationcontroller properties but when i click an image inside this video i need to present a viewcontroller modally

7832334
ilist	icollection
in order to specify the xml element names of an array ilist icollection etc. and it s items you have to use the attributes xmlarray and xmlarrayitem

7832355
jikes	javac	jikes	gcj	gcj	javac
this gives you the ability to specify the path of your executable when using jikes jvc gcj sj or whatever version of javac you are using

7832358
gcj	javac
the exec command would also allow you to call gcj instead of javac

7832414

i ve upgrade to ios sdk versioning 5 xcode 4.2 monodevelop 2.8.1 and monotouch 5.0

7832552
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
it looks like you are confusing the structure of how to nest a qgraphicsview and a qgraphicsscene

7832552
qgraphicsview	qscrollarea
when you set a widget or qgraphicsview to a qscrollarea you change that widget s parent

7832552
qgraphicsview	qscrollarea
so if you wanted to set up your qgraphicsview inside a qscrollarea your code would look like this

7832552
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qscrollarea	qscrollarea	qgraphicsscene
when using qgraphicsviews with a qgraphicsscene instead of setting the margins using a qscrollarea s setcontentsmargins i use the qgraphicsview automatic scrolling and just set the scene rect to have a larger margin that the size of my content like so

7832571
post	get
in fact these two are the same webscript one just acts on a post and the other on get

7832673
post	get
quoting from your post as i suspect it will get edited.

7832722
maven	cobertura
yes using the cobertura settings in the maven plugin you can set it to fail the build at when coverage drops below a certain percentage

7832785
hide	show
you need to make the smoke rise off the viewable area or fade out at its apex hide it then reset it s starting height top or top-margin depending on your method property to make it show up back at the bottom and fade it in again

7832789
rdf	owl
as a very crude approximation you can think of owl and rdfs rdf schema being in the same category and you can think of rdf as the underlying somewhat abstract language that is used to express everything in the world of semantic web including actual resources as well as descriptions in owl and rdfs

7832818
post	get
it looks like you just need to post an updategl right after you get the new position values

7832850
width	height
i know i don t really need that since i can just substract width 2 height 2 but everything would be easier if the origin was at the tl

7832876
packets	multicast
you need to enable multicast loopback in order to recieve packets sent by yourself

7832902
uitableview	reloaddata
just add one uitabaleview and perform check on your data set flags for example if currently your uitableview is filled with array1 and now you want to to fill it with array2 just set flag and call uitableview reloaddata

7832983
put	get
the problem with the child method is that you end up with lots of entities which means more cost because you pay per get put query result at least under the new pricing

7832987
pull	push
however with this workflow you couldn t deploy directly from your github repository - you would need to pull it locally and then push to the ec2 machine

7832991
post	get
i have a class for posting to website using a post or get and read the response

7833077
folder	directory
the following are some examples to these error messages that are issued when i attempt to commit add the manually copied files folder to so mentioned directory

7833114
superclass	subclassing
if you define equals method in each subclassing when comes the situation where equals in abstract superclass is called

7833114
superclass	subclassing
just imagine set with superclass as type populated with objects that are two instances of two different subclassing

7833114
subclass	abstract-class
in your example equals method possibly implemented in abstract-class log will not be called if we have implementation already in actual subclass

7833131
width	height
do we need to get some information like video width height from streams or do we just need to pass the streams to decoder

7833131
width	height
i think some video renderers use width height information from videoinfoheader structure.

7833179
sorting	filtering
i want to create user views tables with sorting and filtering capabilities

7833179
sorting	filtering
but i found jxtable and it has methods for sorting and filtering and this how i want it to work sorting and filtering must provide ui component and model just can hold data

7833179
sorting	filtering
but glazedlists also provide sortedlist decorator for eventlist with sorting and some filtering methods

use gesture recolonization for this it work fine.in first tap u show price and second hide

7833217
mbunit	nunit
some implement tests within sql others within your code and use mbunit nunit etc

7833229
textview	imageview
my guess is the reason why it s in the bottom of the page is because of the linearlayout in the end you will have 3 children textview imageview and imageview all below each other

7833235
uiview	subviews
uiview that exist solely as subviews in ib are managed by the state of their superview

7833250
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
its first param is uiviewcontroller and uinavigationcontroller is uiviewcontroller s subclass

7833250
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
so cannot directly present a uinavigationcontroller but you can present a uiviewcontroller and add uinavigationbar and uibarbuttonitem to it manually or use interface builder

7833268
post	put	post	get	put	get
each method invocation is a http get post delete or put request

7833604
jsf	seam
how can we resolve jsf el expressions programmatically on seam managed beans

7833658
actionscript	haxe
also you could try porting it to haxe which is very similar to actionscript and should allow you to build for both android and ios at once

7833660
facebook	fbconnect
the things become a bit more difficult when you want to introduce fbconnect within already existing login base while you have to find a way to bind the identified facebook user with your user account

7833670
mouse	keyboard
how can i programmatically generate 1 mouse click and immediately after it 1 keyboard click

7833684
mouse	keyboard
take a look at the robot class which can be used to programmatically generate mouse clicks and keyboard strokes

7833725
portrait	landscape
i think the uitableview s height is still same with the value in landscape mode after you rotate device to portrait

7833785
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when that succeeds i call another view controller in which i add a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller to the view

7833799
width	height
specifying the width n height in background.js fixed the problem for ipad

7833803

here dmitry is constraining the drag between a min of 15 and a max of 85 px

7833894
versioning	upgrade
you should also check with the developer of the module if they have a separate 1.4.9.x versioning as they might and most developers will actually give you an upgrade at no extra cost too

7833894
post	get
you could always get in touch with a developer on the opencart commercial forum to upgrade it or if this is a free extension you could post it in the free extension area and request help off anyone that can for upgrading it

7833908
versioning	upgrade
the versioning of perl on the ftp server is 5.8.8 i can t upgrade it

7833978
rdf	owl
if you re just generating or consuming semantic web data rdf you don t need to worry bout owl

7833978
rdf	owl
the relationship is a bit complex as owl files are written in rdf and describe rdf data

7833983
ubuntu	linux
dear moderators this questions combines issues that relate not only to programming but also to server administration unix software and particularly ubuntu linux issues

7833993
post	get
but i want to get rid of step 3 the application should be aware of that there are no more post left to render at step 2

7834087

i can use strlen and substr but

7834103
unsigned	short
edit sorry if i forgot to mentioned my variable that stores the hexadecimal number is an unsigned short

7834109
sorting	filtering
the rownum filtering applies before the sorting

7834126
spaces	delimiter
for those who don t want spaces as the delimiter simply don t use s

7834151
namedtuple	dictionary
in addition the answer provided by detly if you don t know about the fields of the dictionary before hand you can construct a namedtuple class with

7834153
codeigniter	cakephp
after you gain some experience consider using a php framework like codeigniter cakephp or zendframework

7834153
perl	tcl
in fact in my experience php is faster than any dynamic language i have benchmarked it against - python perl ruby tcl are all slower performing than php

7834195
int	chars
if it is a value stored in a different type lets say int then just simply remember the fact that hex encoding needs 2 chars per 8 bits to encode the whole value range

7834252
width	height
for media types that require a running stream you can also play the stream extract the media parameters such as width and height and then setup your graph correctly

7834252
width	height
do we need to get some information like video width height from streams or do we just need to pass the streams to decoder

7834252
width	height
i think some video renderers use width height information from videoinfoheader structure.

7834252
width	height
depends on the decoder some decoders just require you to stream the media and then setup everything correctly others may require that the width and height etc be correctly configured

7834258
inherited	properties
your second snippet basically means that a baz is-a foo so a baz instance in addition to its own properties has the same properties as a foo instance inherited

7834299
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
then just limit the action in the touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent and touchesended withevent methods to perform only when there is a single touch

7834303
rdf	owl
being disjoint is example of one of the logical assertions you can state in owl that you can t state in rdf

7834356
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller has navigationcontroller property that is handled by the framework and it points to the parent uinavigationcontroller if the view controller in question has one

7834389
pop-up	dialog	screens	tablet
i do have a bit of weir behavior that the android app wants to force quit a few times and the connection to the adk is not made immediately can t choose to have the accessory connect to the app from a list the tablet pop-up but after a few times back and forth between the app and the home screens through several force quit dialog boxes i do get the option to connect the accessory adk board to be connected to the example app and then it all works as wanted

7834436
freemarker	velocity
i think your main option is to use something like velocity or freemarker to produce the pages with embedded calls out to jena to get the appropriate rdf statements

7834465
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr are redirected

7834472
ssl	https
the webservice is based on https ssl

7834479
free	malloc
first set a breakpoint for malloc and free

7834485
min	max
of course you don t need to use optional parameters you can use overloaded methods if you wish to make use of min max or now

7834603
acs	adfs
we also have a need to federate our authentication with external third-party adfs and other systems which is precisely the problem that acs solves very well

7834692
memcached	apc
php has a variety of real good solutions to interchange data between scripts - like a text file a database an apc memcached nosql database

7834732
ubuntu	debian
i don t know if ubuntu has the same package but as ubuntu is based on debian it seems likely.

7834752
profiling	instrumentation
i instrumentation my program and run it under profiling then

7834787
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods should be written more carefully but this should be enough as an example of how to dynamically add a formal property at runtime

7834814
google-chrome	firefox
i have an issue with a site appearing fine in ie and firefox but in google-chrome it is adding a space between my divs of the top logo and the css menu

7834844
udp	tcp
i am going to send an image using tcp ip and then going to update the changes in that image using udp by dividing the picture in to small pieces and sending only the pieces that are having major changes then the client will patch those pieces on the old picture

7834903
folder	directory
when i look at the gem directory it looks like there s exe folder instead of bin

7834920
google-chrome	safari
webkit google-chrome safari appears to extend margins outside top of containers and adding a minute amount of padding in these occasions seems to do the trick

7835007
getter	setter
the type of a getter and setter must match

7835018
post	get
you can use get method or post method..

7835038
hash	salt
you can use and mix many hash methods with additional salt which can be based on domain+other logic that will be very difficult to guess or crack depends what hash algorithms you will use and other things unless someone knows how its done

7835067
post	get
do i have to register my website as somewhere that might get post

7835089
width	margin
you need to specify a width otherwise the margin won t know how to centre.

7835124
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested this on ie 7 8 9 firefox google-chrome and safari on a win7 box

7835244
int	double
roundto double value double towards int numberofdigitsbehindcomma

7835248
converter	multibinding
this could be done using a multibinding with a converter that returns true if the index is equal the count false otherwise

7835258
width	height
i have set enough height and width for it in ib but it looks like the tableview appears on screen with very narrow one row and it does not resize when the tables fills with rows

7835287

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome 14.0.835 firefox 7.0.1 ie9 when zooming out - the top right box size is changing atleast it looks like it and then it is not right aligned with the box below

7835287
width	height
explanation the zoom function on every browser changing the width height of the div but not the border size therefore it cause this glitch float

7835321
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if the database is configured as case-insensitive then you cannot get it to do a case-sensitive comparison on the password unless you resort to tsql tricks

7835321
hash	salt
you should not be storing a password - you should be storing a salt hash ideally salt per user

7835323
helpers	actioncontroller
i assume that view_factory is a helpers method defined in a plugin and it is included to the application helpers with something like actioncontroller base.helper factoryhelpermodule

7835371
int	double
i m trying to get all the double after the into a vector which i can do if they re int but once a . is entered it seems to stop

7835389

i ll post the code links here it s just a small and silly project to test if i can get it up and running so that i can use hibernate in the future

7835438

to show the dialogo you should first hide it i think

7835446
textview	imageview	getter	setter
i define an xml layout .at run time i am get linearlayout from xml layout file i am creating a listview at run.at run time in listview i am adding many relativelayouts as shown in picture # 5 this relativelayout contains different other ui component like textview imageview etc its working fine but when user press back button i am saving listview object using setter method in beans when user comes on activity resume again i am getting listview from getter method and adding it again to my linearlayout as i add above but its giving me exception as java.lang.illegalstateexception the specified child already has a parent

7835463
post	put
after that put up a captcha only after some time interval or some number of post by him her

7835481
primes	modulus
the length of each primes factor must be no more than half the length of the modulus

7835481
exponent	modulo
the private exponent must not be longer than the modulo

7835481
exponent	modulo
the private exponent reduced modulo p-1 resp

7835481
exponent	modulo
technically there are infinitely many possible values for the private exponent d and similarly for exponent1 and exponent2 because all that mathematically matters are the value of d modulo p-1 and q-1

7835481
integer	unsigned
the public exponent here encoded within the rsapubkey field must fit in a 32-bit integer unsigned

7835526
folder	dir
this will create the folder structure a b c in current working dir

7835566
google-chrome	firefox
i put together a site that generally works well on firefox google-chrome and ie8 yes i m new to this

7835599
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should generally not directly add the views of uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller as subviews of your own view controllers

7835599
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this is normally a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc

7835633
inherited	properties
accessing a field via an object properties instead of a direct reference allows you to use prototypal inherited

7835638
put	get
to get around this before your foreach statement put

7835651
gmail	hotmail
however when i did this the mail did not arrive at hotmail and gmail accounts

7835651
gmail	hotmail
if i add more html like a table it still gets rejected by hotmail and probably gmail too

7835671
button	checkbox
i created a web user control using a checkbox and invisible link button

7835740
width	height
note that in flex components that have not been added to the stage may not lay out properly until you give them a width and height and call validatenow on them

7835766
rss	feed
i am trying to aggregate several rss feed and when i try to convert the publish date i get from the feedds i get an exception as the date is in the following format

7835771
width	height
and probably a good idea to include the height and width options too

7835788
width	height
the size of each sector is known sector width and sector height and also the amount of sectors rows and columns

7835788
width	height
all sectors are of the exact same size width and height

7835794
dlsym	dlopen
can i somehow use system.posix.dynamiclinker dlopen and dlsym on it to get actually callable haskell functions

7835851
put	get
i didn t get what you mean exactly because your background depends on the users display resolution but generally if you set the width and margine of html to auto it will scratch all over your page wether user maximize or put in any resolution for scrolling you can also reach what you looking for

7835852
prepare	execute
the fastest way to do it with dbi is to prepare your sql insert statement and then execute it multiple times

7835853
textview	imageview
if you have a textview or imageview inside of your xml for the dialog you can simply just change the helping text image by defining it the same wat as with the button and changing it when appropriate

7835878
primefaces	richfaces
the standard jsf implementation does not offer something like to represent dynamic columns but component libraries richfaces and primefaces have respectively and for exactly this purpose

7835884
jsf	seam
i m running glassfish and i d like to use jsf and cdi seam

7835884

as mentioned by others ctrl+w _ ctrl+w | to maximize within the current tab window layout while respecting min height width settings for various other windows

7835917
width	height
ctrl+w resizes all windows to equal size respecting the minimum height width settings

7835933
range	minimum
if you have a minimum width requirement 1 for non-empty columns remove it 15 times from your 320 pixels generate the numbers in the new range and make the necessary adjustments

7835935
octal	decimal
its called one of bitwise operator it treat their operands as a sequence of 32 bits zeros and ones rather than as decimal hexadecimal or octal numbers.bitwise xor a b returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are ones

rsa	aes
how can i ensure that pycrypto is encrypting data correctly according to the various encryption algorithms such as rsa and aes

7835987
spaces	delimiter
but if this is a string or another byte array with a significant delimiter you can check for the size not for the allocated spaces

7836032
datalist	repeater
actually i want to bind repeater inside a datalist s databound event due to which repeater s bound event is called twice

7836064
int	chars
on windows i get the int and then some chars or byte data

7836107
unsigned	short
in windows wchar_t is the same as unsigned short while in unix it s 4 bytes long so you should create your own vector type to make your code portable

7836109
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome return me the code correctly

7836113
integer	unsigned
a 32-bit unsigned integer type 1

7836113
integer	unsigned
a 4-bit unsigned integer type realized as a bitfield 2

7836122
width	height
when you use float xxx browsers can not calculate the height width of element properly you have to use clear both an element that resides after floating box

7836138
ssl	https
i m using ssl too so i have to tell the app it should use the https scheme

7836142
unsigned	short
everything works fine it s just that wchar_t is a synonym for unsigned short on your platform and so the debugger doesn t know what name to display there

7836165
int	chars
in chars class public static chars fordigit int digit int radix does the same

7836174
maven	m2e
and maven 2 as build tool m2e plugin

7836174
maven	m2e
so question is how to control eclipse or the m2e or maven or whatever is causing the problem not to generate those folders and why i get them in first place

7836187
int	chars
microsoft just wants to facilitate inspecting wchar_t values which are short int s and represent utf16 coded chars on windows so their debugger shows short int s as wchar_t s

7836191
rss	feed
i found this site that allows to convert rss feed into json

7836198
ocl	uml
the object constraint language ocl can be used to define invariants queries pre- and postconditions for mof meta-models including uml models

7836216
centos	linux
working under linux server centos remotly in local network my rails server working there too

7836222
post	get
post vs get - post is meant to change state of server whole get is for reading results -

7836222
post	get
you should use get to retrieve news and post to post comments

7836222
put	get
first update will get everything you may also put a limiton amopunt of news retrieved in single batch

7836234
min	max
i have think about length obviously bounds the square obtained joining min latitude min longitude max latitude and max longitude tortuosity average speed average elevation

7836263
getter	setter
you can t use kvo and do custom getter and setter with instance variables other than that they are very similar when using arc

7836268
accessor	properties
you really should be using properties accessor to handle the memory management for your lastindexpath1 variable

7836273
for-loop	loops
is there any programming language script who won t allow increasing the counter for an for-loop inside loops

7836348
subtraction	addition
the foundational things that you get with languages tend to be very mathematical and symmetric like an integer is unlikely to have addition but not subtraction

7836352
ant	maven
i would start looking in your maven ant environment properties

7836352
ant	maven
the java_home and other options set int your maven properties or ant properties will be used for the compile and build

7836359
highcharts	highstock
format highcharts xaxis for stock data problem when using the highstock library when the candlestick type is used

7836377
hide	show
in that case storing the data as a rawsxp can be appropriate typically as a slot or element of an s3 or s4 class with print show methods to hide the gory details from the user

7836377
free	calloc
perhaps the downside is that the rawsxp is allocated and managed by r subject to garbage collection whereas the content of an external pointer would likely be allocated more directly via calloc and free

7836405
put	get
i noticed that if i put double quotes on my input boxes that get passed to php via json json_decode will return null

7836414
next	document.write
this is because they can modify the html document including for example adding further scripts that must be loaded and executed before the next script in the original html document via calls to document.write

7836501
pull	push
the table structure seems simple enough but would rather pull from azure than push

7836503

i m able to create any other files and see them in the folder but when i try to create a .htaccess i don t see that file in the directory

7836534

7836579
nsurl	nsstring
nsurl url nsurl urlwithstring nsstring stringwithformat

7836598
hide	show
it works great and show hide its as needed

7836610
pull	push
by and large when it comes to vendor software products they are used interchangeably and do not have the strong distinctions in terms of push or pull as you describe

7836618
post	get
you might spot that i get a mention in his post since i love messing about with those hidden methods

7836681
rss	feed
i have have a webview that show me a webpage that include an url that contains a rss feed how can i store the url before the page is loaded

7836691
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in firefox and google-chrome however the content doesn t load in ie

7836744
width	height
with identity.ortho 0 width 0 height -1.0f 1.0f you were on the right track

7836775
google-chrome	safari
btw im using google-chrome on ubuntu 10.04 if that matters this might be a safari desktop issue

7836820
udp	tcp
anyway imagine a normal server using tcp udp put here your favourite wsgi sip classified information server etc

7836841
webclient	webrequest
i know there is a timeout property with webrequest class but i am not sure if just can replace webclient with webrequest but keep the functionality

7836859
google-chrome	firefox	inherited	properties
the function of code is to swap text-align of all tags in firefox google-chrome this code do perfect work but on ie i have a problem on it i think it read inherited text-align properties after changing parent properties and swap it again

7836875
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all work perfect in firefox and google-chrome - plugin return correct hours until end date but ie and safari shows just nan nan nan

7836923
hide	show
once the date has been established figuring out a way to show or hide the specific image based on date

7836986
hide	show
as to how you d show hide the images i d be inclined to conditionally add a class to elements to be hidden or show

7837036
pull	push
reject pushes where changeset authorship doesn t match authenticated users using a hook in practice this sucks because developers pull from one another and push one another s changesets all the time

7837038
swing	windowbuilder	jfreechart	windowbuilder
it s not a requirement but i have had good luck with building standard swing interfaces with windowbuilder so i d like to go further and include jfreechart components with them

7837047
width	height
there was a new innercontainer class that sets the height and width to 100 to ensure it fills the containing box and thus the borders are where they are wanted

7837051
swt	swing
you can then add a ui layer say swing or swt onto the business logic layer to create a client application similarly you could create a web-app

7837065
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
newer browsers implement json.stringify ie from version 8.0 firefox from version 3.5 google-chrome from version 4.0 safari from version 4.0 opera from version 10.5

7837097
folder	directory
could there be a rename of a folder directory involved

7837103
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that google-chrome and safari both don t do anything on loading refreshing the page - you have to click out- and then inside the window for them to start the animation

7837147
width	height
i have used a 1x1 transparent pixel set the width and height as 100 and it works

7837188
pop-up	dialog
at a high level - the app has a main screen and several modal dialog -type screens that pop-up to manage various user interactions

7837223
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have checked through my php.ini httpd.conf and .htaccess and error reporting is set to e_all but i must have missed something to enable fatal error logging

7837245
client-side	server-side
the hook could be either server-side which wouldn t prevent commit but would prevent pushing that change to your server-side repository or client-side which could prevent the commit but the hook would have to be installed locally by each developer

7837256
folder	directory
note that this will only work if your storedprocedure folder is in the topmost directory of any files that might need to include the files it contains

7837259
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
after a few hours of fixing the browser compatibility bugs in the reportingservices.js file i managed to get it to work on firefox google-chrome opera and safari as well as ie

7837281
implements	extends
is there some oninsert or onsubmit function that i could implements extends for the automatically generated linq-to-sql-classes or some other solution

7837281
put	get
the normal way to do this would be to put restrictions check-constraints triggers and stored procedures in the sql server db but i would like to avoid that in order to keep my code in one place and get syntax checking etc

7837317
textmate	sublimetext
if you aren t opposed to using a different editor there is a liquid mode for textmate which i think may also work on sublimetext if you aren t using a mac

7837317
vim	emacs
then of course there s surely got to be an emacs or vim plugin

7837323
portrait	landscape
upon further testing if i load the navcontroller in portrait with the first view being the table view then switch it to landscape then select the cell then press back it works fine

7837323
portrait	landscape
so the problem only happens if i start the app in landscape and never turn it to portrait

7837327
folder	directory
i would like to find a way that automatically loads a file if it is found inside the specific_modules folder file2.php when called if it is not found it should load file2.php normally from the modules directory

7837334
disk	ram
they use methods of delaying disk write they keep cached copy of data they need to write in ram so that they can achieve fast insert rates

7837338
vim	emacs
the vim o o command is a two key command in emacs

7837354
put	get
if i put following embed code i get the proper preview of the embed code

7837379
google-chrome	firefox
basically i want a program that can generate the list of files google-chrome s network tab in developer tools can make or firefox s firebug plugin

7837407
spaces	delimiter
if you needed to check for multiple words and do it without regular expressions you could use stringtokenizer with a spaces as the delimiter

7837451
maven	pom.xml
and since i m using maven the relevant bit from the pom.xml

7837517
folder	directory
this new location should be the parent directory of the source folder

7837522
pop-up	dialog
if i understood you well on the receiving end a service will be monitoring for events on bluetooth or wifi and should pop-up a dialog requiring user to accept or deny a transaction

7837558
width	height
first i used videoview but the device eken m003s played the video in full screen not within the videoview which i set both width and height by 272 x 153 dp

7837558
width	height
i entered width 272 and height 153 to force width and height of the .mp4 video to be of that size but eken m003s continues to play video in full screen mode

7837587
post	get
i have read the post how to stop wpf tabcontrol to unload visual tree on tab change but i could not get it work i must have missed something

7837637
hash	md5
to get the md5 hash in php use

7837648
margin	height
for example if the whole screen is 320dp height and you want the horizontal list view to be 80dp height you need to set the top margin to 240dp

7837652
hash	salt
salt string salt to add to the hash

7837659
post	put
second i realized that the requestmethod for submitmodifyaccess should be post or perhaps put

7837659
post	put	post	get	put	get
first i believe that in order to do a rest put or post you have to have a get of that exact same url

7837717
width	height
i think you need to explicitly set the width height in the label

7837717
width	height
you can set it to width auto height auto but it has to be set

7837718
for-loop	arrays
i would also prefer that you use a for-loop in this situation as you are looping over a static arrays where the amount of times you need to iterate is known from the beginning

7837744
implements	extends
i have looked into implements this yet we have faced issues in extends the baseexpandablelistadapter due to the java.lang.object being the return type of the method signatures

7837795
vim	emacs
if you re really desperate check whether vim or emacs is compiled with x support in which case you could automate them into handling it for you but this is a longshot

7837808
put	get
i m new to android and im trying to put a httpclient and writing to sqlite table to a service and i just cant get it right

7837929
google-chrome	firefox
this sample code renders differently in firefox and google-chrome

7837996
getter	setter
developer s guide doesn t recommend using getter when you can use direct field access avoid internal getter setter

7838020
put	get
the data originates as an xml file which i ve managed to extract and put into a php format but i m struggling to get the insert and checking functionality working

7838045
hide	show
it might me easier to create the button in markup and then hide or show it programmatically

i want to assign float variables to nsmutable arrays in a for-loop

7838124
hide	show
i would hide pager on rowediting and show it again on cancel or update

7838143

the problem is that for my froyo device the resources in ...platforms android-8 data res drawable-hdpi and ... drawable-mdpi do not look like the checkbox or radio button i see on screen

7838143
button	checkbox
specifically the widgets i see have a larger green fill circle in radio button and checks that extend outside the box for checkbox

7838171
post	get
i was able to get this to happen via ajax specifically calling jquery s .ajax function see with post type but no data

i am accessing a remote data source and found that a group join causes an iqueryable query to be transformed into an ienumerable

7838310
post	get
holds all incoming parameters from both get and post

7838328
lxml	beautifulsoup
use a proper parser like beautifulsoup or lxml in python

7838333
sorting	grouping
then set the sorting at the appropriate level details grouping or a parent group.

7838340
getter	setter
imo you re better off finding the variables and renaming them using the rename variable refactoring which will also correctly handle getter setter renaming if applicable and so on rather than relying on a relatively ignorant search-and-replace

7838365
move	drag
i would like to also have the user move the picture with a drag gesture

7838420
range	min	range	max	min	max
it does need to know which fields it s doing what with--which fields are like versus equals how to handle min and max fields that define a range etc

7838437

debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	slackware	archlinux
as far as i ve experienced it works on ubuntu debian redhat centos slackware and archlinux

7838478
ienumerable	iqueryable
edit for clarification calling toarray on an instance of objectquery iqueryable or ienumerable does hit the database and retrieves a result set

7838534
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and opera looks fine but google-chrome not.

7838557
button	checkbox
however i can t work out how to make radio button and checkbox checked depending on the stored xml data

7838582
width	height
so if i wanted a plane facing up with a width and height of 1000

7838634
int	chars
it tries to convert this string to an int because item.bill_to is a string and string.remove expects an int argument the position from which to remove chars but you pass a string instead

7838643
children	parent
this enables code-reuse and is generally more stable in terms of life cycle then children calling functions from their parent

7838643
children	parent
parent add children but children calling parent implies both objects must be aware and handle type definitions

7838643
children	parent
programmatic implementation should be passed downwards with the parent maintaining control of children

7838670
inherited	properties
incidentally i would suggest that it might be good to define an interface ireadablecustomer in which the properties just have getters and have icustomer inherited from ireadablecustomer icustomer would have to add a new qualifier to its properties definitions to avoid silly ambiguity messages

7838699
portrait	landscape
so it seems if you load a photo which was taken a photo in portrait upside-down it loads in that orientation if you take a photo in landscape left it loads in that orientation

7838922
children	parent
are all the parent defined before the children

7838928
metaphone	soundex
you might want to consider using some other similarity estimation method that actually maps names into distinct groups such as soundex or metaphone

7838986
int	double
note that weight height and fls are double values and yet you re using a d int placeholder for them

7838999
jar	war
you can use clojure.java.io resource to access resources whether they re on the local file system or packed in a jar war

7838999
jar	war
you probably shouldn t try to load them from a directory since you can t be sure where the file is going to end up when its deployed from a jar war or even if it s on the file system at all probably

7839003
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven than add this to your pom.xml

7839030
implements	extends
you can extends basicauth class by looking at dbauth as example and implements the ldap connectivity for user authentication and user mirroring into regular models

7839052
hide	show
when the checkbox is checked the hide div is hidden and the nor div is show

7839053
hide	show
if i hide form a from itself how do i show form a from form b without creating another object

7839182
width	height
one was the problems was that i had to specify a width and height for the map-canvas div

7839184

as far as i know jambi is only available for ubuntu as a binary package and on other linux platforms has to be deployed along with the application jar as fixed version

7839440
put	get
you ll currently need to put a jumper wire between d10 and d4 to get

but this resticts the hight of expanded parent nodes - and hence chops off all the nodes children

7839635
gridview	rowdatabound
finally i ve spread my gridview code across so many events button clicks rowdatabound events from other gridview repeaters etc. i can t imagine why someone would suggest that you only put it in page_load

7839642
put	get
i want to get it s id and put it into a string

7839647
hide	show
there is no need to show hide fragments when transitioning to full screen because the activity stack handles everything you want to do it quickly and easily and keep your code minimal and clean

7839667

is there a way to generate public partial classes or protected

7839708

7839841
cvs	svn
in svn cvs i often created a local checkout of main trunk to start working in the code and then when real commit branch is ready switch to it and start commiting the code there

7839896
super	abstract
i could just throw away customsetup and put all the custom code after super but having that abstract method makes clearer what you re supposed to put there

7839902
for-loop	arrays
you are creating a new arrays every iteration of the for-loop

7839925
sse	avx
my c++ code uses sse and now i want to improve it to support avx when it is available

7840073
range	min	range	max	min	max
until i saw results for min and max that were outside the range of my data i was unaware that summary has a digits argument to specify precision of the output results

7840073
range	min	range	max	min	max
applying summary and range we get the following output - notice the discrepancy in the range values versus the min and max

7840073
min	max
to clarify my issue relative to the answers on the link provided by brian excepting the answer by brian himself it s not that the behavior is undocumented but it s flatly wrong to denote as min and max values which are not min and max

7840073
min	max
maybe one could argue whether min and max should be renamed as approximate min and approximate max but let s not go there.

7840084
folder	directory
so i put my old website in the www folder i uploaded the zend framework directory zendframework-1.11.11 and then created a foder dev in the root directory as well

nsstring	nsdata
i can easily construct the nsdata from my nsstring using datausingencoding

7840132
post	put	post	get	put	get
405 means method not supported the http method get put post etc. is not supported

7840188
min	max
i also had some considerations regarding the min number of rows that needed to be preserved from the initial full matrix and i would discard any candidate submatrices that did not meet this criteria before selecting a submatrix with max d value

7840209
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and firefox but in ie if i select disease a then select disease b it closes all the tooltip dialogs and dropdown buttons and pushes the last one selected to the top of the screen and covers the data button

7840214
lwjgl	jogl
there s a game engine i seen in java called libgdx which is built on top of the lwjgl and jogl and can be used to make android games because it uses google s android framework as well how is that possible

i also tried putting the parameters in a data object for .load but that seems to force a post not a get and i want a get here

7840324
many-to-many	one-to-many
the only question left is to ask whether it is a one-to-many relationship between product and category or a many-to-many relationship

7840339
post	get
currently i have a problem submitting a form breaks down because in appending the table i get an error actionview template error no route matches action vote controller post post_id 245 positive true

7840370
sequence	permutation
edit i wish i could recreate this so i could post some code that i think might be buggy or something else helpful but i ve tried every permutation i can think of logging in on the affiliate site vs the main site having two carts open adding removing products in various sequence but i still can t reproduce the issue

7840374
typedef	struct
like others said a typedef is missing or a struct info instead of emp

7840412

7840438
google-chrome	firefox
once i added position absolute to the div that was containing those buttons the binding doesn t work anymore in firefox and google-chrome but works in ie lol

7840452
daemons	systemd
in my case our systemd group uses a tool for log rotation that requires them to touch the file after rotating it out which causes my daemons to continue thinking that its file handle points to the correct place

7840499
spine.js	backbone.js
you also can use the spine.js instead backbone.js

7840516
submit	submission
when a user submit or visits the submission form check their ip against your db

7840519
width	height
here x would be the width of each sine wave while y is the height of the frame

7840521
uiview	subviews
they are booth in the same controller as subviews of a main uiview

7840529
width	height
here x would be the width of each sine wave while y is the height of the frame

7840538
src	attr
i ve seen other methods using attr src but in each case they specify manually the new src how could i get the code to take the src from the a tag of the thumbnail clicked

7840546
post	get
and when i try to create a post with a text 10 chars as expected it doesn t save the post and i get an error message by default

7840569
width	height
is it possible to make the container to fit the size same as the containing image without explicitly set the width and height of image to container

7840574
firefox	safari
this scenario is handled fine by some browsers but not all -- namely firefox and safari

7840615
pull	push
this could be accomplished most easily with using the push method but i m not too familiar with ajax push or comet technology so i ll give you a pull solution

7840650
versioning	upgrade
with this new versioning tortoise developers now are forcing us to upgrade the folder in order to use it

7840650
versioning	upgrade
we all have to upgrade our tortoise clients in company or maybe wait for a backward compatibility feature on next tortoise versioning

7840680
cos	sin
otherwise if you are always off by + - 90â play around with the sin and cos defining x and y

7840680
cos	sin
there are 8 different ways you can do the sin cos of these two components with varying signs

7840707
width	height
it is because you are setting height and width in onload event which will occur only after image is totally loaded

7840707
width	height
but if u remove that the height and width values are not set and so it would not work

7840710
mp3	ogg
because of licensing issues mp3 is not available on firefox audio tag you will need to store your files as ogg in order for them to work on firefox

7840723
versioning	upgrade
previous versioning of tortoisesvn would just upgrade your working copy to the latest svn format without checking with you

7840749
width	height
then you hit the window.open line which needs width and height which are not yet defined

7840749
width	height
a few milliseconds later your image loads and so do your width and height

7840761
subtract	add
so if i row1 bill is 50.00 and row2 bill is 25.00 how can i add them both and connect the total 75.00 to a textview that will update itself each time a new bill is added or an old bill is subtract

7840783
uninstall	upgrade
i ve personally had upgrade issues several times in relation to using xcode 4.x where the only thing that solved my problems was to completely uninstall the existing dev tools reboot and then install the new ones

7840800
versioning	upgrade
we all have to upgrade our tortoise clients in company or maybe wait for a backward compatibility feature on next tortoise versioning

7840809
accessor	properties
you can also make your life miserable by creating an interface implemented by both base classes and using di to intercept method and properties accessor calls which would then be routed to some kind of common surrogate class that actually provides the implementation

7840861
fast-forward	merge
occasionally as there are changes in a i will need to be able to pull them down and merge them into b s x_master which if i understand this should be a fast-forward as they will be the only changes in x_master branch on b and then be able to merge those changes into b s master and thus onto anyone cloning b s master when they pull

7840861
pull	push
how do i push and pull from b into and from a

7840876
bluetooth	usb
android service to pass the commands to the pc via bluetooth or usb

7840888
post	get
then you dont get offsets if a new post is added during pagination

7840893
crypt	hash
it uses crypt which already generates different hash for the same string

7840911
inherited	subclassing
i have a subclassing of this super that inherited the particular function but would rather it return a new version of the subclassing

7840920
hide	show
we have some sample code called honeycomb gallery you can take a look at here which has a two-column-plus-actionbar layout and the ability to show hide the leftmost column

7840920
hide	show
this should give you a good head start in figuring out how to do layout for multiple fragments and show hide them

7840944
google-chrome	firefox
i got it to work in firefox and google-chrome with no problem

7841015
tolower	toupper
is there a toupper or tolower or similar functions i can use to do a case-insensitive linq to xml query

7841090
post	get
also see this answer ios development how can i get a facebook wall post to show in the friend #39

7841092
width	height
the first number in parentheses defines the width of your marker and the second number defines the height both in pixels

7841097
cdr	cons
when the cdr is null you are just returning the car and in the else line you are doing cons on car and recursion on cdr

7841205
ubuntu	linux
i am using rabbitvcs client for svn on ubuntu linux and it doesn t show me the commit command when i right click on the working copy folder

7841250
pthreads	fork	waitpid	fork
fork wait and waitpid are defined by the pthreads standard and windows is not posix-compliant

7841251
sse	avx
every time you improperly switch back and forth between sse and avx instructions you will pay an extremely high 70 cycle penalty

7841251
sse	avx
when you compile without arch avx vs2010 will generate sse instructions but will still use avx wherever you have avx intrinsics

7841251
sse	avx
therefore you ll get code that has both sse and avx instructions - which will have those state-switching penalties

7841251
sse	avx
therefore you should use either all sse or all avx

7841251
sse	avx
it sounds like you re trying to make multiple code paths one for sse and one for avx

7841251
sse	avx
for this i suggest you separate your sse and avx code into two different compilation units

7841251
sse	avx
if you need to mix sse and avx be sure to use _mm256_zeroupper or _mm256_zeroall appropriately to avoid the state-switching penalties

7841252
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox but not in ie8 or lower

7841265
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
here is how you plot a bunch of points in a qgraphicsscene and show it in a qgraphicsview

7841265
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
read the descriptions for qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview in the qt documentation

7841297

take a look into the fadein and fadeout methods

7841633
hash	salt
i have stored passwords transmitted them using salt verified them a hash etc

7841642
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i m trying to solve is i cannot make a authenticated web service request through openam without using cookies and i cannot figure out how to place the cookies in the flex file upload request well actually this works in ie but is broken in firefox and google-chrome - i read that this is because ie uploads the file in the same browser thread while some other browsers spawn a new thread and the cookie information does not get passed along

7841654
width	height
replace height by width top by right and bottom by left

7841665
width	height
so i came up with this to make it work in the ie i created a div that was covering the entire content of the page and set it to position relative and width height 100

7841665
pop-up	dialog
when the user is at the bottom of the page and clicks on the links dialog pop-up but the main page jumps up to the top

7841678
ubuntu	debian
it s also available as ubuntu and debian package in official repos

7841705
stdout	stderr
you probably don t have an easy way as a subprocess to know what filedescriptors are useful from the parent process unless you pass that along with command line arguments and you certainly don t want stdin stdout or stderr so its perfectly reasonable to before doing anything else close all open files

7841710
hide	show
add the show and hide buttons and make sure it works

7841783
maven	m2e
a standard maven multi-module structure as a single git repo works perfectly fine for me in eclipse indigo with m2e and the git plugin that shows up in that environment.â you can t ask eclipse to do your fetching for you but once you ve pulled from command line you use team share say git

7841800
put	get
that would get put in workbook sheet2 cell a1

7841804
button	checkbox
jqueryui has a button widget that converts radio button or checkbox into button

7841810
disk	ram
or you could run out of ram or the disk might fill up or whatever

7841841
children	parent
if source and target are in different panels is there something different in their implementation like going from ribbon to the parent main grid created by default and then finding the target in the children grid

7841844
firefox	safari
and the odd thing is that it diplays all the characters in firefox and it fails to load the font in safari just if i include the unicode-range parameter in my declaration

7841860
getter	setter
i tried to follow it but as i m new to java i m having a hard time understanding encapsulation specifically the setter and getter methods

7841877
protovis	infovis
there are more interactive toolkits available protovis infovis

7841881
versioning	upgrade
i recently had problems with integration tests after i upgrade my solution to .net 4.0 - the answer to that question was to grab the 64 bit versioning of system.data.sqlite.dll

7841919
pull	push
as for the sequence of pdt vs ipn there is none since pdt is a pull request from you to paypal and ipn is push from paypal to you

7841936
post	get
then i finally go back to the main application screen and try to make my first api call to get the most recent ten post on the user s dashboard

7841976
onresume	onpause
do you do anything special on onpause and onresume

7841976
onresume	onpause
when the phone goes to sleep as far as i know only onpause should be called and when woken up onresume

7841977
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it seems to run very well but on firefox it seems laggy and to take much longer than the prescribed required completion time

7842019
getter	setter
by anything other than my class s own getter setter

7842060
put	get
so can i get the source code and look at it or do i need to maybe put it on the combres issue tracker

7842061
firefox	safari
i am seeing the issue in safari 4 5 and firefox 3

7842075
width	height
ideally i d like to set it s width and height to 50 and let the browser do the rest as the window resizes

7842078
verilog	vhdl
vhdl verilog are the target languages since i hope to work on an fpga

7842078
verilog	vhdl
i ve done some searching and i ve come across the rfc specs for md5 and sha1 but i can t seem to find a combinational avoid clocks please implementation in vhdl verilog anywhere

7842086
ceylon	kotlin
nowadays that more and more strong rivals appear kotlin ceylon it becomes obvious to me that groovy has already passed even its zenith - even its core team is trembling you should see their discussions on grumpy mode

7842153
int	chars
i know that it starts the sequence of chars which are int representation this sequence could be of any length including 0

7842153
int	chars
after the int sequence follows sequence of chars which are not int representation

7842156
multiplying	division
multiplying both sides by the square root eliminating division inequality is preserved because square root cannot return a negative number

7842176
google-chrome	firefox
i m doing it like this in google-chrome and firefox

7842176
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works perfectly

7842194
strtol	atoi
atoi should do what you want to although a more robust implementation would use strtol

7842195
atoi	atof
why does osx document atoi atof as not being threadsafe

7842206
google-chrome	firefox
i test the code in google-chrome ie and firefox

7842216
strtol	atoi
try atoi or the complete strtol

7842302
put	get
if we put this more general we get

7842312
portrait	landscape
when i rotate from portrait to landscape and back the cells in the uitableview resize perfectly on-the-fly while the rotation is occurring

7842312
uitableview	reloaddata
after rotation if i manually call reloaddata or wait until my app triggers it or scroll the uitableview the headerviews will resize and show themselves properly

7842325
strcpy	strncpy
buffer overflow vulnerability in master due to strcpy instead of strncpy it shows you how things work

7842331
classname	inherited
square.h error expected classname before token for the inherited it does not identify shape

7842339
actualheight	actualwidth
you can use the window s updatelayout -method to have actualwidth and actualheight validated

7842360
move	drag
the reason for doing this is that when drag calls move start and up the this object isn t going to refer to your object

7842407
submit	submission
the default action when you hit enter in a text field in most browsers is to submit the form so your browser is submission it after it calls the js because your handler is not suppressing the default action

7842467
put	get
if i put it in my library s libs folder and my app s libs folder i get a dex error saying class already added

7842507
width	height
i want to go one step further run all javascript linked to from the web page and then inspect the resulting dom including visual properties height width etc of elements

7842553
tablet	galaxy
i ve created an android 3.1 tablet app running on a samsung galaxy tab 10.1 that renders an html5 app in a webview using scrollable divs overflow-y scroll

7842563
width	height
you could take a step further and make height a property you take in so you could use for height or width like so.

7842590
pop-up	dialog
i am working on this site and i would like the login dialog pop-up box to pop-up whenever the user clicks on the log in link

7842590
pop-up	dialog
right now i am able to get the dialog box to pop-up using jquery when users submit forms and are not logged-in like in this form has to have some input in there

7842600
button	checkbox
when that button is clicked i need it to also check the checkbox within mycheckboxcontrol

7842666
accessor	properties
you never call -release on the results of a properties accessor

7842689
google-chrome	firefox
this issue repros in both firefox google-chrome for me

7842732
put	get
i ve currently got my code working when i have already put in the data but i would like to get this data from a database

7842736
post	get
again get requests respect the timeout value i specify post requests respect the timeout if 100 seconds

7842736
post	get
i can get the post to respect the timeout value if i don t post any data which isn t very useful

7842768
ready	each
therefore by controllerdidchangecontent being called each time i create a new managed object the properties i require to make the table view cell are not yet ready

7842797
width	height
first your view gets measured this is the just the width and height

7842828
post	get
post test.php - returns programmer but get test.php returns null

7842833
pecl	pear
edit pecl also has one similar to the pear version bbcode parser

7842848
folder	directory
underlying reason unable to open destination file var folder 05 d7xltrms59j0n1bplx_nvwr0000gn t protocols.ipa payload protocolssmall.app info.plist no such file or directory

7842848
info.plist	ipa
looking inside the ipa info.plist is certainly in there

7842850
int	chars
when reading values from a stream byte by byte the stream.read returns the ascii code of the current chars so you first need to convert it to a regular chars and then parse it as a int

7842885
screens	tablet
this version is an adaptation for larger screens to better support tablet

7842941
post	get
i am trying to get latest 10 post from discussion board in sharepoint by using spquery

7842976
hide	show
the easiest way i ve found to fix this is to track the lifetime of the dialog in the activity and do a hide show in the onresume for the activity

7842979
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
then with a simplecursoradapter you connect the matrixcursor to the listadapter

7842986
put	get
what is the code i should put in onclick and how do i get the contacts chosen by the uset

7842991
inherited	properties
is there a way to inherited properties from parent pom

7843025
inherited	properties
there is no way not to inherited properties from a parent pom

7843025
inherited	properties
inherited properties won t work for that

7843028
listview	gridview
you should probably run a new activity which pulls the contacts of the phone and let s the users select multiple items gridview or listview

7843040
rss	feed
i found this site which you authenticate and it will then give you a working rss feed

7843135
floating-point	integer
however in the popular programming languages like c c++ c# java pascal 120 and 120.0 represent different numeric constants the former being an integer constant and the latter being a floating-point constant

7843135
int	double
the value always has a type so an int value is something completely different from a double programmer s term for floating-point number value

7843135
int	double
for doing this the int value of the constant is implicitly converted by the compiler to a double value using more or less customary mathematical rules and this value is assigned to the variable

7843151
disk	ram
i m at a core i7 6gb ddr3 of ram and a 60mb s write disk speed under ext4

7843217
ready	each
something seems wrong here this wont execute of course and would need something like jquery s ready but even if each one has jquery.ready every time this code executes for each track in model it will grab anything that has .model-attribute-wrapper and will keep on adding the class

7843220
folder	directory
i have found that only those pages are working which have a folder with identical name in the same directory

7843220
folder	directory
now since courses.php has a folder with identical name in same directory

7843242
pascal	delphi
if you are new to the wmi i recommend you which read these articles accesing the wmi from object pascal code and delphi and wmi events also you can use the wmi delphi code creator to create an delphi snippet to access the events of the mssql service broker

7843244
udp	tcp
i have had success in figuring out how to get data such as the source dest ip addresses tcp udp ports and source dest ethernet addresses

7843260
updatepanel	scriptmanager
does that mean that we can t use asp.net updatepanel which need a scriptmanager in the same page where we load mscorlib.js

7843284
setinterval	settimeout
by using sequential calls to settimeout you can compensate for the drift that is associated with setinterval

7843295
ceil	floor
edit after reading the other responses i have a feeling that mathematical ideas outlined there pengone will lead to a quicker lookup basically a calculation of the inverted formula plus a floor ceil call

7843343
facebooker2	koala
i ve came across with a few gems facebooker2 koala and fb_graph and the heroku integration that provide a easier way to use the graphapi but i wasn t able to find updated examples on how to integrate them with a rails app from scratch

7843354
typedef	struct
which typedef element as struct element so you don t need to place struct in front of the type

7843386
put	get
i d like to put arguments on different lines but i get parse errors on all the variations i try including adding commas allwin-style parens and different indentations

7843394
typedef	struct
you need to typedef your struct if you re going to use it that way

7843396
udp	tcp
similarly tcp and udp are transport layer protocols

7843396
udp	tcp
if you can find the tcp udp ports in the packets then you already know how many packets are using which protocols

7843438
post	get
what happens is that the if post section adds a value in form and then it could get overriden

7843452
post	get
custom attribute that would get hooked up to post process the generated widgets

7843491
tiff	png
if you still have trouble printing with the api you could convert your tiff file to png

7843503
mongodb	bson
if i understand what s happening correctly you re seeing intact objects in the mongodb databases curly braces and all. these records are actually not much more than standard associative arrays stored in bson

7843503

the issue is when the mouse is hovered and the pop up box shows if i scroll down up the page with the mousewheel trackpad while the mouse cursor is not on the product item anymore due to the scrolling the hover-out behavior is not detected and the pop up box remains in sight remaining in the middle of the screen since its position is determined during the hover event relative to the product s position on the screen

indeed i believe the best solution is to get a list of craigslist sites cities prebuild a mapping of cities to coordinates using some geocoding api tiny geocode comes to mind but yahoo and bing offer good solutions too and then storing it in a way that makes sort-by-nearest easy say mysql s geospatial extensions or mongodb s

7846588
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave and mouseout events are triggered only after a mouseover or mousein event which actually means that in order to detect if the cursor is hovering an element using these events you must first be hovering it so that the events would be triggered

7846588
mouseout	mouseleave
this way you don t have to hover an element in the first place in order to trigger mouseout or mouseleave events

7846915
pop-up	dialog
so what is occurring is that both pop-up will be shown anytime anywhere in the dialog span is clicked

7846915
pop-up	dialog
as a hint what you want to be doing here is somehow discerning between which of the links has been clicked by say binding the click to each link rather than the dialog and then only showing one of the pop-up at a time depending on which link was clicked

7846957
g++	gcc
so you could say that g++ contains a c compiler but saying that g++ contains gcc isn t correct i think

width	height
so back to the question - the overlay div could not be re-sized to take the s width and height without using javascript

7851206
width	height
this is my jsfiddle solution example with jquery what it basically does is getting the form and appending a inside with the same width and height

7851215
innodb	myisam
i recommend you read up on database engines myisam with table locking and innodb row locking

7851240
post	get
i used an iframe to post requests to actionscript and then get results handed back via url changes

7851251
getter	setter
oneway is concerned with getter and onewaytosource is setter

7851251
getter	setter
of course twoway is concerned with getter and setter

7851260
nhibernate	queryover
the equivalent nhibernate queryover my preferred query api query would look like this

7851267
textmate	sublimetext	textmate	aptana	textmate	bbedit	sublimetext	aptana
i ve tried aptana textmate bbedit and sublimetext 2 which are all splendid but they don t generate docbloc tags from the function s signature like netbeans

7851282
traceroute	packets
even if you do like traceroute start with a ttl of 0 and increasing by one for each answer there is no guarantee that the route will not change from one packets to the next

7851284
submit	submission
in terms of form actions if the form is submission to it s parent page i realize that you can use or # to submit the form

7851286

i took the dll from the .net3 directory and put in in my project but i now get

7851355
clgeocoder	mkreversegeocoder

portrait	landscape
in other words there are two videos one sized to work in landscape view and one to work in portrait view

7851380
google-chrome	firefox
however google-chrome firefox and ie9 all underline rule

7851389
realloc	malloc
you can t realloc a pointer that wasn t generated with malloc in the first place

7851422
realloc	malloc
your issue is because you were calling realloc with a pointer to memory that was not allocated with either malloc or realloc which is not allowed

7851468
multiplying	modulo
you may consider multiplying the results of the modulo comparison by -1 before returning it

7851488
button	checkbox
if you want to add support for multiple selections you can use checkbox instead of radio button

7851529
portrait	landscape
when i tried to use the same part of code for portrait in the landscape mode it gives me a weird result seems to be completely wrong

7851548
pull	push
any machine can host a git repository for people to push and pull from

7851579
multiplying	add
in order to calculate the result we do not need to know anything about the matrix other than how multiplying int int and add int int work

7851599
comparator	icomparer
you can also implement the comparator if you wish but a more correct and formal approach is to use the icomparer from my point of view

7851613
mef	prism
i m not sure how prism uses mef but here s a theory how is the shell being created in normal startup

7851645
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

i have a script to inject a user s email into the contact db of my client and it s bombing in ie but working in firefox google-chrome as usual

7851719
oncreate	setcontentview
in your main activity after oncreate and setcontentview you need

7851738
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
this replaces the gesture recognizers from the uiviewcontroller views with the gesturerecognizers of the uipageviewcontroller

7851746
mp3	wav
if i would like to create web crawling cluster searching for sound files wav mp3 wma ... the main problem i would hit would be the fact that most of sounds in web is wrapped into flash

7851759
src	attr
you cant use .src you need to use attr src new_href

7851771
nsstring	nsdata
you are logging urldata an nsdata object instead of results the nsstring

7851817
icmp	udp
i ve got an icmp ping working nicely but i ve run into a snag on the udp implementation i can construct send and receive the packet without problem the issue that i m seeing is that linux doesn t like the udp packets being sent back from the remote system and always sends an icmp destination unreachable packet even though my python script is able to receive and process the packet without any apparent problems

7851817
icmp	udp
my question is it possible to subsume the linux udp stack to bypass these icmp error messages when working with raw sockets

7851821
width	height
the image in chrome did not use width and height in this particular browser

7851821
width	height
instead i multiply the original width and height by the scale x and y

7851837
division	subtraction
that s because the division operator has a higher precedence than the subtraction operator -

7851868
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled

7851959
pull	push
you use git push similarly to svn ci and git pull will do the rest

7851970
pull	push
the git equivalent to svn ci is git commit -a followed by git push and the equivalent to svn up is git pull

7851972
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to m2e plugin from versioning 0.xx to versioning 1.0 thats probably what caused the issues you are having this may be helpful it is intended for springsuource tool suite but i fixed an regular eclipse following the advices at the end on the section called uh ohâ my projects no longer build

7852009
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my app s root view controller is a uitabbarcontroller on which i selected one of the tabs and selected a uinavigationcontroller and then dragged a view as the tutorial suggests but am unable to select my uitableviewcontroller class

7852016
post	get
i don t need to affect any other jeditables just get the currently active one to post back as if enter had been hit

7852059
post	get
you are using post but you re not posting any data - use get instead

7852059
post	get
the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post

7852115
put	get
update i didn t get a chance to implement the jquery solution but as my answer shows below myjsfunc can just be put directly inside the rendered tags

7852164
slider	hoverintent
i am using jquery hoverintent on my dropdown menues and i also have a slider on the page i am working on

7852164
slider	slidesjs
when i take the slider off i have no problems with the dropdown i have one other slider slidesjs with the same result

7852252
put	get
if i put the # signs around the variable i get

7852259
maven	pom.xml
i am getting this infamous maven 0.13 error out of a simple basic pom.xml

7852259
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
this pom.xml was created by m2e itself when i clicked maven enable dependency

7852259
m2e	pom.xml
why did authors of m2e not update their template pom.xml generator so that m2e 0.13 generates a template pom.xml that is compliant to its own requirements

7852277
verilog	vhdl
is there any way of telling ise to synthesize my vhdl verilog code into combinational circuits consisting only of look-up tables

7852298
client-side	server-side
either a server-side or client-side implementation is sufficient

7852334
width	height
i want the width and height from the textfield to be set automatically

7852334
width	height
it s pretty hard to explain what happens but it just looks like it doesn t set the height and width the right way

7852341
strcpy	strncpy
for instance the safe variants of strcpy strncpy strlcpy strcpy_s simply truncate the string if it s too long which in this case would make you try to load the wrong font

7852341
memcpy	strcpy
at which point strcpy becomes safe because you know it s not too long although i prefer memcpy because it makes it obvious to future readers of the code that i ve thought about this

7852360
width	height
this works pretty well by using the prerotate method with the values width 2 and height 2 of the bitmap and 1 or -1 degree as rotation factor

7852365
post	get
i ve seen post on so on how to get the user identity but not the full profile

7852479
pascal	delphi
the below code is from free pascal and uses ansistrings but it probably works analogous in delphi

7852514
maven	m2e
i use m2e to integrate eclipse indigo and maven

7852518
verilog	vhdl
it also shows side-by-side comparisons of vhdl and verilog code so that instead of choosing one that people may push you to you can learn the one that you like stylistically

7852557
versioning	upgrade
so my solution was to upgrade to a newer versioning of richfaces and add the following method in my entity class

7852662
disk	ram
you also shouldn t ignore disk performance particularly if your tables won t fit in ram

7852662
disk	ram
but don t take my comments to mean that you need more ram more cpus or faster disk

7852683
width	height
for everything to look correctly on the iphone we have to reverse the width and height of the backbuffer which seems very strange

7852685
curb	libcurl
you could always make one from rails but that seems messy or you could have an external process that does it with something like libcurl or the ruby curb library

7852691
width	height
if you give your link or tag the style display block and give it a specific width and height it should work just fine

7852703
bluetooth	usb
you should add a usb device filter for your bluetooth device

7852715
portrait	landscape
the issue is that my app is set only for portrait mode but the uialertview is displayed in landscape

7852775
post	put
if you d like to unit test this rather than keep testing in a browser i ve just put up a post just recently on how to unit test code in medium trust

7852787
getter	setter	public	protected
i m using public here for easability but if it s a security concern would likely use at least protected getter and setter

7852799
rdf	owl
does it mean that we can write a rdf file to describe some resources and we can describe the relationship between those resources by using owl in an another file

7852799
rdf	owl
so i should have the rdf file before using owl

7852806
post	get
the only other way to pass it without get would be post or by using cookies

7852843
post	put
i haven t fixed fluent nhibernate although i am in the process of doing so on a fork but i have just put up a post just recently on how to unit test code in medium trust

7852853
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i have tried gridlayout gridbaglayout boxlayout and flowlayout

7852876

7852888
hide	show
i have simple javascript which show and hide div with loading image

7852903

rss	feed
it parses the data out of the rss feed where available

7852922
ready	each
in my implementation i perform an alloc of the alert object more than once so each time i get ready to re-alloc it i release the old one

7852946
put	get
...i thought it maybe could be possible to put the row layout directly there inside but dont know how to do to get it to work if it is possible

7852952
inherited	properties
if each sub-type has a small number of unique properties it might be just as easy to store a type and each properties in a single table single table inherited or if speed actually becomes an issue

7853021
post	get
i get this error as soon as it serves a post back on the other server than the original get was served

7853039

7853042
width	height
1024x768 width x height

7853042
width	height
minimum width 256 minimum height 206

7853042
width	height
new width 274 new height 206

7853044
nfa	dfa
note though that the conversion from nfa to dfa can be wildly inefficient.

7853055
std	ostream
since the of std ostream isn t overloaded for function pointers in general it will try a conversion to bool which succeeds and since the function pointer is nonnull it s converted to the boolean value true which is printed as 1

7853082
folder	directory
make sure your source directory for example myproject src is listed as a source folder

7853101

7853116
hide	show
assuming that they start in the correct show and hide states you can just do the following

7853118
inherited	properties
is there a way to cascade non-inherited properties like text color to child elements in a webpage without explicitly telling child elements to inherited from parent node

7853118
inherited	properties
my current understand is that this is an issue of inherited and not all properties are automatically inherited form the parent container and for the style to be inherited one has to change the color to inherited by doing something like

7853123
hide	show
you can use .toggle instead of show hide then you could get rid of the if else construct

7853124
equals	gethashcode
however you can define an implementation that allows you to specify appropriate equals and gethashcode implementations external to the actual model class itself

7853135
google-chrome	safari
the following very basic script fails in google-chrome and safari with this error cannot call method appendchild of null

oncreate	ondestroy
oncreate ondestroy

7853203
onresume	onpause
onresume onpause

7853203

to fix your problem try registering your receiver in onstart instead of oncreate

7853246
put	get
i ve searched far and wide but i can t seem to get the information i need to put this query together properly

7853248

7853458
google-chrome	firefox
i have a flex application and on some browsers google-chrome firefox when a file upload is attempted the flash player will not pass the openam cookie

7853485
unsigned	short
your values are all of type unsigned short which means you should have had

7853502
int	chars	int	double
i know how to do it to int and double for example integer.parseint 123 is there a class for strings and chars

7853520
int	double
if you want to store more precise lat lon values then you need to use a double or a fixed point int

7853521
int	chars
if you want to work with a string as a collection of chars then you have a .length method and a .charat int index method to do the same thing

7853528
prepare	execute	prepare	pdostatement
either pdo prepare or pdostatement execute fails

7853544
int	chars
you can use the .charat int function with strings to retrieve the chars value at any index

hide	show
this is a wizard-type of application so each window has back next buttons that will create a new window hide itself and show the new window

7853637

i m trying to think of a way to close the whole app when the user closes the window but close only the window not hide it actually dispose of it and show the owner when they click back

7853693
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i ve added a scriptmanager and updatepanel in my user control but now the page is not posting back at all

7853705
web.py	cherrypy
fwiw we use cherrypy the web server built into web.py behind nginx to serve most of the html at oyster.com -- nginx splits the traffic across 2 or 3 web servers each running 4 python processes and we can easily handle 100s of requests per second

7853733
post	get
the restful service i m integrating with requires me to add a r true parameter to the url to get a json representation of the model in the response which is needed to get the id back during a post

7853894
qlistwidget	qtablewidget
i m trying to store the widths of a qlistwidget qtablewidget s columns

7853925

you can use the request.querystring collection for get and request.form for post

7853962
cvs	svn
short answer use scm commit hooks git example svn example cvs example

7853966
stdout	stderr
now for your actual problem curl s error message gets written to stderr but the backticks only return what s written to stdout

7854006
rubygems	bundler
i ve tried uninstalling and installing bundler and been over to rubygems to check if there were any further dependencies i needed but nothing seems to be working

7854054
children	parent
you pass the function from the parent to the children and the children calls the function when needed

7854055
vsto	add-in
take a look at xldna xll+ add-in express vsto etc

7854095
integer	unsigned
so if you actually want an integer representation of it you need to use the unsigned 64-bit integer type the signed type is not sufficient as 1 63 is a negative value

7854110
stdout	stderr
i want to execute a child process and be able to read from its stdout and stderr write to its stdin and receive notification of it exiting and its exit code

7854124

i ve implements a custom class that extends ajaxawareauthenticationsuccesshandler so that specific roles can be taken to specific url s after logging in which works great

7854220
cashapelayer	calayer
i want to mask a calayer with cashapelayer because changes to the shape can be animated

7854232
hide	show
you could then use this g variable to do any amount of custom things hide panels show controls etc.

7854254
move	drag
when the user is trying to click it interprets is as a drag when the mouse has only move 1 pixel

7854254

7854664
width	height
my app crash because the view doesnt have any width or height

7854665
rss	feed
because of the limit on many aggregators i have to keep my site s main feed under 512kb so i ve limited the number of posts that show in rss to 50

7854670

7854760
submit	submission
if you want to do this before submission i suggesting capturing the submit event using the code immediately above and then submission the form

7854773
keystore	jks
a rather large problem that i frequently encounter is that when generating the csr to get our certificate the keystore sun formatted jks keystore does not output the .key or provide any facility for obtaining the .key

7854773
keystore	jks
so i always had ended up with a .pem .crt with no way of using it with apache2 which cannot read a jks keystore like tomcat can but instead requires a unpackaged .key + .pem .crt pair

7854773
keystore	jks
to get this working and if you already have your jks keystore file that you use for a tomcat application server follow the following steps

7854773
pem	pkcs#12
now you will want to convert it to pem format which is more widely used in applications such as apache and by openssl to do the pkcs#12 conversion

7854796
postgresql	mysql
be it mysql mssql postgresql or even sqlite in case of little amounts of data

7854901
getter	setter
i know that property takes care of setter and getter in conjunction with synthesize and i know that both ways work fine

webkit	gecko
a bit of experimentation indicates that neither the gecko nor webkit

7855063
webkit	gecko
note that both the gecko and webkit

7855063
webkit	gecko

by post action i can get textbox value using formcollection

7861179
post	get

i would change it to protected i also hate private properties they rarely need to be private instead of protected - that would give better error message that you are trying to access property that is not public also i think it should give you the file and line it occures

7861202
post	get
if so bear in mind that facebook will send a post request not a get request when passing the signed_request to your application - if you were testing locally without any facebook integration you were probably making get requests

pull	push
the repository on the server side is going to get commits via pull and push and not by you editing files and then commiting them in the server machine therefore it is a bare repository

7861254
folder	directory
after creating it you will see that the directory contains a .git folder where the history and all the git plumbing goes

7861296
width	height
how can you make a ttstyledtextlabel to expand to the available width height

7861301
post	get
you have to pass the order by column name and order ascending or decending by either get or post

7861314
getter	setter
the way i do it is make a separate class that i use only for connection calls and methods instantiate it from the delegate set that instance from the delegate as a property or manually create its setter and getter and use in in any class controller i want to

7861342
width	height
i mean i m setting initial frame size for the main view in loadview portrait mode frame size width 320 height 480

7861342

post	get
as in jb s answer you can use get instead of post

7861452
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear

7861715
min	max
max avg min speed

7861715

7861779
post	get
2 sanitize all your get and post data that comes into php

7861808

7861811
3des	aes
i could assume it is 3des like it is said in this whitepaper but i hope for aes

7861887
dbcontext	objectcontext
from what i can see on msdn dbcontext wraps an instance of objectcontext as a facade not exposing this specific event

7861887
dbcontext	objectcontext
however dbcontext does have a constructor overload that takes an objectcontext - you can use this to pass in an objectcontext and subscribe to the savingchanges event on it

7861905
memcached	apc
you can also specify different cache backends like memcached and apc where yii will store the html it caches but again that does not directly affect your images and css js

if you want to change the width and height of the text input you can t do that by changing the width and height of the container the div tag

7862522
width	height
alternatively you could keep the width and height set for the div tag and set the width and height of the text input to 100 without quotes

7862534
int	chars
you want to use int 21h function 01 which reads a chars from stdin and echos it

7862552
viewdidload	viewwillappear
or alternately set the uiimage from the filename property in viewwillappear instead of viewdidload

7862561
width	height
i need them to give proper width and height of image when user selecting area to crop can t just use overvlow property because of ie

7862564
portrait	landscape
device-width always refers to width in portrait mode so width device-width will scale the viewport in landscape mode

7862569
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it worked on ie google-chrome and safari but not in firefox and opera

7862586

if you try using hover or other mouse events you might run into trouble with keyboard navigation and activation or the lack of hoverish events on touch interfaces and we can t pretend those don t exist anymore

7862625
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

7862625
google-chrome	firefox
the damn ie8 debugger doesn t even display dynamic changes to the dom when the script runs like google-chrome and firefox

7862625
width	height
the transparency cannot be applied to the parent div element which on its own has no width or height

7862689
thin	webrick
take a look at the thin server in place of webrick

7862689
apache	nginx
in production you will ideally want to handle ssl at the nginx or apache layer but this should handle your development requirements

7862697
getter	setter
if user_subscribed is a virtual attribute on the event model you should set get it using the regular setter getter rather than array setter getter

7862710
public	protected
the modifiers can be private public protected or internal.the name of a constructor must be the name of the class where it is defined

7862715
daemons	systemd
on some systemd privileges are not required to change passwords because a daemons is used already most decentralised authentication systemd nis+ etc

7862943
firefox	safari	mobile-safari	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
dashcode will allow you to develop html5 css js applications which can be deployed as widgets under the osx dashboard or to develop browser client based applications that can be run on safari mobile-safari and other compliant html5 css browsers google-chrome firefox and ie9 i think

7862944
width	height
while justin king s answer works if the width and height are known before hand it doesn t work if they re not set and the parent control dynamically lays the rectangle out

7862944
actualheight	actualwidth
unfortunately in silverlight you cannot use binding with converters on actualwidth and actualheight as they are calculated properties

7862944
actualheight	actualwidth
what this means is that when actualwidth and actualheight change a property changed event is not raised internally so the binding wouldn t propagate the changes to the source

7862979
int	boolean
atomic datatypes are like int or boolean they are just that atomic and not made up of sub elements

7862996
getter	setter
i want to generate auto code of classes for tables so all classes with their attributes constructor and getter setter methods automatically generate

7863151
oncreate	ondestroy
my current thought is to store the values of interest at oncreate using names like oldinterval and comparing them to the value at the time of ondestroy

7863151
oncreate	ondestroy
rather i would like to store a backup of the whole sharedpreferences object at oncreate so i can query it at ondestroy

7863154
post	get
currently the api allows you to get only your own post

7863159
for-loop	loops
i would however recommend you use a for-loop for this instead of a while loops if you re going to use a loops rather than a function to do it

7863159
for-loop	loops
they don t need an if statement for-loop while loops or whatever before them

boost	allocator
to optimize the app i used boost pool library but extended it so that my allocator actually contained a collection of boost pool objects each responsible for allocator one specific size from 16 bytes up to 1024 in steps of 4

7864631
boost	allocator
this provided almost free o 1 complexity allocator free of these objects but the catch is that a memory usage is always large and never goes down even if we don t have a single object allocated b boost pool never frees the memory it uses at least in the mode we are using it in so we only use this for objects which don t stick around very long

getter	setter
it is not considered bad style to have getter and setter for some variables and not for others

7864745

but adding getter and setter and then making your variables private for your other variables will protect the users of your class from future changes to the internals of your class

7864769
feof	fread
using fread and feof but feof is breaking the loop early so what s the best technique to keep reading from the stream

7864783

why not make all your variables private and have public getter setter for each

7864802
getter	setter
if you define getter and setter for all of your variables and make the variables private future changes to your code would be much easier

7864802
getter	setter
this is one of the principles behind getter setter in oop

7864802
getter	setter

moving and resizing setbounds fired mouseleave event of the parent and a mouseenter event of the single panel

7865862
int	chars
in the particular case of binary you can use another direct solution for each digit that is non-zero set the corresponding bit in an int type large enough in your case unsigned chars suffices and the value of the variable at the end of the loop will be the result of the conversion

7865882
hide	show
in that case you could show a dialog - loading and in the callback of the ajax you could hide the loading dialog

intersect	contains
the intersect operator returns a resultset contains the matching values from the two queries

7867560
setinterval	settimeout
because you will be dealing with asynchronous callbacks settimeout calls at the end of a full cycle to start the process over again will be a cleaner way of handling the interval if you were to use setinterval and the server took longer than expected to return you could see the client start to race on itself

7867604
accelerometer	gyroscope
i need to find a way to detect if the phone has rotated 360 degrees by using preferably the accelerometer gyroscope and or compass

middle one is clip by uv draw from px1 and crop only width 34px height 33px right one very long rectangle draw from top to bottom from px0 to px480 width 34px height 1px sorry for virtual code but you know what i means

7867912
for-loop	loops
as of c# 5 it s likely that the foreach loops behaviour will be changed to avoid this being a problem - but the for-loop equivalent would still be an issue

7867944
width	height
explicitly specify a width and height style attribute for the div in which the chart will be drawn

7867960
invokelater	invokeandwait
so i guess i should be because animation should be on edt so i wrapped the animate method with runnable and invokeandwait but still got that in the animation thread i m not on edt while calling to that code as i said earlier is on edt so my invokelater seems not to place that animation on edt

profiling	benchmarking	inline	inlining
you should inline a function if the compiler doesn t and profiling with a realistic data set shows you re spending a significant amount of time in the function the algorithm using said function is an efficient one and if inlining it shows a speed improvement in a benchmarking with said data set

7868062
google-chrome	firefox
i have gone through the horrors of flash caching files as well however it was firefox and google-chrome that gave me the most trouble

7868074
post	get
this will not only be cleaner but it will keep you from using get parameters in a post request

7868074
post	get
and if for some reason you must use a get query string with a post request then you d want something like this

7868101
onclick	onchange
even my onclick onchange functions are working without a problem dynamically added form elements it is just doesn t seem to work

7868106
put	get
also i made a try to put the same code in application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions but i get a warning at self.view addsubview themovie.view

7868108
put	get
when you print out the values later you re just printing this same copy of the data over and over again via different pointers to it -- so you get whatever you put in sh the last time you modified it rather than what was in it when you set the pointer

7868108
free	malloc
you ll need to remember to free them later along with everything else you ve malloc ed though

7868110

7868176
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the attribute works well in latest versions of firefox google-chrome and opera i ve just tested it

7868258
prng	random
the rand needs to be either truly random or a cryptographically strong prng

7868291
required	placeholder
the only snag i can see is that since the asp.net model binder required the names of variables in arrays from your description it sounds like you will be accepting an array of sections to be explicitly qualified with an index you would need to replace a placeholder index in your master copy with a new dynamically generated value before adding the html fragment to the dom

7868306
webclient	httpwebrequest
instead you should use the webclient or httpwebrequest classes

7868330
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
uses css3 and works on recent 2011+ mozilla opera google-chrome safari and perhaps ie eventually

7868540
int	chars
i mean sizeof chars is 1 and sizeof int is 4 on my machine

7868567
wordpress	joomla
this is a huge problem since most dristributions of oss-software for php has this included in their htaccess by default wordpress drupal joomla and many others and most guides in htaccess-rules always recommend followsymlinks since it s needed for mod_rewrite - it does work just as well with symlinksifownermatch

just puts out on the output-buffer and won t actually print out until the output-buffer gets fflush

getter	setter
a bean property see propertydescriptor consists of a getter and or a setter method of the same type return type of the getter must match single param type of the setter otherwise they are not mapped to the same bean property i m guessing the first method in the class wins

7868627
getter	setter
so your integer getter string setter approach can t work as the string setter will not be detected as belonging to the integer property

7868646

but am having a problem with thumbnail images not re-sizing in safari mobile or desktop that work in ie 8 and firefox 7.01 and opera 9.5

7868846
put	get
the semantics are supposed be different in that put like get is supposed to be idempotent -- meaning you can the same exact put request multiple times and the result will be as if you executed it only once

7868846
put	get
when you put a resource at a particular url what happens is that it should get saved at that url or something along those lines

7868846
post	put
as for modifying the properties of the stream you can do that with either put or post

7868846
post	put
basically only use put when the operation is idempotent - otherwise use post

7868846
post	get
note however that not all modern browsers support http verbs other than get or post

7868871

implements	extends
implements mouselistener on your class is one way to do it but if you just want to react to clicks it s easier to use an anonymous class extends mouseadapter

7869324
getter	setter
it can be extremely helpful and meaningful in case of getter and setter

7869353
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
on firefox opera and google-chrome it works good on ie is problem

7869422
ilist	icollection
edit corrected icollection instead of ilist error

7869422

save in onpause load in onresume and you ll only lose data when the phone dies with your activity up front

7869586
hash	md5
another example a new cpu by intel can support md5 hash checking it doesnt mean you can t use md5 it means a library developed which uses md5 instructions will work faster because the cpu has a separate entity inside which will execute the operation efficiently

this directory is meant for publicly viewable files folder

7870041
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs

it works just fine except the situation when the embedded web browser may be displaying a pop-up dialog window say during saving of contents

7870284

7870317
getter	setter
i tend to favor read-only properties for things which can regardless of object state be examined without risk of exception read-write properties for things which can regardless of object state be examined or set to any object value which is ever valid the set of valid values shouldn t depend upon the object state and getter setter methods for other things

so i tried to calculate the height using the drawtextexw method however the result is the same as with drawtextw function where it extends the width of the rect to fit the largest line of text

7870766

so how can i correctly calculate the height of the text rect with a given fixed width when drawing a large string with no spaces where dt_wordbreak and dt_calcrect are specified

7870826
put	get
to get this to happen when these exceptions occur if you can t do this in your own code you could try aop writing an agent if you are using java 6+ or you could in a pinch grab the source code of sqlexception change it to dump the stack in its constructor recompile and put this class back in the boot class path before everything else

g++	gcc
if it s gcc and it certainly looks like it is based on the absolutely identical error message you may need to make sure that you re calling g++ rather than gcc and or that your extension for the source file not header is a recognised one like .cpp a

7870894
g++	gcc
i m not entirely certain the rules that gcc follows but i ve always found it safer to use source files like blahblah.cpp and explicitly use g++

7870895
cvs	svn
only thing that i have come across in my limited use of cvs is that cvs treats branches and tags as different and also treats them as what they are and not as just folders that svn does

cvs	rcs
so i find cvs and sometimes even rcs convenient when the repository is a collection of largely unrelated files and i m more interested in tracking changes on individual files but revisions of the repository as a whole are not particularly meaningful

7871646
cvs	rcs
finally cvs stores the history for each file in a single file with the same format used by rcs with a relatively straightforward format

7871646
cvs	svn
i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git

the problem is in part of your code where you enumerate some object for example nsmutablearray or nsmutableset using for-loop for id _obj in object and in that loops removing or adding some objects to the same object

7871836
for-loop	arrays
you could make an arrays of your imageviews and then change them in your for-loop

while this problem talks about int its doing so only to restrict the input and output chars and format

7871842

7873678
for-loop	loops
you may not want to count the registries as that would require a query for each state as you are showing the state map you can start every state without link and then on a loops from a resultset using select distinct states or something that would list only states with registry in them then you would activate state by state in a for-loop

7873699
width	height
index 0 and 1 contains respectively the width and the height of the image

7873699

hide	show
my theory is that it doesn t work because the page loading itself show loading indicator and hide it after the page is loaded

7873877
children	parent
after investigation this happens if the collection is at least 1-many edited the code it seems that the more safe way of cascade deleting would be to remove the children objects first brothers then clear the collection of the parent sister and only after that delete it from the context as there is something inside ef itself that tries to connect the entities and removes stuff from something else

7873882
hide	show
in the js.erb file you can mix javascript and ruby and show hide replace divs as you please

7873918

getter	setter
just a note though your getter setter should reflect that they should look like this which might actually be the case in your code but not in your post

superclass	subclassing
if the logic sort of spans across all subclassing if you can t extends the class without dealing with this logic put it in the superclass

7874271
super	abstract	super	implements
if you go for the later consider writing it in a way such that you can enforce the logic to be implements through abstract methods in the super class

7874294
superclass	subclassing
is it possible to create a constructor on the subclassing which is passed no arguments or am i right in thinking that in order to create a default constructor on a subclassing the superclass must have a default constructor too

7874294
superclass	subclassing
also if i were to add a default constructor to the superclass how would i initialize the superclass variables in the subclassing constructor

int	double
to achieve this my floating point double precision values were unions with unsigned int such that i would test the floating point values using x86 operations before the x87 operations would be called upon

7874552
int	double
you re using a very strange and slow way of casting from int to double

7874567

try calling fflush on the output after the client is done to make sure the output gets written to the pipe if the child lives on while the parent reads its output

7874599
width	margin
also your page is not centered in ie - i suggest you wrap whole page in a fixed width wrapper with margin 0 auto to center whole page - so you don t keep repeating the width multiple times in your css for each layout element

width	height
the issue is i need a specific width of jlabel where height is not important because it will scroll the text until the y of jlabel is than -jlabel.height which means jlabel last line of text is at top of jpanel

7875028
width	height
so how can i calculate the height which can hold a sort of text based on a specific value of width

7875028

7875153
width	height
you may want to look at the fontmetrics class which has methods for getting attributes of the font such as height width ascent etc

7875153
width	height
given this information you should be able to work out the height of a particular font size relative to the width and vice versa

7875163
hash	md5
if you read the cookie you only have to compare the hash with md5 databasename.databasehash

7875177

maven	m2e
it s probably best to start by right-clicking on the dynamic web project and go maven convert to maven project then move the folders as shown above and then go through all the warnings the m2e and m2e-wtp plugins throw at you most offer a quickfix

7875511
width	height
by the way i m using width in this example but the same happens for height

7875568

use jquery s own show and hide

7875571

7876030
draggable	droppable
i have a jquery ui droppable element which i would like to get bigger when a draggable is hovered over it

7876030
draggable	droppable
however once the draggable exits the original smaller boundary of the droppable jquery ui interprets this as a dropout despite still being within the current larger boundary

7876030
draggable	droppable
in this case when a draggable hovers over the droppable the droppable visually increases in size to 200px

7876030
draggable	droppable
if at this point the draggable is moved down by 20px i would expect it to still be hovering over the droppable

7876032
inherited	properties
inherited allow you to reuse code adding new fields properties and methods or replacing methods and properties of previously defined classes

7876432
button	checkbox
however when one of the button is clicked which indirectly call the click method on the checkbox the checkbox is not clicked until after the click code has been run

7876453
min	max
i decided to implement it calculation the max and min values of the last 1000 values and then calculate the error using this formula max-min min and compare it to epsilon

7876453
min	max
the first hare-brained idea was to use a list and append new values to it calculating the max and min values for the last 1000 values of it after each appending

7876453
min	max
but it didn t solve the problem of needing to go through all the last 1000 values on each iteration to calculate min and max

7876470
config	ini
i don t think there is security risk involve in saving any config in php.ini file since the location of the ini file is outside the public directory

7876492
width	margin
the reason is it is set to the width of the parent div which by default is 100 since you margin the red column left 200px it slides the display section over so you can see your left column

7876493
getter	setter
because the getter returns a boolean value but the setter expects a string jax-b just ignores this setter

7876531
jar	war
but joining the previews comments maybe you can create a jar with all your handlers and then in each war project define one abstract class with the chain that you want and inherit it in your services

7876540

use the onchange event instead of the onclick

7876540

store preferences using being int double bool dictionary object...

7876634
queue	fifo
keep your 1000 items in an fifo queue

7876654
min	max
when adding or removing entries compare them to the current min and maxvalues - then you only need to rescan the deque for min max if the value you are removing is the current min or max

7876654
min	max
and when adding just compare the new value with the current min and max and update accordingly

7876654
min	max
this will optimize the scanning of your deque for min max values

7876682
width	height
so it stays display inline and elements with that style don t respond to width height changes

7876743
stdout	fflush
use fflush stdout

7876749
unsigned	short
2 i am not properly considering the variable type of packed and unpacked i.e for packed it is unsigned char and for unpacked it is short

7876779
stdout	fflush
use fflush file stream with stdout as the parameter

7876803
stdout	stderr
this way you can run any svn command you want just examine stdout and perhaps stderr to get the command s result

7876804
srp	ocp
have it exactly once. it stands to reason that the long if or the switch will indeed be a violation of srp and ocp

7876817
put	get
when you managed to get the user input put the its pointer in esi esi address to the string

7876870
powerpc	i386

i was just wondering if anyone has come across anything offering similar search functionality for mongoid as meta-search ransack

7876912
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome support browser extensions that can take advantage of platform specific apis to register event handlers for onbeforeload or onbeforerequest in the case of firefox and google-chrome respectively

7876912
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

7876912
google-chrome	firefox
the key point for these 2 firefox apps is that they intercept the web request before the browser gets its hands on it and operate on the other side of the http https encrpytion stage hence can see the decrypted response however as identified in the other post that they don t do the whole thing although the jsdeminifier was very useful i didn t find a firefox plugin to do exactly what i wanted but i can see from those previous plugins that it is possible with both firefox and google-chrome

7876912
ssl	https
basically the way it works is that when your browser makes a request to the remote https server the ssl proxy intercepts the request and from the ip address of the server generates a server certificate on the fly which it signs with its own root ca and sends back to the browser

7876966
width	height
i have a sprite in as3 code i want to enter its height to resize it how can i scale the width accordingly

7876970
getter	setter
it provides an interface to getter setter functions so that the changing of a model value there are many different flavors of change will call render on the corresponding view and the page will correctly reflect the underlying models

7877036
getter	setter
make a setter getter pair for a string field and an isa that is a calculate field this is the way i ve always done it because it just seems a bit more straightforward

7877064
post	get
i know its an old post but just in case someone else get here

7877076
width	height
otherwise you will need to apply a ratio such as width height

7877076
width	height
say your sprite was width 150 height 100

7877076
width	height
that means width is 1.5 times height

7877095
google-chrome	firefox
everything works like a charm in firefox google-chrome and ie7 but internet explorer 8 and 9 treat the consecutive nowrap spans as 1 big nowrap element it puts all the values on one line

7877112

safari and firefox will tab between text input boxes but ignore checkbox and action button altogether

7877170
firefox	safari	button	checkbox
can i force firefox and safari to let my users tab between input boxes checkbox and action button

7877209
super	extends
one slight gotcha to be aware of is that the object system in openlayers uses a function called initialize as the constructor so in order to have coffeescript s super keyword work correctly when you extends openlayers classes you ll need to decorate them

7877228
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it with google-chrome safari and ie8 and it works well just not firefox

7877242
hide	show
maybe the enter-notify-event and leave-notify-event connected to buttons may help you do the thing with for example a popup menu show and hide respectively

7877254
min	max
this one figures out the max and min from each table before combining the set - it may be more performant to do it this way

7877269
jobs	cron
itâ s a very easy and elegant solution for using ci controllers for cron jobs

7877280

7877434
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem exists on the third click on mobile safari many clicks later on safari and google-chrome and has not yet been encountered on an old version of firefox

7877442
post	get
the issue was because the control was not added to the page until the dayrender method - meaning you could not get a reference to it on a post back

7877448
post	get
if you would like to filter what is done via a post or what is done via a get use this

b doesn t exist in test db so i get an error object references an unsaved transient instances

7877618

7878126
width	height
add width and height if div has no content

7878174
versioning	upgrade
the compatibility level was pretty much created for lazy people like me or rather to reduce the friction on upgrade to help sell more units of newer versioning and reduce the necessary support window on older versioning of sql servers - good goals in their own right

7878204
google-chrome	firefox
if you visit the following url and hover over the main navigation at the top right above the header image in google-chrome firefox and ie8 the sub nav that displays once you hover over a nav element for example hover over meetings appears to line up correctly with the parent li

7879340
cassini	iis
remember cassini the toy web server that ships with vs runs under the developer s credentials so permissions to the local file system are very different compared to running your website on iis directly

7879375
g++	gcc

vsto	add-in
iâ ve migrated it to c# it takes the data from a remote java server via wsdl but i found that most functions were being called 50+ times and it ran far far slower than the original add-in itâ s an automation add-in using extensibility.idtextensibility2 â so no vsto tricks available here

7879468
vsto	add-in
this is not an vsto add-in itâ s implemented using extensibility.idtextensibility2

7879468
vsto	add-in
try the edit intercept version as a vsto add-in this should give me the key bindings

7879471

7879633
portrait	landscape
however videos that were shot with the iphone held upside-down in landscape or portrait are inverted on the web server

7879708

memcached	apc
you could cache this using apc memcached or the like if you do not want to query the database for this everytime you render a page

7879736
hash	salt
i think generally speaking storing the username|password hash is pretty safe assuming you re hashing them reasonably using a salt using an iv etc

7879758
qslider	qdial
for example a mix of qdial and qslider ie

7879758
qslider	qdial
if so you will need to subclass either qslider or qabstractslider or qdial and do the painting in your own paintevent

7879758
qslider	qdial
the qt demos and examples or the qslider qdial source code itself may serve as examples on how to overload a paintevent

7879784
gmail	hotmail
hotmail is reading subject but not the body and gmail reads it well

7879813

7879883
google-chrome	firefox
get google-chrome or firefox use the developer tools i personally prefer google-chrome and play around with the css of that element - you d want a margin-top rule similar to this

7879885

note that i assume that unlike get the post request doesn t prepopulate the before validation has succeeded

7879887
many-to-many	one-to-many

7880024
boost	stl
languages and avoid things like stl and boost

7880024
boost	stl
the moment you add the baggage of stl and boost you are slower than

7880024
boost	stl
thus if you are not careful with your stl and boost code you will

7880024
boost	stl
edit the quote is about stl and boost thus i added the stl tag

7880027
google-chrome	firefox
well i ve created this and checked it in google-chrome and firefox web developer tool cookies view cookie information and they had fiddle.jshell.net for both cookies

7880066
google-chrome	firefox
there are a number of options for headless html+javascript thanks primarily to google s new toy node.js used in the google-chrome browser depending on the language that you want to use but unfortunately none that i know of are firefox based -- there was crowbar but it appears un-updated since 2008

7880072
packets	multicast
i am unable to send a udp multicast broadcast packets from a laptop wired to a wifi router to an android phone connected to the same router wirelessly

7880208
getter	setter
getter and no setter

7880259
voip	rtp
it turns out the voip stack which is otherwise an excellent stack either has a bug or i do not understand the way it packages and transmits the rtp packets

7880362
chown	chmod
so all of the subsequent calls to exec for chown chmod mv all run with the permissions of the current app process - and hence fail

7880431
vbscript	jscript
first find api you need and find a way to write jscript or vbscript that does what you need

7880641
post	put
but i found that if i put a php.ini file in any directory where php is receiving a post request

7880686
textmate	sublimetext
try editors like textmate or sublimetext

7880723
google-chrome	firefox
it s really not recommended to have .innerhtml used this way as the tag now contains technically invlalid html but it seems to work in firefox ie 9 quirks mode on and off and google-chrome

7880727
for-loop	loops
the scoping semantics of the for-loop dictate that after each execution of loops the object that was created during that iteration will be destroyed

7880763
put	get
in this event i call method loadbitmap to get hbitmap and receive bitmapsource to put this captured picture to the image control

7880767
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
there is jscrollpane as part of the gui containing jlayeredpane let s say mappane

7880775
hide	show
before it displays i have another view which is called up code below which i show and then hide after some processing

7880819
folder	directory
assuming i understand the problem you need to walk the entirety of a directory structure and for each folder you find you need to create a base xml file

7880832
int	chars
it is generally accepted that you are better off using fgets chars s int n file stream where stream is stdin s is a chars array and n is the maximum number of chars to read

7880855
for-loop	loops
in the following examples all the variables are destroyed and recreated for each iteration of loops except i which persists between loops iterations and is available to the conditional and final expressions in the for-loop

7880978
hide	show
i added some custom controls to allow the user to show hide all series and to check uncheck all series

7880978
hide	show
this part i also got working but there is a problem once the chart is rebuilt the functions that allow the user to show hide check uncheck no longer work because i have destroyed and re-specified the variable that they run off of

7880978
hide	show
if this is the way to do it then how do i get my show hide check uncheck functions to continue to work afterward

7880994
pop-up	dialog
the dialog that pop-up after a user clicks like on my in development website overflows the main content area of my website

free	malloc
if your pointer was created via something like malloc you can make a where the dtor calls free

7881056
int	boolean
the primitives are strings int floats boolean and possibly

7881081
width	height
setting the image width and height to a percentage doesn t work because stretching the browser too far horizontally or vertically would cause the image to distort

7881081
min	max	width	height
and setting the height width to a max min didn t seem like an ideal solution either

7881083
put	get
don t expect to get something like a pointer that will eventually point to a part of what you put in curr_state

7881114
acs	adfs
so the general recommendation is to use one that is already tested and design for that adfs acs on the microsoft world or from some other vendor

7881120
opencv	emgucv
i know that there are wrappers for opencv opencvdotnet sharpercv emgucv ... but i don t know which to choose

7881129
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
personally i use the first of the two as it provides a bit more control for styling a block for color width height margin padding etc

7881142
width	height
try setting just either height or width whichever is more important to you

7881142
width	height
if you just set width the browser will scale the height down accordingly

7881169
firefox	safari
it works fine in ie9 safari both pc mac firefox mac

7881178
put	get
you get a multiple defined symbol when the linker tries to put together the object files for all the files including the header file

7881218
min	max
the problem is your project is a windows application and includes windows.h windows.h includes macros for min and max

7881230
ubuntu	linux
this should work on linux all versions i would assume ubuntu mac os all versions and windows all versions

7881275
wordpress	expressionengine
expressionengine doesn t natively have a method of including the category name as a url segment when outputting the permalink uri unlike say wordpress

7881277

on firefox ie9 google-chrome works fine

7881538
sorting	grouping

7881685
opera	google-chrome
the problem is present in opera 11 google-chrome 15 mozilla is for some reason fine

7881702
int	boolean
these business objects contain user-defined property sets that can only be one of a handful of fundamental types int float string boolean datetime or list so it makes no sense to expose the entire set of .net types to the customer to pick from

7881726
width	height
without the width and height attributes it works perfectly well

7881746
gridview	linqdatasource
read works fine with no filter but when i add where parameters to linqdatasource it fails in the gridview databind with an error no property or field cityvalue exists in the type zipcode

a message utilizing ws-addressing may contain its own dispatch metadata in a standardized soap header

7881850
put	get
when i put in order to redirect then i get the same error again

7881861
hide	show
the easiest is to hide everything until you ve loaded the correct stylesheet then show everything once it s loaded

setinterval	clearinterval
each key stroke clearinterval the pending setinterval

7881968

7881987

7882094
disk	ram
zookeeper persists data to disk but works only if data fits ram

7882100

versioning	upgrade
a second instance of this exact same problem was resolved when the client upgrade their proxy server to the latest versioning

7882123
width	height
this basically tells you half the width and height of the image

7882127
post	get
if i send a get request any changes i make to settings.data are ignored but if i send a post request then changes to settings.data stick but you have to use the query string format to get anything sensible through

7882128
getter	setter
my persons class implements the inotifypropertychanged and has a getter setter of lastname firstname and lastupdated

7882131
put	get
the alternative of doing diff tools based deployment put you at the mercy of the tools decision on how to handle the diff with large tables this can get very dangerous if the tool decided to to a copy-based modification and also puts you at the mercy of whatever support the diff tool has for automation which makes the failure retry handling how should i put it .

7882136
getter	setter
like all those setter and getter

7882137
httpconnection	downloading
for getting the xml i recommend using an asynctaskloader and an httpconnection to downloading it

7882177
opera	google-chrome
the gist of it is that google-chrome and opera and ie9 in fact are sorting the numerically keyed members of your object and placing them before any members with string keys

7882177
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie 9 are preserving the order of a structure that should not be ordered and while they re doing nothing wrong that behavior is less right than that of google-chrome opera and ie9

7882179
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox has firebug google-chrome and safari have it built-in etc

7882216
cassini	iis
shut down the web server cassini iis iis express and try again

pop-up	dialog
however if the user has the official app installed the authentication code opens a white screen with the blue facebook banner at the top with a loading pop-up dialog

7882303
qstring	qbytearray
you can also use qstring or qbytearray which are already registered instead of std string since these functions are slots and signals and as such are already qt specific

7882307
mouse	keyboard
which is proper way to suppress of transfering focus to next control in case when validation don t pass and where to put validation code on such widgets gtkentry gtkspinbutton etc to be usable with signals invoked with both - mouse and keyboard actions

7882402
width	height
the div has a fixed width a max height and shows scroll bars when the height is too large

7882405

you can upload the files to a certain directory default directory and then manually copy the files to a secured folder that is outside of the deployment directory and application server installation yes you can do that

7882410
free	malloc
these days good ol malloc free or new delete are fine

7882416
subtract	add
then for each line the running total will subtract usage amounts and add purchase amounts

7882451
goto	break
c# does not directly support the break labelname syntax...but it does support the infamous goto

7882463
viewdidload	viewdidappear
but note that the navigation bar is not part of your view it is created and handled by uinavigationcontroller so basically it can exist and be drawn even before viewdidload and viewdidappear is called

7882489
goto	break
i would personally try to avoid using goto here by simply putting the loop into a different method - while you can t easily break out of a particular level of loop you can easily return from a method at any point

7882495
jobs	cron
the cron jobs are usually run as the root user

7882511
disk	ram
there are lots of other system level things to check i ll assume you ve been through all those items network disk ram etc

7882539
qstyle	qslider
you could use qproxystyle to ovrride drawcomplexcontrol method - you will have to draw entire control on your own as there is no separate flags in qstyle controlelement for parts of qslider

7882541
pem	pkcs#12
i want to convert pkcs#12 key to pem to use it in a push notification service for iphone

2 if this is the way to do it then how do i get my show hide check uncheck functions to continue to work afterward

but i suggest you to use a templating system like smarty or twig it is a lot easier and cleaner

7882600
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome support start in version 4 and 10 respectively

7882614
rss	feed
is there any built-in way to get the long expanded url from a twitter rss feed

7882614
rss	feed
turns out the way to do this is by requesting the json version from search.twitter.com rather than the rss feed and tacking on

7882614
rss	feed
if necessary i am willing to use the twitter api directly to do the search instead of using rss but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal

7882637
int	double
all r platforms use the xdr bigendian representation of c int and double in binary save-d files and these are portable across all r platforms

7882640
slideup	slidedown
slideup -- then slidedown -- then slide slideup ect.

7882643
draggable	droppable
i have a small problem with droppable draggable

7882647
for-loop	arrays
javascript arrays are 0 based so the for-loop in setheights is incorrect

the only text that is colored are words like int bool double self return etc

7882711
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome 14.0 safari 5.1 win7 32x there is 1px of white space

7882711
opera	firefox
in firefox opera and ie looks fine

7882744
folder	directory
as an aside if you really want to store your project files in the vs install folder which is under c program files microsoft visual studio 10.0 then you ll need to run vs in administrator mode because c program files is a protected directory

7882745
jar	war
from what i understand a war file is a special jar file which is a special zip file

7882754
onresume	onpause
onresume essentially does the same check for validity of the this.camp_ object - there is no ondestroy or onpause code in baseactivity

7882754
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
if instance was null it should be returning an illegalstateexception not a nullpointerexception

7882774
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you need multiple uinavigationcontroller in your app you should probably separate them in a uitabbarcontroller or by using presentmodalviewcontroller

7882809
pop-up	dialog
i give it a name and click okay and it tries to connect to the repository for about 15 seconds and then the follow error dialog pop-up

7882819
strncmp	strcmp
and remember the data read from the port is not guaranteed to be zero-terminated see zero-terminated strings for reference so you have to watch for this also either add a zero after the actual data or somehow limit string operations on the buffer like using strncmp instead of strcmp

7882861
memcmp	strcmp
to compare strings use strcmp or memcmp if there is no nul chars at the end and the lengths are known

7882864
post	put
use a-tags only for get-links use forms for post put delete-links - unstyle the hell out of them if necessary

7882939
google-chrome	safari
my code works in google-chrome safari however when i port it over to phonegap it doesn t work

should this work just by redirecting stdin and stdout since cin and cout are supposed to be sync d with stdio

7886067

again write and read on the file descriptors 0 and 1 work write to and reads from the pipe stdio on the file pointers stdin and stdout do not work do not write to pipe

7892772
svg	vml
it does provide vml which is similar to svg

7892772
svg	vml
in order to do this they have to do a conversion process from their native drawing api ie either svg or canvas to vml

7892772
svg	vml
the svg-based libraries are likely to be quicker at this as svg and vml are relatively similar

7892772
svg	vml
ie s vml is slower than other browser s svg

7892772
svg	vml
the library with the best chance of running at a decent speed in ie is raphael because it is written from the start to generate either svg or vml so it never needs to do any conversion

7892773
awt	swing
the typical containers include jpanel for swing and panel for awt but many others like window are possible

7892773

7894989
int	double
is a allocated on the stack like any other local data int double etc. or is a default constructor called and the memory allocated on the heap

7895172
pull	push
so you should be able to pull push them anytime

7895182
touchesbegan	touchesended
this is because uitableview as a subclass of uiscrollview does all sorts of under-the-hood weirdness with the responder chain your code is also kind of odd where you call both touchesbegan and touchesended from the overlying view s touchesbegan method but this isn t why you can t scroll the table

7895199
google-chrome	firefox
this gives 59 in firefox and 186 in google-chrome

7895254

atof	strtod
also unless you were required to write asciitofloat for your homework assignment you should use atof or strtod both declared in stdlib.h from the standard c library

7895440
width	height
the downside is that the whole image is going to be decoded so if you don t actually need the image but only the width and height you might actually want to look in the byte array and decode the file format

7895450
int	chars
the reason this works in this case is because a chars is really an int

7895452
google-chrome	safari
one issue is that i m on mac with google-chrome but jquery s browser object thinks i m using safari which is also a webkit browser

with their getter and setter

7895772
pull	push
i have tried the hg-git plugin and have gotten to the point where i can commit in git and push those changes to a remote mercurial repo however the issue i am running into is that no matter what tutorial i have found i can t seem to pull new changes from mercurial back into git which makes the entire thing useless at this point

7895785
ubuntu	linux
i need to make this cross-platform between linux or at least ubuntu and windows so any common approaches between the two platforms would make my life much easier

7895814
button	checkbox
i ve found that an enterprising user might press backspace on a checkbox or a radio button in a vain attempt to clear it and instead they would navigate backwards and lose all of their data

7895830
int	double
the extract function template also works with double long int float and so on

7895881
google-chrome	firefox
the code i wrote to do it works in google-chrome and ie but fails in firefox on both mac and windows

7895888
hex	binary
it says the type is short so through it i suppose you could represent the number zero in binary as 0000000000000000 or in hex as 0x0000 since as far as i know one hex digit represents four binary digits

7895888
hex	binary
because 8 in hex should correspond to 1000 in binary

7895888
hex	binary
why if one hex digit represents four binary digits and the output value of the function is a short two bytes here the number is represented by sixteen hex digits

7895920
implements	extends
if you want to check if the object is an instance of a certain class but not if it extends or implements it maybe comparing the classes with would be faster

7895931
screens	mdpi
google seems to support this as being true in their section on testing for multiple screens sizes when they list this resolution and mdpi as being large

7895949
hide	show
you could break it into two lines as you have found you could hide the assignment inside a bracketed dereference as mob show or you could simply throw away the first value

7895954
16-bit	64bit
2 - most significant bit is the 15th as the value is signed if you cast it to 32-bit int 16-bit 1000 0000 value would become 1111 1111 1000 0000 in 64bit world the conversion would be 1000 0000 - 1111 1111 1111 1111 - 1111 1111 1000 0000

7895961
udp	tcp
don t reinvent the wheel and choose between udp and tcp until you re completely sure you need something more sophisticated but not simpler

7895961
udp	tcp
to dispatch your data to right application you need transport protocol udp tcp and others

7896012

when i look at the outputs for the primary output of my application it gets the app.config from the project directory instead of the corresponding obj folder like everything else...a big oversight in my opinion by msft

hash	md5
where request is a primary key and represents an md5 hash of a request uri

7896592

forcing the system to use only ram with no possibility of writing to disk is tricky and ignores the fact that someone with root access can also read data with difficulty directly from the ram of the webserver process before it gets encrypyed

7896619
udp	tcp
it makes more sense to compare tcp vs udp vs other transport layer protocols -- and http vs ftp vs other application layer protocols

7896662
jqxhr	deferred
in the case where the script already exists the jqxhr var will not be a deferred so the then is executed immediately

7896719
hide	show
in my view a show hide button and a map

7896731
pci	ioremap
in case it is io memory pci memory you should have a closer look at ioremap

i ll also have to do a similar conversion to videos shot in portrait to rotate them from landscape so that they are orientated correctly on the server

7896773
super	abstract
i have looked at some other similar questions and seen things about the usage of final variables when calling the super constructor or problems with the abstract nature of the parent class but i could not find a definitive answer to why this particular situation throws an instantiationexception

use to make the ram disk

7896860

7896937
g++	gcc
but when trying to compile that using gcc actually g++ that lead to funny errors

7896947
put	get
if you use a listbox so that the user can select a row and then put your commands in the vm that contains the collection you get a cleaner implementation

7896967
google-chrome	firefox
and it actually works well in google-chrome but for some reason it doesn t work on firefox

7896967
google-chrome	firefox
and again it does work on google-chrome but i don t get anything in firefox

7897044
vsto	add-in
vsto add-in comaddins and requestcomaddinautomationservice

7897055
move	drag
so either way it neglects to just move it as one might notice the option i change is the helper which is the main factor in all this as well but if the helper is a clone it should just use a clone of itself to be dragged and if it s set to original it should take the module entirely out of the spot it was in and drag the module itself but i don t see why it would be causing these weird problems the current setting on the site is clone but you ll of course have to make an account to be able to test it which if you wish you can delete immediately afterwords and once you re on the site you need to call the javascript function modularmode which if you don t know how can easily be done by entering javascript modularmode

7897078
google-chrome	firefox
but on firefox and google-chrome when i goto the canvas page it redirects away from facebook and to my site

7897208
width	height
i am simply growing the width height on hover

7897215
post	get
you cannot 100 prevent this if the user wants to do it however to avoid this happening by accident look into post redirect get

you can do the same thing to identify candidate rectangles by translating from the x y space of the image to the solution space of possible rectangles theta d width height rotation

7897230

safari and google-chrome seem to be ignoring the after element completely

7897263
google-chrome	safari
it works in safari google-chrome if i have both .readmore and it s after pseudo- set to block but then the .readmore is on its own line obviously and i d really like it to be inline

7897263
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i set it to inline or inline-block it stops working in safari google-chrome but firefox doesn t seem to care.

7897263
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
any tips advice or resources on how firefox safari google-chrome render block elements differently

7897267
hide	show
here is a way of doing it...it hide the show more link for the current div collapses all other currently opened divs and brings back there show more links

7897275
crossover	mutation
since you will be using crossover and mutation on a sample of the population you don t have to worry too much about the efficiency of the crossover operator

7897291
datamapper	activerecord
i just went into #datamapper and solnic helped me understand this there is no need to use the mysql2 gem with datamapper because do-mysql the dataobject driver dm-mysql-adapter depends on to access mysql repositories doesn t have problems with character-encodings which is the reason i and most people i would assume use the mysql2 driver in activerecord projects

7897293
int	boolean
primitive types int floats boolean -- and in particular the fact that primitive types aren t part of the object system

7897310
uiview	subviews

7897350
getter	setter
i have some common variables that each need to have but i don t want to make getter and setter in each class seems like it goes against dry anyway

7897379
width	height
unless there is code missing from your example in your tiletocache you instantiate and use tilerect without defining a width and height

7897403
implements	extends
it seems weird that you would want to extends piece and implements piecebase.

7897403
getter	setter
if you used an interface all your classes that implement it will still have to define their own getter setter

7897403
getter	setter
that way they all use the same getter setter ..

7897422
getter	setter
i suggest simply defining the abstract class piece with the required common getter and setter and then have your concrete classes extend piece

7897429
clang	llvm
i m using llvm 3.0 and clang on xcode 4.2

cpu	processors
in many cpu s dsp s digital signal processors and machine controllers such as that controlling a washing machine the stack is located on the chip itself

7897471
hash	md5
cryptographic digests like md5 sha-1 and even sha-512 are a lot better because you only ever store and compare the hash passwords but they are still bad because they were designed to hash data very quickly for the purposes of data integrity and signing

7897483
hide	show
i need to add information below the div that toggles show hide on click

7897496
folder	directory
instead set the mvc directory as its own app starting point and then run the mvc from that folder so that it and the existing webforms app are completely ignorant of each other

7897496
post	get
so now instead of blog blog index or blog blog post 1 i get a proper clean url without the duplicate blog in the url - blog post 1

7897508

7897617
hide	show
both tables are exact duplicates except that table 1 has the show link while table 2 has the content you want to show and a hide link

7897617
hide	show
as the content in both tables is the same except for the show hide box visibility you ve created an illusion that the box is toggling

7897617
hide	show
if you have more than one show hide box you ll need to create more tables

7897624
google-chrome	firefox
its working in ie8 google-chrome and firefox

also note that the standard library functions strlen strcpy strncpy strcat printf strdup etc. are slightly incompatible with each other regarding the terminating null

7897716
printf	strncpy
also strncpy does not guarantee null termination while printf does

7897720
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
when you set the onitemclicklistener the event onitemclicked will only be called if the child of the listview does not have the onclicklistener set

7897720
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
since the textview s onclicklistener is set the onitemclicklistener will not be called

7897737
put	get
i know that when i put getheadphones in google i get get headphones but not sure how they do that and how they know that it is not get head phones

7897792
hide	show
how can i make the question panels show and hide animately

emitmapper	automapper
once you have both object types you can follow mitch s advice and use a tool like emitmapper or automapper to automatically map domain objects to dtos

experiments at a previous employer showed that the standard linux and solaris malloc free implementations were not particularly efficient in high-concurrency multicore environments

7898015

7898021
width	height
the offset values represent the x and y spacing from the left and top edges of the screen which should be set to half of the stage width and height so that the camera will centre on the stage correctly

the _x and _y properties are private and have getter and setter

7898028
stdout	stdio
printf is written to the stream stdout which is declared in stdio

7898028
stdout	stderr
it is opened the first time you touch one of the standard streams stdin stdout stderr

7898028
stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio
the standard streams stdin stdout and stderr are macros that call a stdio library function which opens the streams and returns an array those streams

7898057
keydown	keyup
i don t think you can get around using keydown keyup or keypress for determining which keys are pressed

7898059
implements	extends
i have class that extends uiapplication and implements runnable

7898061
keydown	keyup
on keydown set it to true on keyup set it to false

7898066
firefox	safari
however when in firefox i need a margin-top of 20px in safari i need like 15px else it s too far down

7898066
firefox	safari
i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts

7898066
width	height
i ve tried all kinda of display combinations with line-heights and perhaps adding a width height for the text and whatnot

7898152
nsobject	ivar	ivar	subclassing
yes photo can use any method property ivar etc except for those ivars declared private of a nsobject when you subclassing nsobject

7898311
width	height
i m guessing i would need to group the rows by the same product type width and height

7898384
getter	setter
perhaps you can use _session which sort of amounts to the same thing i know or declare a class which has a static variable and use a getter and setter

7898468
post	get
when i bring this up in firebug to inspect the call i see the headers but the post and response is nothing it is just spinning. i never get an error in return i only get incessant spinning

7898513
folder	directory
when you create a new target it creates a new directory in your project folder which makes it easy to have the same file names for multiple files

7898572
post	get
you specify that you cannot use any type of post or get

7898572
post	get
whether synchronously via a form action or asynchronously via ajax any type of communication will fall under the category of either a post or get

7898582
post	get
i can t see any way of doing the same as that post without using the ids i was thinking you could route via a vf page and build up the url in the controller but it doesn t seem as though you can get the ids of fields just their type etc

7898589
post	put
once you have set the correct scopes you should be able to do post put requests just fine

7898624
client-side	server-side
behind your question there is apparently confusing between server-side actions and client-side actions

7898659
keydown	keyup
but i want to keep the script from being unnecessarily being called so i was wonder if there were a way to track a keydown event and stop the keyup event when there is already 5 characters in the textbox which would indicate that a query has probably already been submitted if there were a way to stop the keyup event handler after

7898694
keydown	keyup
instead of a keydown event how about having a boolean flag that you check in keyup to decide if you have to do a resolve

7898706

folder	directory
best way to deploy resource file in application directory s app_globalresources folder

7898738

7898750
width	height
i have set the width and height property of canvas equal to window

7898750

7899117
typedef	struct
i can only send in a continuous block of memory explicitly and the typedef struct s are only there for conveying defining the memory struture of the data

7899308
mouseleave	mouseenter
your code doesn t specify an event handler when it rebinds the mouseenter and mouseleave events

7899315
int	double
so whatever is where t is a type like int double or even one of your classes becomes and the syntax is exactly the same hereafter.

7899325
