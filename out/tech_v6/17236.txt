min	max
so actually instead of setting min max and quantiles yourself you rather should pass the full data from a dataframe to a boxplot

47309939
min	max
set this to an unreasonably high value to force the whiskers to show the min and max values

47309939

swift	objective-c
therefore to allow archives encoded with swift 3 mangled names to be decoded in swift 4 and above the compiler is suggesting you expose the class to objective-c with the swift 3 mangled name

47310147
swift	objective-c
if you don t need to provide this backwards compatibility for swift 3 then you can go ahead and expose the nested class to objective-c with your own stable name to ensure future mangling changes don t affect archive decoding

the problem is that you re setting the width and height of a display object with no graphics

47310252
width	height
since its width and height at that point are zero you re asking flash to set the scale values to infinity

47310252

there s no way an empty display object can have width and height other than zero

47310252
width	height
the width and height will be set automatically

47316183
setinterval	settimeout
the problem with your code is that settimeout and setinterval are asynchronous functions -- javascript will not wait for the them to finish and thus your while loop is creating an infinite number of them and crashing your program

47316194
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout for such purposes is better idea than setinterval as you don t have to clear them and they won t get crowded - if your fight takes longer than period then this won t run into next fight

from my understanding unity can be a rest client where we can send get and post to the existing rest server by using unitywebrequest in unity.network

47316522
for-loop	loops
the main point of simplification was in exchanging the for-loop from 0 to r.length being initial size to a while loops using the collection s iterator so loops only ends when there is actually no more element left and thus making a finishtoarray .. method unnecesary

47316522
for-loop	arrays
also the rather complex body in s for-loop has been highly simplified from several if -branches including return statements to just a simple if -branch resizing the arrays if necessary

google-chrome	safari
most applications you have installed including google-chrome and safari are using this api and know nothing about x11 and will ignore the display variable

maven	pom.xml
this is the maven dependency what you need to add to your pom.xml

47317509
width	height
the main idea is to wrap your views labels inside the uiscrollview with a uiview instead of directly inside the uiscrollview then you need to set the constraints of the uiview to match the uiscrollview from all sides and add a height and width constraints equaling the uiscrollview

47317574

int	chars
the ugly casting trick with unsigned is to instruct the compiler to handle the pointer as if it would point to an int combining several chars in a single value

47317624
int	chars
if you have a little endian architecture which is much more probable the bytes would be loaded into the register as an int in the reverse order a b c d in memory order would be loaded as d c b a for the calculations the bytes would then be shifted and combined as explained to the right a d c b but when stored back into memory the bytes would again be reversed b c d a so the rotate right that is done on the int results in a rotate left if looking at the individual chars

47317641
width	text-align
we move the text-align center from to and remove the width 25 from so the text inside the list items is correctly justified

children	parent
speaking of real usecases i m working on an everyday growing project at first pure react state management seemed like a very convenient way to develop and it was working just fine when the components structures were still somehow flattened but as we go along it the project gets more complicated and by complicated i mean more component become nested and one parent has a serie of nested children so we have to pass props all the way from the parent to the most furthest child and whenever we need to rerender the parent all the children have to go through this cycle also as for your case if you know that your project won t get way more complicated and tabs.jsx won t have maybe something like form that contains further nested subform that contains a grid maybe you surely don t need to complicate your life with redux but as i stated earlier for us we started to notice that at this stage integrating redux would be considerable

even if you were able to send an arp request to a system in the other subnet and receive its response somehow -- providing you with that system s mac address -- you could not use it to send a packets to that system because ethernet does not provide a routing mechanism and so the system will never see any ethernet packets you address to it

put	get	post	get	post	put
in every trivial rest example you see it appears to be pretty symmetrical between what you get vs what you post put

47360791
put	get	post	get	post	put
for example rest would lead you to believe that if you do a get on a collection or resource and then post or put that response body back that there should be no change but that s just not realistic considering the aforementioned examples

47360791
put	get	post	get	post	put
so in essence your get response becomes a superset of the actual post put body

47360791
put	get	post	get	post	put
the terminology i ve used for this as a head nod to the relational asymmetry between the two has been to say that my get returns a readonly representation of the collection resource versus that the post put body accepts

47360791
inherited	properties
that lends itself nicely to code where you can inherited a readonly representation from the object to augment it with the properties that your server backend is responsible for creating managing

47360791
put	get
for example here s two typescript interfaces showing what data a user could put ipet versus what data the server would respond with for a get ireadonlypet

47360791
put	get	post	get	post	put
i don t know if i d force a user to strip off things like id when making a post put subsequent to a get request as that s a lot of data transformation work to ask of your api consumers

47360791
put	get	post	get	post	put
so someone could do a get then modify the id then do a post put and you would simply ignore the id property

47360791
put	get	post	get	post	put
if i had to choose one i d probably go with the second option because i think it makes for a simpler more symmetrical experience for your api consumers in that they can do a full circle get post put the get response and get again to receive the same original response

47360811
stdout	stderr
the following examples illustrate using redirections with tee as a pipe target while distinguishing stdout and stderr

47360811
stdout	stderr
run this in the cli with stdout redirected to dev null and you only see the stderr messages

47360811
stdout	stderr
essentially we first want to redirect stderr to an error file then stdout to a log file

if you needed to delete them then the for-loop wouldn t work becuase sizeof c is not the size of the arrays and should have been delete instead

47361065
post	get
a get request or post request is necessary for the client to request data from the server and receive it as a response

47361273
width	margin
with just the first two position and top it nicely fixes to the top of the browser window but it pushes all items to the left side of the container margin padding and all when the screen is more than large enough to accommodate the 960px .container requirement. when i add the third property of width and set it to 100 it exceeds the 960px container and continues off the page if i reduce the value to 960px to match the container it brings the bar back in line but then it will not flex properly when the screen is reduced the problem being that the bar does not flex at all

47361275

47361361
spaces	delimiter
whereas spaces delimiter word list words are to come first then the jumbled word processed each consuming a single console window line

47361361
bufferedreader	ioexception
in reality your code works as expected however since you are using a bufferedreader object and a filereader object your code will need to be in a try catch block to handle any exceptions such as the filenotfoundexception and the ioexception

47361685
swift	objective-c
i think part of my problem is because swift 4 has changed the way things like objective-c work

47361685
swift	objective-c
that seems to lead down the path towards requiring me to expose every class variable i want to use this tool with to objective-c and that just seems backwards -- this is a newer feature as i understand it and it s just odd that apple wouldn t make it work natively in swift

47361686

addition	multiplication
using addition instead of multiplication

47362316
multiplying	addition
so r4 gets a copy of n coming in then that is added for factorial it is a multiplying which depending on the instruction set and code can produce a lot more code that can confuse the understanding so i used addition instead to the return value from the call to the next function with recursion where the compiler didnt figure out what we were doing this would have been a call to ourselves and we can write this asm and make it a call to ourselves to see how it works

47362316
addition	multiplication
so the addition in this case multiplication in your desired case is

47362379
width	height
the easiest way to set the height width without preloading the images would be to get a list of images from a server that also return height width

47362379
width	height
that is a decent method for setting height width

47362379
width	height
if you don t have a server you will need to hand code the html elements and put the height width data in manually

you can write it so the database exp.db is updated rather than created by the csv file but you would probably want to use a language like python perl tcl ruby etc to do that.

47371507
inherited	subclassing
to combine this with your need for get_entity to be called on an inherited class you can use the #inherited method to automatically call get_entity any time applicationrecord is subclassing

it gets a pointer to interval object as parameter and puts the copy of it into the array

47371796
spaces	delimiter
- specifying no delimiter separators - must be placed at the very end of the options string because the very next character is invariably interpreted as a delimiter which is what happened in your case a spaces became the delimiter

47372037
children	parent
all parent s are 0 all children of course are greater than 0

47372037
children	parent
this was very doable because the parent and children are both being sorted on create_date even if one was asc and one was desc

47372037
children	parent
so the caveat is now i want to sort the parent by a column called votes desc and the children or comment replies the same as above create_date asc

47372194
free	malloc
i ve read here if the memory is allocated normally like malloc free syscalls does every shared library has his own heap but if uses mmap allocates memory which doesn t belong to the program s heap

in comparison by preparing an sql statement using prepare followed by bind_param and execute all potentially harmful input values are automatically escaped by the php engine and are therefore transformed in harmless values

47372340
for-loop	arrays
and to go further your code will be very slow you should never use a for-loop to iterate over a numpy arrays the proper way of doing things is to exploit what is called vectorized operations that is operations that apply on the whole arrays at once for example will give you an arrays that contains the sum the cell on left+cell on the right for each cell where you can compute that sum

47372351

free	realloc	free	calloc	realloc	calloc
the same applies to functions calloc realloc free and others

47372797
free	malloc
now because windows does not have the same relation to c language as unix-likes have it does not provide you with malloc and free functions

47372797
free	malloc
this allows you to have multiple c runtimes co-existing in the same process and every of those runtimes can provide its independent implementation of malloc free etc each operating on a separate heap

client-side	server-side
this approach does not require any server-side code to be changed but introduce more complexity in our client-side code

47383387
for-loop	arrays
then in the second for-loop we check every value in the arrays if it is maximal so checking the first value against a load of zeros then you exit the nested for-loop and print the statement with the value of if it was positive

47383387
for-loop	loops
as was commented a single loops would be enough and ensure your print statement is outside of the outer for-loop

47383410
min	max
also you shouldn t print until after you determine the min and max

47383410
min	max
or fixing your current code declare min and max outside the loop

47383563
libstdc++	libc++
keep in mind when i say gcc i really mean gcc with libstdc++ while clang really means clang with libc++

47399078
fiddler	charles
as described in the troubleshooting section of the api docs i d suggest that you use a tool like fiddler or charles http proxy to examine the raw http request that your app is sending then you can investigate verify the items i ve listed above

47399081
sorting	filtering
how can i still allow sorting of the original items data set while still allowing filtering

47399092

47399135
post	get
if you have a polymorphic many-to-many relationship on post i can t get it to work on the read only version

47399135
post	get
the problem is when you filter a post using the read only model with a specific tag you get sql like this

47399154
inherited	properties
add to class header-top-container properties position inherited class like following

47399174
post	get
i made a post a while back here idp connecting to sp saml sso which has helped me get in the right direction

47399191

i know the concept of what i should be doing create a counter within the for-loop and then after the iterations in that loops whatever the value of that counter variable it should also give me the count of files right

47399193
width	height
vw and vh relative to 1 of the width or the height of the viewport

47399201
dictionary	map
initially i would parse through a corpus to create my dictionary which is then used to map words in a string to integers

uninstall	upgrade
so your major upgrade will uninstall the older product completely deleting the service and then install your upgrade

47399268
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
having said that an upgrade is always an uninstall of the older product so the servicecontrol in that older versioning will run and remove both might be the problem deleting the service during the upgrade

47399285
min	max
edit min max notation messed me up

47399309
width	height
the idea is for it to stretch to 100 of the window width but never go taller than a specific pixel height even if it gets distorted

47399313
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be a strange bug in css grid for google-chrome doesn t happen in firefox

47399354
hide	show
this will produce mini columns to the left of the rows click on the 1 2 3 to show and hide detail

47399420
getter	setter
it uses get on the source and set on the target so it will invoke getter and setter

47399470
for-loop	loops
it s not illegal for-loop contents never to refer to loops index as is easy to see

47399479

47399509
postgresql	mysql
and start looking at mysql or postgresql or something

47399584
int	chars
you are converting an int to chars using the ascii

47399584
int	chars
you could make the array int array instead of chars array or you can call for 0-9 only to get the desire result

47399596
put	get
request works model gets updated but i have issue with redirecting as it is redirecting also as a put instead of simple get

47399599
int	chars
as others have commented above you ensure your array is of type int not chars or add 0 to each int to get the correct ascii value

47399623
getter	setter
your are right this might result in quite straightforward dto s with a bunch of getter and setter but it will beat checking array structures for sure

47399623
getter	setter
so concluding if you have a tightly defined set of php objects with well established constructor properties getter setter constructor relationships action methods and besides that some kind of serializing mechanism you re in good shape

47399637
google-chrome	firefox
they display this way in ie 11 google-chrome and firefox when using reporting services

47399701
for-loop	loops
if you yank off the outer for-loop for example the inner loops should proceed if the querysets are not empty

47399710

versioning	upgrade
the solution was to upgrade my oneplus 3 to android 8 to get a newer driver versioning where this issue does not occur

47400220
post	get
i know that getmapping only handles get requests it is used when we do not want to change anything on the server just get data and postmapping handles only post requests it is used when we want to change something on the server

47400240
post	get
i was able to get it working using 3 separate queries one for each table + post processing at the application layer but for the sake of my personal knowledge base i was wondering if anyone knew how to do it in a single query

47400265
dplyr	purrr
here s a fairly readable solution that uses dplyr and purrr to return quantiles in a tidy format

47400291
fish	bash
ordinary bash functions like echo 123 works fine only fish functions are not found

47400292
getlasterror	findwindow
calling getlasterror after findwindow succeeds is meaningless the value is undefined

47400314
post	get
it s not clear from you post how do you get the _columnstoindexes

47400348
versioning	upgrade
it could be a general gea problem or some versioning upgrade issue as the code last was used a while ago

47400367
min	max
initializes variables total max min i ran

47400367
min	max
checks and sets min max

47400367
min	max
prints min max average

47400367
for-loop	loops
using a while loops can be done with a counter but it s usually done with a for-loop

47400367
min	max
min max are probably expected to be min max of the random count not of the total and it s clearer to use math.min max

47400367
int	double
calculating the average should be done with double division not with int division

47400417
tiff	png
the url is absolutely a valid file url -- like i said this works in the playground and i ve tried a number of different files and file types tiff jpg and png

47400443

in my application i have a main window and a utility pop-up dialog that is shown when the user clicks on a menu item

47400512
pop-up	dialog
this is ok - but when the user then clicks on my java application again only the main window is shown - the utility pop-up dialog is still hidden under firefox

47400512
pop-up	dialog
i would like to design it such that when the user interacts with the main window in any way the utility pop-up dialog is also brought to the front

47400560
pop-up	dialog
the utility pop-up dialog is still hidden

47400574
put	get
separately as a matter of style you should put your twilio client outside your get function so it s only created once not every time someone calls the endpoint

47400594

i am trying to only get the votes that seen false that are connected to the post with p.creator.user_id if the post has 0 votes or all votes are seen

47400601
qstring	qdatastream
if you take a look at how the fortune server example is implemented you can see that it uses qdatastream to serialize fortunes qstring s over the socket

47400601
qstring	qdatastream
so the question is reduced to how does qdatastream serialize qstring s

47400601
qdatastream	qbytearray
this has nothing to do with using qbytearray you can let qdatastream write to the socket directly

47400622
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my fx-assets composer plugin and yii versioning from 2.0.12 - 2.0.13 and suddenly my thumbnails stopped working which are generated by the nailthumb plugin i am getting the following errors in the console

google-chrome	firefox
so far i implemented the html+css works fine in firefox and google-chrome

47400637
google-chrome	firefox
ps only google-chrome and firefox support is required as it will end up as a tv in a control room kiosk mode

47400650
scipy	mpmath
however since gamma functions with negative first parameter are not defined in scipy i had to choose the version from mpmath

47400694
httprequest	httpresponse
however it may be surprising to learn that the httprequest and httpresponse classes are largely immutable

47400715
post	get
your code suggests you are trying a post whereas a get is required for the instruments endpoint

47400726
google-chrome	firefox
there does appear to be a rendering difference between google-chrome and firefox edge when using auto-fill in this context

for-loop	arrays
i use a nested for-loop to shoot through the 2d arrays and it creates a new struct with the particular seats info for each and plugs it into the arrays

47400791
google-chrome	safari
however i don t see them in google-chrome or i see that they are broken in safari

47400792
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop goes through a 4x4 range but your arrays is 2x4

47400805
scipy	mpmath
mpmath has its own quad method which replaces scipy s quad in your code

i had the same issue and after a few hours maybe a day i ve decided to migrate to junit just the tests that use powermockito

47400984
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
so a way you can solve this is to do a second for-loop within the first one to loops through the allseasons arrays and compare dates

47401003

47401493
multiplying	add
i have a scenario where i have to find percentage of each child node by multiplying node value with node weight e.g nodeval nodeweight 100 then sum these computed values of all child nodes and add it to its parent now at one level up this newly computed parent also has its weight which will be multiplied with its value and then we will compute sum of all child nodes at this level and add it to its parent one level above and so on

i also set width and height attributes in style object still same error

47401512

unfortunately i had to hardcode images width and height

47401550
for-loop	arrays
since at the end of the for-loop no click event will yet be triggered the arrays will still be empty and the alert will result in undefined

47401565

you can use match to do the filtering part and grouping to do the aggregation

47410261
margin	height
because when in non-mobile size the default value of flex row items s align-items kicks in which is stretch and make items on the same row equally high which is not the case when wrapped or using flex column direction where they instead collapse to their own height based on margin border padding and content

47410261

git-svn	svn2git

47410672
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

47410672
git-svn	svn2git
if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually

47410672
git-svn	svn2git
the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn

47410672
git-svn	svn2git
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

assuming you have no other methods binding mouseenter mouseleave to the element you should be able to use .off at the top of your showfloatingpanel method to remove the event bindings and then allow them to be added back in by the method like so

47433397
mouseleave	mouseenter
note though if you wanted a different method to also bind to the mouseenter mouseleave of the above would unbind those events too

some plugins might depend on the versioning of vim and may work in versioning 7 but not in versioning 8 when you install macvim this could be versioning 8 and the terminal vim versioning might be 7 both will use the same .vim folder and .vimrc to load the plugins and configuration when you open the vim from terminal it might still work because the plugins were depending on vim versioning 7 but when you try to execute macvim it will try to load the plugins using versioning 8 and then it will crash the reason some of the answers worked it s because they are replacing the system vim therefore macvim and vim will be in the same major versioning if you have upgrade from the previous versioning the best you can do it s to clear up the plugins folder and then load macvim or vim and check that everything is working then start applying the plugins one by one checking that they are not breaking vim

â dbconnectionstringbuilder implements the interfaces idictionary icollection ienumerable and icustomtypedescription

47442861
idictionary	icollection	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	idictionary
the reason your sample works when you created a wrapper that implements the inotifypropertychanged is because a bindingsource knows how to pull from the inotifypropertychanged interface without getting confused about the derived classes implementation of idictionary icollection ienumerable icustomtypedescription ie you bound to a concrete class that only implements one interface inotifypropertychanged

47442861
idictionary	icollection	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	idictionary
i could not implement the inotifypropertychanged interface and any of the idictionary icollection ienumerable icustomtypedescription and use a bindingsource to bind a non collection type property string specifically on the class

47442861
idictionary	icollection	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	idictionary
i created a sample class that implements both inotifypropertychanged and any of the other interfaces idictionary icollection ienumerable icustomtypedescription

i know that capturestream gets maximal framerate as the parameter not constant and it does not even guarantee that but it is possible to change mediastream currenttime currently in google-chrome in firefox it has no effect but in return there is requestframe not available at google-chrome but the idea of manual frame requests or setting the placement of the frame in the mediastream should override this effect

as you can see the last two dimensions of the xgrad and ygrad tensors which represent width and height of an image are only partially updated in xgrad2 only the columns 2 to width-1

47450913
width	height
even if that means rotating the image by -90â if image width image height in the example below

47450945

getter	setter
regarding the getter and setter only add the ones you need

47451311
getter	setter
your screen class accesses none of the fields in the studenttable class understandably since most of them are not justified and would be completely useless to other classes yet you have a getter and setter for every single one of them

47451311
getter	setter
if you do have a lot of getter and setter put them at the end this stops having to scroll 20 minutes to access any of the actual implementation in the class

47451830
fgets	strlen
check how to use strlen to get length of null terminated char array and fgets to get input

47451841
for-loop	loops
so should i rely on compile-time code optimization which is able to unroll the for-loop using compile-time determinate length end of loops at compile time or use recursion all the time

47451869
rss	feed
instead of having to check every x amount of time is there a system that automatically updates and lets me know when something knew is pushed to the rss feed

47451897
for-loop	loops
the template and loops itself work as intended but changing a variable from the list inside the function called inside the for-loop doesn t work

47451918
width	height
if not your other alternative is as i mentioned in the comment is to set the width and height for the image to a fixed value

47452025
sorting	filtering
if item 20 is selected store 20 not page 2 item 10 because a you don t have that same problem with overwrites and b that saves you problems in the future when you implement custom sorting and filtering and no longer can rely on list position

47452032
hide	show
i wanted to hide the url instead of displaying the link i wanted to show my project url

then i filtered minimum value of j and maximum value of r and threshold values which corresponds to min j and max r

47452114
width	height
you need to set .css display block in your js when you click the element and if you wanna have it filling up the entire width and height of the window you could look into using width 100vw

47452139
width	height
i m trying to load an images into imageview which is of variable size but as aspect ratio is maintain by adjustviewbounds images with less width and more height are shown too big

47452139

47452188
range	min	range	max	min	max
double however is a floating point number which has a much larger range both in terms of min max values but also sub-integer values including very small values

47452256
range	infinity
the borders of the range can also include the xs double value - inf infinity see here

47452256
range	infinity
i suppose that the check does not know how to handle inf so my question is if there is a way to include this infinity value as a border to the range or if i have to go a different way

is there any other way to archive this regardless of static width and height

47452367
post	get
the answer is that unless you want to manually change the list filteredposts without altering post you don t need a get and set function for your computed variable

47452367
post	get
this way if you change the post or the search variable in data filteredposts will get recomputed and a re-render will be triggered

47452379
width	height
you have to set your #hidden div s height and width to 100 and give it a fixed position

width	height
determines the location on screen width and height of the given view and returns the values via an async callback

47471407
width	height
if successful the callback will be called with the following arguments x y width height pagex pagey

47471407
height	border-box	width	border-box	width	height
the result is the smallest rectangle which contains the entire element with read-only left top right bottom x y width and height properties describing the overall border-box in pixels

47471407

47472272
width	height
notice that only the convolutional 2d layers will see images in terms of height and width

47472272
width	height
when you add the lstm s you will need to reshape the data to bring height width and channels into a single dimension

47472295
vsts	tfs
we were able to move test cases from tfs to vsts but parameters and attachments of the test cases didn t migrate with them

47472314

47474031
put	get
i m just unaware of how to get this done in the current studio version and while i can find lots of references to what code to use and plenty of examples of how to make code work i can t seem to find any info on where to actually put any code

apache	nginx
i ve created a nginx virtual host that works as a reverse proxy for apache which is listening in the port 8000

47474154
chown	sudo	chown	mkdir
well to answer your first question i think you have to do few things to resolve your problem.first run the command given in this link kubernetes.io docs setup independent create-cluster-kubeadmâ œâ â then few commands 1 mkdir -p home .kube 2 sudo cp -i etc kubernetes admin.conf home .kube config 3 sudo chown id -u id -g home .kube config .this admin.conf should be known to kubectl so as to work properly

47474257
seaborn	matplotlib
i use matplotlib and seaborn to create a plot with two x axes and two y axes

serializable	deserialization
i m fairly certain that the two classes shown authors and books are probably many to many database serializable entities from an orm such as entity framework and possibly even code generated from database tables in which case good pricipals of object orientation don t really apply as the orm needs to write to fields during deserialization

47475059
postgresql	informix
the dbmss could be different in this case informix and postgresql

47475465
put	get
given many 2x2 matrices get produced by some unknown process their colorspace-transcoding ought keep some rationale that if all were put side by side the transcoding used should be non-local having some global anchor for globally equalised normalisation of individual colorspace-transcoding values so as not to devastate any phenomenon that was observed in the original colorspace on 4096 x 4096 imagery source but was torn appart by just locally-normalised 2 x 2 transcoding this will lead to incoherrent target colorspaces and the globally observable visual phenomenon will not be visible in a set of target 2x2 sub-views right due to incompatible colorspaces transcoding -- a new kind o non-linear disorder will be introduced due to globally discoordinated colorspace-transcoding and the initial information value of the original will be lost

here the button is positioned at 40 of the axes width and 50 of its height 20 of the axes width long and 8 height

47490263
for-loop	loops
a for-loop will loops through a variable in an iterable such as range

47490263
for-loop	loops
in your case when the program reaches the first loops of the for-loop i is 0

47490269
for-loop	loops
furthermore a while loops does nothing else this in contrast to the for-loop that reads the next item into the variable

47490269
for-loop	loops
since your while loops does not changes the i and the continue will let the while loops not the for-loop perform a new loops it will thus keep executing the while loops

47490281
width	margin
and finally if the window is equal or wider than 1000px the container width will be set to 960px overriding the rule that sets the width to 400px but notice that i m not overriding margin rule so this is valid still since browser window is wider than 430px so the media query applies

as your custom field is specific to product post type but not to order post type you need to get first the order items to get the product id that you should use with acf get_field function this way

47490372
try-catch	exception-handling
the try-catch block basically absorbs the exception-handling

47490383
width	height
the height and width of the window include the chrome so they will have to be slightly larger than the window contents

further down the code im asking if the output is between these numbers are between min and max give number is in interval

47490990
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
the operations are only addition subtraction and multiplication of matrices represented by + -

47491031
min	max
the function is expecting two parameters min and max

47491031
min	max
thus min is going to be an event object and max will be undefined and your if statement won t work

47491031
min	max
you can check this out by logging min and max inside find to the console

47491048
scenekit	arkit
i have added positional audio and interactive audio to an arkit scenekit game but now i just want to add background audio that plays when the app is running and open and stops if the app is closed or in the background

47491507
unsigned	short
cast unsigned short is applied to the unsigned result - this step seems strange

47491507
unsigned	short
the composite type unsigned is unnecessarily being narrowed to unsigned short

47491507
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
the unsigned short result is prepared for shifting and integer promotions are performed on each of the operands of the

47491507
unsigned	short
so the unsigned short is promoted to int or possibly unsigned if

47491507
unsigned	short
the int is applied to a unsigned short

47491507
unsigned	short
note it is dubious that unsigned char isswitchon and unsigned short switchmask are not the same type

47491528
put	get
the reason most people put that image in a container is because they get some sort of advantage out of it over using an image alone this could range from aspect-ratio locks to relative positioning

47496088
division	modulo
note that converting your numbers to string s before processing them is a bit wasteful - you can do this using the modulo and division operators and to inspect the digits directly note that this code requires a minor tweak to work with negative numbers

47496099
for-loop	arrays
therefore your p arrays is not existing yet and so you are using an undefined object in a for-loop which is not working

47496148

47496334
int	chars	int	boolean
what you can do is create a boolean array which the index is the int value of the chars example below but premature optimization is the root of all evil the for loops are very fast optimize the code only when it s needed

47496365
min	max
does this imply that we are using pooling and if so what would the default min and max pool size be

47496403

we ve defined our new element and we have a value property getter setter to interact with this element s value

47498238
getter	setter
pay attention that the getter setter will be found on the element s prototype object which is okay in itself to be sure

47498238
getter	setter
the value is set on the non-upgraded yet element therefore it is not the getter setter that are being invoked but just a new property is added to the element

47498238
getter	setter
having this property set on the object itself even after the upgrade is done the value s getter setter are not accessible for this element instance anymore since there is an overriding value property available before getting to the prototype

47499270
children	parent	width	height
when you set the contents of an element with absolute positioning that parent element wont know the dimensions of it s children so that s why you need to manually set the width and height of

47499270
width	height
if you really want to keep it the way you are doing it not recommended you would need to set the width and height of the same proportion as your images and all images would need to have the same proportions

47499270

swift	objective-c
the reason this worked in swift 3 was that all methods of classes that derived from nsobject which uiviewcontroller does were available to objective-c

47499448
swift	objective-c
in swift 4 due to se-0160 it is necessary to explicitly tag functions with objective-c that will be called through a selector unless you are overriding a function that is so marked in the base class or in this case if the functions satisfy the requirement of an objective-c protocol definition

47499487
width	height
work without having to know the parent s height width

when no limits are set it tries to find the limits by querying for the max and min index of the table

47499858
min	max
but if no data are on the table it returns none for both max and min

47499866
getter	setter
then maybe use a setter and getter for this purpose to set the value to the form control

47499891
getter	setter
i know that in kotlin getter and setter generic automatics but how i can set listener if it private

47499922

put	get
what you quoted was just an explanation for what would actually get put into the standard

47500288
comparator	comparable
if you re using comparable then you don t need to pass a comparator to the arrays.sort method it will use the instances themselves to perform the comparisons

47500297
post	get
i recently ran into this issue myself and would like to post how i managed to get around this

47500306
comparator	comparable
the most concise way to do create a comparator from the comparable output returned by a method of your class is the following

47500306
comparator	comparable
when to use comparable vs comparator

47500306
comparator	comparable
it is more flexible because you can provide any number of comparator in any number of contexts whereas you can only implement comparable once for a given class

47500360
dplyr	tidyr
packages i have installed dplyr tidyr multcomp multcompview

47500737
integer	unsigned
_bool is actually just another unsigned integer type with the exceptional rule that conversions to it always result in 1 true if the value does not equal 0 false

47500737
integer	unsigned
because it is an unsigned integer integral promotion rules apply

47500741
width	height
if we want to draw a parallellogram with height a and width w we first need to think how the first second i -th line etc will look like

47500742
hide	show
i know how to show or hide a section but got stuck going to do that

47500744
width	height
this results in the perspective switcher taking 100 width and the perspective side view not taking 100 height

47500787
for-loop	loops
this for-loop or using even foreach loops doesn t look nice and proper - but maybe it s only way to use standard looping

47500810
google-chrome	firefox
assuming you know how to deploy your widget use the config mgr or the icmadmin desktop then by far the easiest way to debug the front-end is using the developer tools that come with most browsers ie firefox google-chrome

47500839
multiplying	add
you should multiplying not add

47500863
interpolation	splines
splines interpolation on for 3+ dimensions can be done using scipy.interpolate.rbf as your described

47500863
interpolation	splines
for plotting purposes you can use a smaller resolution 1000 points is a good rule of thumb and when you want to evaluate your splines you can interpolation on much greater than 132000 points without problem see example below

47500863
interpolation	splines
fit splines and interpolation

47500865
int	double

47500995
tcplistener	serversocket
the serversocket is connected to the game server and the clientsocket is the game client which connected through a tcplistener in another class

47501009
children	parent
now you could have a structure where only the parent had links to the children and not vice versa just as you could have a singly-linked list

47501009
children	parent
but to have a doubly-linked list where each node has a pointer not only the the node after it but also a pointer back to the node before it is not a violation of object-oriented principles and neither is it a violation to have a doubly-linked tree structure where the child nodes also have pointers that allow navigating up the tree from children to parent

47501029
express	node.js
i m new to node.js and am trying to make a simple web app using express

47501051

47501261
consistency	acid
i also need acid support and immediate consistency so most no sql options are not appropriate

git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

47502088
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

47502088
git-svn	svn2git
if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually

47502088
git-svn	svn2git
the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn

47502088
git-svn	svn2git
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

47502121
post	get
in my app i have a code from official docs except one difference i send xsrftoken in response to post request not get

47502139
getter	setter
a hand-written getter or setter is always non-atomic

47502139
getter	setter
so you have a getter which is non-atomic and because the property itself is an atomic read write property you have an automatically generated setter which is atomic

47502139
getter	setter
you can t combine a non-atomic getter with an atomic setter or vice versa

47502141

in json out put first array object is ok but i cannot get json out put i required can i get help for create this json

47502222
getter	setter	accessor	ivar
remember if you implement both accessor methods both the setter and getter youâ ll have to manually synthesize the ivar

47502222
getter	setter
your getter is not atomic nor is my example setter so you likely just want to make this nonatomic

47502222
getter	setter	accessor	properties
being atomic means that the synthesized accessor ensure that a value is always fully retrieved by the getter method or fully set via the setter method even if the accessor are called simultaneously from different threads from programming with objective-c properties are atomic by default

47502222
getter	setter
note if you had made it nonatomic that also eliminates the need for you to write a custom setter to accompany your custom getter

47502222
getter	setter
if you implemented your own getter for an atomic property the compiler cannot synthesize a corresponding atomic setter because it has no way of knowing how to synchronize its setter with your getter as there are lots of different possible synchronization mechanisms

47502225
int	chars
this is a part of my code which is used to validate an input and loop if it is a chars however it causes an infinite loop when a chars is input but works fine when an int is used

47517089
versioning	upgrade
i have tried to upgrade versioning of redis gcc and the behavior is not changed between the servers

47517103
width	height
one of the problems is that apache poi has a method to get the width of a column in pixels while it only has a method to get the height of the row in points

47517103
width	height
the following example does positioning a picture over cell b3 anchored 20px from left cell border 20pt from top cell border in width up to 20px from right cell border and in height up to 10pt from bottom cell border

accessor	properties
it appears to be a properties with a get accessor but then it holds a new keyword in front of the object type

47517248
serializable	deserialization
clearly depending on the serializable format that s chosen you will need to alter the deserialization scanner to match

47517248
serializable	deserialization
this is the way serializable and deserialization work â the serializable format which should be strictly defined controls what the deserialization code needs to recognize

47517248
serializable	deserialization
the deserialization code can be more flexible you could argue against all the blanks in the format string shown for example but that would make the accepted format more rigid but should certainly recognize anything that the serializable code produces

47517289
post	get
post redirect get

47517289
post	get
this will probably be the more complex part of this answer making sure that when the user hits refresh the server receives a get request instead of a post

47517289
post	get
for this we ll use the well-known post redirect get pattern

47517289
post	get
in essence each time the user submits the form a post we are going to internally redirect the user to the same page but using get instead

47517289

i am able to set the video player size and control the aspect ratio when i embedded the scene and set the width and height via javascript on the scene

47517394
keydown	keyup
while working on a simple game i ve noticed that when i have six keys on the keyboard pressed down simultaneously catching the keydown and keyup events on the document of the web app starts to get unpredictable

47517394
keydown	keyup
is the browser blocking some combinations or does the browser draw the line at six with the keyup and keydown events

so for json serializable and deserialization i am using gson-converter library

47517644
pbkdf2	hash
you are not supposed to be able to generate the same pbkdf2 hash twice that is the point of the random seed

47517644
hash	salt
wrt verifying you are base64 encoding the salt and hash in create but not base64 decoding them in verify

47517644
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hex	binary	hash	salt
for debugging display the inputs and outputs of pbkdf2 for both create and verify use hex for binary values such as salt and hash and add that to the question

47517649
put	get
another problem i have is that my code finds all of the cards as matches it is supposed to get 2 cards that i clicked put them inside an array and compare them

47517682
int	double
and the input could be int 3 double 3.5 string hello

47517692
width	height
why do the height and width properties are zero

47517692
width	height
the stackview is copying the anchors of the parent so it must have same height and width

47517749
implements	extends
the error to solve is when i use custom route reuse strategy the strategy does not get triggerred when i use implements to override angular router class routereusestrategy and when i use extends keyword i get the below exception

47517756
int	chars
you may want to remove these chars and since these are numbers cast the value to int before appending to your list

47517789
put	get
i had the mysql commandline client that came with the 3.23 server installed via tarball not in the system library path on my client-testing box as well and it could connect fine with those credentials i couldn t test with isql because i couldn t get it to properly use plugin_dir and couldn t figure out where it wanted me to put the plugins

47517789
ubuntu	debian
while ubuntu debian especially is very good about making packages available on old architectures this still might be tricky

47517792
single-quotes	double-quotes
it doesn t matter if you are using single-quotes or double-quotes you can slash all the quotes and it ll be just fine

47517804
stdout	stderr
disown is the better practice being built into the shell rather than depending on an external tool but it requires more work you need to redirect stdin stdout and stderr yourself whereas nohup will do the redirection with a nohup.out name hardcoded if you haven t done it yourself

47517820
put	get
so my idea was to put these into a new function as i ve learnt from the python documentation that processes to be parallelized are generally placed into a new function and try to get the cpu to process it parallelly

47517839
lxml	beautifulsoup
i have written code to scrape wikipedia for links using beautifulsoup requests and lxml parser as imports that aren t built into python 2.7

metal	scenekit
i have a nasty problem with a scenekit app when running on iphone x ios 11.1.2 with the metal renderer

47517927
stdout	stdio
using system you could redirect stdout to a file then read it using fopen from stdio

47517927
execl	posix
to pass the arguments directly you could use the posix execl also mentioned in the documentation for popen above

47518039
children	parent
however each component gets one copy of a given service so you cannot have a parent communicate to two children via the same service independently

47518041
folder	directory
currently i manually extract all files in the zipped folder to the current working directory for my project and then use the csv module to read them

47518054

google-chrome	firefox
next are the firefox and google-chrome buttons

47518106
move	drag
however i have a custom view for text entry that i would like to interactively move as the user drag down

47518124
children	parent
since js events bubble up to parent elements you only have to attach one event listener to the parent element and it will catch every event triggered by its children

47518209
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
my swift data model for this api includes both class inherited subclassing and composition objects as properties of other objects

47518225

47518270
hide	show
i m trying to implement show hide navigation based on login

maven	pom.xml
i am using the instructions at to generate scaladocs for maven 3.x which says to add the following to your pom.xml

arp	udp
i have implemented udp client on pc and when i send data using sendto api at the same time i monitor data on wireshark wireshark shows it as an arp packet

47518392
arp	udp
i am not sure how udp packet is getting converted into arp packet

47518392
arp	udp
i understand arp is for finding mac address of target node but here i already know mac address of target device how can i add it in my udp client so it directly starts udp communication

47518400
post	put
it verifies the token only for requests that modify data post put delete etc.

47518474
width	height
you can specify their height and width using percentage or a specific number

47518478
versioning	upgrade
especially if it is about major versioning upgrade

47518478
versioning	upgrade
and you can t use transport client because it required jar upgrade for every minor versioning es upgrade and this fact do not make your life easier

47518500
ubuntu	linux
had the same problem just starting with create-react-native-app on ubuntu 17.10 and finally got it working on linux

47518552
integer	unsigned
the second even more important problem which has to be solved during marshalling is the use of native sized unsigned integer size_t as c type

47518552
x86	64bit	integer	unsigned
it is defined as either 32bit unsigned integer on x86 architectures or 64bit unsigned integer on x64 architectures i do intentionally skip all other processor architectures

47518578
pbkdf2	salt
i falsely assumed that since pbkdf2 accepts either a buffer or a string that it would work with a buffer however i was storing the salt in base64 to later verify it with pdkdf2 would result in a different salt being used

47518583
stdio	fflush
and you ll better use fflush inside your recursive function at least during the debugging phase since stdio is buffered

47521551
accelerometer	gyroscope
so the sensor registers two i2c addresses one for the pressure temperature and one for the accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope

47521551
accelerometer	gyroscope
this particular sensor registers two addresses 0x77 and 0x68 which i check with i2cdetect but consulting the code it has a particular address for the gyroscope and accelerometer and a separate one for the magnetometer 0xd0 0x18 again which should be the same

however if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields these can also be used by the subclassing

47537306
int	double
but if the int part is larger than the maximum 64-bit int it s not that simple and you need to convert biginteger to float double which hardware doesn t support

47537306
int	double
but if the int part is very large all 53 mantissa bits of the double might already be determined by the int part

47537306
range	infinity
but a robust library function can t do that because creating a temporary value many times larger than the final result means it will overflow to + - infinity for some inputs that are within the range that double can represent

47537306
integer	fractions
handling the integer and fractions part separately avoids the overflow problem

47537306

because you typedef node as what you are passing into add_end as the first parameter is a double pointer to struct node like

47540389
typedef	struct
when you pass node with your typedef you are only passing a single pointer to struct node representing head which means that dereferencing it will not give you the pointer to head but the structure itself which means that neither your if or else statements will work as intended as your intent is to compare pointers

when copying a long double 1 all of gcc clang and icc generate fld and fstp instructions with tbyte memory operands

47541077
clang	icc
compiles to the same assembly with fld fstp as previously shown for gcc and icc but clang now uses

47541077
int	double
oddly if you stuff an additional int member into the struct which double its size to 32 bytes due to alignment all compilers generate sse-only copy code

47541096
width	height
requires a few lines of javascript to set the dimensions of the #screen element to match the #navigation element - this could be avoided if the width height position of the #screen element was known in advance

47541096
google-chrome	safari
will only work in browsers supporting the backdrop-filter property - mainly safari or in google-chrome with the experimental web platform features flag enabled which you can set by going to google-chrome flags #enable-experimental-web-platform-features in google-chrome

however i can not find a way for my zoomed image to increase insize in between pixels as my float values must be converted into int before image resize this creates a jittery effect where image scales up by pixel every 3 or 4 frames sometimes height and width separately as opposed to a smooth anti aliasing scale where in between pixels can be used and scaling occurs frame by frame no matter how small the increment up like a texture on 3d game

typedef	struct
clearly you could automate the typedefing as c++ has done and thereby lose the possibility of having a perhaps unrelated book and struct book in the same scope but i guess that not automating it makes the grammar perhaps neater because then if you don t use typedef s at all you ve got a basically context-free grammar whereas with typedef s explicit or implicit a context of currently valid typedef types has to be maintained by the parser

i have 3 art exhibit pages i m trying to configure for printing at their maximum size without stretching them of course and centered at the top center of the page in both landscape and portrait printing modes on letter sized paper but global paper-type compatibility would be a nice feature too

47558964
portrait	landscape
also as respects all of the exhibit images i do not want to stretch the image bigger than it s original size i just want it to have the freedom to expand automatically to fill most of not all considering the desired 1 inch margins of the paper in both portrait and landscape print-modes

47558964
portrait	landscape
in other words i want the image to expand and contract dynamically via css when the user switches between landscape and portrait modes in print-preview respectively while staying perfectly centered and never stretching beyond it s natural size

47558985
dictionary	map
since this map is a dictionary it needs to be unique

47559054
google-chrome	firefox
i can do this just fine for google-chrome and firefox

47559070
google-chrome	firefox
apparently there is absolutely no knowledge of this problem anywhere not even on the github so i just said forget google-chrome and stuck with firefox because it actually works

47559090
lisp	scheme
questions should be tagged with the hygiene tag when they involve both macro expansions and name collisions which means that only specific programming languages using macros are concerned like c lisp scheme etc.

47559099
typedef	struct
course is typedef as a pointer you need to reserve space for the whole struct not for a pointer to it change to

47559100
button	checkbox
a form with some textareas and a sumbit button are all disabled each of textarea has a checkbox aside

47559153
width	height
if you truly want a 100 dynamic canvas that will match the users screen exactly you will need to get their window s width and height

47559153
width	height
you will also need to use the height and width in your drawing calculations to make sure you are placing objects in the correct part of the screen to the correct size

47559153
width	height
optionally you could just set the canvas width and height to an acceptably high level for large screens and then allow it just to be squished down for smaller screens

47559233
queue	fifo
instead of since 2 was technically enqueued before 6 and in the case of items having the same priority they need to follow the fifo structure of queue

47559237
hash	md5
above command is the md5 hash of the site s url

47559265
versioning	upgrade
read their docs to see how to upgrade the versioning of ts used to transpile the file

47559267
google-chrome	firefox
i get the same error with the latest builds of google-chrome and firefox

47559310
google-chrome	firefox
because you have firefox instead of firefox - you are probably having it launch the second instance of google-chrome

47559324
google-chrome	firefox
i have been testing my site on google-chrome and firefox and everything works fine

47559324
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it works fine

47559324
google-chrome	firefox
the weird part is it works fine google-chrome and firefox

47559324
google-chrome	firefox
why would jquery work fine in google-chrome firefox android ios but not in ie

47559341
hide	show
how do i approach the show hide to control parent-child level display

47559350
jsch	openssh
in my case only updating jsch to latest version currently 1.50 fixed the issue seems there was an incompatibility in key auth handshake with older versions of jsch in combination with latest openssh version 7.1.x

i want to open a google site in safari webview or a google-chrome custom tab with the already signed in user

47559389
n-gram	words
the stop words removal will not affect your n-gram

47559417
viewdidload	viewdidappear
is it common practice to have this code live in both of those methods viewdidload and viewdidappear

47559417
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
tasks that need to happen when the view is first created should be done in viewdidload and tasks that need to happen every time a view appears should happen in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

47559429
width	height
once you change the height of a row or the width of a column that change happens across the entire line

47559483
n-gram	words
set analyzer to words for outputting words and phrases or set it to char to output character n-gram

47559483
n-gram	words
answer stop words are removed short characters are removed then n-gram are generated which can return unexpected results

47559709
vsts	tfs
i thought that maybe it wasn t supported because it wasn t a .net core application or because i m using tfs and not vsts

47559725
width	height
if this app can rotate you might need two sets of constraints one for when the width is less than the height the other for when the height is less than the width

47559733
scenekit	arkit
just started playing around with scenekit arkit

47559757

junit	mockito
i need a junit with mockito test class for the below rest service class

47559819
min	max
alternatively just cache everything in a temp table with a sequence # as a key and then kill the min and the max

47559829
temp	tmp
in azure app service you can still rely on tmp to find the temp folder

47559925
pyenv	virtualenv
pyenv seems to be used often where virtualenv is used but i would stay away from it also since i think virtualenv also does what pyenv is built for

47559925
folder	directory
you don t need sudo permissions to create virtual environments or install libraries since virtual environment library installs don t leak files outside their folder which is within your user directory tree

47559925
pyenv	virtualenv
pyenv is similar to virtualenv in that it lets you manage multiple python environments

47559945
charindex	substr
i tried with substr and charindex functions but was unable to get the desired result

47559961
versioning	upgrade
also is it a common practice for organizations to upgrade to a newer versioning of a package like node.js or wait until the official repository has been updated

47559991

i m doing a test with mailgun and i copy the example and put my domain and password but it s not going and i do not get the mail either

47560186
innodb	myisam
the tables are using innodb and not myisam

47560198
stdio	fflush
i still prefer exit because it would fflush the stdio buffers and run atexit 3 -registered handlers

47560198
execvp	fork
there are few occasions where that could be useful since most of the time your working directory is listable then sudo is useless and in that case you could even use opendir 3 readdir 3 with stat 2 so no need to fork then execvp the bin ls program

47560198
g++	gcc
btw you should compile with all warnings and debug info g++ -wall -wextra -g with gcc and use the debugger gdb and perhaps strace 1 and valgrind 1

stdout is captured into your variable stderr is printed

47560476
debian	linux
i am getting this error on debian linux

47560500
vsts	tfs
my understanding is that tfs has this reporting capability but vsts does not have it built in

47560512
getter	setter
you need to have both getter and setter in your pojo for the inner map

47560512
getter	setter
if you don t want to change pojo implementation for some reason you can setup jackson to use private fields and not getter setter something like this how to specify jackson to only use fields - preferably globally

47560515
width	height
if i understand correct in the gridlayout there are two columns that occupy exactly half the width of the screen and and there are three row that split the height into three equal parts

47560878
xlsx	xlsm
how can i change the format from xlsm to xlsx

47560878
xlsx	xlsm
i need a script that will save a copy of the xlsm file with xlsx extension but doesn t ask user to input file name it needs to keep the original name the only thing the user needs to do is select where to save the file

47560883
filtering	grouping
i m not sure if it would be best to do some sort of grouping filtering or matching or if i need to create a new list that splits the first bit of date by decimal into a list which would look like 25 803 1 1 for an example and then try indexing it based upon what the user inputs somehow

47560888
lisp	scheme
if scheme comes from lisp which is a list programming language then how come they don t have built-in loops or are there loops and i m unaware

47560899
subtract	add
every time you get a good day add 1 to that flag and subtract 1 if not

47560916
ocaml	scheme
because scheme and also ocaml requires tail-calls and the r5rs specification requires the scheme implementation to properly provide them this is false for java and c

essentially what i want is to give heatmap my dendrogram that i made from an hclust function and have it order the samples in that order with the dendrogram above and then plot the relative abundances in the heatmap

47561017
hide	show
it ll then iterate through and hide show them

47561056
min	max
i was wandering that is possible to use lagrange multipliers for finding max min of some function with two or more equality constraint

47561117
multiplying	add
with ios10 you can now use uigraphicsimagerenderer to add a partial multiplying effect as easy as this

47561124

i was trying to get some practice with docker and wanted to put my worker code in a docker container then put that container on a set of remote machines and have the master run on my local machine

47561129
min	max
and i want to make it numeric so i can calculate mean min and max

47561158
countif	sumifs
you asked for another approach the formulas countif and sumifs can eliminate the nesting

47561158
multiplying	subtraction
i don t know if it is simpler but maybe you or someone else could make an optimization here maybe using your method of multiplying or maybe there is a way to put an and statement to eliminate the subtraction and the abs

47561158
countif	sumifs
edit you can use countif and sumifs as the first comment stated

47561195

47561256
versioning	upgrade
note that you can upgrade all of your packages or just one specific package as well as update to the latest versioning of a package or a specific versioning of a package

47561274
ssl	socks
in your specific case you are using ssl inside the socks connection which means that the application data will be encrypted the same way as without socks proxy if you use ssl properly strong ciphers proper server authentication it will also be strongly protected when using a socks proxy

47561274
ssl	socks
if instead you fail in doing ssl correctly like not validating the servers certificate properly socks will not help to protect the data

47561274
ssl	socks
instead the operator of the socks server might in this case easily man-in-the-middle your insecure ssl connection since he is alreafy in the right position in the network to do this

47561290
keras	tensorflow
for future visitors if you use keras and tensorflow as backend then you can try the following example

47561353
subtract	add	subtract	addition
in addition to characters you can add or subtract lines eg end-1line and you can get the start or end of a word or line eg end-1c linestart represents the first character of the last line in the widget

versioning	upgrade
recently upgrade to win 10 same versioning of cr i had prior

47561407
portrait	landscape
eventually i found that targeting just the iphone x sized screen with css media queries for both landscape and portrait did the trick

47561407
width	height
the width and height pixel values needed to be declared as important in order for the iphone to accept them

47561412

both packages are the newest versions-- ggplot2 2.2.1 and cowplot 0.9.1

47561463

sorting	filtering
on the client-side i need to have sorting on every column header and filtering based on a dropdown option

47561579

i like this solution in whole but i have to pass class into the superclass constructor because if i use class inside datacontainer it doesn t see any members of subclassing

47561612
post	get
both these examples return an empty response body for a post and return foo for get

47561612

getter	setter
also add setter and getter methods to your person class

47561698
width	height
i wanted to set the height of the images dynamically based on some calculations including the width of the image tag

47561698
width	height
as i wrote to calculate the height of the image i use the width of the image - how i can access the dom element the image tag in order to calculate the height based on the width of the element

47561716

47561792
int	double
comparing dates to datetimes timestamps is similar to comparing an int to a double in that the implicit conversion applies to the less precise value

47561817
prometheus	grafana
grafana can then query prometheus to generic graphics and alerts

47561817
prometheus	metrics
as the documentation cites prometheus unlike other metrics storage systems uses a debatable pull model

47561817
prometheus	metrics
thus the spring boot application must expose a metrics end-point that the prometheus server can pull from default is metrics

47561817
prometheus	metrics	pull	push
thus there is much documentation available on google but that is the arguably convoluted topology - along with arguments from the soundcloud and prometheus folks as to why a pull model is preferred over push as every other metrics framework employs

47561828
post	get
since i don t post any code as evidence of my own efforts i don t expect to get something completely working

47561832
width	height
according to firefox s inspector the custom component is about 25x20 so setting 100 width and height does not change anything

47561839
maven	pom.xml
additionally the projects in this company are created using some pre-defined maven archetypes that will create a custom folder structure for all the software components as well as the creation of the pom.xml with all the required dependencies using those dependencies is a must so i cannot remove any of them just add

47561860
range	minimum
this representation basically says find the smallest index in the list range len l but based on the value at that index not the index itself means that the minimum will be computed based on instead of just index

47561899
int	chars
this seems likely intended as a way to save memory by using a chars member instead of an int member for tok yet this would only have an impact in severely memory-constrained environments or where many such commands structs are used

so after after a lot of research the my music folder is a directory junction point by windows

47561950
children	parent
...actually assuming only two layers parent and children no grandchildren the parent id does not need to be less than the childs

47561950
children	parent
this orders by the parent id if there is one first then whether the row had a parent and then the final id is only necessary if you want to guarantee the order of the children cannot not change from one execution of the query to the next

for purposes of this question please assume that the width of the image is unknown so adding a left margin or padding is not really an option as far as i can see

47561993
int	boolean
i always thought that a function can only return a value that is the same type int boolean ... as the type specifier

if your not using visual studios you will have to get into a little java script to return users screen height and width

47562773
subtract	add
i can t seem to add and subtract into the balance of the code

47562783

width	height
take the width and height from the getsystemmetrics32 calls and divide

47562803

watch the version to make sure the api required nativemessaging google-chrome firefox actually exists in your version

i understand 3-way in anova probably we would do a simple effect analysis but i am not sure how should i deal with 3 way interaction in regression

47564318
int	double
another thing is that i don t think it is a good idea to use double to represent some amount of memory even though it might not generate a compilation error it might possibly lead to issues with precision rounding when you allocate just a couple bytes too little and thus invoke a segmentation fault if you need to represent discrete entities such as a size of a block of memory or length of an array int types are the logical choice

children	parent
similarly if a parent has a status of disabled then all children should be implicitly disabled as well

that way if a parent was disabled a trigger updated all children accordingly
