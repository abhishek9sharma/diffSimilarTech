the intellisense only gives me equals gethashcode gettype and tostring as options

1100086
itunes	iphoto
i m thinking about something along the lines of itunes or iphoto where the program manages a whole bunch of files in those cases audio or image files and has a database of metadata so you can organize find those files easily

1100090
integer	unsigned
i am looking for a fast integer only algorithm to find the square root integer part thereof of an unsigned integer

1100096
post	get
the only problem with this is that you re doing a get instead of a post but that s easy to get around

1100109
wadl	wsdl
using soap we can use wsdl but does ror implement wadl or wsdl 2.0 for restful services

uiview	subviews	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller from a uiview that is a subviews of the uiviewcontroller mentioned

1100240
mouse	keyboard
depending on your mouse software you should be able to map those keyboard shortcuts to your mouse s back forward buttons

1100243
irix	linux
edit ah irix not linux

1100285
keydown	keyup
is it absolutely necessary to track down every keyboard notification keydown and keyup events

1100315
onkeyup	onkeydown
use document.onkeypress or the siblings onkeydown and onkeyup

1100319
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome so you begin with a solid base

1100356
postgresql	mysql
i m starting a new opensource project for real estate and wanted to focus on using mysql but would also like to ensure it works in postgresql

1100393
post	get
if you handle post and get data identically then no it doesn t

1100400
post	get
it does if a search engine is crawling the page since they will be making get requests but not post

1100403
post	get
but there are situations where you more or less have to use post instead of get at least for pushing data to the server

1100406
post	get
the client side also matter - as mentioned you cannot bookmark a post d page usually and some browsers have limits on the length of the url for really long get queries

1100409
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 2 and firefox 3.5 do and i assume other browsers as well

1100409
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari

1100412
union	distinct
i m sorry that i m not able to understand exactly what your issue is but i wonder if your issue stems from the fact that the union operator will eliminate duplicate rows kind of like a select distinct over the combined query

1100423
post	put	post	get	put	get
it works for put as well as post and get

1100424
twig	smarty
there are other template engines such as smarty twig etc. that make the syntax even more concise

1100433
post	get
according to the http rfc get should not have any side-effects while post may have side-effects

1100433
post	get
the most basic example of this is that get is not appropriate for anything like a purchase-transaction or posting an article to a blog while post is appropriate for actions-that-have-consequences

1100433
post	get
by the rfc you can hold a user responsible for actions done by post such as a purchase but not for get actions

1100433
post	put
methods such as post put and

1100436
ilist	icollection
however if a class does not provide a value for the contentpropertyattribute and implements any interface of type ilist or icollection a property of name items if present and if of appropriate type ilist is detected trough reflection automatically for the purpose of population trough xaml and that is the case with the class

1100446
post	get
be aware that browsers may cache get requests but will generally not cache post requests

1100454
post	get
by http specifications get is safe and idempotent and post is neither

1100454
post	put
the funny thing is that most people debate the merits of put v post

1100454
post	get
the get v post issue is and always has been very well settled

1100455
pop-up	dialog
more specifically in the image editor dialog accessed from the image property of an existing control i select select from file resource... to pop-up the select resource dialog shown

1100461
filtering	grouping
in the case where it is not filtering the elements are grouping by the value of that condition - the condition is calculated once

1100465
post	get
get versus post in terms of security

1100470
post	get
get and post are quite different really

1100470
post	get
you are right in that normally get is for getting data from the server and displaying a page while post is for posting data back to the server

1100470
post	get
internally your scripts get the same data whether it s get or post so no the server doesn t really care

1100470
post	get
the main difference is get parameters are specified in urls while post is not

1100492
post	get
all get does is post the stuff in the first line of the http request and post post stuff in the body

1100492
post	get
ie a post processes the information then redirects the browser to a get statement to view the new state

1100539
uiview	subviews
these subviews you re talking about are perfect candidates for extraction from your one monolithic uiview

1100543
union	distinct
the two select statements are distinct from each other even though the results are joined together by the union

1100546
public	protected
i know in c# what restrictions access modifiers like private public protected etc

1100552
filtering	grouping
another solution i realized would work is to revers the ordering of my query and perform the grouping before i perform the filtering

1100553
itextsharp	sharppdf
here s the shortlist itextsharp sharppdf report.net nfop and siberix report writer

1100554
union	distinct
the two queries you are union together must be separate and distinct

1100563
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my xcode sdk to versioning 3.1.3 and my iphone os to 3.0

1100569
public	protected
until you discover that it needs to be promoted to protected or public

1100648
pop-up	dialog
are you also reloading the partial via ajax when the dialog pop-up

1100748
visualvm	hprof
to analyse a hprof memory dump you can use quite a number of tools such as eclipse memory analyzer included with eclipse 3.5 galileo visualvm or netbeans

1100797
innodb	myisam
depending on your database storage engine innodb myisam etc you may be able to lock the table while a person is modifing it

1100800
udp	tcp
i work on a product that supports both udp ip and tcp ip communication between client and server

1100800
udp	tcp
wild guess coming up the udp to tcp code ratio is probably about 80 20

1100800
udp	tcp
we have extra overhead with the udp communications because we have some of the same stuff that you get for free with tcp ip checksums sequence numbers etc.

1100800
udp	tcp
for example wireshark showed that a request for the next set of records was 80 bytes with udp and 84 bytes with tcp

1100803
int	chars
this is done in delphi 5 where pchar is chars alias and i simply cast it as int int in delphi

1100817
mockups	balsamiq
start with visualizing the project in something like balsamiq mockups so that you can see how each piece of the puzzle will come together

1100844
inherited	properties
i would like to create a simple control that inherited from headeredcontentcontrol and has some basic dependency properties called title subtitle icon

1100866
versioning	upgrade
functionality that should be in a nice library where it can be easily upgrade with each new versioning of the framework is instead spewed out in generated model and controller code where it ll end up intermixed with your code

1100868
udp	tcp
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

1100910
metaphone	soundex
you should also investigate metaphone or soundex but to support that you will need to pre-index your data in a separate table or pre-calc the methaphone or soundex codes for each word in a separate field and index that as well

1100970
width	height
gotoafter 1 gotor oauthtwitter gotop action 3dwindowend oauthtwitterrequest menubar yes location yes resizable yes scrollbars yes status yes width 800 height 400

1100976
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if the model already implements inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged what s wrong with the view binding directly against the model

1100998
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged are not the only aspects to be considered.

1101020
getter	setter
it turns out that i had some properties tagged as datamember that had getter but no setter

1101023
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere 3.5 failed on me a long time ago while tomcat would propagate the message just fine

1101050
getter	setter
if you consider properties as getter and setter i don t believe it will break encapsulation

1101057
gendarme	mono.cecil
gendarme does some code metrics sort of with the help of mono.cecil perhaps it would help with what you are trying to accomplish

1101069
post	get
writing a suite of iis hosted wcf webservices both get and post and i need to be able to read a cookie for an authentication token so i know the user has been auth d previously

1101072
width	height
say the height and width is to be laid out in 3 bytes each with some id and length for the wire format you make something like

1101083
inherited	properties
this will give you the count 3 message when you hover over an instance of your inherited list in visual studio and a view of the items in the list when you expand the root node without having to drill down into the base properties

1101088
goto	break
break understands the semantics of the block scope while goto is oblivious to it

1101129
public	protected
is it possible to restrict an attribute usage to just protected and public variables

1101171
boost	stl
you should consider avoiding c-style file i o entirely and using c++ streams and boost serialization library instead - it supports stl collections out of the box

1101212
width	height
in wpf if the user control has a default width or height the user control won t strech even if you use the enumeration for stretching

1101212
width	height
the solution was to remove from the usercontrol xaml the default width and height and the control behaved the way it should

1101213
width	height
by default usercontrols explicitly set their width and height properties

1101213
width	height
with the height and width explicitly set the usercontrol won t respond to attributes like horizontalcontentalignment

1101217
integer	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
this one goes beyond just the integer result and calculates extra fractions fixed-point bits of the answer

1101259
ienumerable	ienumerator
fundamentally all an ienumerable promises is that it can return an ienumerator which itself provides a simple contract that happens to have a fancy language construct to make it easy to use foreach

1101265
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
as a quick answer i would say change memberexception to an unchecked-exception extends runtimeexception and see if you get the same results

1101272
elf	dwarf
any recommendations for a good cross-platform library for reading elf file debug information in dwarf format

1101298
ubuntu	debian
specifically ubuntu debian

1101305
daemons	launchd
i have a pair of launchd daemons one of which is a true daemons runs as root and one of which is a gui agent that runs as a per gui session basis session type aqua

1101360
stdout	stderr
do i have to do this and bind the stdout stderr somehow to a newly created console page or is there another way

1101377
spaces	delimiter
you could take the beginning delimiter of the match and the string length and use that to append the correct number of spaces but i don t see the point

1101380
hide	show
rather than having this feature fail when it is used and then show an appropriate error message to the user i d prefer an ability to silently check if root is available first and if not hide the respective options in the first place

1101397
emacs	aquamacs
as a long-time emacs user i would recommand against exotic versions of emacs aquamacs falls in this catagory but this starter kit thing as well and let me try to explain why just for the sake of finger-training and brain-training also

1101406
postgresql	mysql
let me see if i understand your point but starting your hsqldb you can consider as a normal database like mysql postgresql

1101414
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
where applicable you should throw exceptions of the correct type eg argumentnullexception or invalidoperationexception in .net

1101424
emacs	aquamacs
for the subset of emacs that i use there s very little difference between using aquamacs and gnu emacs on a linux box

1101458
super	implements
if it is not implements in x check in the super class

1101462
super	extends
in one of my projects my pom extends that super pom and i would like to add an additional resource

1101462
super	extends
is there a way to extends the super pom s resources

1101475
rss	feed
oh also remember to export your rss feed before you upgrade

1101515
folder	directory	config	ini
the last time i had that kind of problem i made an include directory out of my public_http root folder and added its path to the include_path ini config

1101518
portrait	landscape
is there a way to get the mail compose window to appear in landscape rather than portrait

1101537
maven	pom.xml
remember that your super pom.xml is inheriting from maven s default pom.xml and pretty much any plugin that you define in your pom.xml effectively overrides the setting in the default pom.xml

1101580
firefox	safari
firefox safari will work just fine but ie will fail to set a cookie if it comes from a domain with an underscore

1101599
int	double
conversion to and from int float double

1101632
portrait	landscape
my app has to switch to portrait mode sometimes because the uiimagepickercontroller doesn t work in landscape mode so i use the following code in my view to re-set up landscape mode.

1101637
min	max
it shouldn t be too difficult to screenshot and extract the necessary graphics to create your own nearly-identical min and max track images

1101642
public	protected
the getresourcefilename method is protected so we will have to wrap it in a public method to expose it to the outside world

1101663
gprof	shark
the general consensus over the past few years seems to be that apple would rather you use shark instead and they ve been very lax about fixing bugs and such with gprof

1101686
class-method	delegation
you ll need to keep a reference back to the app delegation object in your mainviewcontroller - currently you re only dealing with static class-method

1101706
cvs	svn
we are currently determining if we would move cvs and vss projects to a single svn server

1101706
cvs	svn
i ve been using svn for a long time now but is forced to use cvs and vss for work stuff

1101706
cvs	svn
and also what the benefits of moving from cvs to svn would be

1101706
cvs	svn
and is there a way to preserve the histories of the vss and cvs when moving to svn

1101716
cvs	svn
there are tools to convert cvs history to svn and other tools to migrate vss history - so you can use them in your case of moving to a better system

1101716
cvs	svn
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

1101721
cvs	svn
svn versus cvs is simple

1101721
cvs	svn
svn was developed as a new software to be used instead of cvs to correct some issues with cvs

1101724
rss	feed
i m writing some ruby on rails code to parse rss atom feed

1101741
nhibernate	llblgenpro
nhibernate works very well with oracle in my experiences as does llblgenpro not free but has a reasonably priced per-developer license for the entity mapping designer

1101830
cvs	svn
there are many reasons to upgrade to svn from cvs

1101830
cvs	svn
the biggest benefit of svn over cvs has to be true autonomous commits

1101830
cvs	svn
we used the open source tool cvs2svn to pull over all our cvs projects to svn

1101853
cvs	svn
my usage history is vss -- cvs -- svn

1101888
post	get
looking around i can t name a single web application not web service that uses anything besides get and post requests

1101907
post	put
the way it works for browser applications is people design restful applications with put and delete in mind then tunnel those requests through post from the browser

1101907
post	put
edit by the way if you re curious about why put delete are missing from browser based form post it turns out there s no real good technical reason

1101920
implements	extends
in the jsp world the extends functionality is not part of vanilla jsp and is implements using third-party libraries sitemesh or tiles

1101921
post	get
quite simply the html 4.01 form element only allows the values post and get in its method attribute

1101923
vb.net	vb6
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

1102004
entity-relationship	diagram
an excellent technique you can use is called entity-relationship diagram

1102004
entity-relationship	diagram
a very useful rule-of-thumb to remember when using entity-relationship diagram is that most of the time almost always a box in the entity-relationship diagram is a table in the database

1102049
int	chars
we re using the same amount of memory in both cases 4 byte int s vs 4 byte chars arrays so it can t be an issue of padding

1102129
mockups	balsamiq
for web design wireframes i would suggest balsamiq mockups - it is great for doing rough sketches and most of the functionality is available in the free version you can also get a free license in some cases

1102130
post	put
the restlet java framework lets you tunnel put and delete requests through html post operations

1102131
accessor	properties
is the customerwrapper collection stored in a field or do i create customerwrapper instances on the fly in the get accessor of a properties maybe

1102141
spaces	delimiter
you need a spaces between delimiter and

1102143
int	boolean
if you need a array of boolean i suggest using an int or several int then use mask and bit wise operations to access modify flip each bit depending on number of your chromosomes

1102146
spaces	delimiter
as an argument to the delimiter command so not having the spaces there may be confusing it

1102170
textarea	textbox
if you look at the editor here in so you write normal text inside a textarea and it is then transformed in the box below it so you ll see the asterix inside the textbox but in the box below it ll transform special characters by regexing them with tags

1102206
mockups	balsamiq
for cheap free web design i d go with balsamiq mockups

1102209
pull	push
you can push and pull specific branches too so that no one ever need know you re working on both of them at the same time

1102216
width	height
ps i m aware that the substance laf allows to scale the font size at runtime but that way only the height of my controls are scaled not the width

1102245
factories	presenter
so we created factories crating pair of view and presenter which is matched to given id string or guid

1102253
post	get
here is a blog post telling you how to get your background images working for the body

1102306
hex	binary
any such apis which do exist will almost certainly be doing the encode to a byte array perform appropriate binary operation decode opaque binary data to hex base64

1102306
hex	binary
that makes me wonder whether it wouldn t be worth writing a utility class which could take an encoding a and an output format such as hex base64 - that could represent an arbitrary binary operation applied to a string.

1102322
daemon	cron
with background_job the worker was kept running via cron so there was no daemon management

1102326
setinterval	settimeout
as for timers if you re using settimeout or setinterval as far as i know they aren t considered references either

1102336
subtract	add
so if you just add and subtract for example without doing anything which would skew the range of digits required too much adding a very very big number to a very very small number you will end up with easily comparable results

1102369
maven	pom.xml
i saw this question and it motivated me to look again without success at maven configurations for an alternative way of declaring configuration so it is appended to the parent pom.xml s config instead of overriding it

1102369
maven	pom.xml
in a maven pom.xml if configuration declares the same elements as in the parent it overrides the parents configuration

1102389
apache	nginx
this is because some of my apps use _server server_name and it does not have the same meaning in nginx as in apache

1102425
innodb	myisam
also make sure you are using innodb tables - myisam is not optimized for writes

1102456
consistency	acid
acid - atomicity consistency isolation and durability

1102470
explode	implode
if it s always the first part of the domain regardless of whether its www you could use explode implode

1102470
explode	implode
explode implode 2.472

1102515
postgresql	mysql
it supports mysql postgresql and oracle

1102520
folder	directory
concerning source files my project directory structure is flat no source code is in sub folder this is the default when you manage code with xcode only

1102526
width	height
for a div to scroll it must have at least a height and or a width specified depending on which dimension you want it to scroll through

1102562
post	get
the form data is send in either the url get or the http message body post

1102619
width	height
i can only draw rect in integers to a region in integers the width and height and top left point of x y are all integers

1102728
google-chrome	firefox
i came up with the following code which works just fine in ie and google-chrome but not in firefox

1102804
mp3	wav
is there a simple way to convert mp3 to wav in vb2005

1102815
post	get
don t use a post request to get the next page as it looks like you might be unless you are just using the wrong terminology

1102819
min	max
using a regular min a and max a query would be too slow on large tables

1102820
cifs	smb
i want to know if there is any free tool to test the performance of a smb cifs network share

1102835
folder	directory
traverse a large unix directory path file folder structure

1102846
solaris	bsd
document good if you make an assumption about the user s platform if you test for win mac linux only will your code crash on bsd or solaris

1102867
client-side	server-side
whilst it s true that asp.net webforms do use a certain amount of client-side code to do their work this is mostly related to communicating ui events to the server-side so that they can be processed

1102904
codeigniter	cakephp
i am developing a web app with cakephp with oracle backend on windows box the development was initially done in codeigniter and recently we decided to migrate to cakephp

1102911
min	max
if you index the column then min a and max a should be very fast as in this example where t1 has 50000 rows and is indexed on object_id

1102911
min	max
the result is the same if you select the max instead of the min

1102911
min	max
however if you select the min and max in a single select statement the result is different

1102940
inherited	properties
you re adding a properties to addition.prototype so you keep main s inherited display function

1102945
onfocus	onblur
using the onfocus and onblur events allows you to achieve this i.e.

1102956
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception extend runtimeexception and do not need to be declared or caught

1102960
mouse	keyboard
on top of this unless you are dictating prose to the computer any other type of input is easier and quicker using keyboard mouse or touch

1102970
qunit	jsunit
i know how to use qunit and jsunit but i want to try and get vs to run these tests and integrate the results into my build process

1103052
maven	pom.xml
the problem is with maven we have to specify versions in all the pom.xml files

1103089
uiview	subviews
the thing is that the frame property on the view is set twice possibly causing even more double work if your custom uiview is doing some advanced layout in the setframe method placing and resizing subviews for example

1103116
hash	md5
included are the fips secure hash algorithms sha1 and md5

1103119
config	ini
now i wondering is there other ways to winapp store config data and to that still be in one nice and accepted ways i looked at ini files but it seems to me like an old app and i considering can i just open app.config as xmldocument and than use xpath to read and write my values

1103231
versioning	upgrade
i m sure there are a lot of people out there that have no idea that their software can be upgrade and i know there are lots of people who hardly ever connect their device to itunes so i would be sure to at least still test with versioning 2.2 and upwards

1103250
versioning	upgrade
when you deploy to the app store you will need to specify what versioning you app is and users who have not upgrade to 3.0 will not be able to install your app

1103262
hash	salt
i have a django-based site not yet launched so there are no real users using plain django.contrib.auth and want to store passwords as plain-text not salt sha-1 hash

1103293
ubuntu	linux
on my linux system ubuntu jaunty i have python 2.5 2.6 and 3.0 installed just by installing the binary deb packages python2.5 python2.6 and python3.0 using apt-get

1103353
int	boolean
in a sql view i have 5 boolean variables and one int variable

1103379
subtract	add
it s all maths and unless you start using add and subtract operators too it starts to look a little inconsistent

1103435
instances	transient
nhibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

1103447
vim	emacs
i typically ssh to another computer to do my development using vim don t post use emacs please

1103488
postgresql	mysql
how would one configure postgresql instead of mysql to run artifactory

1103520
bitblt	gdi
for example in gdi bitblt is handled directly by hardware

1103562
folder	directory
after having done make to compile python 3.x just move the python folder somewhere and create a symlink to the python executable in your bin directory

1103578
put	get
put a retain on the image view so it doesn t get deallocated before the image is downloaded and cancel the download if the view is not visible anymore

1103629
sorting	filtering
should sorting and filtering of data be performed using the user s locale or the data s

sorting	filtering
can anyone think of examples that require the use of the data s locale for sorting or filtering

1103692
cvs	svn
the traditional svn structure as inherited from cvs is to have trunk branches and tags sitting in side the main project directory

1103695
getter	setter
a property is an interface consisting of two or one for readonly methods made public by the object namely the getter and setter methods in this case

1103758
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you have a many-to-many relationship with extra data such as nickname then you would model that as two one-to-many relationships

1103831
spaces	delimiter
oh yes and please note if you re using a mixture of classes on any element the above function will return them all delimiter by a spaces like you d define in the html class attribute. if you want to check if a particular class exists do this

1103863
width	height
the window size must not exceed the limit of 720px in height and 1280 in width

1103864
vim	emacs
this is also a good reason for learning vim even if you use emacs as your main editor

1103864
emacs	textmate
for example if you are used to textmate then you may be tempted to map lots of functions to complex 5 key chords of keys but in the long run it is much easier to go with the long sequences of commands that emacs tends towards

1103893
punctuation	words
if you re looking for a number make sure that they only put in numbers if they are inputing a words make sure no punctuation is available

1103909
bazaar	git
i find myself using git branches much more often than i used to do with bazaar specially because my repo is not small and also involves binary files total 180mb

1103932
ncover	partcover
code coverage both ncover and partcover work fine

1103942
cpu	affinity
if you decide that you need specify the core that a particular thread can run on the os will generally provide a mechanism set the thread s affinity to a specific cpu

1103971
itertools	functools
really whether using python 2.x or python 3.x list comprehensions map itertools operator and to a slightly lesser extend functools are my friends

1104003
width	height
it takes an object for the cornerradius value rather than setting ellipse width and height values

1104003
width	height
i m not 100 sure that the cornerradius value isn t converted into ellipse width and height but it seems like it d be something to try

1104063
children	parent
my problem was that i was never explicitly setting the parent reportcriteriabean in the children pkvisits

1104086
postgresql	mysql
included are sample connection strings for sqlite mysql and postgresql

1104106
post	get
as long as you know that dinner.rsvps will be the same on the post as the get i m confident of this in my code then using the rsvp.id will work

1104139
put	get
the main point is that people tend to use the same password over and over again and therefore using plaintext in your site you put your users at risks for an attacker to get to their bank account

1104154
post	get
like in the onsubmit event change the method of a form from get to post

1104171
try-catch	exception-handling
the only way to solve this is to wrap the thrown exception-handling in a try-catch block

1104186
jobs	cron
then just execute these rake tasks with a cron job at whatever interval you require i use whenever to manage these jobs because i m slightly cron-illiterate

1104221
versioning	upgrade
i can only presume the versioning numbers refer to something of significance inside of sqlserver but i m having trouble believing that there have been that many releases patches upgrade to sqlserver since 2000

1104227
pdfsharp	migradoc
i am using pdfsharp migradoc to write tables and charts to pdf files

1104227

please note that i am using pdfsharp migradoc for the first time

1104231
ant	maven
use a build tool to build your application maven ant .

1104256
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the global config for isapi_rewrite 3 is called httpd.conf and per-site distributed configurations are .htaccess

1104264
firefox	safari
i ve put together a small function that yields results in both firefox 2+ and safari 3+ but apparently doesn t even register in ie 7

1104264
firefox	safari
again this works in firefox and safari but has no effect on the same divs in ie

1104265
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome all methods work properly

1104278
mouse	keyboard
i want to trap windows mouse and keyboard input with the help of event given by windows for detecting system idle or not in c++

1104278
mouse	keyboard
anyone can tell me if windows event to trap the mouse and keyboard input is available or not.

1104322
postgresql	mysql
i was having similar problems with mysql and postgresql but no problems with sqllite

1104322
postgresql	mysql
this is how i solved the problem with postgresql didnt test this trick with mysql but id asume it would solve it as well

1104344
mouseover	mouseenter
i have always used the mouseover event but while reading the jquery documentation i found mouseenter

1104344
mouseout	mouseleave
also applies for mouseout vs mouseleave

1104350
mysqlimport	mysqladmin
pl mysqld_safe mysqladmin mysqlshow mysql_tzinfo_to_sql mysqltest mysqlbackup mysqld_multi mysql mysqldumpslow mysqlcheck mysql_upgrade mysqlimport comp_err mysqld myisamchk innochecksum

1104381
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
mouseenter and mouseleave do not react to event bubbling while mouseover and mouseout do

1104401
put	get
i want to get the text of every row and put that text into an array

1104418
superclass	subclassing
you do it all the time the outlet for the view in uiviewcontroller is defined in a superclass you subclassing for each of your view controllers

1104441
sorting	filtering
apple suggests subclassing nsarraycontroller in order to change sorting filtering behaviour

1104444
gridview	objectdatasource
gridview objectdatasource linq paging and sorting

1104455
min	max
i d have a separate table or storage area somewhere that stored the max min and sum values associated with each field in your original query and update those values every time i updated and added a table record

1104471
inherited	properties
i d say you make that an interface which you can inherited the properties

1104479
superclass	subclassing
as far as i know by reading the manuals the parameters of the primary constructor are also implicitly fields of the class so i would end with one array array double in the scala subclassing and another double in the java superclass which is pretty redundant

1104534
hide	show
it includes a menu option to hide show hidden files among many other useful features

1104535
width	height
when you have their position add it to half their width height and you will have the position of their center on the page

1104547
int	boolean
when i define columns in mysql i generally use int varchar 255 text and the occasional enum for boolean

1104571
int	chars
however you can easily get int representations of chars so you can compare chars like so

1104581
post	get
if you want to create a way to directly pass php commands and directions via ajax the only way i could see it is by using a php eval on code that is sent to it via post or get in jquery

1104601
accessor	properties
it raises an error error mc3080 the properties setter inputbindings cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

1104612
int	chars
you will have to use fixed column types like int and chars some size for text

1104695
superclass	subclassing
is it because the jvm knows that dosomething has a call to super.dosomething or because calling a subclassing method will always acquire a lock on the superclass as well

1104729
post	get
it can only cause the php file to run on the server via a post get call on x url

1104729
post	get
in other words instead of calling the php file update.php for example directly as simple examples show you can call a go-between file call it whatever you like ajax server ajax router etc that uses get post parameters you send to figuere out what method you want to use and what values to pass to it

1104735
rss	feed
i cannot guarantee how much content will be provided per rss feed item

1104756
centos	linux
on my linux centos 5 server php 5.2.10 runkit compiled by hand

1104767
serializable	deserialization
why not create a peer serializable object who s role is simply to support serializable deserialization

1104767
pull	push
the serializable class can either have methods on it that are used to push pull the real object in and out of serialization or you could use a separate data mapping class this might be better if you have serious versioning concerns

1104767
getter	setter
that way your main application object s are persistent ignorant and you don t have to make compromises - like public getter and setter and attributes - just to support serialization

1104786
subnet	packets
if your peer machines are on a different subnet and therefore traffic between you and the peer is passing through a router then there s no way to do what you want -- the mac address of the packets you receive will be the mac address of the router which forwarded them to you as that s the link-layer device you re communicating with

1104786
subnet	packets
if the peer machines are on the same subnet then the incoming packets will contain the mac address of the peer in the ethernet header.

1104786
winpcap	libpcap
if after all that you re still determined look into libpcap winpcap for packet capturing which is the most portable option which comes to mind

1104787
width	height
anything else would be too cumbersome the solutions i can think of off the top of my head would involve actually keeping track of the height and width of every character for the specific font and manually do a whole lot of char by char calculations but another solution would be to look at a containing div with overflow hidden

1104802
httphandler	pagemethods
a simple way to do this would be as you said simply make an ajax call to a pagemethods mvc action httphandler or web service that returns the required value from the session

1104804
folder	directory
in this application i have created a folder in the application directory

1104881
inherited	properties
static properties don t need qualifiers in inherited classes

1104890
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript are two such languages

1104892
pull	push
gethash pull out the whole object so you can just modify it in-place rather than telling push how to look it up again

1104924
superclass	subclassing
if i think that subclassing should have a protected way to take effect on the state defined in the superclass i make a protected setter .

1104973
children	parent
what you are trying to achieve is some kind of a nested set and therefore the easiest way to implement it would be to save the parent id in the children s entry

1104983
width	height
but when i change the height or width of the object mcwhiteborder the drop shadow does not appear at all

1105016
post	get
there s really no reason why something that can be a simple link causing an http get should be emulated by using script to submit a form using http post

1105020
range	max
user audience per application will range from 10 to 6000 max

1105048
width	height
basecanvas - canvas with fixed height and width

1105069
x86	64bit
registration for the 32-bit com dll s will be under a separate location in the registry hklm software wow6432node classes and your com components should live in separate folders 64bit under program files and 32-bit under program files x86

1105098
gridview	onclientclick
subclass the gridview control override the render method then make the href of the pager point to the page you want and copy the original href javascript link to the onclientclick event

1105126
hide	show
i m using javascript to show hide the menus and a ul for each menu inside the same div as the origin link

1105133
hide	show
jquery s hide and show don t work and neither do these methods

1105158
put	get
edit as craig stuntz pointed out you can get the route values in a view via viewcontext without having to put them into viewdata first

1105169
rss	feed
my encoded characters come from a rss feed btw look like this

1105206
hide	show
for example this code hide all elements of the pie class whereas i only want to effect the elements that are currently show and not act on the ones that are currently hidden

1105234
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog change the item and if the user clicks ok save the changes back to the original item and if they click cancel do nothing

1105284
versioning	upgrade
if so it might be an upgrade from an older versioning of sql server

1105297
nsscanner	nsstring
this goes in a category of nsstring uses nsscanner for the implementation and handles both hex and decimal numeric character entities as well as the usual symbolic ones

1105348
128bit	64bit
you can effectively get a 64bit int from 2 32-bit ints or a 128bit int from 4 32-bit ints or indeed any size you require from enough ints

1105359
glut	sdl
you could look at glut c qt c++ sdl c

1105364
inherited	properties
properties are just methods that get inherited like any other.

1105468
many-to-one	one-to-many
the fundamental problem with ui api s is that you re dealing with a many-to-one or one-to-many depending on how you look at it relationship

1105514
google-chrome	firefox
combining them works great in google-chrome and firefox

1105516
free	malloc
i had just completed the section of the course on malloc and free to the general satisfaction of most of the punters when the one cobol guy on the course came over and asked

1105516
put	get
this is actually not too far from oo and i think the basic idea you need to get across is that there will be subtly different types of record with different things you need to do to them and the best way of dealing with this is to put the record and the things that need done together to create objects

1105518
width	height
try adding width 600 height 600 in your options to reduce the window size right down...if no bars are appearing it is more likely a css problem

1105528
cpu	processors
writing a cache line that is shared between processors forces it to become invalid in the other cpu s keeping the caches in sync

1105564
jar	war
maven treats a project as something that creates a single artifact - aka jar file war file ear file etc

1105566
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
doesn t look right in google-chrome safari firefox either so this really isn t an ie8 problem

1105566
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in the future design your site to look good in ie8 firefox google-chrome and safari

1105569
stdout	stderr
i admit that i don t know much about multi-threading but i think what i need is a mechanism to promptly pause input stream threads one each for stdout stderr when an user input is needed and resume once the input is provided to prevent a block

1105569
stdout	stderr
1 is there any way to control the process of taking in inputstreams stdout stderr without using read

1105582
loops	while-loop
if you really want to mess about manually with loops indices consider using a while-loop

1105633
width	height
i have an image that depending on the screen resolution drops down out of sight in my css flow layout because i have set its width and height to static values

1105636
lisp	scheme
i would highly recommend structure and interpretation of computer programs which actually uses scheme but that is a dialect of lisp

1105642
udp	tcp
it s a voip application that uses a combination of udp and tcp to initially set up the connection and do port tunneling stuff and then uses udp for the streaming data

1105646
range	minimum
to satisfy the request it has to seek at the beginning of the range 2009-05-01 start a scan from this position to extract all the resultid sort them then return the top 1 the minimum resultid

1105658
maven	pom.xml
because there is no multiple inheritance in maven you either have to have a gigantic parent pom.xml with all this content in and some complicated profile conventions or several parents one for each type of project

1105679
folder	directory
delete the file after you have what you need from it presumably after moving it out of the temp directory using move_uploaded_file to the folder from which you will read it then remove it using unlink

1105725
many-to-many	one-to-many
should i instead combine the data from user_organizations and org_user_details into a table like the one in my first post and just tell nhibernate that user looks at it as a many-to-many relationship and organization looks at it as a one-to-many relationship

1105739
put	get
i put in a hyperlink to the mvc page from one of the standard .html pages and i get a 404 response telling me the requested page does not exist

1105760
cdr	cons
learn to love car cdr and cons

1105762
opera	safari
the specs say it does not work for netscape mozilla safari opera and internet explorer for the macintosh. .

1105783
hide	show
basically having some trouble with using hover to hide or show an item

1105783
hide	show
problem is if the mouse hovers over the div and leaves too quickly the show hide div will stay visible

1105788
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
could not find a base address that matches scheme net.tcp for the endpoint with binding nettcpbinding

1105792
udp	tcp
both use openssl under-the-hood and provide similar abstractions for tcp udp and ssl

1105792
udp	tcp
one thing you may need to keep in mind is that ssl is record-oriented instead of the stream-oriented both tcp and udp

1105799
put	get
if you are willing to put up with a small performance hit on inserting these entities you can create a solution to get n of them very quickly

1105808
free	malloc
i suspect an issue is because loki uses malloc free for each chunk as well as when the size is getmaxobjectsize .

1105812
filesystems	fat
for this strategy what you would need is code for your bootloader to mount the nand flash as a drive and have a fat driver so that it can traverse that filesystems and find the image

1105831
xfce	gnome
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured

1105831
kde	gnome
here s a list of lots of choices basically anything that s not kde or gnome will be smaller

1105865
lisp	scheme
i liked structure and interpretation of computer programs uses scheme practical common lisp paradigms of artificial intelligence programming casting spels in lisp among others

1105869
width	height
bit of a guess since my css is rubbish but since nobody is answering what about setting a width or height or both in the image so that it is a percent of its parent

1105903
opera	safari
it would be a bug in safari or opera if the d handle it differently

1105926
vb.net	vb6
i am upgrading vb.net app that handles the events of a com object possibly written in vb6 from framework 1.1 to wpf 2.0 3.5

1106016
ant	maven
what was the reason for moving from ant to maven

1106016
ant	maven
it sounds like you had everything worked out well with the ant solution so what is maven buying you here

1106016
ant	maven
if it is just dependency management there are techniques for leveraging maven from ant that give you the best of both worlds

1106037
kde	gnome
i too think you re asking for desktop environments like kde gnome fluxbox etc or at least window managers kwin metacity tvwm twm etc and not x servers

1106104
for-loop	arrays
since the for-loop iterates n say the arrays length is n times and in each iteration dosomething is executed the overall performance would be o n logn

1106113
hide	show
how about once the option is clicked clone the image and stick it in a div with no style hide your original load div and then show the new image div where you want it to go

1106115
put	get
i hate to put an index hint in a stored procedure but sql server just canâ t seem to get a clue on this one

1106130
keyczar	botan	keyczar	cryptlib	botan	cryptlib
there are several options such as keyczar botan cryptlib etc

1106133
pop-up	dialog
another way to always launch your debugger is to add the following line to your code and it will pop-up a dialog box when called that will give you the correct debugger options

1106188
rss	feed
my django application retrieves an rss feed every day

1106191
trac	bugzilla	trac	mantis	mantis	bugzilla
in the latter case you could install a webserver an use tools like mantis bugzilla jira highly recommended trac etc

1106193
firefox	safari
it happens in safari and firefox

1106234
google-chrome	firefox
i can t get firefox to play my stream though google-chrome plays it okay

1106284
width	height
this seems to require the enclosing div to be set to a particular width and height value

1106319
inherited	properties
all of my child forms inherited the same base class and that class just has a properties that returns the my.forms.mdimain

1106326
packets	multicast
i ve never done this before so would you do something like set up a multicast socket to broadcast an empty data packets and then have the receiver of that empty packets fill it with their ip address and return that now full data packets so that you have the address to start the connection

1106335
width	height
you ll need to manually specify the width and height properties to get the image to keep its dimensions

1106339
width	height
where w h are the original height and width in and the new height and width out and maxwidth and maxheight define the bounding box that the image must fit in

1106347
min	max
average the hue saturation and brightness separately while keeping the min max values

1106382
oncreate	ondestroy
oncreate and ondestroy are not good places to load save registry values that affect the positioning of the window

1106384
width	height
divide the screen image into a grid of r-many rectangles in an n by m grid each with width total width n and height total height m

1106444
width	height
more or less if you want the image to resize with the window you can t set the div to a fixed width and height

1106444
width	height
the div must have a width and height also

1106478
for-loop	loops
as per mike sutton what you need is a while loops not a for-loop

1106479
firefox	safari
it just showed a single stationary image on safari and firefox

1106482
equals	gethashcode
for this to work your class must override equals and gethashcode and implement the iequatable of t interface

1106503
ant	maven
the tool is capable as acting as command line tool as well as ant maven and eclipse plugin

1106547
haskell	scheme
i am slowly learning haskell too and i am using the tutorial write yourself a scheme in 48 hours

1106588
getdate	dateadd
select dateadd dd ceiling datediff dd 1 1 09 getdate 14 14 1 1 09

1106607
getter	setter
implementing getter and setter has two advantages in my eyes

1106609
disk	ram
ram if your ram is not big enough to store your complete application image you need to store it on an external disk

1106625
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
afaiu it supports openid and facebook connect ldap ntlm kerberos etc

1106710
pascal	delphi
we have some ancient delphi code might have even originated as turbo pascal code that uses aka iochecks which makes the code use ioresult instead of exceptions for disk i o errors

1106710
rmdir	mkdir
delphi basics suggests that it also affects mkdir and rmdir

1106758
actionscript	mxml
i m working in flex builder 3 and i have two actionscript 3 classes abc and xyz and a flex mxml project main.mxml

1106846
cvs	svn
i have to agree with simon - careful comments and manual merges are the only way to keep it with the rest of your svn or cvs files

1106869
rmdir	mkdir	rmdir	chdir	mkdir	chdir
also anything that calls inouterror chdir mkdir amd rmdir

1106877
post	get
i get data in from post and validate it via this standard snippet

1106887
hid	keyboard
depends on the framework api and os but the picolcd states that it should show up as a standard keyboard or hid device

1106894
lisp	smalltalk
alan kay of smalltalk fame calls the original definition of lisp evaluation in lisp the maxwell s equations of programming

1106955
width	height
convert to 640x480 if either dimension of the original is larger or a 4 3 aspect ratio relating to the width height of the original whichever is closer to 640x480

1106974
int	double
so this got me thinking i know that i will be working with numeric types hence t will be any of the following int uint short ushort long ulong byte sbyte decimal float double

1106977
typedef	struct
you have two solutions there declare a typedef or make explicit that you are passing an struct

1107019
min	max	width	height
i started with try and set min and max height width to the actual height width

1107025
int	double
hence t will be any of the following int uint short ushort long ulong byte sbyte decimal float double

1107036
prop	each
as you can see my sql statement is a union of all three and i want to specify which table pet prop or amend each row of data comes from

1107049
ubuntu	linux	vmware	virtualbox
folks mentioned vmware and virtualbox also note that ubuntu s wubi installer lets you install linux under windows without repartitioning

1107049
ubuntu	mint	kde	gnome	kde	kubuntu	kubuntu	gnome
also since ubuntu is so popular that are many versions kubuntu uses kde instead of gnome mint and xubuntu are both lighter weight

1107049
anjuta	kdevelop
in addition to kdevelop there s anjuta eclipse and many more

1107049
vim	emacs
lots of people use emacs and vim for good reasons

1107063
junit	testng
we noticed that when testng test cases extend testcase junit those tests start executing as junit tests

1107066
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
html 5 which is still in development has a canvas element that can be used with javascript to create the kind of thing you are looking for but only the latest versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari support it

1107085
spaces	delimiter
1 if you know that the rest of your data after the address is exactly 2 fields ie bc and ca you can do split on your string using spaces as delimiter remove the last 2 items

1107105
django	web2py
supposedly web2py platform handles this automatically but unfortunately web2py is not well documented yet but it might be a cut above django in terms of quality of api and is worth taking a look at

1107132
versioning	upgrade
i would upgrade to the latest versioning if the problem persists

1107134
udp	tcp
most of our development that is shared between windows and linux is server side networking sockets tcp ip udp ... and then client side tools on linux and gui apps on windows

1107152
junit	testng
i didn t think either testng or junit required any base classes now that both use annotations to specify test methods

1107152
junit	testng
and why on earth would a testng class extend the junit base class testcase

1107152
junit	testng
did you have junit tests running successfully that you re not trying to convert to testng or visa versa

1107152
ant	maven
it s immaterial whether they re run by you ant or maven

1107200
instances	transient
i guess you can try doing session.lock on your transient instances to reattach it to the session and then session.refresh to refresh it.

1107291
vmware	virtualbox
your choices range from virtual pc to vmware server sun virtualbox and more

1107312
width	margin
else you can divide the margin-left into or increase the width of the to 330px so that it would accomodate the extra margin

1107337
getter	setter
when you define your bindable sources through the use of getter and setter the bindings don t seem to work

1107337
getter	setter
the solution is to declare a bindable event for your getter and dispatch the event in your setter

1107368
mouse	keyboard
iinputdevice - a mouse keyboard etc.

1107373
ubuntu	linux
it is just easy to setup a sun virtualbox on your windows machine and spin up the ubuntu or fedora image and get your linux up and running

1107458
apache	lighttpd
i am in the process of migrating from a django fastcgi setup in apache to one in lighttpd

1107458
apache	lighttpd
this software relies on request.get_full_path which returns a different value under lighttpd than it did under apache

1107458
apache	lighttpd
ideally i would like lighttpd mod_rewrite to have the same behavior as mod_rewrite under apache

1107482
children	parent
in general the configuration elements of children will override those specified in the parent for any given plugin

1107509
oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
these methods are likely called from defined in oncreate onstart onresume onrestart onpause onstop or ondestroy

1107509
put	get
if you put a long loop at any point in your program it will appear to freeze because the os specifically the ui thread is unable to get a slice of time

1107545
profiling	benchmarking
i typically approach things in the following order with the help of a profiling and some fixed application benchmarking so i can compare different approaches

1107546
hide	show
however this also posts both the will show and will hide notifications to my view controller

1107546
hide	show
is there a way to only respond to the will show hide notifications if the keyboard is actually going to show or hide

1107596
min	max	min	median	median	max
i m having some trouble returning multiple values in this program that calculates min max mean median

1107666
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the reason for this behavior is that the only unchecked-exception in the java language is runtimeexception and it s subclasses

1107718
cpu	processors
in a multitasking or multithreaded processors environment the usual case for a long time now where there are other operations possible while the desired event has not arrived burning cpu and resource access paths leads to an awful waste of processing power and time

1107718
cpu	hyperthreading
when we have a hyperthreading system like i think you are referring to in your question it is important to note that the granularity at which cpu threads are sliced is very high

1107752
mouse	keyboard
in system preferences keyboard mouse and keyboard shortcuts there s a full keyboard access setting that allows users to configure whether they want tab to enable changing keyboard focus to text boxes and lists only or to all controls

1107769
width	height
this also works in ie however not always so sometimes you might need to set a height or width or do a zoom 1 which tends to fix a lot of ie bugs look up haslayout bug if you want more info

1107773
free	malloc
c++ compilers simply make the default operator new and operator delete wrap malloc and free or other memory allocation primitives that normally don t know anything about objects and types and allocate release raw chunks of memory and thus have to store the size within to know how much to release

1107780
free	malloc
i can t imagine an implementation where it wouldn t since the memory allocation functions underlying new and delete will just be like malloc and free type-independent functions that operate on pointers

1107833
width	height
you cannot set an explicit width height on inline elements so if they must be a specific size then you re stuck with floating them

1107874
firefox	safari
one other thing is that gwt is adding this same support to normal browsers firefox ie safari so you can debug from within them the same way

1107890
mouse	keyboard
last but not least if you do have the headcount budget to hire one more engineer please do but make sure he or she is a software engineer in testing not a warm body banging at the keyboard or mouse for manual testing -- somebody who s rarin to write and integrate all sorts of automated testing approaches as opposed to spending their days endlessly repeating if they re lucky the same manual testing sequences

1107932
hide	show
use the onclick events to call the needed hide or show div

1107941
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering

1107945
children	parent
this is useful in many cases as disabling children hover animations drag n drop selecting a parent container before continuing checking clicking the child widget etc

1107966
hide	show
to hide and show your div using jquery you could do something like

1107991
jvmti	jni
anything related to auxiliary apis like jni jvmti

1108030
decoder	encoder
is there an open-source java implementation of the vcdiff binary diff format decoder and encoder

1108031
keydown	keyup
edit i only added the keydown and keyup events just to prove that the keys presses were getting through

1108052
hide	show
edit#2 moving all tags down at the tail of the fixes well hide this error and the page show normally

1108058
free	malloc
in pure c you only really have one solution allocating on the heap with malloc and making sure to free afterwards

1108073
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can call rest services from delphi using http get put post delete

1108127
ubuntu	debian
it s the default version of java that comes with many open-source linuxes such as debian ubuntu and fedora

1108168
x86	64bit
you could compile it for x86 instead of any cpu that way it will run against 32bit librarys on a 64bit windows

1108213
internationalization	translation
it handles very difficult internationalization and translation transformation issues which makes it slow

1108219
rss	feed
you can also use something like sventon to give you an rss feed of logins to a particular branch

1108220
junit	testng
looking at the maven surefire plugin info i can t see any way to select a test for testng processing only if it also extends a junit 3 class

1108269
put	get
if that is the case the php script may be trying to send it internally in which case it ll just disappear while the other target emails will get put on to the internet and routed properly

1108270
factors	mean
does anyone know what the q factors http headers emitted by firefox 3 mean

1108337
post	get
you don t ever get the value of user out of the post variable in php

1108337
post	get
in all recent php versions post variables are accessible through the associative array and get variables similarly through

1108379
width	height
the cause of this seems to be because width height is not always set in the xaml-file - only margins

1108403
mvp	presenter
the difference with mvp is it introduces a presenter class which monitors the model on behalf of the view in other words the view doesn t know about the model it only knows about its presenter

1108442
post	get
i want to maintain modelandview when requestmethod is get and requestmethod is post

1108442
post	get
so i made modelandview return type to get post methods

1108461
extjs	mootools
take your pic yui dojo extjs jslib jquery mootools prototype

1108471
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
prototype internet explorer ie 6 + firefix firefox 1+ safari 2+ opera o 9.25+ google-chrome c 1+

1108477
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
you can set the qgraphicsscene s area that will be displayed by the qgraphicsview with the method qgraphicsview setscenerect

1108480
move	drag
i am able to move the circle by accessing its cx and cy attributes so there must be a way to drag it

1108616
firefox	safari
this will only work in firefox and safari though

1108621
wav	riff
wav files uses the standard riff header format

1108678
sorting	filtering
to make life easier it employs a searchlist another prototype i wrote which allows you to do incremental search filtering and live sorting on the listed items

1108708
cvs	svn
as far as i remember is the scm support in xcode limited to git svn and cvs

1108712
getter	setter
- client side add to business object s getter setter rights checker allowing write display data for particular user

1108714
getter	setter
use attr_accessor to add attributes and you will get getter and setter automatically

1108789
division	modulo
using the modulo gives the remainder of the division rand 100

1108790
min	max
a normal group by query using a min and max groups all the driverids

1108799
mouse	keyboard
if you could mention the playoff between controls that would also be appreciated if touch screen a keypad control is provided but if also supporting keyboard mouse input how do you manage the keypad ui space effectively

1108843
min	max
you clearly want to keep journeys separate - the results you say you want for driver 401 involve the first row then min max run over the second set of rows for that driver

1108877
bids	ssis
realising my mistake i changed it to money but bids ssis kept rounding it and treating it as an int

1108877
bids	ssis
it s like bids ssis has a strange memory and the only way round it is to start again

1108926
ubuntu	linux
i am working on ubuntu 8.10 linux os

1108941
textarea	textbox
i have a asp.net textbox textarea which is in a repeater have single textarea for each record which are read only i have button open in new window when i click on it the content of the text area needs to be rendered in a new window using javascript

1108965
distance	altitude
edit sql server 2008 geographic extensions also neglect altitude information when calculating distance

1108970
mouse	keyboard
our ui supported a normal keyboard mouse combo too the touchable buttons were just standard button controls sized appropriately

1109042
temporary	tablespace
2007-06-03 13 05 tgl create a guc parameter temp_tablespaces that allows selection of the tablespace s in which to store temp tables and temporary files

1109055
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
is there a place where you guys upload your personal projects and also svn i think is the most popular but with git bazaar i dont know if it just a hype or distributed version controlling is really the way to go

1109161
pickle	configparser
this could load up data from a specific file which could be text json configparser pickle or any suitable format

1109225
folder	directory
update since you want to do plugin-style dlls you can keep the dlls in a separate directory and copy them into the exe folder on application startup

1109240
mouse	keyboard
we use two distinct ui s one for touch-screen with large bold buttons and one for mouse keyboard entry

1109255
put	get
if you put everything into one c source module you get -

1109268
post	get
get post attributes - but on server side they may be handled in a case sensitive way

1109277
hash	md5
oscommerce stores the password using md5 but also adds a random 2 digit number provided in plaintext to the hash

1109277
hash	md5
hash md5 twocharactersplainpassword

1109277
hash	md5
hash md5 74pass acaa6e689ae0008285320e6617ca8e95 74

1109277
cart	oscommerce
is there any possible way of importing customer passwords from my oscommerce cart to my new cart

1109292
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm which is a one-way function

1109292
hash	salt
you cannot reverse the hash on your oscommerce system to remove the salt and rehash

1109321
super	abstract
here the super class mapping itself is abstract

1109329
hash	md5
do not save plain md5 hash in your database

1109329
hash	md5
plain md5 hash can be reverse engineered quickly and easily using rainbow tables

1109329
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
anyways i want to reiterate that plain md5 hash are easy to crack for most passwords since people like short and easy to remember passwords. use a salt and or a more complex algorithm

1109474
agile	srs
for instance you do not have a software requirements specification srs in agile

1109509
unification	inference
type inference to unification problem

1109522
for-loop	arrays
i fill refresh them with data from an arrays with a for-loop

1109536
distance	polygons
the requirement is that the new inflated polygons s edges points are all at the same constant distance from the old original polygons s on the example picture they are not since then it would have to use arcs for inflated vertices but let s forget about that for now

1109557
daemons	systemd
this can be a daemons app or windows systemd process or it can be a unix-style superserver that s configured to load and run the actual file-copy app when someone contacts the listening port

1109583
jar	manifest.mf
i m able to read the manifest file inside of my java code but i would also like to know if it s possible and if it is how to open up a jar file from the command line and view its manifest.mf file or at the very least be able to specify a property of the manifest.mf file and view it s value

1109587
distance	polygons
the resulting polygons lies at the required distance from the old polygons far enough from the vertices

1109587
distance	polygons
near a vertex the set of points at distance d from the old polygons is as you say not a polygons so the requirement as stated cannot be fulfilled

1109602
put	get
i can use set_icon const void size_t function to put binary data but then how do i get it on the other side

1109604
youtube	vimeo
posting a video on tumblr.com allows you to just paste the url of the video on youtube vimeo whatever and tumblr automatically does the embedding for you

1109725
cpu	processors
binary code expected to run on any processors either needs to avoid extensions or to detect the cpu type before using them

1109725
x86	64bit
intel s itanium 64bit architecture was completely different from amd s x86-64 architecture so for a while their 64bit offerings were non-compatible and itanium was nothing like x86 whereas x86-64 extended the instruction set by adding 64bit instructions

1109756
httphandler	httpmodule
you ll want to use an httphandler or httpmodule to do this

1109785
min	max
use min max avg or any other function to give you one result for fields that could return multiple values

1109822
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but it only works in firefox google-chrome safari and any browser supporting css3

1109824
folder	directory
svnadmin can write to the root to create new projects and to the project folder to create the trunk branches tags directory

1109951
int	double
for int it can construct them by peasant arithmetic double or double and add 1 for each bit for bits it just provides the appropriate encrypted bit

1109951
int	boolean
we can mix and match boolean and int values in our designs obtaining an if then else that requires evaluating both branches simd style by evaluating cond then + 1 - cond else using 1 as true and 0 as false in cond so you can get away with using the built in arithmetic of your ring to make your circuits more shallow

1109989
punctuation	words
one thing i can think of is that it will count punctuation marks as words if they are surrounded by spaces

1109989
punctuation	words
you may want to reduce the set of words characters to alphanumeric characters only and counting punctuation marks as words separators - unless it is a or a - in the middle of a words depending on what you define as a words are it s and quick-witted single words

1109995
getter	setter
this is a rather old topic are setter and getter good or evil

1109995
getter	setter
inline the getter and setter

1109995
getter	setter
to which extent do the getter setter impact performance function call stack frame compared to a direct field access

1109996
width	height
sticking a transparent 1x1 gif in your image to start will let you scale it to the width and height you need

1110002
ant	maven
speaking of recompilation neither maven and particularly nor ant do a good job at identifying what needs to be recompiled

1110002
jar	war
in fact you use java s jar to generate a scala s jar file from the class files and the maven targets for lift support building war files

1110008
getter	setter
in c++ the compiler inlines the getter and setter

1110011
getter	setter
in c++ when a compiler s optimizations are enabled then getter and setter may be inlined be implemented using the same machine instructions as there would be for direct access to the underlying member data

1110027
youtube	vimeo
i am trying to code a firefox extension that can get the video youtube vimeo property path etc. when a user right-clicks on it on a web page

1110031
width	height
basically in a complex hierarchy of ui controls allowing you to browse the elements and see properties such as x and y coordinates width height id

1110057
getter	setter
setting the email field as private getter setter will not solve my issue since i don t want to store the value at all on the entity and fetch the field from the database - as i said this application needs to be as performant as possible

1110076
children	parent
is it a case of your top parent stackpanel has been given a limit of x wide but it s children are asking for a total width that is greater than this due to length of the labels

1110077
children	parent
each row represents the children of the previous row where child categories are attached to parent by their respective positions - they are a child if their position is the parent to the left and the next parent to the right if there is one

1110089
getter	setter
often i encounter classes that are used as data containers which have both getter and setter for each member

1110089
getter	setter
most compilers can optimize trivial getter setter but as soon as you declare them virtual in c++ you pay an extra lookup - often worth the effort

1110101
getter	setter
as far as i know the jvm jit compiler only optimizes heavily used code so you could see the function call overhead initially until the getter setter has been called sufficiently often

1110150
nsstring	nsdata
therefore the nsstring initializer grabs even the bytes after the end of the received nsdata until it reaches some zero byte previously stored in memory

1110158
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
ditto for webkit google-chrome safari and opera

1110211
integer	unsigned
here are functions for reading and writing 32 bit unsigned integers from a stream heeding an arbitrary byte order which is specified by the integer whose representation is the byte sequence 0 1 2 3 endian.h endian.c

1110319
versioning	upgrade
with wpf i ve had rendering issues related to my video drivers and the fix was to upgrade the video driver to a newer versioning

1110324
getter	setter
also d has property syntax that allows you to make something a public field and then change it to a getter setter later without breaking source-level compatibility

1110324
getter	setter
if you want to use trivial getter setter for some reason such as only having a getter and making the variable read-only from outside the class make them final

1110326
getter	setter
however providing a getter and setter for each data member of a class is not a good practice

1110327
perforce	svn
branches are cheap in all of the systems mentioned so far svn tfs perforce git

1110375
int	boolean
i have an arraylist that gets different type of values in it 1st value- string 2nd value- datetime 3rd value-- boolean and 4th value is int how do i find thier type and assign those values accordingly any help is appreciated

1110385
listview	gridview	gridview	sqldatasource
i was thinking of using listview or gridview bound to the database with a sqldatasource that filters the questions for the questionnaire being generated for the data entry

1110407
post	get
i was wondering if anyone can post an example of how to get a selected radio button option from an asp.net radio button list control via jquery on the loading of a page

1110425
for-loop	loops
you will often see this pattern using a for-loop rather than a while loops

1110493
post	get
are you putting the attribute on the get method or the post method

1110498
dbml	edmx
the second tool i know of are the huagati dbml edmx tools which allow update of dbml linq-to-sql and edmx entity framework mapping files and more like naming conventions etc.

1110502
free	realloc
if you want to use realloc i do not see another solution as you initial array was free by realloc

1110502
free	calloc
you can calloc your reduced array copy the nodes then free the old array

1110513
profiler	yourkit
if a method is inlined it doesn t appear in the profiler certainly not yourkit anyway

1110553
public	protected
since private methods must be used by the code which is visible in some form public package protected private methods can be considered to be covered under the tests for the more-visible methods

1110588
textmate	notepad++
but if i open the csv file with notepad notepad++ or even textmate on mac i don t see any such signs and i m not able to get rid of them

1110617
firefox	safari
as usual it s working fine in firefox and safari but it s breaking in ie

1110636
groupbox	panel
the 1st panel in the main splitcontainer has 3 main groupbox which are selected via a toolstripbutton which sets the desired groupbox to visible and turning the others to invisible.

1110717
openfeint	scoreloop
so far i ve found openfeint and scoreloop but i don t really care about the social part or discovering other games i just want a simple system with matchmaking win loss and global rankings

1110746
mamp	wamp
open phpmyadmin if you re using mamp wamp or a server that has it installed and run the following query update system set status 0 where name devel_themer

1110746
mamp	wamp
those should work to disable any module in a pinch. you can also edit the php.ini file in your mamp wamp configuration to give it more memory temporarily though that trick won t work if you re running on a shared host that doesn t recognize php.ini changes

1110765
stdout	stderr
the problem is you catch only stdout and not stderr see standard streams

1110793
inherited	properties
all these pages would inherited from a common base page that would include the properties above

1110801
getter	setter
getter and setter are one of those things that are sometimes useful but you get these doctrinaire people who somehow leap from has proven useful in some cases to must be used all the time and if you don t use it you are a heretic who should be killed

1110801
getter	setter
if you have side effects to a get or set by all means use a getter or setter

1110801
getter	setter
but if not writing getter and setter just clutters up the code

1110801
getter	setter
but declaring a member field private and then creating public getter and setter for does nothing to solve the problem

1110804
stdout	stderr
looking at the documentation it does say there is a stdin stdout and stderr file descriptors that i can directly manipulate but there is a big fat warning that says don t do this

1110809
width	height
the top left corner of the #logindiv is positioned absolutely at a point 50 across the width of the window and 50 of the height of the window from the top-left origin

1110809
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
this is then altered by the margin s moving it 50 of its height up the page and 50 of its width back across the page

1110809
width	height
changing the width height of the #logindiv will require different negative margins for positioning centrally

1110820
decoder	encoder
come up with some kind of csv encoder decoder for the fields and values and populate a collection on every page

1110826
stdout	stderr
in this case will stdout and stderr used as parameters in tidy have their values changed to new stringbuffer buffer.substring i

1110848
stdout	stderr
you misstate what is going on here -- the object references are passed by value a copy of the reference is made so stdout and stderr do not get modified when you call tidy

1110858
stdout	stderr
no stdout and stderr will not be changed and yes parameters are passed by value

1110862
mouse	keyboard
wrist-rests for keyboard and mouse

1110975
getter	setter
just to be extra clear java 1.6 introduces getter setter like file.canexecute and file.setexecutable boolean for file permissions

1110982
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

1110986
daemons	launchd
do i have a daemons running looking for a crash or do i wait until my app is launchd next time to report

1111015
calloc	malloc
in a language like c malloc makes no guarantees about the memory being initialized to 0 but calloc does

1111015
free	malloc
now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

1111037
implements	extends
should i just implements a class that simply extends the abstract class

1111105
typedef	struct
as far as which style is preferred i prefer the 1st style with the name in both the struct tag and as a typedef for the struct simply because there are no drawbacks other than a few more characters in the source file

1111105
typedef	struct
my ide s struct snippet drops the name in both places so i always get a typedef struct name along with a struct tag name

1111127
skip-lists	tree
depending on your requirements heaps tree or skip-lists might be appropriate

1111159
onmouseover	onclick
for example an attacker could inject malicious code into the onclick or onmouseover attributes

1111167
width	height
so getting width and height you can calculate an aspect ratio

1111176
post	get
you can post the suggestion to after registering and they should get back to you fairly quickly

1111185
vmware	esx
i ve a ps script which i use to keep track of my vmware esx servers

1111186
post	get
this gives you the ability to go more than just get post more rest-ful verbs using response status codes headers etc

1111261
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups

1111277
uiview	calayer
is there any problem applying multiple transforms to a uiview and it s corresponding calayer

1111294
onmousemove	onmouseup
the copy seems to be working fine but the onmousemove trigger doesn t seem to fire until the onmouseup trigger has fired

1111321
bazaar	git
btw the same thing applies to other gpl projects â as long as git mercurial bazaar remains under gpl don t hold your breath for apple to ship integration for them in xcode

1111379
put	get
if you put logic like this in inside the storeprodedure and log it somewhere you might get some info about the caller

1111389
getter	setter
it is recommended that you leave this field private and don t specify getter or setter for it as you want the jpa implementation to be singly responsible for this field

1111494
hash	salt
i understand that salt make the same password hash to different values

1111494
hash	salt
so let s say i am attacker here is how i might use a dictionary attack against a salt note in this example i don t write out 128 bit hash or salt for the sake of brevity

1111521
hash	salt
without salt the attacker can generate hash for every word in his dictionnary then run the new dictionnary against your passwords list

1111521
hash	salt
with salt each password is hash with a random string so even with the prior hash dictionnary knowledge he still have to re-create a new hash dictionnary containing the salt for every different salt in your database

1111533
ssl	https
anything sent over https is encrypted using ssl transport

1111539
wav	riff
is the endianness of format params guaranteed in riff wav files

1111542
ssl	https
https is http over ssl

ssl	https
as the other posts say - https is http plaintext wrapped in ssl on top of the tcp ip layer

1112085

i m trying to create a web application project template for everyone to use here at work that will minimize the amount of work that we have to do to create a new application with all our normal stuff and i was thinking that it would be nice to do some setup stuff add some records to a database when the developer creates a new application only if they tell it to and i would like to do it through a dialog like the one that pop-up for unit testing when you create a new asp.net mvc project

1112378

1112582
post	put
i know this is an old post just wanted to put this out there for anybody else

1112638
opera	safari
in fact you do not know if the browser is even using separate win32 window handles for tabs as it may just have one handle for its main window and draw everything inside by itself qt and wpf applications do that and i believe that opera in particular does that and probably so does safari

strftime	strtotime
mdb2 has a date type that displays yyyy-mm-dd format but could easily be turned into m d y with strftime and strtotime

1112643
strftime	strtotime
edit obviously you ll have to use strftime and strtotime on each row separately

1112643
strftime	strtotime
if you switch mdb2_fetchmode_object to mdb2_fetchmode_ordered or mdb2_fetchmode_assoc above you can probably use a foreach loop to run strftime and strtotime on all of the rows that need to be reformatted

the problem is that the height variable gets set just fine whereas the width variable contains nan â 2147483648

1113270

also the xcode debugger tooltip shows both properties in the texture correctly only after the width gets through the two accessor the number gets garbled

1113271

cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
there are many different source control providers including tfs subversion svn perforce cvs and visual source safe to name but a few

1113435
perforce	svn
tfs svn and perforce tend to get pretty good feedback from their users

1113435
perforce	svn
out of these svn is the only one that is free so if you are planning to do this as a learning exercise i d be inclined to start there actually i believe you can get a free 2 user license for perforce too but i m not 100 sure on that

1113524
put	get
obviously you may want to put it in a function or class so you can get at it from anywhere without having to duplicate the code all over the place

1113702
width	height
you will probably have better luck if you set the height and width of the main surfacewindow in the xaml file

1113702
width	height
at runtime the surfacewindow s height width is set to the surface screen s size but at design time in blend there is no height and width and this can cause problems with designers

1113712
ninject	spring.net
now you can use an inversion of control container like windsor unity ninject or spring.net to configure your development environment versus release environment

1113745
postgresql	mysql
for example i often test using sqlite and use mysql or postgresql in production with no changes in code

1114025
getter	setter
does the generate getter setter come under code assist

1114033
maven	m2e
it s also worthwhile mentioning m2e it integrates maven into eclipse and allows you to optionally resolve dependencies from the workspace

1114041
integer	unsigned
in your example i would probably use a typedef for a 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integer rather than using int or unsigned int or size_t

1114043
min	max
the progress bar itself is easy to use you set the min and max value i ve set it to 100 to repressent 100

1114056

1114235
multiplying	add
there are some really cool and complicated functions that describe how to find integrals and such with computers but because we can t be exact with our answers and because computers are limited with what they can do add multiplying etc there are lots of methods of how to estimate math to a great deal of precision

1114259
profiling	debugging
profiling on the debugging build is usually pretty pointless especially in c++ because debugging heaps have a lot of extra checking that totally changes the performance profiling of a typical application

1114261

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
over time gecko konqueror opera safari and google-chrome each decide to similarly spoof the user-agent of some previous browser in order to manipulate browser-sniffing web pages into correctly understanding their browser s features

google-chrome	safari
plenty of other nonsense also results like modern google-chrome s user-agent simultaneously claiming to be mozilla google-chrome safari and like gecko

this seems okay in google-chrome and firefox admittedly it s a little flakey sometimes it doesn t work maybe if the image is in the cache

this will return a cgrect which in itself is comprised of a cgpoint called origin and a cgsize called size

1114338

1114880
g++	gcc
gcc g++ open source proven refined by years of collaborative experience on many linux and unix systems

1114935
put	get
so...on one hand there is the option of staying organized the way i ve been doing for years and allowing intellisense to be the way that a new user of an assembly quickly gets up to speed with its functionality and just lump it for the includes... the other way is to put everything in one namespace...and write good docuementation on how to get started with the assembly.

1114968
inherited	properties
you can change the button s frame an inherited properties from uiview by adding a method to do so in the view controller .m file that manages the button then adding that method as an action for a control event on the button

1114995
datamapper	activerecord
incidentally this is one area that datamapper kicks activerecord s butt soundly

1114995

i m not sure if i understand your problem but you can try implementing the iserializable interface in your class to manually fine-tune the serializable deserialization processes

1115058
put	get
hey i just sort of learned how to put my sql statements into vba or atleast write them out but i have no idea how to get the data returned

1115063
pylons	turbogears
i am considering whether i should use turbogears or pylons for my project

1115076
turbogears	toscawidgets	pylons	turbogears	pylons	toscawidgets
turbogears emphasises integration while pylons emphasises modularity -- with tg2 you re getting such components as genshi toscawidgets and sqlalchemy all integrated and coordinated

1115086
led	electronics
the need to allow space for an ever growing range of peripheral expansions led to the original decision to segment the address space into electronics memory from 0-640k and other stuff input output roms video memory etc from 640k to 1mb

1115119
hex	binary
it s only slightly less difficult and error-prone than modifying strings in a binary executable using a hex editor

1115152
width	height
if you want to scale really everything including font sizes you could probably apply a scale transform to your content and bind it s x and y values to the window s width and height

1115154
versioning	upgrade
by keeping the legacy containers and scheme you can upgrade any versioning to the latest

1115156
width	height
simplify the problem by calculating the width and height of the rectangle

1115157
vim	emacs
i wish there existed color scheme quick setups like both emacs and vim have had for decades

1115167
codeigniter	cakephp
if you want to dig deeper you could check out a framework like codeigniter or cakephp

1115171
superclass	subclassing
sadly you need what i consider a hack making a one-to-one reference from subclassing to superclass restaurant to place

1115206
jinternalframe	jlayeredpane	implements	extends
you could implements your main game display and control panel as the background of a jdesktoppane which extends jlayeredpane and could make the pop ups jinternalframe

1115219
superclass	subclassing
remember that although wildcardbuddies is a reference to a pair of employee subtypes the object it points to is quite specifically a pair of managers and conversion from a superclass employee to a subclassing manager is not allowed

1115225
firefox	safari
my only leads are from safari unmatched embed tag firefox browser pretends chart never loads even though it has ie non-specific prototype.js error

1115282
apache	nginx
if using nginx as front end in front of apache mod_wsgi you could use x-accel-redirect now

1115308
google-chrome	firefox
add shortcuts here to notepad dreamweaver and why not google-chrome and or firefox

1115359
width	height
the second thing isn t as much a problem but something i can t figure out when either the height or width of my rectangle is negative the rectangle is filled in black

1115373
inherited	properties
to explain the loop check first if the properties is a user defined properties as opposed to being inherited from the object object

1115443
pascal	delphi
as we know delphi also provides memory management a bit like c - using ampersands and pascal functions but what would be the most effective logging

1115449
ubuntu	linux
i am writing the program for linux i m using ubuntu 9.04 and using gcc

1115462
put	get
if it becomes too expensive to update the data in the mapping table at the same time as the primary table you could put a message on a queue and get a worker role to perform the updates for you asynchronously

1115476
opera	firefox
your only real loss then would be having an improper font-weight for older non-ie browsers like firefox 3.0 and lower and opera 9.2x and lower

1115482
config	ini
ini files is the way i use to store config in zend framework look at the sample config

1115487
getter	setter
use a different serializer such as datacontractserializer which also supports private getter setter or fields but doesn t support full xml control - for example see here

1115497
getter	setter
in this example boo will have id property with public setter and getter

1115497
serializable	deserialization
use boo for xml serializable and deserialization and use foo for handling business logic

1115514
gridview	linqdatasource
i have gridview in my page and i set it s datasource to linqdatasource also i set allowpaging true allowsorting true

1115514
gridview	linqdatasource
here is my question how can i implement paging in gridview of course for relational tables using linqdatasource linqdatasource with enabled delete or update

1115539
width	height
it can work with either absolute or relative positioning as long as the image width and height are defined

1115602
eurekalog	madexcept
also you have also commercial options for this madexcept eurekalog etc. but these are only advanced error loggers while jvcl besides that s free will give you also over 600 components to play with

1115647
boost	stl
as long as my ide doesn t support view short typenames i m leaning towards using declarations for commonly known symbols the stl boost ...

1115728
stringbuilder	stringwriter
stringwriter stringbuilder you are implicitly using .net s utf-16 string

1115741
vim	emacs
i don t know much about emacs so you may regard the following as off-topic but i work with both eclipse and vim

1115840
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are generally smaller faster and optimized for text editing and navigation

1115862
google-chrome	safari
this code gets the desired functionality to work like charm but only on google-chrome and safari

1115880
rsa	aes
modern symmetric aes and asymmetric rsa cryptosystems are very secure read practically impossible to break in themselves but the way you use the cryptosystem and user behavior changes everything

1115889
implements	extends
also a class can implements many interfaces but can only extends one abstract class

1115910
hash	md5
just ask for the name and calculate a hash such as sha1 or md5 for that name maybe lowercase and strip whitespace first prefixed with some secret text that is hardcoded in your program

1115921
mouseover	mouseout
start and loop the animation on mouseover stop pause the animation on mouseout

1115922
mouseover	mouseout
in the mouseover event or the first method of the hover event you start a timed function that causes the scroll and in the mouseout event or the second method of the hover event you stop the timed function

1115964
int	chars
the thing that is going wrong here is that self.id requires an int and openssl digest.sha1.hexdigest uuid.timestamp_create returns a string with non-numeric chars which would lead to the value 0 being actually stored in the database

1115969
eurekalog	madexcept
both eurekalog and madexcept do pretty much exactly what you re after

1115969
mantis	bugzilla
both give great output and have support to connect into bug tracking systems like fogbugz mantis and bugzilla

1116053
feedback	review
if you re heavily re-writing someone else s code you re effectively taking the time to review it anyway you just aren t providing the feedback which is the worthwhile part of code review

1116053
feedback	review
so sneak the review in under the radar - write a function or three then ask a colleague to look at it and give you instant feedback on whether it makes sense to them

1116116
xna	spritebatch
i will also point out that i am using xna to develop this game but i have almost no grasp of all the classes available yet pretty much only using the game component with some classes that are related to it such as gametime spritebatch graphicdevicemanager but not much more

1116135
versioning	upgrade
i highly recommend memberwing they have a free versioning that is quite enabled and the upgrade is only us 100

1116139
uiview	subviews
remember that uibutton inherits from uiview and so you can add subviews to it just like any other view

1116253
keydown	keyup
you shouldn t use the keypress event but the keyup or keydown event because the keypress event is intended for real printable characters

1116259
valgrind	callgrind
you may be able to use valgrind callgrind with the flag to achieve this

1116281
put	get
simply put the constructor call config values and the call to the start method in the callback function that handles the results you get from the ajax request

1116331
mkmapview	mapkit
the error is not thrown when i import mapkit mapkit.h or when i declare a variable as mkmapview mapview

1116433
converter	multibinding
the goal is to use multibinding to pass the model to your converter in this case pass the datacontext

1116456
disk	ram
more ram and faster disk help a lot

1116527
yslow	pagespeed
use yslow or pagespeed to identify bottlenecks

1116572
int	double
maybe your calculator method can be applied to two different set of parameters say on an int and on a double

1116594
margin	height
this is because slideup works by reducing the height to 0 but it doesn t change the margin

1116597
post	get
bots just sending post or get data without loading the page just get filtered too

1116647
children	parent
parent children

1116651
gif	png
one cool feature is the ability to send an array of bytes to a server side script which allows you to save jpg gif and png onto a server directly from flash

1116676
put	get
by the way you could use joptionpane to put up a little gui to get user input .

1116713
slideup	slidedown
jrails redefines slideup and slidedown for some reason

1116802
spaces	delimiter
it is just that your input needs to be delimiter by spaces

1116802
spaces	delimiter
if you input a single number and hit enter there will be no spaces and as you have set your scanner up to be delimiter by spaces it wont find anything

1116806
int	double
there s an overload for interlocked.exchange specifically for float and others for double int long intptr and object

1116831
put	get
now my problem is that if i put the code for read-function before the code for action-function i get an error in read-function saying that it doesn t know what action-function is because the code for it is further down and if i do the opposite well i get a similar error obviously saying that read-function cannot be resolved etc

1116831
put	get
if i put the code for these two functions in the reverse order i will get an error saying

1116860
hash	md5
i m currently using md5 hash but i would like to find something that will create a shorter hash that uses just a-z a-z 0-9

1116871
domxpath	domdocument
one possibility domdocument and domxpath

1116877
domxpath	domdocument
if youâ ve not just a fracture like the one mentioned use a real parser like domdocument that you can walk through with domxpath

1116883
hash	md5
you can decrease the number of characters from the md5 hash by encoding them as alphanumerics

1116937
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
another option is to use progressive enhancement with font-face with your chosen font which is supported by firefox 3.5 opera 10 and i think safari

1116993
maven	pom.xml
if you use the maven plugin m2clipse you can precise the manifest file in the maven configuration file of your project pom.xml in the build section

1117008
hash	md5
you could encode your md5 hash code with base64 instead of hexadecimal this way you get a shorter url using exactly the characters a-z a-z 0-9

1117074
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller

1117138
ienumerable	ilist
a quick look-up on msdn revealed that ilist t s insert method only has a version which takes an index and an object t and does not have a version which takes ienumerable t instead of t

1117163
subtraction	addition
you ll find other such methods for right addition right subtraction etc

1117178
width	height
in the third table width and height are explicitly defined

1117178
width	height
we would like to avoid explicitly setting height and width and so if we could get modify either of the first two tables to match the clickable-behavior of the third that would be fantastic

1117183
debian	linux
if you want something more fancy on linux you can try the classic curses library or if you just want a dialog box you could try the library that the debian install utilities use but i forget its name

1117273
hide	show
how to show and hide div every 1min in jquery

1117289
hide	show
to flip show hide you can do something like this

1117333
folder	directory
i have a directory public_html myfolder and i want my domain www.example.com to point to public_html myfolder as my root folder

1117349
stdout	stderr
on the other hand forms application don t have the stdin stdout and stderr connected and while they can behave as command line tools and process command arguments they have problems when embedded in scripts because the standard input output is not hooked up

1117368
ssl	ntlm	kerberos	ntlm
you can take out the authenticated stream part ssl or kerberos ntlm if you really don t need it and then it becomes

1117409
int	double
for harvey such as fewer casts better intelliprompt linq and better performance if you are using collections of structs such as int and double

1117423
lisp	smalltalk
this practice goes back to the earliest dynamic languages like smalltalk and lisp

1117424
boost	stl
is there a data structure readily available in stl or boost that accepts two arguments and maps it to a certain value

1117426
nsexception	nserror
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to

1117431
x86	64bit
if you compile normally the clr will run your app as 64bit on x64 windows and 32-bit on x86 windows

1117457
hash	md5
i have a database application that generates a md5 hash and compares the hash value to a value in our db sql 2k

1117457
hash	md5
i realize this may not be the best method to hash but utimately any changes to the md5 code would force us to change some 300 values in our db table and would cost us a lot of time

1117503
post	get
a reset_password get action or a start_reset_password post action it just doesn t really sit right it seems i am trying to make these controllers do too much work

1117507
next	except
as an aside i m also applying flat is better than nested in another way not dependent on any try except which is if i have nothing more to do on this leg of the loop continue move on to the next leg of the loop instead of if i have something to do followed by a substantial amount of nested code

1117517
hash	md5
i don t think the .net md5 hash code have changed in visualstudio 2008

1117520
post	put
send email costly action which you don t want repeated and you do want executed every time the user requests it post or put on any url you want

1117520
post	put
reset password based on token i d consider implementing this as a login-via-token instead but if you re going to do it your way then it has server-side consequences and hence should probably be a post or put

1117531
try-catch	exception-handling
another option that can help is to wrap only the offending code with a try-catch putting the exception-handling handler as close to the exception-handling as possible

1117550
vb.net	vb6
same goes for vb.net by the way - spaces inside square brackets used to work in vb6 but they don t in vb.net

1117577
rss	feed
i have a bunch of texts and images taken from the content tag of a rss feed item that i want to display in my app

1117614
updatepanel	formview
once you get it working normally try putting the formview into an updatepanel and see if the bind still works

1117619
hide	show
you just need to connect to the change on the select check the val and hide show the div

1117623
trie	tree
in that case r b tree or trie s might be the best way

1117627
getter	setter
private is really so that you are not using variables globally so you make use of getter and setter in classes which helps loosen coupling

1117640
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
writing your own code is definitely an option but layout engines ie webkit in uiwebview safari or gecko in firefox is a complicated task

1117688
division	multiplication
the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication

1117688
division	multiplication
i would also be careful about always using multiplication of the reciprocal instead of division to gain cpu performance they may not give exactly the same results

1117693
base-class	derived-class
otherwise the problem i m attempting to learn my way through is one of setting base-class member types based on arguments passed to a derived-class constructor using templates

1117693
base-class	derived-class
if there were a way to set the base-class member type t foo-t simply by passing arguments to the derived-class constructor i would prefer that

1117696
subtract	add
think about it in terms of elementary operations that hardware can more easily implement -- add subtract shift compare

1117696
division	multiplication
as you see even at this small size number of bits in the numbers and with libraries optimized by exactly the same speed-obsessed people multiplication by the reciprocal can save 1 3 of the time that division takes

1117702
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

1117724
hide	show
one thing you can do is make the height fixed and use overflow css property set to hide to hide the text and use the title attribute to show the whole text in a tooltip

1117741
ubuntu	centos
in our case this development stack is running under ubuntu workstation components eclipse ide maven and centos server components maven nexus subversion trac hudson sonar

1117779
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems is the most generous in naming files

1117783
hide	show
and some stuff i d like to hide and show in correspondence to clicks on those triggers like so

1117836
redmine	trac
with regards to annotation you might be able to get away with using one of the code review plugins for either trac or redmine

1117847
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i am trying to do a painting program with qt 4.5 so i am using the qgraphicsview for the canvas and qgraphicsscene to store the items drawn

1117847
qgraphicsview	qpainter
for some reasons i just couldn t get a qpainter context in my own derived qgraphicsview

1117847
qframe	qwidget	qgraphicsview	qwidget	qgraphicsview	qframe
seeing that qgraphicsview is derived from qabstractscrollarea then qframe then qwidget i would expecting that the code would work

1117847
qgraphicsview	qpainter
1 why is that i can t use paintevent in a qgraphicsview to get a active qpainter

1117941
inherited	properties
i inherited the tabcontrol and i added a properties called tabsvisible and corrected it

1117974
for-loop	loops
if you do iterate through the list use a foreach loops instead of a for-loop

1117978
public	protected
private is imo always best at first and then make public protected as the need arises

1118005
inherited	properties
to use it create an instance of the object then set the image properties inherited from uiimageview to the picture and overlaycolor to a uicolor value the blend levels can be adjusted by changing the alpha value of the color you pass down

1118035
super	self
super classwithlotsofattributes self .__init__ args kwargs

1118035
super	self
super classwithlotsofattributes self .__init__ args kwargs

1118050
division	multiplication
any well written program will do the multiplication and division necessary to scale the font properly and in the newest versions of windows the os will lie about the resolution and scale the fonts automatically

1118163
django	turbogears
any suggestions on making the call between upgrading to turbogears 2 or switching to something like django

1118182
public	protected
the fields were made private yes you can use private protected with records and added read-only properties to the public section

1118228
django	turbogears
am sure you would have read from plenty of comparison between turbogears and django on web

1118261
getter	setter
if a class contains a variable named blah then the standard getter setter syntax is obviously getblah and setblah

1118261
getter	setter
the first seems to conform more strictly to the pojo conventions but the second type is what intellij generates if i ask it to make a class getter setter and hey intellij has never let me down yet

1118320
getter	setter
only the names of the getter setter are relevant

1118362
maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
if you redirect the output to a file and search for maven-antrun-plugin i suspect you ll see that it is declared in the build section of the effective pom.xml

1118401
vim	emacs
vim and emacs do just fine as well

1118409
rss	feed
i m using .net s syndicationfeed to create rss and atom feed

1118441
post	get
for example i d like to get post ordered by number of postlovers and

1118479
post	get
the iphone app will use get or post to retrieve data from the web services such as to get data for top ten songs for example

1118494
qgraphicsview	qpainter
i guess the moral of this is that there is no qpainter context within a qgraphicsview and you are better off ignoring its paintevent

1118506
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason new data never loads in ie 7 but loads fine in firefox and google-chrome

1118516
jobs	cron
the best option would be to put jobs in a queue and run the shell as a cron job every so often which then processes the queue

1118595
int	chars
a printf in the next line shows buf to be 300 chars in length but int len gives only 89

1118601
debian	linux
on both my cygwin and my linux box debian i m experiencing same issue

1118611
firefox	safari
i ve tested the following in firefox and safari and it works although it s perhaps not the nicest solution

1118670
django	turbogears
in my experience it is simply less hassle to use django compared with turbogears

1118678
folder	directory
check whether folder already exist at the destination in which case move files in that folder over and continue traversing the source directory structure otherwise move the folder wholesale

1118724
button	checkbox
for many controls such as a button or a checkbox setting will suffice to prevent any interaction between the user and the control

1118742
put	get
put all the functions you want to select from into a dll then use dlsym or getprocaddress on windows or whatever other api your system offers to get the function pointer by name and call using that

1118892
inherited	properties
however in c++ inherited is a properties of types whereas const is a mere qualifier on top of types

1118895
expression-blend	silverlight
on microsoft showcase there are a lot of great video tutorial about silverlight and expression-blend

1118909
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1118936
persistent	transient	instances	transient
the javadoc for hibernate session.persist i know you re not using the hibernate api but the semantics are the same and the hibernate docs are better says make a transient instances persistent

1118997
ant	maven
you can have ant scripts inside maven use maven-antrun-plugin i can provide examples if requested

1119058
min	max
i also know you can do this by fetching the max min value you are interested in in a subquery using min max then use that result as a criterion in your main select

1119124
persistent	transient
since the id type is assigned nhibernate has no idea how to tell if the object is transient or persistent

1119134
free	malloc
i want to know how malloc and free work

1119162
free	malloc
one implementation of malloc free does the following

1119163
free	malloc
this has nothing specifically to do with malloc and free

1119163
free	malloc
this would be true even if you never used malloc and free and allocated the char array on the stack or statically

1119175
free	malloc
when you free memory malloc takes that memory block off the chain.

1119190
free	malloc
malloc and free are implementation dependent

1119190
free	malloc
when you malloc a block is pulled from the free list

1119197
free	malloc
how malloc and free works depends on the runtime library used

1119212
lisp	prolog
most courses will touch upon html css ecmascript but what about prolog haskell or lisp

1119225
free	malloc
as far as malloc free implementation goes - entire books are devoted to the topic

1119319
free	malloc
there s a sample implementation of malloc and free in the book kernighan and ritchie the c programming language

1119322
pop-up	dialog
returning the message as a string will pop-up a confirmation dialog containing your message

1119334
free	malloc
the more interesting part is how free works and in this direction malloc too can be understood better

1119334
free	malloc
in many malloc free implementations free does normally not return the memory to the operating system or at least only in rare cases

1119334
free	malloc
this is also the reason why managing very small memory elements with the standard malloc free is not efficient

1119334
free	malloc
but since malloc and free must be so universal the standard behaviour is always the fallback when alternatives are not usable

1119334
free	malloc
you know your next free or malloc will crash but you don t know why

1119346
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
if that isn t possible you can write the bytes you read from the inputstream to a bytearrayoutputstream which will grow as required

1119347
webclient	webrequest
i have also tried using the webclient class but i suspect it uses a webrequest internally

1119371
free	malloc
malloc and free don t work the same way on every o s

1119390
integer	unsigned
which is the unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator

1119399
memset	strncpy	memset	memcmp	memcpy	memset	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	memcmp	strncpy	memcmp	memmove	memset	memmove	strncpy	memmove	memcmp	strncmp	memcmp	strncmp	memset	strncmp	memmove	strncmp	strncpy	strncmp	memcpy
in it is used as the type of the parameter num in the functions memchr memcmp memcpy memmove memset strncat strncmp strncpy and strxfrm which in all cases it is used to specify the maximum number of bytes or characters the function has to affect

1119430
inherited	properties
unless specified the color properties basically defaults to inherited which means take the value of the parent element

1119473
iprincipal	iidentity
i have my own iprincipal iidentity and membershipprovider

1119481
inherited	properties
another alternative would be to inherited from toolstripmenuitem and override the set of the text properties to replace with

1119482
lisp	smalltalk
i have read numerous time that learning a language such as haskell lisp or smalltalk will somehow make you a better programmer while you program in other languages

1119483
concave	convex
this code works for both concave and convex polygons of completely arbitrary shape and is able to handle any line orientation

1119484
integer	unsigned
size_t is the unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator iso c99 section 7.17.

1119484
integer	unsigned
its type an unsigned integer type is size_t iso c99 section 6.5.3.4.

1119544
cvs	svn
jira also integrates with cvs and svn

1119557
sml	scheme	lisp	sml	lisp	scheme	ocaml	sml	ocaml	scheme
the list then include lisp scheme dylan ocaml and sml

1119593
width	height
the required memory for uncompressed rgba image is width height 4 bytes

hash	md5
what you can do is get a secret key that only you know include that in an md5 hash signature typically you can structure signatures as a s tring of your parameters a nd values and the secret appended at the end then take the md5 hash of that...do this both in your client and service side and match the signature string only if the signatures match do you get granted access...since t he secret is only present i n the signature it w ill be hard to reverse engineer and crack

gif	png
if you don t know the image type like you want to handle gif and png as well or if you think the extension may occur multiple times in the filename image.jpg.jpg then you will want a template to help you

1119707
gridview	detailsview
i have a master details setup with a gridview and detailsview both in updatepanels

1119707
gridview	detailsview
when the detailsview is edited and updated i want these changes to be reflected in the gridview but without rebinding that data which could change the selecteditem s sort order among other problems it causes on detailsview itemupdated i have the following

1119713
distance	polygons
i would start by bounding all the polygons by a bounding circle and then finding an upper bound of the minimal distance

1119713
distance	polygons
then i would simply check the edges of all blue polygons whose lower bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons

1119713
distance	polygons
for every blue polygons where distance red s center current blue s center - current blue s radius upper bound of min distance

1119713
distance	polygons
if the blue polygons are relatively small compared to the distance between them and the red polygons then this approach should work nicely but if they are very close you won t save anything many of them will be close enough

1119737
ordinals	difference
i actually found a better way to this it s actually built in the system plus it uses the internal ordinals metadata of the entities which are loaded anyway i haven t tested the performance difference but this should be hell of a lot faster than reflection

1119757
mp3	wav
if it s exactly the same sound but not sample-accurate matching a clip of an mp3 to a wav of the same song for instance you can easily find it using cross-correlation

1119791
zlib	libpng
but you can consider looking at the ones used by fairly portable libraries like libpng zlib etc

1119810
ienumerable	ilist
if your item is acting as a list you may want to implement an interface like ilist or ienumerable ienumerable

1119890
pull	push
it can be used to push put a view into a region or pull let modules declare which region they populate

1119911
config	ini
a common bottleneck is file access - a config file ini file that is required to launch the application can perform well on a developer machine but perform abysmally in different deployment situations

1119950
codeigniter	kohana
makes me think that you might be using codeigniter or kohana

1119955
ssl	https
if you want security transmit your data over https http with ssl

1119956
hide	show
i want to hover the containing the image and then show or hide the element

1119969
hash	salt
basically you take the user s password apply a hashing function if that s the way it s stored on the server then you take a server challenge token and salt the password value for a new hash

1119977
crypt	hash
you should hash your passwords and store the hash password in the database see crypt

1119997
hide	show
i m using a list to build a simple nav menu that show when you hover and hide when you leave it

1120001
post	get
now i have to pass a variable from silverlight to mvc not with get post

1120009
distance	polygons
pick any blue polygons and find the distance from the red one

1120009
distance	polygons
if the minimum distance between the bounding areas is greater than the already found distance you can ignore this polygons

1120009
distance	polygons
find the minimum distance centroid distance between the red polygons and all the blue polygons

1120009
distance	polygons
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far

1120009
distance	polygons
for the actual minimum distance calculation you could use yang et al s a new fast algorithm for computing the distance between two disjoint convex polygons based on voronoi diagram which is o log n + log m

1120081
mouseover	mouseout
what i recommend you do is to use a javascript framework such as jquery which has cross-browser handling of mouseover and mouseout

1120081
mouseleave	mouseenter
even better it has mouseenter and mouseleave which are special events that are sure to only trigger once per mouse entering leaving of an element even if it has child elements

1120081
mouseleave	mouseenter
see demo of mouseenter mouseleave events in jquery

1120139
post	get
when i submit my comments i get comment post not allowed 400 why missing content_type or object_pk field

1120157
hash	md5
then when the client connects have the client generate another random string append that to the end of the shared string then calculate the md5 hash

1120168
postgresql	mysql
many databases at least mysql and postgresql maybe all has a database called information_schema or something similar

1120186
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
as far as the spinning part goes you just track the location and movement of touches in your view with touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

1120247
textview	imageview
i put an imageview and a textview within a relativelayout that is used as list items and want the imageview to grow vertically with the line number of textview

1120365
post	get
by the way to get post from a particular category use

1120381
hash	salt
say a user registers for your site you hash the password they have chosen then use that hash as a salt and rehash their password with that salt

1120391
super	self
super unapproveduser self is wrong it should be super unapproveduser cls because in class method you do not have self available

1120431
hash	md5
also you should avoid md5 in favor of a currently-strong hash algorithm such as sha1 sha-256 sha-512

1120436
hash	salt
if they know your hash function but not your salt the salt has protected your passwords

1120436
hash	salt
if they know both the hash function and your salt your data is at risk

1120597
ati	nvidia
until windows vista ati and nvidia supported a feature called horizontal span which combined two monitors into a single larger screen

1120624
rdf	owl
the final thing to keep in mind is what semantic web for the working ontologist modeling in rdf rdfs and owl calls wishful names

1120626
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

1120626
firefox	safari
this is particularly the case seeing as you can use conditional tags to work around ie bugs but if you try to code in reverse it s much harder to write hacks to force firefox safari etc to display the coded-broken html css correctly

1120632
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the selenium ide is a firefox browser extension no ie version available yet but selenium works in most web browsers including ie firefox safari and opera

1120637
cvs	svn
i am pushing for cvs svn

1120637
cvs	svn
wondering how this would integrate with an svn cvs cycle

1120641
ssl	https
by default versions of windows internet explorer that were released starting with the release of security update 832894 do not support handling user names and passwords in http and http with secure sockets layer ssl or https urls

1120641
opera	firefox
if you are using firefox or opera you are ok as long as you configure the iis website directory security to allow basic authentication

1120667
google-chrome	firefox
whereas other browsers such as firefox and google-chrome have the benefit of learning from ms s mistakes

1120684
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
code to firefox work around for ie make sure it works the same way in google-chrome and safari and ignore the rest

1120698
mouse	keyboard
basically it will put an http interface on java.awt.robot so code in any language can simulate mouse keyboard events

1120702
firefox	safari
most important in my eyes you have a claim that it s you can use conditional tags to work around ie bugs but if you try to code in reverse it s much harder to write hacks to force firefox safari etc to display the coded-broken html css correctly. this claim of a lack of symmetry is non-intuitive to my eyes but if true is quite a strong argument

1120830
cvs	svn
i ve used svn cvs clearcase and mercurial

1120844
inherited	subclassing
1 single table inherited you create a single tasktarget table that has every field that every subclassing might want

1120871
opera	firefox
also works firefox 3 on windows and opera

1120928
rss	feed
for example if you want some kind of software that checks rss feed every 5 minutes and makes a little pop-up as soon as a new one comes along

1120935
post	get
for a really simple solution you could even just dump your post get data into a session variable then call it up quickly on the page being redirected to almost making the redirect transparent from a logic point of view

1120951
int	chars
here each single 0 or 1 is actually a bit that needs to be stored as it is in the jpeg file but since we can t write bit by bit into file a total of 8 bits are taken and converted into a int value in base 10 and stored into a 1-byte chars

1120968
post	get
- pass back to the page using get post fine

1120992
firefox	safari
data uris work in firefox 3.0.11 and safari 4.0 and probably other compliant browsers but i can t get this approach to work in ie 8.0

1120995
folder	directory
the problem is that for a subfolder in the tutorials directory say www tutorials abc which contains an index.html using one url displays the page as is whereas the other url shows the folder contents and does not display the index.html file

1121045
post	get
mvc use action attributes to map the same view for http get or post

1121045
post	get
question is in javascript how can i know if the view is for http get command or http post command

1121078
factors	matrix
when drawing the text pass a matrix scaled up by factors 2 and scale down the bitmap by factors 2 .

1121082
getattr	setattr
just like getattr and setattr delattr should only be used when the attribute name is unknown

1121128
width	height
had i been using native c++ i could have used a pointer to the x or y member also width height and so on and passed it in as a parameter so that i need implement each algorithm only once

1121136
post	get
write a little bit of javascript on the page to indicate whether the request generating the view was a get or post

1121140
hide	show
also note that without a time string slow normal fast or a time in ms 1000 2000 as an argument toggle will simply hide and show the elements without the fading animation you are looking for

1121147
jquery	scriptaculous	slideup	slidedown
the slideup and slidedown methods come from scriptaculous not sure if they re directly compatible with the jquery effect

1121147
slideup	slidedown
slidedown didn t seem to do anything either probably because slideup was gone so i swapped it for pulsate just to confirm it was working

1121147
slideup	slidedown
i m guessing the original code is intended to slideup and slidedown a content area separate from the menu items

1121150
fadein	fadeout
i guess you are trying to toggle between fadeout and fadein

1121165
regasm	gacutil
currently i insert my .net assemblies with gacutil and register my com assembly with regasm

1121182
ready	each
as you see in each set you have browser specific styles and on the fourth rows we declare in standard way by this we assume if in future the others hopefully ie too decide to implement the feature to have our style be ready for them too

1121182
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as told in other answers this works beautifully on firefox safari camino google-chrome

1121225
folder	directory
if you want the .dll in that folder either create a reference to the .dll from your test project or use the deploymentitem attribute to make sure the item is copied to the test directory

1121253
daemons	launchd
the third option is to create a fully fledged launchd daemons which will run as root and communicate with my application via a socket

1121253
daemons	launchd
does the launchd daemons option seem like the best route to go for this or is there a much easier route i m missing

1121260
wxruby	qtruby
at least for now you ll have better luck trying qtruby or wxruby or jruby

1121282
inline	inlining
this is pretty much pointless since the inline keyword usually does the same thing and function inlining is often a premature micro-optimization anyway

1121309
button	checkbox
that applies to button checkbox comboboxes and any other object in table

1121319
hide	show
run-time dynamic show hide

1121321
ienumerable	ilist
if you know your consumers are going to both iterate over it ienumerable and add to it ilist then it seems logical to simply return a list

1121338
inherited	properties
so the fact that it looks wierd with this theme has to do with some inherited css properties from the lightword theme

1121342
ant	maven
for building c c++ software from ant or maven you might be interested in terp

1121353
post	get
but when the user is redirected by the consumer to the service provider oauth actually specifies that an http get request should be used see section 6.2.1 i can t link b c i m a new user and can only post one hyperlink -- very annoying stackoverflow

1121364
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
when you use reflection.emit and i m presuming dynamicmethod here you get to choose what the first argument to the generated code will be and it can be passed implicitly by the delegate like this

1121373
ant	maven
how would you execute ant tasks at different phases in a maven build cycle

1121469
client-side	server-side
using a combination of client-side scripting javascript etc and server-side obfuscation random image names would be the most likely way to do it without affecting the user experience

1121517
post	get
i can post some code if you need but this should be enough to get you started

1121536
jquery	scriptaculous
for example scriptaculous and jquery can probably fit the task and should be simple to learn

1121565
rss	feed
m using the syndicationfeed class to consume some rss feed

1121565
rss	feed
i am wondering how to get the content encoded node of an rss feed

1121573
button	checkbox
choose the field type textbox checkbox radio button dropdown

1121735
subclass	abstract-class
in your deserializer you could have different strategies to deserialize the right subclass of the abstract-class

1121790
hash	md5
if you re really afraid of accidental collisions just do both md5 and sha1 hash and compare them

1121791
multiplication	modulo
examining the disassembly shows that in the fast const case the modulo has been turned into a multiplication and shift type thing whereas in the slow non-const case it s using idivl

1121849
margin	height
the height property doesn t apply to inline elements and the vertical margin border and padding act differently

1121883
hash	md5
forging md5 hash is proven by researchers where they demonstrated being able to forge content that generates an md5 collision thereby opening the door to generating a forged csr to buy a cert from rapidssl for a domain name they don t own

1121900
equals	gethashcode
i had to use the usecompositeid method and then override equals gethashcode for the drivers license object

1121941
stdout	stderr
you will need to consume stdout stderr in separate threads to prevent blocking

1121993
ienumerable	ilist
if its an ilist then you d be able to do .tolist on the ienumerable

1121993
ienumerable	idictionary
if its an idictionary then you d be able to do .todictionary on the ienumerable

1122042
put	get
to make your own programs run the same way you ll either need to put them or a symbolic link to them in a directory that is likely to be in every user s path usr local bin is a good choice or you ll need to get your users to add your program s directory to their path

1122076
getter	setter
they automatically add getter and setter methods to your class

1122098
dxcore	coderush
i m using version 3.23 of dxcore coderush and refactor

1122109
int	chars
for example enum chars defines an enum the same width as chars instead of int

1122112
put	get
i can access name from the entry map before i put it in the list but once it s in the list i get this error

1122116
folder	directory
find the folder name desktop at the current directory

1122133
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

1122146
cos	sin
the motion of the center of mass cm will just move smoothly along a straight line and the corner points will rotate around an axis through the cm assumed to be the z-axis here so the equation for each corner point parameterized by time t is p v t + x + r sin wt+s i + cos wt + s j where v is the vector velocity of the center of mass

1122158
accessor	properties
the same applies the other way to initializing properties values in init using your properties accessor there would be sending messages to a half- init ed object

1122182
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as daniel was hinting to presenting modal views is a uiviewcontroller behavior uinavigationcontroller just inherits this from its superclass

1122216
abstract-class	superclass
in procedural programming a unit may be an individual program function procedure etc. while in object-oriented programming the smallest unit is a class which may belong to a base superclass abstract-class or derived child class

1122282
3des	aes
the ssh connection being tunneled is already encrypted so there s no point in using the heavier aes 3des for the outer layer

1122347
setinterval	settimeout
you can also use the settimeout setinterval functions

1122369
children	parent
this code forks a various number of times the children then attempt to get tuples from the parent using a rinda tuplespaceproxy over drb

1122369
children	parent
the children then return their results with different tuples to the parent which aggregates them

1122388
accessor	properties
however i would not have the properties accessor implement the validation logic

1122390
width	height
you will need the height and width of the component that you are trying to draw

1122400
kerberos	ntlm
the asp machine has authenticated the user connecting to iis via ntlm kerberos

1122431
width	margin
and set the content div to have a left margin of whatever the width of the navigation pane is

1122441
.htaccess	httpd.conf
check the httpd.conf and or .htaccess for something like the following

1122459
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
you don t have any aggregate-functions in your query like sum count max min etc so there is no need for group by

1122463
firefox	safari
tested on safari 3 and firefox 3.5

1122488
put	get
you get to put a bunch of the general setup stuff in the test class

1122494
lxml	beautifulsoup
i m using it on python 2.5.2 with lxml and beautifulsoup

1122525
int	double
your 5555555555555555555 example exceeds the largest int which can be reliably stored in javascript s ieee-754 double precision floating-point format which is 9007199254740992

1122535
post	get
if you don t have js you just get central time zone times on forum post

1122575
rss	feed
more generally how does any rss feed reader aggregator like bloglines etc report subscriber numbers to feedburner

1122584
profiling	debugging
note that sometimes switching on the profiling switches the xslt engine into a debugging mode so that certain optimizations are not performed so the profiling results should be taken with some common sense

1122598
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction
remember that division happens before addition subtraction

1122616
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
however the transition from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device waits a while

1122644
bazaar	git
tools like git or bazaar can take care of a lot of the tedious stuff automatically like package building uploading etc

1122662
post	get
but it s as simple as reading out the values in the post and get values the form delivers you

1122662
post	get
how are post and get variables handled in python

1122737
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
i m using vim for my example but i m sure this is just as easy with emacs textmate etc

1122742
xslt	xquery
stylus studio includes both xslt and xquery and with either you can write text files

1122742
xslt	xquery
if you have a xslt or xquery program you can choose to generate code to drive that transform

1122742
xslt	xquery
use the xquery generate code generate c# code... or xslt generate code generate c# code... options to actually create the code and attendant .sln file

1122745
implements	extends
then select a theme to extends from subclass it and implements the methods you care about

1122767
imperative	declarative
of course this depends on the actual schema of your data model and the exact queries but this is just a heads up so you don t bring the imperative thinking mind frame of procedural programming to the declarative world of sql

1122792
addclass	removeclass
you should use addclass and removeclass to achieve this instead of manipulating the css directly

1122809
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
both fat and ntfs are case insensitive filesystems

1122818
addclass	removeclass
i agreen with benlumley you should use addclass removeclass methods

1122839
min	max
b if avg max min or sum is

1122864
daemons	launchd
i have an application composed of a gui and 3 launchd daemons launchd command-line executables

1122864
daemons	launchd
i m planning to put the executables for the launchd daemons inside the .app bundle for the gui

1122969
getter	setter
one thing you can do may be sticking to the singleton sample you found and just exposing a property setter if needed add getter as well and use it like

1122988
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i ve got a uinavigationcontroller with a series of uiviewcontroller on it

1123014
installation	upgrade
if you set productcode as and leave upgradecode as a fixed guid you don t have to write a new upgrade installer for each upgrade because your msi is both a new installation installer as well as an upgrade installer

1123047
getter	setter
option 2 if x and y are exposed as properties you could have their getter setter access a member array of two elements and then expose the array as a read-only property too

1123086
bash	zsh
however .bashrc is used by default when using a bash shell so if you are using another shell csh ksh zsh etc then your changes will not be reflected by modifying .bashrc

1123087
inherited	subclassing
usually you ll find the construct method in the base abstract-class of the inherited tree and its purpose is to simply construct instanciate and sometimes initialize the correct subclassing

1123090
ia-32	x86
this works on all platforms the fact your asking about ia-32 x86 does not matter

1123137
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s working correctly in safari and google-chrome but not in ie7 firefox 3 opera

1123182
gridview	repeater
a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts

1123200
pthreads	fork
does anyone know of a way i am thinking pthreads semaphores right now to guarantee a lock across processes or barring that a way to stop a django server from fork

1123213
atof	strtod
no more messing with atof or strtod and raw c-style strings

1123295
ssl	https
i have set up tfs 2008 with ssl https on ports 8081 81 and 17013 etc.

1123300
profiling	instrumentation
the only way i see to do this is without any form of instrumentation to use the clr profiling api to track object lifetimes

1123326
put	get
this works out to something like get retr cwd put stor

1123332
width	height
and thanks to evert s answer to this question i was able to parse the output with preg_match to find the original file s height and width

1123332
width	height
it takes the original s dimensions target dimensions and whether or not to force conversion to the target aspect ratio determined from its width height

1123337
dictionary	map
what i wanted was to be able to map all of the instances in a queryset into a single dictionary with a specified model field as the key

1123344
pull	push
i tried a simple pull followed by push but this yield my commits in duplicate

1123364
pull	push
you need to pull from the one remote and push to the other

1123364
fast-forward	merge
there s a fast-forward button on your fork of the repository that you can use to catch your fork up if you re entirely merge in to the other side

1123380
post	get
for example i d like to get post ordered by number of postlovers and created in the last 24 hours

1123437
put	get
how do i get it to put the value of the variables in1 in2 in3 and in4 into the list

1123494
arraycollection	addchild
in mediator loop over the arraycollection and addchild the views based on data type

1123567
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however in every browser i ve tested so far firefox ie google-chrome and safari when i place a # on the url the behaviour seems to be that the browser is downloading the entire swf first and then starts playing it with the end result that it takes a while for the swf to load blank screen the pre-loader kicks at a 100 and then the swf continues to the site

1123574
for-loop	loops
there is a loops that calls the renderface function which includes the above for-loop

1123583
inherited	properties
attributes applied to attribute class defination carry a properties attributeusageattribute.inherited that determines if an attributed is inherited in the derived classes

1123607
inherited	properties
you can specify that by applying the attributeusage attribute to your custom ones and setting the inherited properties which is true by default

1123607
inherited	properties
this properties indicates if your attribute can be inherited by classes that are derived from the classes that have your custom attribute applied

1123630
rss	feed
i am creating a rss feed application based on a data and i have the following

1123630
rss	feed
i am sorting through the arraycollection get 1 piece of data condition and need to connect to an rss feed which returns me the title and i set my arraycollection in correspondence to condition - title

1123705
stateless	stateful
what looks like a stateless operation loop over each pair in a table is actually quite stateful

1123710
jar	manifest.mf
this is a self-sufficient jar and with a main-class manifest.mf entry anybody can double click and run the application

1123716
post	get
what i m guessing that you are using is a sms gateway service provider which can route incoming short messages via a http get or post to your destination url

1123722
httphandler	httpmodule
or if you re comfortable enough can you just ensure that the httphandler and httpmodule not handlers and modules sections are filled in properly in the web.config

1123756
16-bit	64bit
size_t abstracts the type used to hold the size of objects because on some systems this will be a 32-bit value on others it might be 16-bit or 64bit

1123756
unsigned	short
so if you write your wide character handling code to use the wchar_t type instead of say unsigned short that code will presumably be more portable to various platforms

1124084
hex	binary
the wikipedia page for the bmp file format contains an example including all hex values of a 2x2 pixel bitmap image it should be very good at explaining the basis of the binary representation of an image

1124084
hex	binary
in general if you re really curious how the binary looks for a file you could always use a hex viewer and take a look yourself i normally use od on linux to dump the binary information of a file

1124345
getter	setter
both components contain two methods that write new data to the structs in the array or delete array elements and the setter and getter for the arguments

1124345
getter	setter
the components deviate from each other only through theire argument names the number of arguments each init method takes and the number of getter and setter

1124383
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
with me it s similar ie opera do it quickly firefox safari terribly slow

1124449
int	double
the reason 100 doesn t work is that setvalue interprets it as an int but canvas.top canvas.left are double

1124460
hide	show
an easy fix would be to also add a class when you show the item and remove a class when you hide the item

1124461
width	height
one solution is to have a div that takes up the entire width and height of the page with a unique id and then use jquery to make an ajax request that returns javascript to manipulate that div like so

1124465
nsmutablestring	nsstring
however like java can i initialize a nsstring first then set its contents later or do i need to use an nsmutablestring

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i ve tested this in firefox 3.5 safari 4 and opera 9.6

1124663

direct3d	directx
there has been significant work regarding directx direct3d interoperability and performance see for example

1124870
ienumerable	ienumerator
like other people have mentioned though the performance doesn t actually matter much the foreach will always be a little bit slower because of the ienumerable ienumerator usage in the loop

1124871
getter	setter
basic code generation specifically java bean getter setter

1124976
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller so your code would look something like this

mouse	keyboard
if you can modify it to accept input from the network as opposed to getting input solely from the keyboard + mouse still easier

1125001
stdout	stderr
alternatively is it actually writing to stderr and instead of stdout for some reason

are there any comparison tests for freebsd and ubuntu

1125226
button	checkbox
how can i style html checkbox radio button and dropdowns

1125236
ubuntu	freebsd
more people use ubuntu for rails i suspect so you are more likely to find solutions to the problems you might encounter with ubuntu than with freebsd

1125280
folder	directory
when i build and run my application i get a directory listing in the browser also happens for sub folder and i have to click on index.aspx

1125307
ubuntu	freebsd
well freebsd contrary to everyone s expectation does not perform extra-ordinary well efficient or fast from ubuntu

1125307
ubuntu	freebsd
some aspect of ubuntu are better and some aspects of freebsd are better in terms of performance numbers

1125307
ubuntu	linux
it is important when you have to try any application or a new product or a new release it is far easier to install n try on ubuntu than on other linux variants

1125307
ubuntu	linux
and if you wish to move ahead and are suffering from the dogma of a simplified to more complex or geeky linux distro then read this question it made me stick to ubuntu

1125317
subtraction	addition
for this intuitive storage method subtraction is a different operation than addition requiring additional checks on the numbers before they can be added

1125317
subtraction	addition
since you want the most basic operations addition subtraction etc to be as fast as possible you need to store numbers in a way that lets you use the simplest algorithms possible

1125319
subtraction	addition
two s complement allows addition and subtraction to be done in the normal way like you wound for unsigned numbers

1125320
button	checkbox
see this 2 links for jquery plugins for styling checkbox radio button

1125325
subtract	add	subtract	addition	subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
the two s-complement system has the advantage of not requiring that the addition and subtraction circuitry examine the signs of the operands to determine whether to add or subtract

1125353
google-chrome	firefox
this code will run on firefox 3.5 but not on google-chrome using v8

1125353
google-chrome	safari
it may be that google-chrome emulates the safari behavior even though it uses a different engine

1125355
subtract	add
also if you try to subtract 4 from 6 two positive numbers you can 2 s complement 4 and add the two together 6 + -4 6 - 4 2

1125355
subtraction	addition
this means that subtraction and addition of both positive and negative numbers can all be done by the same circuit in the cpu

1125370
folder	directory
firstly the simple question - has anyone had any experience programmatically renaming moving a folder in a directory structure in sharepoint

1125386
swt	styledtext	swt	draw2d	draw2d	styledtext
for example swt s styledtext supports that directly getlocationatoffset but none of the draw2d text figures supports this

i then use winmerge but have used other merge comparison tools equally well to compare the directory and merge them into the reconciled folder

1125485
put	get
is it something you can parse once at the beginning of the day and put the variables in shared memory so subsequent runs of your main program can just attach and get the needed values from there

1125489
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
use some sort of salt hash md5 sha1 etc

1125545
serializable	deserialization
one use seems to be to call the xml class generator for using xsd schemas for serializable deserialization

1125556
maven	pom.xml
you will need to add references to the google maven repository so the dependencies and parent pom.xml can be downloaded

1125584
disk	ram
however these proxy objects can deal with the raw data being either in ram or on disk

1125585
gmail	hotmail
particularly large email providers like hotmail yahoo and gmail put great stock in this

1125589
folder	directory
i am also copying the actvedirectory folder found in the t4 templates directory to the solution

1125613
postgresql	mysql
both posts use mysql - perhaps you are able to use similar techniques with postgresql

1125646
sortedmap	sortedset
if you re really concerned about insertion deletion performance then perhaps a different data structure is appropriate perhaps a sortedset or a map or sortedmap

1125761
vim	emacs
any decent editor emacs vim will abstract this whole nonsense out for you

1125809
client-side	server-side
i think you should do client-side and server-side validation to be safe

1125812
folder	directory
after compilation a folder called generated will be in your application directory or possibly bin directory

1125816
client-side	server-side
actually server-side validation is a must client-side is nice but optional

1125830
client-side	server-side
i ve always thought of client-side javascript validation as a ui enhancement with the server-side validation as the actual validation

1125877
mouseup	mousedown
so far i ve got the mousedown and mouseup events trapped but i m having trouble figuring out how to scale the cursor s movement which is measured in pixels to a change of the selected point arbitrary scale

1126072
switching	screens
so when a user clicks the button in the uiviewcontroller that owns the button i create the new viewcontroller whose view i want pushed into the screens this is nice because it also allows me to set up data in the view controller and not have to delegate it to some other object or use a singleton to get the data in the new view then i call my toggleview methods and the root view controller does the switching

1126141
put	get
but i feel that i have missed understood something which in my haste to get to working code i have missed the point that there really should be in a put request - and i should collect this from the formcollection

1126173
put	get
mainly i m just wanting to see articles on this so that i can see how other people are teaching tdd and get some ideas for material to put in my presentation

1126251
bazaar	git
i d recommend using one of distributed vcs git mercurial bazaar rather than centralized subversion because it would be easier to create central repository or repositories by cloning than moving your subversion repository to central place

1126271
folder	directory
then copy the contents of the network share deployment folder to a new virtual directory on the web server

1126272
google-chrome	safari
i ran into a problem on google-chrome and safari using jquery to do some calculations using the widths of a strip of images

1126272
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
everything works just fine in ie6+ and firefox but it does not in google-chrome and safari img .width is 0 whether the image is already cached or not

1126290
udp	rtp	rtp	rtcp
why reinventing the wheel and not use rtp rtcp + udp hole punching

1126311
post	get
i ll let you share your ideas and if necessary i will post the detail of my solution in an upcoming post to get your comments on that approach

1126330
qtp	loadrunner
you can still use qtp as a gui handling client with connection to loadrunner

1126336
pop-up	dialog
i have a screen that pop-up on load with a print dialog using javascript

1126377
addclass	removeclass
so thomas must have included both jquery and jquery ui libraries on his page enabling the speed and callback parameters to addclass and removeclass

1126382
equals	gethashcode
in case you consider overriding equals you have to keep in mind that you have also to override gethashcode

1126426
udp	tcp
browser based js does not give programmatic access to udp or even tcp

1126462
post	get
is there some way i could get php to push or signal to the javascript code when new post are available rather then checking every few seconds if anything new came in

1126481
mvp	presenter
in my solution the constructor for the presenter took 3 parameters the model the view and the mvp name

1126569
children	parent
you have two children extending a parent but the children classes can t see each other private or public

1126583
freebsd	linux
i ve used that example myself on both freebsd and linux it works

1126596
x86	64bit
also it would be really nice if i could have a unified installer for x86 and x86-64 which installers the correct components eg myapp_x86.exe or myapp_x64.exe depending on if the os is 64bit or not

1126606
post	get
once you get going you ll have follow-up questions which you should post as new questions

1126626
spweb	spsite
although we were disposing our spsite and spweb objects properly we forgot to dispose the binarystream we took of the spfile object

1126627
post	get
is there a way to get the uri of a jsp that sent a particular get post request to a servlet

the server has a few thousand visitors a day and on the night i m running a few cron jobs which sometimes does some heavy mysql work looping through 50 000 rows inserting and deletes duplicates etc

1126663
inherited	properties
my problem is on block 2 the absolute div inherited the width properties from its parent thus rendering the child divs on top of each other

1126663
width	height
the height and width given are arbitrary and can change at any time

1126669
tunnel	vpn
one is local one is offsite and accessible via a secure vpn tunnel

1126680
gif	png
if the referrer is not blank and the referrer is not equal to your own domain and the request is for a resource in the embedded folder ending in jpg gif png then rewrite the url to replace embedded with shared

1126681
codeigniter	cakephp
i would recommend codeigniter cakephp or zend framework

1126690
width	height
if you remove the width and height restriction then the inner divs will occur next to each other as desired

1126713
ncover	nant
many of the tools are difficult to integrate with nant such as ncover and source monitor

1126719
inherited	properties
i have a custom class called userprofile that inherited from the profilebase class and i use this to set custom properties like fullname

1126742
width	height
that uses the current font for the given device context to measure the width and height of the rendered string in logical units

1126806
mouse	keyboard
this event will fire whether the mouse or the keyboard is used to alter the checkbox

1126905
width	height
we wrap all signatures with a the script looks for them and then measures the div s height and width

1126905
width	height
all the script does right now is make sure the signature resides in a particular height width

1126908
ati	nvidia
as you re already aware both the nvidia and ati display cards allow you to create custom resolutions however never in a million years up to 12800 x 8000

1126912
pull	push
well judging from your scp protocol use it seems that it would be a lot easier for you to be using the fuse sshfs which would enable you to have normal filesystem behaviour backing you instead of just a push pull type crud interface

1126929
super	implements
in the rippleview class i ve implements initwithcoder which doesn t do anything other than call super initwithcoder...

1126929
width	height
now for some reason if i try to check the bounds of the rippleview in awakefromnib i get ridiculous values 0 width and 1081171968 height

1126945
client-side	server-side
this of course is a pure client-side approach to something best handled server-side

1126948
width	height
another approach is to omit the height and width attributes in the img tag so that the full image is downloaded then use img.height and img.width to determine the size of the downloaded image

1127033
getter	setter
you re setting the expectation on the wrong method name - membership_id is the getter is the setter

1127044
mouse	keyboard
for sources such as mouse and keyboard

1127049
cpu	processors
the cpu behavior would indicate that the application is only utilizing one logical processors

1127079

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this will work in firefox safari google-chrome and any other css3-compatible browser

inherited	subclassing
edit if you create a subclassing every time you want to modify the behaviour of a ui control you will quickly have an unruly inherited hierarchy on your hands

1127254
google-chrome	safari
for safari google-chrome webkit and mozilla use the following two selectors although mozilla supports the css 3 selector not sure if the other one does

1127298
ati	nvidia
as you correctly noted one major obstacle for the adoption of the technology is the lack of a common library that runs on most adapters - both ati and nvidia

1127328
strstr	strcpy
i wanted to have a look at the implementation of different c c++ functions like strcpy stcmp strstr

1127366
strstr	strcmp
here is strcmp and strstr

1127376
children	parent
in fact you could make it implement and forward all the methods on to the list with appropriate manipulation of the parent property whenever adding removing children

1127392
put	get
i used to put my private stuff at the top too because i came from visual basic 6 before c++ and hated being told my privates should be on the bottom but once you get into the habit you ll wish you changed sooner

1127417
button	checkbox
similar to this thread replacing radio button with checkbox

1127468
width	height
i have tried setting the height and width manually and this just results in a large grey rectangle on the second tab

sometimes an rss feed item will not have a duration value so i am hard coding a default duration value when it doesn t

1127531
rss	feed
i m including an .flv uri from abc news rss feed to use as an example

1127567
put	get
it works fine the first time but when i refresh the page it looses that reference because the control didn t get rendered again so it didn t put the references out there

1127570
hash	salt
i ve tested the hash password and salt - test is the correct password

1127597
range	minimum
these aren t binary yes no answers think more in terms of range and minimum standards vs

1127634
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
provide some links to firefox opera google-chrome later versions of ie 6 whatever making one link more obvious so people who don t know the first thing about different browsers will have a default choice

1127701
versioning	upgrade
however the reminders to upgrade to newer versioning of the tools gets annoying

1127702
post	get
choice 4 post requests need to be used since get requests could be inadvertently sent by a search engine

1127722
versioning	upgrade
i only use tortoise but to disable the upgrade messages you can just right click in explorer - settings - uncheck automatically check for newer versioning every week

1127771
width	height
when i insert records with jquery #table .append .. in a table taking the height and width of the table jquery #table .width or jquery #table height is not updated

1127799
inherited	properties
well this is just working fine the button in window1 inherited properties from both styles and modifying properties in either one does properly affect the button

1127841
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
if you don t use a using block you ll have to explicitly call the .dispose method of the sqlconnection and sqltransaction objects

1127846
versioning	upgrade
the syntax tristan posted is correct in the current stable versioning but it gave me errors when i upgrade my project to a nightly 2.8 compiler

1127860
inherited	properties
if you are implementing a software design tool that allows you to represent classes interfaces properties inherited associations aggregations etc. then at runtime yes each class you place in the designer will be an object instance of the class class

1127879
pop-up	dialog
maybe you pop-up a dialog giving the user a chance to accept the update or cancel it

1127882
jobs	cron
so far my approach has been to set up cron jobs that essentially do batch processing of queued commands

1127887
getter	setter
are you happy with the concept of a virtual property with a getter and setter which can be overridden

1127887
getter	setter
if so you can think of a virtual event in exactly the same way instead of a getter and setter there s an add operation and a remove operation

1127956
inherited	properties
however i cannot find a properties or method which will return me the generic parameter that was used in the inherited task

1127985
mechanize	hpricot
tools like hpricot mechanize and curl can help you parse the content of pages and send requests but in doing so your system may be quite brittle

1128009
invokerequired	begininvoke
also in general you do not have to use the invokerequired and begininvoke on the exact same control that you are manipulating in code as long as you can guarantee that the control you are manipulating was created on the same thread in the forms initialization routine as the ui element you are calling invokerequired begininvoke on

1128056

1128693
integer	fractions
sure i could take the easy way out and pass the value in cents so it would be item value 1 but i d like to receive the argument in my view as a decimal data type rather than as an integer and i may have to deal with fractions of a cent at some point

1128698
pop-up	dialog
i have a pop-up dialog modal if it matters that displays a yes no dialog to the user with some information

1128777
post	get
so a get post displays all post and is handled by the index method of the post controller

1128780
min	max
grouping isn t necessarily bad news in sql server -- in fact if there s an appropriate covering index for the query it can perform extremely well because it can just navigate to a particular level in the index to find the grouped values then use the remaining columns of the index to use to min max whatever

1128800
ubuntu	linux
how i can develop and compile command line c++ programs in my linux ubuntu for my jornada 720 that have a windows ce 3.1 hpc 2000 something like a compiler like that for palm or something like gcc and a tutorial of development and compiling will be very nice remember that i want to build command line programs to windows ce programs that runs under the cmd of the windows ce

filtering	grouping
you can also filtering the display using the audiences functionality so that it only displays to a select grouping of users

1129148
uiview	calayer
you are correct that uiview does not animate its property changes by default the way calayer does but i don t think this indicates a break in mvc

1129148
uiview	subviews
that said if you had a uiview subclass that managed the layout of its subviews there would be nothing wrong with allowing that uiview to manage the animation rather than relying on a uiviewcontroller to do it

1129159
curlpp	libcurl
apart from libcurl curlpp which is flexible and powerful but i find very...clunky there are two c++ libraries i m keeping my eye on

maven	pom.xml
it seems that all of them require you to add extra configuration to your build scripts or maven pom.xml for every project that you want to have the reporting done

free	malloc
since the stack is a contiguous block of memory premanaged by the compiler there s no real concept of allocating and deallocating in the way that there is for heap allocations new delete or malloc free

valgrind	memcheck
and i debug with the tool valgrind it said that valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full --track-origins yes . main

1129744
hide	show
i wrote a code to show a div element shareform when a link is clicked and to hide it when the link is clicked again

1129832

xpath 1.0 doesn t have the fancy min and max functions so to find these values we need to be a little tricky with the xpath logic and compare the values on the siblings of the node

1129922
firefox	safari
safari and firefox 3.5 both have pretty good support for offline data but again people with older browsers can t make full use of it

1129943

i m trying out vim after being a long term user of textmate and while i can see the appeal of the app even something as simple as selecting all on vim called on the a command line to paste into another app seems needlessly complex

caliburn	prism
looking at the prism and caliburn frameworks as a wpf newbie what are their relative strengths and weaknesses

1130058

versioning	upgrade
so i want to keep a versioning check which notifies the user if the app has been upgrade in the meantime

1130072
filtering	grouping
where is first then you grouping the result of the query and last but not least having-clause is taken to filtering the grouping result

1130098

valgrind	memcheck
cachegrind is a valgrind tool the framework that powers the always-lovely memcheck which profiles cache and branch hits misses

i can make an explorer bar show hide using iwebbrowser2 showbrowserbar method

1130221
hide	show
i want to use a single button to toggle between show hide

1130221
hide	show
there is a parameter for showbrowserbar to set for show hide

1130240
post	put
creating should be done using a post and so creating a new role for a user should be a post rather than a put i would say

1130240
post	put
it depends if you consider adding a role to be the creation of a role in which case it s a post or the modification of a user then it s a put

1130248
inherited	properties
when i m using .net i m more likely to run into inherited when i m using the .net framework does this control have a content properties

1130250
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve checked your code and it seems that at runtime the contentpresenter of the tabitem does not inherit the datacontext from the tabcontrol as soon the item to display is of type visual or derived from it

1130294
getter	setter
does this mean that an interface shouldn t contain getter and setter

1130294
getter	setter
my opinion maybe not so for setter but sometimes i think that getter are valid to be placed in an interface

1130296
exponent	modulo
while i understand how this can be used to send secure data if i m not mistaken this library cannot be used for the client to receive secure data from the server because the public and private exponent and the modulo are transmitted plain-text from the server

1130302
hide	show
this works but when you run the report and select to expand the groups the little icon use use to show hide on the report is a + symbol instead of a - one

1130303
getter	setter
i don t see why an interface can t define getter and setter

1130303
getter	setter
edit the comments suggest that getter and setter imply a simple field is used for backing storage

1130303
getter	setter
fortunately that implication doesn t hold getter and setter are perfectly within their rights to compute things

1130303
width	height
here either the size property or the height width properties are for convenience only - but i don t see that that makes them invalid in any way

1130333
getter	setter
this touches upon the whole getter setter are evil topic which is addressed multiple times on this site and elsewhere

i ve noticed in the following post that you can get a stack trace out of fastmm to show what appears to be where an object was allocated

1130465
accessor	properties
error mc3080 the properties setter commandbindings cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

1130505
post	get
did you know that if you use the service installer you can implement this to set the registry settings based on something in your installer without needing to get the user to perform any post operation or running some batch file

1130522
getter	setter
there s nothing inherently evil about getter setter

1130522
getter	setter
so my interfaces will tend to contain getter but not setter there are other benefits - particularly threading

1130531
int	chars
none of the base datatypes provide u to store more than 1 value eg int chars float etc

1130533
google-chrome	firefox
my code has previously worked fine in ie7 and continues to work in firefox google-chrome and seemingly any other browser but ie8

1130589
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the http method is supposed to be case-sensitive but the http headers are supposed to be case-insensitive according to rfc 2616

1130698
int	double
update to clarify my object is int uint float double and so on it isn t a string

1130724
int	double
in both the first two cases you ll probably have to handle separately each numeric type you want to support double decimal int - each have different ranges and accuracy for example

1130732
firefox	safari
firefox is happy to print it all out just fine and so does safari but ie 7 and 8 will both show a print-preview of the pages but die during real printing

that is by first converting to an nsdata object then using bytes and casting the result to uint8_t for nsoutputstream s write

1131485
jquery	scriptaculous
in my rails app i ve already included scriptaculous and prototype and it would be great not to have to include jquery

1131486
width	height
i ve created a layouter that lays out these custom components but to place them correctly i have to know the custom componets width height

1131486
width	height
after all of them created creationcompleted event fired for every i try to laying out them but width height property is still 0

1131486
width	height
so my question is how to create custom uicomponent that placed dynamically and get to know the width and height of it

1131486
width	height
with the use of the mx_internal namespace i can set width and height using the internal width and height fields and it looks like it is working

1131504

1131604
uitableview	reloaddata
sure the method reloaddata on uitableview will do the trick

1131611
children	parent
generally speaking if you have parent entity a and child entity b and you are persisting a with some children the correct order of operations is first inserting a into the database and then inserting children i am assuming proper cascade from a to b

1131611
children	parent
and in your case the field- fieldrules is probably invoked which causes the children to be inserted before parent

1131645
children	parent
the xml 1.0 spec does not say anything about the order of elements with equal names as children of the same parent element

1131655
children	parent
children grow and become adults and some adults will also be parent of children students as well as adult students themselves -- they might then drop either role but need to keep the other their child changes schools but they don t or viceversa

1131666
public	protected
when i first got started in oo i used to make everything public or protected figuring why should i restrict what other people wanted to do with my code

1131666

1131720
post	get
once i get it finished i ll post the solution here

1131751
subtraction	addition
however i don t quite see the point in doing so as i doubt there are situations where you would perform mathematical operations such as addition and subtraction on portions of version numbers for any purpose besides curiosity or auto-incrementation and even then int and str can be used fairly easily

1131760
hide	show
i m getting an annoying flickering effect in firefox when using jquery show and hide on some div s

data import export pretty easy too --- r can import csv tsv or excel data via odbc and so on

1132166
uniq	grep
for example if your script looks like cat x | grep y | tr -f 3-5 | sort | uniq then most of the time is spent on cat grep tr sort and uniq not on bash

1132194
serializable	deserialization
before we had axis1 and when custom objects were passed between the client and the server the client and the server code had to do their own serializable and deserialization

1132208
shadowing	named
so if you were to assign a value to a property on the prototype using this the runtime will actually create a new property of that named and put it on the object referenced with this rather than updating the value in the prototype thus shadowing the original value

1132222
japplet	jdialog
first of all you should never override the paint method of a top level container japplet jframe jdialog

the rule of thumb i use is auxiliary objects can be put in if they are related to the ui being defined in the nib in some way - so either proxy objects that hold references to elements or actions that get triggered

1132605
pchart	jpgraph
open source php charting library fork of pchart more oo-code looks way nicer than the current market leader jpgraph

edit the order of the children is preserved with this solution simply due to knowing the ordering of the nodes via the preorder traversal and then knowing the structure via the postorder traversal

1137102
width	height
one way at design time is to use a label control and set it s height or width to

1137141
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
put the sample code below in your form s code and attach the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events of that control to these event handlers

1137148
background-image	background-color
it maintains a background-color and background-image to give it the effect similar to what you d see in a desktop application

1137206
xslt	xquery
in functional languages such as xquery or xslt they cannot be changed once assigned

1137216
touchesbegan	touchesended
after a touchesbegan event is fired the uikit looks for a positional movement of the finger touch which translates into touchedmoved events as the x y of the finger is changed until the finger is lifted and the touchesended event is fired

1137216
move	drag
i use all the events for the drag operation so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case

1137223
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox

1137341
memcpy	memmove
i hoped and i vaguely remember seeing so using memcpy would do this using compiler built-in intrinsics but based on disassembly and debugging it seems compiler is using call to memcpy memmove library implementation instead

1137386
bazaar	git
if i were starting fresh i would look at one of the newer generation of distributed version tools like mercurial git or bazaar

1137408
hash	md5
in light of the fact that googling membership provider hashing algorithm turns up this answer as the first result and the gospel that will be inferred it behoves me to warn folks about using the membership provider like this and using hash like sha-1 md5 etc to obfuscate passwords in databases

1137408
scrypt	pbkdf2
use a key-derivation function like bcrypt scrypt or if you need fips compliance pbkdf2 with a work factor sufficient to necessitate the hashing time for a single password to be as close to 1000ms or more

1137439
lisp	scheme
i would prefer an explanation but code is also fine i can read c-like languages java script python ruby lisp scheme

i know you said you were uncomfortable in ubuntu but if you re moving over to linux then you re going to be uncomfortable for a while

1137483
g++	gcc
interestingly enough this small demonstration program links just fine if i compile it with gcc but i get the same linker errors when i try to compile with g++

1137483
g++	gcc
i was hoping someone could help me figure out exactly what g++ and gcc are doing differently so as to get the original program to link the original program is a c++ program and i can t just use gcc

1137490

i finally worked out that the silverlight client doesn t like ienumerable nor ilist nor list as the return type

1137560
awt	swing
and since swing awt apps don t have javascript selenium won t work on them either

1137589
put	get
now that people have verified this could be useful where would i put a block of code such as this so that it will get executed once and only once to create these tests

1137608
superclass	subclassing
one method i tried was by reconstructing an instance of the subclassing type from the parameters of the superclass so that i would be handling the object with it s actual type thus avoiding typecasting

1137617
rfcomm	l2cap
the bluetooth protocol stack includes its own transport protocols l2cap and rfcomm where rfcomm links use the l2cap layer

1137617

1137697
gendarme	fxcop
you might look at writing your own analysis plugin to gendarme or fxcop to enforce such requirements

1137732
qtableview	qtablewidget
the problem with the qtableview is that it seems to have no method that returns the currently selected record in the table so i took the qtablewidget class which interhits qtableview

1137732
qtablewidget	qabstractitemmodel
error virtual void qtablewidget setmodel qabstractitemmodel is

1137804
integer	fractions
this simply checks if the fractions is in the interval and integer

1137812
webclient	httpwebrequest
.net has httpwebrequest and webclient for simulating a browser s requests

1137849
qtablewidget	qabstractitemview
the method is public at the level of qabstractitemview but qtablewidget has a built-in model which you can t change

1137849
qtableview	qabstractitemview
to get the selection you must call selecteditems which is again a method of qabstractitemview and not qtableview which is why you missed it in the docs

1137883
for-loop	arrays
iterate using a for-loop like you have over each element checking the matching element in the other arrays

1137945
debian	linux
i use os x and had problems when connecting to a linux debian lenny

sorting	filtering
for full-text searching i only need about 10 attributes for sorting and filtering i have another approximately 50 columns mostly floats and integers

1138162
superclass	subclassing
due to olymorphism your subclassing can be instantiated but referenced as the superclass

1138187

i have the same situation although i develop both on osx using aptana and or textmate and windows parallels using notepad++ and or visual studio depending on what i m doing

1138348
mouseover	mouseout
your problem is that you re using mouseover and mouseout functions

1138361
g++	gcc
based on the question use libraries compiled with visual studio in an application compiled by g++ mingw and the msdn forum post i can t mix vc gcc it does not appear you can link a gcc application with visual c++ compiled libraries

1138380
move	drag
essentially the idea is that you override the uiresponder touch methods to analyze what kind of touch the device received and then either move the object to follow the user s finger or give it a speed in a direction depending on whether it was a slow drag or a swipe

1138402
profiling	debugging
when dealing with debugging queries using profiling and ssms its pretty common for me to copy a query from profiling and test them in ssms

1138450
implements	extends
my plan is to implements a new tomcat realm by extends jndirealm and overriding the role methods to call an encapsulated jdbcrealm

1138474
implements	extends
you need to extends smtpchannel -- that s where the smtp_ verb methods are implements

1138476

abstract database connector is a c c++ library for making connections to several databases mysql msql postgresql interbase informix bde odbc

1138605
touchesbegan	touchesended
and 2- you throw the object by basically comparing the touch locationinview self.view to the touch previouslocationinview self.view in touchesended could also store a reference to first touch in touchesbegan but i find that less helpful as user may pause using the time stamp of each you can determine the direction of swipe flick and rate of speed and use them to send your little uiview flying around

1138736
uitabbaritem	uibaritem
you can also manipulate the title directly by retrieving the uitabbaritem a subclass of uibaritem and setting the title yourself but this is usually only necessary if one of your viewcontroller titles is too long to display properly

1138761
int	boolean
unfortunately the valid column types are int float datetime date timestamp time text string binary and boolean

1138764
min	max
you re looking for min and max

1138809
hide	show
i know that the following code should show and hide a tiny circular progress bar with the following code in android

1138823
public	protected
the method is protected because you shouldn t call it on object you can and should override it as public

1138823
public	protected
here the protected clone method in object is being overridden as a public method.

1138836
post	get
in the blog comments for so and other blogs i ve noticed a trend in some users posting what the captcha was that they had to solve to get their post accepted

1138882
versioning	upgrade
one way would be to fetch the jad file using an http connection in your app parse for the versioning available on the server and only launch the browser if there is a newer versioning available or after additionally asking the user if the upgrade is desired

1138902
hide	show
i m trying to create boxes of text that hide or show when user clicks on a expand button

1138945
multicastdelegate	delegation
it s possible to add two delegation in a single multicastdelegate

1138945
accessor	properties
in fact an event is a properties with special accessor

1138945

regular properties have these two accessor get and set

1138957
firefox	safari
i m testing this on safari and firefox with the exact same behavior

1139008

i ve read several blog post that indicate that i can just put the path to the list in the list attribute

1139014
qtableview	qmodelindex	qtableview	qabstractitemview	qmodelindex	qabstractitemview
if otoh you are working in a slot connected to the - say - clicked qmodelindex signal of qtableview really qabstractitemview then this code is what you want

1139034
cldc	midp
the apis section of the document you linked to lists only the basic midp cldc nokia ui apis

1139058
firefox	safari
it s still a good idea to add in a few css3 properties in a progressive enhancement approach using it to give an extra few touches to beautify a site s design to those with browsers supporting some css3 properties firefox and safari have about 25-30 market share

1139061
hide	show
i took a slightly different route in that i chose to wrap all of the elements of a given hide show element in a containing div

1139061
hide	show
it allows you to have multiple triggers for one section if you need it and you can add an arbitrary number of hide show elements without worrying about numbering them

1139061
hide	show
it has a few limitations such as the necessity that the hide show body is a direct descendant of the wrapper

1139061
hide	show
it s also nest-able so you can have multiple levels if hide show

1139065
put	get
i think it d be neat to get a bunch of these and put erlang code on them

1139075
pull	push
you could approach this a number of ways but my only comment would be push don t pull

1139083
typedef	using-declaration
typedef names and using-declaration used to specify the types do not contribute to this set

1139200
width	height
byte n x y where x is width and y is height but i don t know what n should be

1139203
queue	fifo
for message-oriented middleware that does not consistently support priority messages such as amqp what is the best way to implement priority consumption when queue have only fifo semantics

1139266
junit	jmock
you should use junit to do this and you should use something like jmock or some other mocking library to ensure you re testing in isolation

1139307
queue	fifo
i could of course implement something that keeps a queue in shm with a known key or through a fifo but that s error prone.

1139317
inherited	properties
i did solve this by using a custom column namedgridviewcolumn that inherited from gridviewcolumn and implements a name properties but it would still be interesting to know how to get the x name on code

1139367
jboss	oc4j
with oc4j this seems not to have been a problem but now with jboss i get the impression that everything resides in the same name space or class loader perhaps

1139368
hide	show
do you have some global pool of messages that you want each user to see that you show on each page but not show again if he hide the message

1139383
updatepanel	scriptmanager
are you getting an exception from the updatepanel that a scriptmanager is required

1139384
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
you don t have to do the stuff that you re doing with htmlspecialchars and addslashes manually

1139392
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
the htmlspecialchars and addslashes calls in the context you re using them don t appear vulnerable to sql injection or xss attacks

1139394
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
serving static content from apache has overhead so it ll be a better idea if you server it using some lightweight webserver such as lighttpd or nginx and connect to apache using reverse proxy to serve the django based content

1139453
public	protected
assuming that the state of the object cannot be accessed directly no public or package protected fields and is not fiddled with by reflection you can put a breakpoint at the start of all of the object s methods and run through the scenario that makes the object dirty in the debugger

1139461
post	get
i don t have the reputation yet to post comments but do you get the same error running this code

1139464
hide	show
obviously the ui view and controller need to be able to access permissions to show hide components and to handle the permission denied scenario

1139480
typedef	struct
see the way node is highlighted differntly from typedef struct keywords and isn t highlighted at all

1139497
codeigniter	cakephp
if you re not opposed to full frameworks i symfony cakephp and codeigniter all have some sort of activerecord implementation

1139499
folder	directory
since the users are active directory users their home folder are not stored in users so i can t simply hard code the full path

1139519
floating-point	integer
then you could safely convert the floating-point into a basic integer

1139523
ant	maven
i can create my own task in ant and replace needed paramaters but there can be possibility of moving to maven and anyway i m not sure about it

1139552
put	get
for example i would like to be able to associate get with index and put with update

1139555
typedef	struct

1139666
versioning	upgrade
during the process netbeans informed me something about an old client versioning of subversion and now i want to upgrade it

1139717
postgresql	mysql
as a side-question does mysql have any facilities for escaping strings like postgresql quote_literal and quote_ident

1139737
uiview	calayer
i m struggling with conceptualizing animations with a calayer as opposed to uiview s own animation methods

1139737
uiview	calayer
throw core animation into this and well maybe someone can articulate these concepts from a high level so i can better visualize what s happening and why i d want to migrate uiview animations which i m quite familiar with now to calayer animations on the iphone

1139739
uiview	subviews
a parent uiview with one subviews

1139750
post	get
if it s something else please post the specific message you get from netbeans

1139786
apache	nginx
why dont you do this in apache nginx where you use mod_rewrite or however nginx does rewrites to link to a non-existent page or instead send a 410 gone no longer exists flag

1139790
int	double	int	chars
ive tried putting them in as regular int string style with double quotes and chars style with single quotes

1139791
cvs	svn
clearcase snapshot views are basically the same thing you would have if you checked out a repository from svn or cvs - it s a local copy of the source code on your machine with pointers back into the central server for tools to query version history etc

1139811
uiview	calayer
uiview transforms are only 2d and are restricted to that layer transforms however can be 3d and you should use those if you want to do 3d stuff uiview animation will work if you change either the uiview transform or the calayer transform

1139822
inherited	properties
in magicdraw when clicking on the properties on a class you see in different boxes at the same time the own properties of the object and inherited ones and you can even change them which updates the superclass owning the properties

1139835
stdout	stderr
p popen firefox www.google.it shell true stdout pipe stderr pipe

1139843
int	chars
if you want to store a number store an int - or in this case a chars as you also need chars to be stored

1139844
equals	gethashcode
if you only want reference equality i think you re fine to not override gethashcode equals

1139847
openssl	gnutls	nss	gnutls
you need an implementation of tls transport layer security formerly known as secure sockets layer specified in rfc 5246 whether it be openssl gnutls ajisai yassl nss or your own implementation not recommended

1139904
spaces	delimiter
you can use spaces or a symbol as the delimiter

1139940
uiview	calayer
an uiview is always rendered to a calayer

1139940
uiview	calayer
when you use uiview methods to animate a view you are effectively manipulating the underlying calayer

1139978
inherited	properties
note all my entities inherited from a base class who contains a properties id

1140034
hide	show
if i were to use one generalized view i need to show hide a few fields depending on whether the items belong to a category or subcategory which might make it harder to maintain if category s item structure and subcategory s item structure becomes more different in the future

1140036
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket
the closest are component based frameworks like jsf wicket tapestry etc

1140048
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
base on my course unchecked-exception are basically a runtimeexception which mostly result of a program bug

1140056
equals	gethashcode
if you have written a class which implements its own equality that is different from reference equality then you are required to override gethashcode such that two objects that compare as equals have equals hash codes

1140056
put	get
you can put an object into a hash table mutate it and be unable to get it out again

1140062
background-image	background-position
if you give the .submit class the background-image property you can set the background-position property independently for each individual button and avoid having to repeat yourself several times

1140083
hash	salt
second a way with in my opinion good balance between effort and effect would be to add an extra column then when ever you change the values concatenate all the values add a secreat password to it better term would be salt run it through a cryptographic hash algorithm and put the result in the extra field

1140109
tinyint	boolean
notice where i have commented subsonic now maps the .net dbtype to the sqllite type boolean instead of tinyint

1140152
ant	maven
before anyone suggests a less frankensteinian build management framework like ant jam maven etc -- we re migrating to jam somewhat successfully

1140165
apache	nginx	postgresql	mysql
when you get to know php better it ll be time to enlarge you horizons and have a look at other oses windows linux mac database engines mysql sqlite postgresql ... webservers apache iis lighttp nginx ... .

1140173
ienumerable	icollection
i would suspect that your uniqueurls-collection is an ienumerable rather than an icollection or derivative and it doesn t have the count-property

1140197
cout	ofstream
std cout and an ofstream

1140273
width	margin
ie 7 and ie 8 do not render 2 consequent divs with float left on the same line if there is a table in one of the divs which is 100 width + non-zero margin

1140273
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
there is no such problem in firefox opera google-chrome and safari

cube	skybox
what they re asking you to do is almost the same thing only the texture wraps around a cube seamlessly like a skybox

1140602
switching	screens
if you switching between open tabs using key stroke ctrl+tab screens that appear will give you more information

1140636
mxmlc	compc
i have a standard makefile which automatically invokes compc mxmlc and asdoc as appropriate

in the following example i am animating the opacity property to 0.0 when the mouseenter and back to 1.0 when the mouseleave

1140648
google-chrome	firefox
i copied the following code that works in firefox 3.0 and ie7 but not google-chrome

1140656
hash	salt
also like niteria suggested try checking out the sql code in the debug dump to see what credentials are getting checked against the database you can make a call to to find out what the hash password should be once you have your salt applied

1140658
google-chrome	firefox
all right this was actually google-chrome caching more aggressively than firefox and ie

1140693
cvs	svn
i m starting in c++ development but i like to use gedit for writing the files but like for ruby on rails and many other languages are some tools and configurations for gedit that makes develop more easy and comfortable and another question what is the best for c++ svn cvs git and others..

1140699
post	get
this feature causes php to automatically escape get and post data when it loads

1140711
pull	push
branches and tags with git ls-remote and git update show you can pull get or push publish data with git fetch or git remote update git push and if server is configured to allow it you can get snapshot of state of remote repository with git archive --remote

1140714
ostream	istream
i would be fine if the istream and ostream components were locked separately but that is not the case

1140720
children	parent
so it is connecting with set of parent to set of children where there is many to many relationship

1140733
cvs	svn
as for source control the choice is between svn this is right successor of cvs and git

1140788
ostream	istream
i.e. have a separate istream and ostream which you yourself lock when they are invoked

1140794

1140923
postgresql	mysql
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

1140923
postgresql	mysql
i believe postgresql can use row level locking out of the box where mysql will depend on the storage engine you choose

1140923
innodb	myisam
myisam only locks at the table level and thus concurrency suffers but storage engines such as innodb for mysql can and will use row-level locking to increase throughput

1140923
innodb	myisam
my suggestion would be to start with myisam and move to innodb only if you find you need row level locking

1140959
hide	show
bonus points if there s a way to hide the spaces from the show whitespace characters

1140995
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu intrepid ibex and compiling c++ files with gcc but when i compile gcc makes a .out file that is the executable but how i can make linux executables

actionscript	haxe
it s small simple and written in haxe which for one is similar to actionscript and above that is a very cool language you should look into .

1141238
implements	modifiers
and i m using a namespace and the internal access modifiers to prevent providing a new implementation on implements classes

1141245
rss	feed
the yahoo boss and rss feed datasources should be useful examples

client-side	server-side
not all of the reasons given are necessarily valid but one important one is that unless you re google server-side cpu cycles are a lot more valuable than client-side cycles so it s easier to have the client compile optimize what is quite often dynamically generated html javascript rather than the server

1141271
for-loop	arrays	int	chars

mouse	keyboard
if i wanted to keep things simple for a program that only needed to display 3-d graphics and interact only by mouse and keyboard then i d probably be totally happy with glut

1141389

if you look at the utf-8 encoding int values 0..127 are the encodings for the original us-ascii chars set

1145940
int	chars
assuming you just want to see what bytes utf-8 chars is made of i suggest you stick to the int output you already have or maybe use hex if that is more sensible - as your 127 bytes arn t valid unicode you re unlikely to get consistent results across different programs

1145973
ubuntu	linux
remember that i m using linux ubuntu intrepid ibex

all of this is mostly about doing some or all of the work client-side which intrinsically scales up better than any purely server-side approach -- because by definition you get proportionally more computing power in your users browsers

1146768
for-loop	loops
in a for-loop there is only one iteration variable for all of the loops

1146780

1146940
multiplying	modulo
many hash functions combine the various elements in the data by multiplying them with some factors modulo the power of two corresponding to the word size of the machine that modulo is free by just letting the calculation overflow

1147231
maven	m2e
i get stuck with m2e and maven

1147232
int	chars
usually a simple hash function works by taking the component parts of the input chars in the case of a string and multiplying them by the powers of some constant and adding them together in some int type

1148947
put	get
so i couldn t get jquery to do it but plain old javascript as ddkilzer suggested works so i put together this function to apply the autocapitalize off option to all inputs with a specific class

1148964
powerpc	i386
i would like to know how you can support i386 and powerpc architectures for programs at bin

1148964
powerpc	i386
how do programs support i386 and powerpc in the source code

1148966
accessor	properties
a simple option would be to add a properties to your model object with an accessor that normalises the appropriate field short description in this case down to a suitable slug

1148972
post	put
the save method does a create or update but calling put or post is the exact same thing imo

1148980
powerpc	i386
be aware that there is more than just powerpc and i386 although these are the safest architectures to choose for a universal binary

1148980
powerpc	i386
there you can see that a modern osx binary is likely to contain any of powerpc ppc64 i386 or x86_64

1149000
inherited	subclassing
i also want to add that you must catch in order of inherited from lowest subclassing to highest parent class

1149043
client-side	server-side
essentially gwt provides client-side and server-side components

1149059
width	height
however i m looking for a solution to ease the inherent difficulties of string height width calculations and all of that arithmetic to make these uilabels line up with word wrapping nicely

1149069
powerpc	i386
what is going on is an internal implementation detail and may vary from release to release or even between different configurations of the same release 32 bit vs 64 bit iphone vs mac os x arm vs i386 vs powerpc

1149090
gdi	direct2d
if you re writing graphics code for windows 7 you should consider direct2d over gdi which has a programming model that is compatible with but very different than gdi s

1149133
stdout	stderr
an example where this would be useful is some sort of customizable logging routines where you might want to send the output to stdout console.out stderr console.error or nowhere system.io.textwriter.null or anything else based on some runtime condition

1149135
bash	zsh
his instructions assume bash but should work the same for zsh

1149140
daemons	launchd
the daemons as far as i understand it is just a convenient way to bypass having to manually launchd a program at boot

1149151
width	height
take a sample cgsize that is the same width as your cell but with a height larger than the max height you expect

1149154
ostream	istream
add the necessary operators istream ostream equal operator etc

1149158
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
a method for multiplication using only addition subtraction and doubling is called ancient egyptian multiplication

1149172
hide	show
this project uses a lot of rich interaction and show hide functionality based on a complex set of combinations of application states closer to what you would find in a flash flex application perhaps

1149177
post	get
when talking about some of them being more dangerous than others i would indeed separate and as it includes out from as it is slightly harder to generate manipulate a post request than a get request

1149177
post	get
that way you have have already excluded some very easy get drive-by attacks and can now focus on validating your post data

1149186
centos	linux
need to run linux preferably centos but also run windows virtualised for testing

1149205
crypt	hash
instead crypt is used to generate a hash of the password

1149205
crypt	hash
when you type in your password crypt is applied to that and then the two hash are compared

1149205
crypt	hash
essentially the function of crypt is to translate the text into some new text from which the original can never be recovered but which has a low probability of generating the same hash for two different keys

1149206
crypt	salt
the crypt function takes a password key as a string and a salt character array which is described below and returns a printable ascii string which starts with another salt

1149221
restructuredtext	asciidoc
latex markdown with pandoc in mind restructuredtext with pandoc or sphinx in mind asciidoc with docbook tools in mind and docbook with docbook tools in mind--see pandoc

1149233
kde	kubuntu
edit i am running on kubuntu 9.04 i386 using kde 4.3 via backports

1149250
pascal	delphi
delphi refers to both a programming language built around an object-oriented evolution of pascal known as object pascal and its associated rad ide development environment

1149250
pascal	delphi
that s a pretty formal definition though and you can generally use delphi and object pascal interchangeably

1149288
postgresql	mysql
if you want to go open source i would recommend using postgresql instead of mysql

1149295
hide	show
the safest and simplest method is to track when the keyboard hide show

1149369
crypt	salt
without salt crypt is basically just a one-way hashing function

1149369
hash	salt
the salt is usually randomly selected and if the salt are different then the hash passwords will be dramatically different

1149371
ready	each
you can have a field in the database for each image which means my thumbnail is ready so please include me in galleries

1149381
factors	mean
yea as mentioned in other posts gc know when to start collection better than you the factors that no buttons are clicked in your application doesn t mean that it is the time to start cleaning gc is doing some kind of lockings when moving the objects so this may cause low performance if you will abuse gc.collect

1149422
postgresql	mysql
the rails trunk has adapters for mysql postgresql and sqlite which you could base your adapter on

1149453
public	protected
my preferred solution for this would be to provide protected accessor functions to communicate clearly to the class s users that these are not part of the public interface

1149479
free	malloc
of course at this point you will probably want a deallocate function and make sure that this is always called to perform the corresponding free for the new malloc s

1149495
sorting	filtering
i want the iterator to support paging sorting and filtering of the data and ideally not iterate over a memory copy but to not even select the data in the first place perhaps linq to sql or entity framework would provide somthing similar

1149495
sorting	filtering
i think doing a sql data reader may be the ticket but if i am not mistaken you need to keep the connection open as you iterate which doesn t seem to make much sense the other approach is to just select the page of data return it and offer an iterator over that collection when you get to the end it pulls down next page this would work but means i have to cook up a lot of sql constructs to support sorting filtering and paging but in the end that may be the solution

1149515
pascal	delphi
you should also check out marco cantu s site and look for the essential pascal and essential delphi books

1149611
post	get
i chose this method after reading this post where cheeso has managed to get these two encryption methods to play together

1149624
geocoding	geocode
alternatively you can send geocoding requests directly to the http geocode

1149624
geocoding	geocode
more information on the http geocode service can be found here google api geocoding

1149644
folder	directory
then during the install method you could simply create a folder in the windows directory by using the variables of the environment class

1149659
accessor	properties
all java singleton patterns both this and the standard with private constructor and static accessor have this bad properties that if you to test them or test anything that even remotely depends on them can use this and only this object

1149692
cpython	ironpython
what would you use for a brand new cross platform gui app cpython or ironpython

1149706
superclass	subclassing
and object-oriented design principles tell us that you can use a subclassing in any place where you can also use its superclass but not the other way around

1149731
hash	md5
md5 or hashlib - calculating hash digest md5 eg to find duplicate files .

1149740
cpython	ironpython
if you like need to use .net framework use ironpython else cpython it s your choice

1149762
cpython	ironpython
use cpython with ironpython you are bound to .net platform which do not have much cross platform support mono is there on linux but still for a cross platform app i wouldn t recommend .net

1149762
wxpython	pyqt
so my suggestion is use cpython for gui use a framework like wxpython pyqt and you would be happy

1149816
rss	feed
i cant seem to find an api for this data anywhere - can anyone suggest such a thing perhaps as an rss feed

1149835
fflush	gets
what i would recommend is making a method of signalling that this cached data should be refreshed like a database-stored timestamp that gets looked at when session_start happens and if the cached data is older than the timestamp the cache is fflush

1149848
switching	screens
clicking somehwere else on the screens or switching applications by alt-tab

1149910
base-class	derived-class
note that he does go beyond the usual answers when someone will delete a derived-class object via a base-class pointer and make your destructor virtual if your class has any virtual functions

1149919
int	chars
now i have to supply contents of the list as chars data int length

1149998
wordpress	joomla
i just want to know about the files and folder structure for a site which is a plugin oriented like wordpress or joomla

1150013
allocator	stl
stl containers like std list and std vector have constructors accepting an allocator type

1150013
allocator	stl
this option is rarely used but using your own allocator in a real time environment is a good example of where this feature is useful and proves that the designers of stl did a very good job

1150062
getter	setter
i build in the entity a getter and setter for that collection

1150062
getter	setter
then for example from an ejb i retrieve the collection using the getter add or remove the desired course and finally use the setter to assign the new collection

1150095
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
it s not that hard once you pick a version control utility be it git svn hg bazaar

1150095
bazaar	git
popularity of git mercurial bazaar vs

1150097
ubuntu	linux
oh and skip web development on windows go install vmware server and install any distribution though for ease of use try ubuntu unless you are already on a linux machine mac it will save you lots of development headaches later on though may be a pain initially

1150097
postgresql	mysql
as for your question on databases even though the books may suggest using sqlite try and avoid it and go for something like postgresql instead of mysql the benefits will become obvious to you once you start looking at more advanced sql stuff

1150122
implements	extends
honestly i believe the hungarian notation was introduced with c# because there is not extends and implements keyword like in java

1150122
implements	extends
since php does have extends and implements keywords it makes sense to use the java convention

1150128
trac	bugzilla
svn also integrates with trac a bug tracking system and bugzilla so you can tie your work tickets to code

1150139
post	get
if data is too long for get what about using post

1150147
user-controls	tabcontrol
i have a xaml code that should load my user-controls inside the tabcontrol

1150150
post	get
observe the login process on the page if it s get or post method and if it uses a cookie

1150151
button	checkbox
i have three radio button and 4 checkbox

1150152
post	get
try using post instead of get

1150198
pascal	delphi
i haven t seen a pascal language resource as perfect as the delphi help itself

1150198
pascal	delphi
i hadn t heard about pascal before i got a copy of delphi

1150198
pascal	delphi
i learned pascal from delphi s help system object pascal reference

1150198
pascal	delphi
you will have an intermediate level understanding of pascal language from delphi help

1150245
converter	multibinding
your approach is perfectly valid though i would use a multibinding for the second example rather than a such a specialised converter though by placing all your logic into the xaml you are producing very high coupling between the way the application looks and the way that it behaves because of this you may want to look into the mvvm pattern to separate those things out

1150293
post	get
both have their flawa although get satisfaction s ui seems slicker and richer - for instance you can post images - something i m not sure you can do with uservoice

1150367
hide	show
i have a flash object that i am trying to show and hide along with the rest of my hidden div

1150371
wxpython	pyqt
i don t know how tolerable wxpython or pyqt are on windows and linux but the further you get from plain cocoa on os x the harder it gets to build and the less pleasant it gets to use

1150422
int	boolean
it preserves the type hierarchy between int and boolean

1150424
profiling	debugging
the .net framework has unmanaged debugging and profiling apis that i assume people companies are familiar with

1150424
profiling	debugging
are there other documented debugging profiling apis available

1150466
mouseup	mousedown
i used mousedown to trigger dnd but with that for example on windows context menus stop working because they are triggered on mouseup

1150520
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
i also know how to bind a sqldatasource or objectdatasource to a control on a form or listview

1150520
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
but how do i render a field from my sqldatasource or objectdatasource directly into the html

1150549
inherited	subclassing
well maybe yes one of the features of oo is subclassing and subclassing inherited is one of the things that s problematic to model store in a sql database

1150555
post	get
if you have any sort of control over the source code of php script on the other server it should be post data and not get

1150555
post	get
however if you have a very valid practical reasons to use get instead of post

1150557
hide	show
if the players still insist on being show you can hide them in the document.ready event

1150585
listview	gridview	gridview	formview	gridview	repeater	gridview	detailsview	formview	detailsview
for instance a gridview repeater listview formview or detailsview

1150626
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you are probably best off with a sortedlist or even better a sorteddictionary

1150647
width	height
it may not work fine if it is called when the map is hidden using display none since it would have zero height and width

1150650
free	malloc
as an old-skool c c++ developer it seems strange that allocating the normal way using malloc and free is only mentioned in some footnotes

1150650
free	malloc
i know that malloc and free work in objective-c but i m curious if it is common practice or not

1150665
free	malloc
it s perfectly fine to use malloc and free to do your own memory management

1150676
boost	allocator
custom allocator for our memory leak tracking system our instrumenting profiler and a few other systems we preallocate and or pool see boost pool allocs using a provided allocator -- usually for std set or std map but the principle is the same for std list

1150685
pthreads	fcntl
i believe fcntl is a pthreads function

1150687
free	malloc
in many cases it s advantageous to use malloc and free to avoid the overhead of the objective-c runtime

1150758
superclass	subclassing
say you have a simple class hierarchy consisting of superclass a and subclassing b

1150795
inherited	properties
what you likely need is to have a non-generic abstract base class for allocationnew that exposes a properties for the resource as a common base type even if the closest thing is object then have your generic implementation inherited and expose its own strongly-typed properties or for a cleaner approach have it replace the parent weakly-typed properties with your strongly-typed version

1150812
ubuntu	linux
is there a command line program for linux ubuntu which can generate a large image containing say 6 caps from a given video wmv laid out storyboard style i know on windows media player classic can do this

1150825
vtk	itk
itk is not built on top of vtk although they are related

1150825
vtk	itk
one can easily process data with itk and then switch to a vtk pipeline for the visualization and interaction functionality

1150825
vtk	itk
we have built fairly large and complex medical image processing and visualization applications experimental surgical planning in python using a combination of vtk itk and wxpython

1150837
rss	icalendar
the free plan provides you with 200mb storage access for two people unlimited repos milestone management bug tracking rss and icalendar support etc

1150843
integer	unsigned
would write my_int as a unsigned 32-bit integer and my_string as a length-prefixed string where the prefix is u16le. to read the file back you would flip the arrows

1150853
maya	blender
as a start hint for how to go about this in your modeling tool blender maya 3ds max etc. you model your avatar and all its clothes you need and rig them to the same skeleton

1150889
config	ini
it has some unique features like database migrations implementation of interfaces differs from languages like java php and others config files are not like ini files you can write code

1150899
g++	gcc
i don t find g++ s asm ugly or hard to understand though i ve been working with gcc for over 8 years now

1150913
irrlicht	ogre3d
a couple of people have said ogre3d i ll offer up irrlicht as an alternative

1150943
jython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
it so happens that these specific tactics and heuristics given their clearly-positive tradeoffs have been pervasive in all recent versions of cpython and i believe ironpython jython and pypy as well

1150957
hide	show
ignoring the javascript needed to show it hide it and change its colours

1150957
for-loop	arrays
before you think about the html involved think about how your for-loop would know when it reaches the end of a page in your arrays and how it would start a new one

1150957
hide	show
as you probably know css can be used to change colours when the mouse moves over items and you can use jquery to apply handlers and show hide your divs

1150964
post	get
it s sensible if you post a lot of tweets to use the rpp parameter so that your feed doesn t get clipped at 15

1150981
ncover	nant
about nant integration ncover has its own nant task

1150981
gendarme	fxcop
for a fxcop replacement check out gendarme

1150988
serializable	deserialization
just as a side note in our case as we had other constraints as runtime definition of types and we ended up building our own meta-type-system to build types at runtime a type of variant and then we ended up implementing deserialization for those types boost style so our serializable don t work with basic c++ types but rather with serializable data pairs

1150995
post	get
shouldn t a method such as that below have an http method of get rather than the specified post

1151012
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example our api has the capability to work entirely with post requests because it needs to be called by flash which has bugs with get cannot send request headers and cannot send put or delete

1151029
ubuntu	linux
i am specifically running ubuntu gnu linux with a 2.6.27-9 kernel

1151037
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
there are the openfiledialog and savefiledialog classes

1151058

not very relevant but i also used nginx and postgresql over my usual choices of apache and mysql i have no problem with apache and mysql i just thought i d try something new

1151131
subtract	add
you need only add subtract the offset to the geopolitical time zone offset in the past present or future

1151134
projectile	angle
generate a path given the angle and velocity of the projectile banana

1151161
pseudo-class	visited
the pseudo-class link visited hover active don t do exactly what i want which is to highlight the last-clicked link on a page to be a different color from all of the other links on the page

1151191
xslt	xquery
if you use the saxon xslt xquery engine there is an early implementation of xml schema 1.1 included for experimentation

1151204
subtraction	addition
date subtraction addition could then be built on that

1151266
accessor	properties
using objective c accessor and properties instead of directly setting ivars and using retain release simplifies doing the right thing quite a bit

1151282
subtraction	addition
with the 60-or-so-bit-integer class in hand supporting addition subtraction comparison through corresponding methods or helper functions you can then write a customdatetime class which supports all your required logic

1151285
cpu	affinity
how can the cpu affinity of a process be set in kernel module

1151306
rss	feed
i would like to install a growl alert for rss feed

1151327
post	get
the biggest problem with is you may be trying to get data from a post d form but might have a get parameter with the same name

1151327
post	get
there are slight security benefits - it s easier to perform xss more specifically xsrf attacks on get parameters which is possible if you use when you really just want post data

1151327
post	get
there s very few situations when you need data either from post get or cookie

1151327
post	get
if you want to get post data use if you want to get data from from get parameters use if you want cookie data use

1151334
subtract	add
so just add up all the numbers in the array subtract 500 000 500 000 and you ll be left with the number that occured twice

1151408
curb	libcurl
i m working on a windows machine and trying to get the curb plugin to work first thing i realized was i needed the libcurl library installed on my machine so that s what i m looking to do

1151445

you might get some help from a similar question architectural question in what assembly should i put which class for a clean solution

1151504
direct3d	directwrite
in windows 7 back-filled for vista once windows 7 ships you ll be able to use directwrite for high quality typography in a direct3d rendering context d3d10 and later

1151516
keydown	keyup
when a keydown event is thrown the down key is placed in set and removed on keyup

1151516
hid	keyboard
it seems to work well and because it uses the standard keyboard event system rather than hid there shouldn t be any compatibility issues

1151525
folder	directory
googling around i found out that there is no hard reason not to dump them all into a single directory as long as you don t ask the underlying os to do a folder listing

1151566
keydown	keyup
if you are trying to detect multiple key presses at the same time then you need to keep track of the key states yourself between keydown and keyup

1151566
keydown	keyup
then if you released f while still holding g your would get a keyup for f while continuing to receive keydown for g

1151584
ienumerable	ilist
linq has a orderby method that works on all ienumerable t including ilist t

1151606
uiview	subviews

1151621
opera	google-chrome
fim should only be used when the html5 postmessage api supported by ie8 ff3 google-chrome and opera 10 is not available as postmessage is more secure and more reliable

1151643
width	height
do the zoom by animating your width height position if necessary to the full size of the final image

1151759
post	get
the gist of the post says that autorelease pools are cheap the program continued to get more efficient with fewer objects per pool right up to somewhere around the 10 objects 1 pool ratio

1151839
colt	mtj
the developer has posted some benchmarks in which jblas comes off favourably against mtj and colt

1151844
qthread	qobject
from cjhuitt s answer isn t necessary anymore it was in qt 4.1 since connect defaults to qt autoconnection which now qt 4.2 does the right thing and switches between queued and direct connection mode based on qthread currentthread and the thread affinity of the receiver qobject at emit time instead of sender and receiver affinity at connect time

1151847
post	get
use jquery s built in support for ajax to make get post ajax calls it s very simple simpler than the update panel i would say and absolutely compatible with most browsers

1151854
google-chrome	firefox
edit looks like in firefox 3 and google-chrome you can t make alias so easily

1151867
width	height
the compile error you get is because you try to pass a qsizepolicy policy to setsizepolicy qsizepolicy but there s no implicit conversion from qsizepolicy policy which is the policy for one dimension to qsizepolicy which is a class containing among other things one policy per dimension height width

1151874
post	get
livehttpheaders shows all information like type of method post or get and headers body etc

1151874
post	get
it also show post or get parameters in headers

1151904
post	get
non-ajax get post using jquery plugin

1151912
cvs	svn
i m currently working on cvs and switching to svn soon and i wanted to know about ways to store binaries

1151928
keyczar	cryptlib
i would recommend using a high level library that provides a sign message function like cryptlib or keyczar if you can

1151954
jquery	scriptaculous
any framework jquery dojo scriptaculous etc. is welcomed

1151987
serializable	deserialization
exception message error during serializable or deserialization using the json javascriptserializer

1152018
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you were using jquery however you could use mouseenter mouseleave events

1152019
cvs	svn
cvs is quite bad than svn in this kind of comparison

1152079
implements	extends
you can implements your own scoring algorithm by extends similarity class and passing it during search

1152080
post	get
there is an understanding that all user input will be escaped upon retrieval from the post or get

1152095
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have a js script that works on ie8 compatibility mode firefox google-chrome opera but not ie8 standards mode

1152159
min	max
you just need to set min and max values and jquery will do the calculation

1152160
stdout	fflush
this partially works in that i do get the contents of stdout but instead of as the progress messages are sent i get it once the command line application exits and it seems to fflush stdout in one go

1152168
folder	dir
alternatively you can write the file to a temp folder and only after written move it to the target dir

1152193
post	get
the built in classes only support get and limited post

1152203
width	height
has a corresponding pixel height and width which effectively define the ratio and are proportionally maintained when the canvas is stretched to 80

1152231
jsf	wicket	jsf	stripes	struts	wicket	struts	stripes	wicket	stripes
yes with java you have web frameworks like jsf struts struts2 wicket springmvc stripes tepestry facelets

1152231
teradata	informix
ive even used informix and teradata

1152237
getter	setter
of course it must be declared as a property for getter and setter

1152252
maven	pom.xml
edit2 you can put all your plugins into your own repository and then you need to tell maven using the pom.xml which repositories you want to use

1152331
many-to-many	one-to-many
databases usually work on relational model you have tables simplifying like a spreadsheet and relations between them - one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many etc meaning for instance that one record in table a has many related records in table b

1152359
maven	pom.xml
a major advantage of this is that you can define a single set of plugin configs in a shared parent pom.xml and reuse the same configurations across across all your projects while still being able to override the inherited configuration in each subproject where necessary - this is one of the biggest advantages of using maven on larger projects

the compiler will not be able to optimize out any of the computations that placed values in the array but you ll still get any other optimizations it can put in to make the code fast

1152405
postgresql	mysql
now i ll need to do the same with postgresql the project is getting mature and mysql

1152413
easymock	jmock
what i ve seen is while it is entirely possible to write the tests using any of the mocking apis - jmock easymock etc they typically work straight-off the logic is so basic how couldn t they only breaking when you change the code adding a value for example and that just makes them a burden on the code base

1152432
maven	pom.xml
if maven has access to the central repository it will download most plugins some are not hosted on central to access those you need to define an additional repository in your pom.xml or settings

1152727
ostream	istream
important both istream and ostream must be ivars part of your class declaration

1152727
ostream	istream
presuming this is what i think it is you should be able to remove the fixes add sometihng like nslog self is p istream is p ostream is p self istream ostream and then wait for it to crash

1152727
ostream	istream
the values for istream and ostream should be the same as whatever nslog spit out

1152727
ostream	istream
for each of self istream ostream

1152930
internationalization	localization
are you asking about internationalization localization

1152953
public	protected
although to actually use it outside the class the method is in you need to set the access of samplemethod to public rather than protected in all of the cases it appears so

1152960
public	protected
i have tried changing the type of method private protected etc but there is often conflicting needs by fxcop and the unit tests fxcop saying it doesnt like contructors with virtual methods but the unit saying that the methods should be public protected virtual or protected internal virtual catch 22 a lil bit

1152962
width	height
the example above will double the height and width of an image over a period of two seconds

hence if i need to modify my data access replace entity framework or upgrade to versioning 4 when it is out of beta my views and viewmodels are isolated from the changes required in the bcs

1153473
postgresql	mysql
but if your store_id is indexed properly and it most probably is if it s a primary key which it looks like then all modern versions of major databases that is oracle sql server mysql and postgresql will use an efficient plan to perform this query

ant	maven
one approach is to re-generate a constants.java file in the first phase of your build script ant maven or whatever else you use

1153646
realloc	malloc
and allocate instances with malloc realloc like that

1153769
mouse	keyboard
2 popupmenu signal is only invoked for keyboard shortcuts shift+f10 or menu button not mouse right clicks

1154252
getter	setter
the xmlserializer serialises the type by reading all the type s properties that have both a public getter and a public setter and also any public fields

1154274
put	get
you can however generate a url to get the image and put that in the jsp

1154274
put	get
if you can t encapsulate that in a get url you may need to add extra information and put it in the httpsession so it can be retrieved on the next get image request

1154316
width	height
you may try just not specifying a width height on your usercontrol

1154329
width	height
this happens if you haven t set the height and width css style for the panel

1154329

works fine but when a try to upgrade to a newer versioning of jquery wich i need for other functionality it stops working

1154788
boost	stl
for instance in c++ you have a lot of approaches that come from a functional programming perspective stl algorithms boost bind boost lambda etc

1154788
haskell	scheme	scheme	prolog
i personally know haskell scheme and prolog and i thing that if you start straight away with unifications spanning search rules and so on it might blow up your mind a bit it could blow up mine at least

1154826
client-side	server-side
validators tend to operate client-side by default enabledclientscript defaults to true but if you choose to push them server-side you simply need to look at the isvalid property of the page to see if the validators were successful

1154832
domxpath	domdocument
the domxpath beeing constructed with the domdocument as parameter maybe it ll work.

1154847
getter	setter
it s getter and setter reference a private char variable which is y n

1154847
getter	setter
i then have another protected property which is included in the hibernate mapping and it s getter and setter reference the private char variable directly

1154855
post	get
just use the basics of the web the client can use get to fetch information and post to send it

mvp	presenter
however it has a close relative called mvp model view presenter which never the two will meet

1155053
put	get
using a protocol like http correctly except to get around places where its implementation is broken like with the lack of put support etc is necessary but not sufficient to be restful

1155074
mousemove	mousedown	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove
advanceddatagrid already has logic built in to handle the mousemove mouseover mousedown events so there s no need to recreate it

1155116
client-side	server-side
in terms of whether you do processing server-side or client-side that would depend on how many concurrent clients you would need to service and whether you could use caching for any of the responses

1155132
post	get
one way to get around all of this is to effectively have the object post any necessary information needed to commit the uploads back in the querystring

1155166
exponent	modulo
but if you are looking for performance gains in your random indexing algorithm you may be able to just crack the ieee 754 encoded double into its exponent and fraction - and use the fraction modulo the array size as a random index

1155185
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome s problem and thus safari s problem later was easily fixed

1155194
ubuntu	linux

all content should be chown d chgrp d to the same user that apache is running as

1155291
jar	war
jar cf jror.war -c tmp war

1155327
serializable	deserialization
you could either use an xml transform to convert these two values or you could implement the ixmlserializable interface and do the serializable and deserialization on your own

1155329
mouseup	mousedown
in the subclass respond to both mousedown and mouseup by creating a new mouse event based on the one you received only with the nscommandkeymask flag ored into the modifier flags and passing the new event up to super

1155570
for-loop	loops
variables should do this you don t define int i for your for-loop until you ve reached loops etc

1155623
public	protected
a type that inherits another type cannot see private parts of that other type it can see protected internal and public parts

1155663

the distinguishing feature between these two seems to be that canvas3d is the standard awt -like heavyweight component and jcanvas3d is meant to be its swing counterpart

1155706
post	get
a the second request is a get not a post

1155717
width	height
i m trying to create a table with each cell having a fixed width but absolute but varying height

1155738
tax	shipping
also the more plugin type features that it might support such as tax shipping etc

1155775
cvs	svn
i think you need to learn the differences similarities between cvs and svn

1155775
cvs	svn
here s a start cvs-crossover-guide and svn for cvs users

1155784
wordpress	joomla
the problem is that the lighter cms systems out there don t usually offer a lot - which is why wordpress joomla drupal have made it so big

1155800
google-chrome	firefox
ie is stacking the above margin on top of the legend whereas firefox google-chrome etc

1155903
pyodbc	adodbapi
i d use adodbapi instead of pyodbc which would get me unicode but adodbapi gives me other problems.

1155906
post	get
now because of your mtype in the grid options the grid is going to do a get not a post

1155935
vb6	vba
.net script vba vb6 it doesn t matter which one

1155940
kerberos	ntlm
if you re using system.net.credentialcache then your web service needs to be in a trusted domain accessed over https and using either ntlm kerberos or digest auth otherwise it does not pass the credentials from the cache

1155980
cos	sqrt
if the form is a linear addition of basis functions f x a + b cos x + c sqrt x then using least-squares can get you the unknown coefficients for the best fit using those basis functions

1155997
restrict	shared
using a shared schema approach requires you to intercept and decorate all of your queries with additional information to restrict the results

1156016
post	put	post	get	put	get
rails auto-generates post get delete put stuff for you but it s just as easy to do in django too - and it really doesn t have much to do with rest either it s just proper http usage

1156054
post	get
i d prefer to use get for this but solution that uses post to submit the data is also viable

1156054
post	get
it has to be a clean get or post with page reload

1156084
inherited	properties
if you need to do so in the designer you can look at several good tutorials about how to make your inherited controls show their new properties in the designer like this one

1156108
post	get
get or post will probably depend on the size of your data there is a limit on the amout of data you can pass through get something like 2000 bytes

1156117
pop-up	dialog
to make sure i created a pop-up dialog box in the rule too and i found every time i enable the conditional formatting to change the text field as read-only the dialog box will not show

1156140
rss	feed	rss	icalendar
i was thinking of using an rss feed but that defeats the purpose of using icals and would require a rss to icalendar converter which seems unnecessary

1156157
firefox	safari
simple clicks gives you comparisons between internet explorer 6 the native version of internet explorer installed other browsers you may have installed locally â firefox 3.5 safari 3 safari 4 â and even an bitmap images of website prototypes

1156207
converter	multibinding
the purpose of imultivalueconverter is to implement converter that support multiple bindings multibinding objects

1156241
hide	show
it s the only method that is publicly exposed that may show hide the callout bubble

1156273
stdout	stderr
if you do not go the assert route i would recommend at least dumping a message out to stdout or stderr

1156286
width	height
ie6 uses width and height as suggestions and will expand divs to fit the content

1156319
post	get
if it s just a simple flat array you don t need to do anything fancy as php has a built in feature to parse array syntax from get post variable names

1156375
width	height
setting both top and bottom but not a height can be used to stretch your vertically based on the height of its parent and similarly for left right and width

1156388
firefox	safari
all the other browsers i tested safari 4 and firefox 3.5 on windows and firefox 3.0 on linux use n

1156391
yacc	bison

open a project from a maven pom.xml

1156409
vbscript	jscript
jscript vbscript or batch

1156433
.htaccess	httpd.conf
an .htaccess or apache s configuration httpd.conf could also be responsible

1156472
equals	gethashcode
in .net you need that equals object and gethashcode are compatible

1156472
equals	gethashcode
implement equals separately from gethashcode

1156472
equals	gethashcode
implement a greater precision gethashcode64 the overrided gethashcode 32 bits will return int gethashcode64 and equals will return this.gethashcode64 other.gethashcode64

1156486
equals	gethashcode
say you add two objects to a hashset that have the same hashcode then the container will use the gethashcode first to find where approximately in the hashset the object is then use the equals on all the matching objects to find your exact object

1156487
equals	gethashcode
it s a good idea to keep the implementation of equals separate from gethashcode because they do quite different things

1156490
post	get
the request s get or post dictionary will have the information

1156496
equals	gethashcode
edit equals methods then can use gethashcode but only to return false when hashes differ

1156518
subtraction	addition
what you re looking for are the binary addition and subtraction operators

1156521
hide	show
if you just want to show hide it you can do the following

1156524
equals	gethashcode
you shouldn t implement equals in term of gethashcode ever

1156524
equals	gethashcode
it s perfectly valid for gethashcode to have collisions but equals must not return false positives

1156524
equals	gethashcode
in fact it s perfectly fine to always return 0 in gethashcode and only implement equals

1156526
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
you might be able to use the css zoom property - supported in ie 5.5+ opera and safari 4 and google-chrome

most of the templates are in freemarker although there are still some of them in velocity depending on your struts2 version

1156591
serializable	deserialization
at first i thought it might have been the gzip compression that was causing the slowdown but removing it only skimmed a few hundred milliseconds from the serializable deserialization routines

1156608
serializable	deserialization
i have looked at many examples of serializable deserialization and i just want to get some feedback as i am sure my code could be improved

1156621
put	get
you get full control of the message and then you can implement a custom form builder that can put the error messages inline which is nicer for the user

1156630
serializable	deserialization
however serializable and deserialization especially of large dictionaries tends to be very slow in general

1156635
put	get
sure i didn t get filthy rich from them but i gained a lot of experience that i m able to put down on a resume or convey during an interview

1156641
serializable	deserialization
if deserialization is taking a lot of time you could if you have multiple processors spawn multiple threds to do the serializable in parallel

1156709
disk	ram
disk is bigger than ram

1156788
implements	extends
on the extends vs implements topic allen holub goes a bit over the top to explain the preference for interfaces

1160756
getter	setter
there is another subtlety not yet mentioned synthesize will let you provide an implementation yourself of either a getter or a setter

this is useful if you only want to implement the getter for some extra logic but let the compiler generate the setter which for objects is usually a bit more complex to write yourself

1161417
crypt	hash
newer implementations of crypt 3 are way beyond brute force since they re based on better hash algorithms than the des-based one that old crypt 3 used

post	get
the initial passing of a textbox input value to the server happens via traditional get or post variables passed in the http connection it s not related to the postback viewstate functionality of asp.net

1161740

it is perfectly legal and often sensible to test for exactly zero before a division or logarithm since the answer is well defined for any non-zero value

1161752
accessor	properties
your favoritecolor properties needs to have both a get and a set accessor

1161767

1162113
crypt	hash
by design intent crypt is a one-way hash

1162113
crypt	salt
jeff had a blog post on rainbow tables too . salt helps protect against rainbow tables because you would need a table set for each possible value of the salt but the size of the salt used in the classic implementation of crypt is only 12 bits so that isn t as huge a block as might be hoped

1162834
accessor	properties
using the public accessor to set the properties to nil in dealloc either self setfoo nil or self.foo nil may have unwanted side effects

1162850
stdout	fflush
the real issue seems to be that if a process doesn t explicitly fflush its stdout then anything written to stdout is buffered rather than actually sent until the process is done so as to minimize io this is apparently an implementation detail of many c libraries made so that throughput is maximized through less frequent io

1162850
stdout	fflush
if you can easily modify the process so that it fflush stdout regularly then that would be your solution

1162858

1163105
networkstream	binaryreader
alternately maybe you can avoid using a to store data fragments and instead wrap your server-side client socket in a networkstream wrapped in a binaryreader so that you can read the components of your message direclty from the socket without worrying about buffer sizes

1163118
getter	setter
provide getter and setter functions for access to static file scope variables in your module

also removed view because it was gratuitous a uilabel is a uiview you were stacking three view 2 of which have nothing but a single subviews which covers its full frame. and it elided the uiviewcontroller view property in general it is bad to make local variables with the same name as instance variables or properties there are compiler warnings you can turn on to avoid that

1163561
postgresql	mysql
for example postgresql uses a process per connection mysql uses a thread

1163578
division	multiplication

move	drag
the latter depends on the their system settings the window move as they drag versus just dragging an outline

1164954
uiview	calayer
all instances of uiview and classes derived from it have an associated calayer object accessed via the layer property that provides the uiview s visual appearance

1165002
cpython	ironpython
not sure if this matters but i ll be trying to use this under ironpython rather than cpython

1165011
mkplacemark	mkreversegeocoder
mkreversegeocoder will give you an instance of mkplacemark so you ll probably also want to check out the documentation for that too

1165012
range	minimum
you can build res for the maximum or minimum number of digits for a range using a base 10 logarithm

1165013
put	get
i d say you could get that up and running in a couple of hours - then you could put your feet up for a few more hours while it did its work -

1165067
google-chrome	firefox
below works in google-chrome 2 firefox 3.5 and ie8

1165095
post	get
most of the security issues related to php come from using unparsed outside get post cookie variables

1165122
rss	feed
i wrote another quick script which connects and prints out the default response an rss feed of submitted items

1165148
post	get
since someone said that my previous post was off-topic i ll try to compensate - nosql is not and never was intended to be a replacement for more mainstream sql databases but a couple of words are in order to get things in the right perspective

1165196
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i ve never seen any reason to believe that visual studio calls svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe

1165218
int	chars
you tell it ok give me the next chunk of chars in this set or give me the int you find in the string and those start at the current index and move forward until they find something that doesn t match

1165218
put	get
if you really wanted to use nsscanner you could put something like that in a loop and keep checking for a no return value and if you get that you can increment the scanlocation and scan again

1165233
put	get
i disagree with this so i thought i d put it to some other developers to get a third party opinion

1165348
multiplying	multiplication
if an approximation would be valid you could try a multiplication by something like 0.1875 0.125+0.0625 this means multiplying by 3 and shift down by 4 places

1165349
width	height
don t know about that bug but one possible solution is to set height and width to 0px instead maybe

1165383
put	get
if you put quotes around the element name with a . you can get it

1165409
inherited	properties
the main point is that with an interface you need to provide the entire contract with every class that implements it with an inherited tree base classes you are only changing adding the properties and methods that are unique to the child class common properties and methods remain in the base class

1165457
for-loop	loops
would it run fast if i change the most outer for-loop to while loops

1165466
for-loop	loops
the only difference between a for-loop and a while loops is the syntax for defining them

1165466
for-loop	loops
actually the for-loop is a little better because the i will be out of scope after loops while the i will stick around in the while loops case.

1165467
entity-relationship	diagram
you should really consider your whole database structure and do a entity-relationship diagram entity relationship diagram first

1165553
ant	maven
i don t use gradle in anger myself just a toy project so far author means they have used gradle on only a toy project so far not that gradle is a toy project - see comments but i d say that the reasons one would consider using it would be because of the frustrations of ant and maven

1165553
ant	maven
experienced ant users find this particularly jarring as maven removes many of the freedoms you have in ant

1165553
ant	maven
maven configuration is very verbose though maven 3 promises to address this and if you want to do anything that is not the maven way you have to write a plugin or use the hacky ant integration

1165553
ant	maven
gradle promises to hit the sweet spot between ant and maven

1165553
ant	maven
so if you ve hit and got stuck with any of the ant maven pain points it is probably worth trying gradle out though in my opinion it remains to be seen if you wouldn t just be trading known problems for unknown ones

1165555
width	height
if that doesn t work remove the width and height properties from the page but keep the scrollviewer

1165563
hide	show
create a single instance of the tooltip and use it whenever you like to show it using the settooltip method and use hide method to hide it

1165594
for-loop	loops
even if the hypothesis of the while loops being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are executed more times

1165609
hide	show
i would then hide all divs that don t have the selected class and show the div that does have the selected class

1165626
prepare	execute
there is prepare and execute which can run a sql statement from inside a user variable so could probably use something similar to untested

1165665
equals	gethashcode
however one idea that comes to mind is to create a separate class to just represent the key and override its equals and gethashcode methods

1165665
equals	gethashcode
they would use the individual fields using case-insensitive comparison in equals and xor ing the hash codes in gethashcode

1165686
min	max
it should return customer objects ordered by their order dates filtered by a min and max date

1165693
for-loop	loops
usually in a for-loop you loops n time

1165700
google-chrome	firefox
when i hard code the fade works as expected in ie firefox and google-chrome

1165725
mouseover	mouseout
then i want to set mouseover and mouseout event for the image to disp the employee info in a popup box

1165725
mouseover	mouseout
then i need to write some jquery code for mouseover event to get the data from the action and code for mouseout to close popup box if it is showing on

1165733
cpu	processors
you need to have as many threads running as there are cpu cores available in order to be able to potentially use all the processors time

1165795
int	double
however when you copy a value type a struct like int or double a copy of the entire thing is made the value of a value type is the thing itself

inherited	properties
why databinding mechanism does not see properties inherited from other interfaces

1165829
swt	swing
i would recommend sticking to swing or swt and seeing what you can do with their look and feel mechanism but don t expect miracles

1165896
stdout	stderr
i have seen this cause problems for example .delete_on_error rules donâ t always run if stderr is redirected to stdout

1165906
put	get
1 put all the win32 calls used into function pointers and pass them in to the functions or classes depending on how many times they are hit that use them and use this to get mock results

1165919
inherited	properties
so binding to ichild does not inherited the parenttext properties

1165959
substance	jide
some lafs also offer support for widgets substance supports some of jide and swingx

1165959
awt	swing
if you re pure swing awt no problems

1165959
substance	jide
would love to use substance but no jide support

1165967
int	double
i ve run across a number of cases where a pattern for accessing items in a keyed collection like a dictionary is encumbered by the fact that the type of the key is not a simple type string int double etc and isn t something that you would want to promote to an actual named class

1165967
equals	gethashcode
unlike struct s these dynamically generated classes provide an implementation of both equals and gethashcode - which are designed to work well with dictionary and hashtable implementation in .net

1165967
equals	gethashcode
i ve hijacked this feature to create an opaque key - essentially a generic class that allows you to create keys on the fly by providing the types that are part of the key - and using an anonymous class to actually provide the equals gethashcode behavior

1165967
inherited	properties
we can even make improvements by allowing the opaquekey class to be inherited from so that it s properties and constructor parameters can be given more instructive names

1165995
keydown	keyup
try listening for keyup or keydown instead of keypress per this so post

1166021
equals	gethashcode
the equals gethashcode will be fine

1166022
setinterval	settimeout
you would have to make your processing code use settimeout setinterval from the start this code would end up working in both a worker and on a normal web site

1166057
mailmerge	openoffice.org
i m currently trying to do a mailmerge using c# and openoffice.org

1166075
firefox	safari
my current solution is working in safari but in firefox only the end quote displays although the space for the beginning quote is there

1166142
width	height
dockpanel will automatically fill in the remaining space with the last item that does not have a dockpanel.dock attached property specified and a height width specified

1166153
equals	gethashcode
system.array does not override gethashcode or equals so they use reference equality

1166184
portrait	landscape
i am impressed so far but i cannot find out how to set the page orientation in my new report from portrait to landscape

1166184
portrait	landscape
how do i change the page orientation from portrait to landscape for my new ssrs report

1166199
int	double
you can use it for any ordered types like int s or double s

1166232
versioning	upgrade
so far we ve only been rolling out complete versioning either versioning 1.0 or versioning 1.5 but no upgrade from 1.0 to 1.2 to 1.3 to ..

1166232
versioning	upgrade
so any customer that get versioning 1.0 cannot upgrade to versioning 1.2 or 1.3 or even the latest

1166232
versioning	upgrade
check the table in database that stores the versioning info and depending on it run different script to upgrade database

1166233
versioning	upgrade
this started happening after a versioning upgrade but happens to no one else

1166235
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

1166330
hide	show
assuming your using prototype you should use the ajax.responders to do the show hide

1166339
filtering	grouping
the query is just a reference to an implementation of which in turn knows about another along with appropriate delegates for filtering grouping etc

1166349
put	get
the question is why if i get the number of task from an external source the workflow doesn t work but if i put a constant number of tasks the workflow works well

1166351
merb	ruby-on-rails
in that case you would most likely use the system of organization imposed by your framework ruby-on-rails merb sinatra etc.

1166388
qcombobox	qtextedit
the sizehint calculation won t be entirely trivial and will be way easier for qlineedit than for qtextedit which is secretly a qabstractscrollarea but you can look at the sizehint and minimumsizehint implementations for inspiration also the one for qcombobox which has a mode to do exactly what you want qcombobox adjusttocontents

1166388
qlabel	qtextbrowser	qlineedit	qlabel	qlineedit	qtextbrowser
edit your two usecases qtextbrowser w o scrollbars and qlineedit instead of qlabel just for selecting the text in there can be solved by using a qlabel and a recent enough qt

1166429
dictionary	map
another alternative to an if statement is a map dictionary in c# i believe that has a lookup based on the type to either a builder object or the object itself if it is immutable or to an instance of the object that can copy itself

1166493
centos	solaris
while porting old solaris 2.4 code to centos 5.3 i came across an invocation like

1166507
free	malloc
my concern is as follows say there is an incorrect mixup in the use of malloc free and

1166519
equals	gethashcode
if you want something more ad hoc i ve found that the code that resharper generates for equals and gethashcode is fine

1166524
free	malloc
if you find you must use both for instance if you re interfacing with a c library thorough code reviews should carefully scrutinize any uses of free to determine whether or not they correspond to a malloc and whether or not they are being used in a c context

1166527
free	malloc
the same goes for malloc and free

1166527
free	malloc
also new and delete doesn t necessarily use malloc free for its allocations so you might end up corrupting your heap as well

1166537
free	malloc
the easy way to not get them mixed up is never to use malloc then you will never be tempted to call free

1166537
free	malloc
the infrastructure to create to avoid this problem is called code review though in this case a quick grep malloc or grep free on the codebase will probably suffice

1166550
free	malloc
always use delete for things allocated with new for things allocated with and free for things allocated using malloc

1166550
free	malloc
new and new allocate from different heaps than malloc and using the wrong free delete will attempt to deallocate from the wrong heap

1166558
free	malloc
to answer the second question if you control both malloc free and operator new delete you can stash extra information to associate with pointers returned by both that tell you how they were allocated

1166581
free	malloc
never using malloc free in the first place or

1166590
free	malloc
never mix new delete with or with malloc free

1166590
free	malloc
atop of this the use of malloc free in c++ is questionable at least

1166648
profiling	instrumentation
it would do things similar to what profiling tools do when they instrumentation your app

1166668
versioning	upgrade
in the short term how do i upgrade from .3053 to .3082 and in the medium term how do i ensure my entire team is on the same .net runtime versioning

1166712
versioning	upgrade
i really like the idea of red-gate s sql packager which will diff your two database versioning and then create a sql script a c# project or a stand-alone executable to upgrade from versioning 1 to versioning 2

1166729
typedef	struct
why should we typedef a struct so often in c

1166729
typedef	struct
typedef struct rsquo

1166760
int	chars
nsthread doesn t take primitives like int or chars so you have to use nsnumber

1166778
typedef	struct
usage of typedef for struct in c is explained here

1166783
typedef	struct
not sure about referring to static functions and typedef in the unnamed struct when you do the definition this way - i never do

1166810
typedef	struct
you must not state that it is a struct since the keyword typedef allows you to actually define a data type in this case person and you pass it this way

1166818
implements	extends
extends the delegate range could be implements via currying and partial function application

1166878
post	get
another thing to check might be the config file - specifically the httphandler declaration verbs get post

1166898
free	malloc
malloc ed buffers or buffers returned from a c api which caller must free must be assigned to a private pointer field of an object

1166898
free	malloc
in other words stick a wrapper around anything that uses malloc free

1166898
free	malloc
then in code review if you see a call to malloc free anywhere else it s wrong

1166938
src	attr
for instance you could call #imgthumbnail attr src value

1166988
profiler	vtune
if it s a native application then the intel vtune profiler is pretty powerful

1166994
src	attr
src is however both a html attribute and you can access those with the attr method

1167010
cvs	svn
to get svn and presumably cvs to work again

1167019
width	margin
the body width is also set to 100 margin 0

1167073

my keydown and keyup method are as follows

1167111
put	get
how can i make it so when you select something from the list the number enclosed in parentheses does not get put into the text field

1167141
min	max
you cannot specify max and min zoom and i don t know of a way to hack it in

1167180
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
as an alternative you could use dataoutputstream to store the int s in a bytearrayoutputstream

1167186
uiview	subviews
from the image i m adding a number of uiview as subviews to my main uiviewcontroller.view the number of views to add varies based on user selectable data

1167186
uiview	subviews
because i want to improve the gui i want to overlay an uiviewimage as the top subviews of the added uiview something like in the image

1167255
free	strdup	strdup	strtok
the older way to work with strtok was to use strdup in the allocate and free later

1167309
cvs	svn
i know there is tortoisecvs but i m wondering if there is an easy way of sucking down source code in a cvs repository just using svn tools without having to install cvs tools

1167309
cvs	svn
since svn seems to have taken the preferred spot in oss i have to believe somebody has written a tool that will map cvs databases to svn repositories

1167309
cvs	svn
based on a few responses while migrating off of cvs to svn is cool mostly i m looking for a way for me to use my svn client to pull from a cvs database with little or no fuss much like you can do with svnbridge a real-time svn bridge to tfs

1167320
width	height
you have page height width and interactive height in report properties

1167320
portrait	landscape
you don t say portrait or landscape

1167322
inherited	properties	public	protected
perhaps you could define a few asp placeholders think of it as zones within your usercontrol and make them available via public or protected if you only want the inherited class to be able to change them properties

1167448
igraph	statnet
igraph and network the latter is part of statnet

1167477
hide	show
still i d much rather just hide the grid and show a no records found message div block

1167524
put	get
you can change this though get the carbonel package then put the following into your .rprofile

1167540
versioning	upgrade
that said once you begin developing your os you may find that you need to upgrade to the full non-express versioning

1167551
daemons	systemd
currently i only set the systemd property java.rmi.server.hostname on both sides to the network interface which should be used for the data exchange and registered the default port for the communication with rmi daemons

1167578
folder	directory
isolatedstorage requires less collaboration with your iis admin when it comes to granting ntfs rights to folder outside of your virtual directory

fpdf	fpdi
i am using fpdf fpdi to build a pdf templating system

1167605
post	get
get and post

1167634
move	drag
you say that your listboxes are all data-bound - which implies that you actually move items from one backing collection to another on drag and drop

1167657
put	get
simply put a template is more specialized than another if you can replace each type parameter of the latter template with some type and in result get the signature of the former

1167677
pop-up	dialog
the problem is when i click the search button the modal dialog pop-up but the databind method never gets called

1167685
post	get
we primary use the framework for updates but the device api is generic enough to be able to build almost anything you need via standard http https get post calls

1167696
min	max
the region could be described using its min and max coordinates as follows

1167760
rss	feed
i m currently running an app that is based on rss feed but i have a cron job running hourly to scour the interwebs for new content but i d love to know more about how to solve the i need realtime problem without overstaying my api call welcome

1167833
put	get
in order to get this to work you must put your code in the same assembly as the aeccpointstyle class

1167839
accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

1167839
accessor	properties
they also enable client code to create objects when you declare a properties as shown in the following example the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

1167847
versioning	upgrade
of course you ll need to add a reference and i absolutely hate adding reference to office because you get tied to a versioning of office and i hate updating code every time we upgrade

1167870
folder	directory
if you ignore the gen folder this also means that you don t need to set the exclusion pattern for this directory as subversion doesn t create a .svn directory inside ignored items

1167891
accessor	properties
try making the so object private and create a properties accessor for it that first checks that if the private is set if not set it before returning the private variable

cpu	processors
cpu utilization is oftentimes running at 100 on all four processors now this never happended on the sql 2005 server

1168052
cpu	processors
it appears that whenever i have four processes waiting on this resource cpu hits 100 on all four processors

1168090
put	get
if it is global across all sessions you could put it in a class_variable rather than an instance_variable but that can get messy once you start having multiple rails processes each which will have their own copy of it or if you re running in threadsafe mode you can end up with nasty concurrency bugs

1168108
nunit	nmock	nunit	moq	moq	nmock
i d really suggest you start with a simpler framework such as xunit nunit together with mocking ones such nmock and moq

1168113
sorting	filtering
you can use a derived table for filtering and sorting like this

1168114
post	get
i figured out how to make the web service respond to the http get calls but i cannot figure out how to make it return json data even though the service returns json data when i call it using jquery .ajax with type post when called from the autocomplete plugin it always returns xml

1168114
post	get
fixing autocomplete plugin to use http post and json data instead of get and query string parameters

1168121
mod-alias	mod-rewrite
is this possible to do through mod-rewrite or mod-alias

1168152
implements	extends
you can extends your current service class which implements isearchuser and let it implements icreateuser as well - in that case you could add a second endpoint to your service config

1168224
folder	directory
there should be a sibling directory to your solution directory called testresults which contains the folder used for each test run

1168254
width	height
if i don t specify width and height values for a titlewindow it will be resized to fit it s contents when i show it using popupmanager

1168271
put	get
is there any possible way to get around this or do i just need to limit the amount of items put into a room 2500 was about the limit i found to work

1168287
put	get
if it contains something like .. .. index.php or something like this - you get the idea this could allow someone to put any file they want on your server

1168315
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino and sproutcore are also designed for this

1168327
firefox	safari
now that ie8 is a forced update there should be better support but i can t speak from experience on ie nor firefox or safari etc

1168366
udp	tcp
it supports tcp udp icmp...

1168366
icmp	tcp
it s also very useful if you want to see where along a route that a tcp port is being blocked like by a firewall where icmp might not be

1168397
disk	ram
after making sure you have plenty of ram putting your ide on a speedy disk drive is often one of the best performance upgrades you can make - perhaps even moreso than cpu speed

1168397
disk	ram
should we have to buy an expensive disk drive just to run a modern ide in a responsive manner when the uber-3l337 un1x c0derz happily run emacs on 386s with 32mb of ram

1168400
pop-up	dialog
checking on every write would be a horrible mess if you re really concerned about the scenario have a timer go off every hour or two that checks the table version and pop-up a dialog warning the user to get a new version

1168412
accessor	properties
inconsistency with the use of the shortcut dot syntax for accessing properties often having to use the full length accessor

1168424
codeigniter	cakephp
search for cakephp and codeigniter and maybe symfony i m not sure all do the rest thing.

1168435
pop-up	dialog
when the current running version is out-of-date and the latest update is required then pop-up a dialog box that requires the user to get the update

1168450
accessor	properties
properties get accessor and the tostring method are assumed pure the program state before and after must be identical

1168451
division	multiplication
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most maybe even all cpus if you happen to be using a power of 2

1168453
nsdateformatter	uidatepicker
you ll need to use nsdateformatter to format the nsdate returned by your uidatepicker

1168459
width	height
but this does not just change the height it also messes with the width

1168459
width	height
edit this actually does not interfere with the width of most browsers - it resizes to the previous width and new height

1168459
width	height
i would like something that would be equivalent to setclientwidth int width and setclientheight int height keep in mind that these setters don t actually exist

1168479
g++	gcc
cc gcc -m32 cxx g++ -m32 linux32 rpmbuild -bb --target i586 package.spec

1168480
width	height
i usually just force the height width of the container to 1 by 1 px.

1168480
width	height
then when i need the flash i will re-set the height width as appropriate

1168509
submit	submission
your jquery form submit method doesn t prevent the actual submission from taking place

1168566
division	multiplication
most compilers will turn multiplication and division into bit shifts when appropriate

1168592
tcpdf	fpdf
the demonstration of tcpdf i saw at the following presentation showed that tcpdf may have more in-built capabilities the fpdf

1168616
multiplying	division
for division by a constant the compiler can often convert the operation to a multiplying by a magic number followed by a shift

1168616
division	multiplication
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation

1168624
plesk	mediatemple
the virtualhost solution didn t work for mediatemple because each vhost.conf is already delimited as a virtualhost configured by plesk

post	get
if we can t get to a better solution around here and we decide this is a valuable question i ll post this as the answer

1168844
rss	feed
im trying to fix a python script which takes the posts from a specific rss feed and strips them down and inputs them into a text file

1168844
rss	feed
it only prints out the last post of the rss feed into a text not the whole thing as the first function does

1168844
rss	feed
if anyone could tell me why the script doesnt post more than one the last post of the rss feed into the text but the whole thing in the shell and what modifications i need to fix it i would really appreciate it

1168865
for-loop	loops
you should open the file before the for-loop and then put the lines inside loops

1168866
post	get
so you get a single post here

1168883
pull	push
i have set it up to pull rather than push only because that s the way i got past the logins issue

1168889
equals	compareto
compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

jar	war
with servlets the compiled classes must reside on the server in order to function war jar files

1168935
cpython	ironpython
note that with this code you can actually use extensions written for cpython from your ironpython code so that s not a discriminating condition any more

1168955
postgresql	mysql
i have downloaded dblinq 3 which is a linq provider for mysql oracle and postgresql

1168957
cpython	ironpython
while ironpython doesn t have the limitations of the gil cpython does - so it would appear that for those applications where the gil is a bottleneck say in certain multicore scenarios ironpython has an advantage over python.net

1168957
cpython	ironpython
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other

1168983
hash	md5
in the past i have used a javascript md5 hash function to encrypt the password before posting it...but i was hoping for something more secure

1168988
ssl	https
transport security using https and a valid ssl certificate works in the same way a web site does it doesn t require additional credentials certs from the user

1169006
ubuntu	debian	profiler	google-perftools
google also has a nice profiler as part of the google-perftools -- which are included in debian ubuntu and possibly other distros

1169034
hash	md5
so even if you hash the password with say md5 the md5 hash is still sent in plain text then intercepted and can then be posted back to the login page by the third party

1169108
glassfish	weblogic
personally i would go with the app server s transaction manager regardless of whether it was websphere or weblogic or glassfish or whatever

1169135
prepare	execute
not too familiar with using mysql in c but according to what i can see in the mysql.h file you should call mysql_stmt_prepare to create the statement and mysql_stmt_execute to execute said prepare statement

1169140
filtering	grouping
a filtering can be used to apply before after logic across a grouping of controllers a uri or to a specific action

1169169
lisp	scheme
there are some fundamental issues that separate common lisp and scheme which make trying to use the former with sicp a pretty bad idea

1169169
lisp	scheme
so in scheme you have a clear separation something is either a list or one of the primitive types of values -- but in common lisp nil is not only false and the empty list it is also a symbol

1169169
lisp	scheme
in addition to this you get a host of slightly different behavior -- for example in common lisp the head and the tail the car and cdr of the empty list is itself the empty list while in scheme you ll get a runtime error if you try that

1169169
lisp	scheme
to top it off you have different names and naming convention for example -- predicates in common lisp end by convention with p eg listp while predicates in scheme end in a question mark eg list

1169169
lisp	scheme
mutators in common lisp have no specific convention some have an n prefix while in scheme they almost always have a suffix of

1169169
lisp	scheme
also plain assignment in common lisp is usually setf and it can operate on combinations too eg setf car foo 1 while in scheme it is set

1169169
lisp	scheme
his third option -- rewriting functional loops expressed as recursive functions as common lisp loops dotimes dolist and the infamous loop can work for a few simple cases but at a very high cost the fact that scheme is a language that does proper tco is not only fundamental to the language -- it is also one of the major themes in the book so by doing so you will have lost that point completely

1169169
lisp	scheme
in addition there are some cases that you just cannot translate scheme code into a common lisp loop construct -- for example as you work your way through the book you ll get to implement a meta-circular-interpreter which is an implementation of a mini-scheme language

1169169
lisp	scheme
people who are familiar with all of this should not be surprised after all the circularity of the evaluator means that you re implementing a language with semantics that are very close to the host language -- so in this case you inherit the common lisp semantics rather than the scheme tco semantics

1169169
lisp	scheme
for example many common lisp compilers will never optimize this call funcall foo bar while scheme compilers will optimize foo bar like any function call expression because there is no other way to call functions.

1169169
lisp	scheme
finally i ll note that much of the above is very good flamewar material throw any of these issues into a public lisp or scheme forum in particular comp.lang.lisp and comp.lang.scheme and you ll most likely see a long thread where people explain why their choice is far better than the other or why some so called feature is actually an idiotic decision that was made by language designers that were clearly very drunk at the time etc etc

rss	feed
the thing is i have a script that updates a textfile with the newest posts from an rss feed i got some help from you guys to figure it out

1169246
ubuntu	linux
i m running xterm initialized with utf-8.en.us running ubuntu linux and mono

1169281
int	chars
wc and most unix-like commands deal with chars in terms of the c chars data type which is usually an unsigned 8 bit int

1169281
int	chars
.net deals with chars in terms of its own chars data type which is a 16 bit unsigned int and represents a utf-16 chars

1169306
postgresql	mysql
however i don t think sqlite has rich enough stored procedures to do something like this you would need to use mysql postgresql or similar

1169360
int	chars
example - lets say that i have a string of chars and each 50 chars will increment an int by 1

1169372
cassini	iis
you can find out how cassini differs from iis here

1169382
ant	maven
both ant and maven are okay

1169470
post	get
the fact is that users can still get access to post parameters and can easily forge their own post parameters

1169478
keydown	keyup
i think you first problem is that you are using the keydown event when you really want the keyup event

1169488
rar	zip
compressing with rar vs zip

1169490
post	get
how do i find out whether a get or a post hit my asp.net mvc controller action

1169495
int	chars
the form allows only a single element to be selected using int or chars indices whereas allows indexing by vectors

1169500
verilog	vhdl
before plunging into verilog vhdl or buying an fpga dev kit i d recommend taking an introductory class on digital design

1169502
post	get
traditional means is via hyperlinks which defaults to get unless you use javascript or forms which defaults to post

1169518
int	chars
the only cross-platform way to do it is to read it byte by byte that is chars by chars and build an int out of them

1169539
for-loop	loops
i can imagine doing for-loop for each state then doing the regression inside loops and adding the results of each regression to a vector

1169543
width	height
1.label control where i can fix the height and width of the label so it doesn t grow to long but rather wraps the text inside my fixed width and height

1169543
width	height
2.a textbox control where i can already set the height and width if i set multiline off however the user should not be able to edit the textbox...in fact the textbox should not be able to recieve the focus at all

1169571
accessor	properties
iclass has a couple properties with only get accessor

1169571
accessor	properties
so all of the classes that derive from absclass will also need to satisfy iclass by having the same properties with get accessor

1169571
accessor	properties
however in some cases i want to be able to add set accessor to the properties from iclass

1169571
accessor	properties
yet if i try to override the abstract properties in absclass with a set accessor i get this error

1169580
disk	ram
if your system has faster disk possibly a faster cpu probably or a lot more ram almost certainly then make sure to tune the various parameters based upon that

1169599
accessor	properties
this works the way it does because properties aren t truly virtual - their accessor methods are

1169703
put	get
i put a formview on the page to display the person s picture and i can get whatever i want from that dscontactemail with #eval email for example but how do i get that from the code behind

pdfsharp	itext
as far as free libraries go from what i ve seen i don t believe that pdfsharp or itext will meet all of your requirements in this case but i m sure someone will correct me if i m wrong

1169817
post	get
the parameters can come from the get uri or from the post body when content-type

1169839
portrait	landscape
even if it s cropped the characters are still rendered too small in portrait mode so you need to switch to landscape mode

1169852
webkit	gecko
hypothetically the first two test cases separated by should render identically which they do in gecko via ff3.5 mac but webkit via safari4 mac renders the before and after segments as inline

1169939
post	put	post	get	put	get
any model resource can accept a get operation to query its state a put operation for setting its state post for appending to it and delete for removal

1169939
post	get
a view resource can return a representation of a given state in some bare-bones representation or something like with xml via a post operation i guess unless the view s data is small enough to use a get operation

1169939
post	get
a controller resource can accept a get operation for queries and post for form processing

1169941
bash	tcsh
use ps to identify the pid of the shell process bash tcsh etc then kill that.

1169944
pylons	web2py
if you want simplicity use web2py or pylons

1169953
post	get
if you are using limit in your query and or don t try to get lots of lines can you post your code

1169959
subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
it would override add and sub so you could do addition and subtraction by simply using operators + and -

once you have them they can be ran automatically or manually using your ide ant maven or other build tool you use

1170088
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
if i wrap the socket in a bufferedoutputstream bufferedinputstream life is great

1170088
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
but wrap the socket in a datainputstream dataoutputstream or even have dataoutputstream bufferedoutputstream sock.getoutputstream is extremely slow

1170119
wgs84	utm
the basic idea is to convert gps coordinates which are in wgs84 coordinate system to distance from some point - in case of utm northing is a distance from the equator and easting is distance from one selected meridian

1170171
int	double
you have to have one type of general setter method per type of variable double int ... though

1170172
ready	each
don t forget error handling - each step can fail and you need to be sure your program is ready for that

folder	directory
typically when you deploy a user control in sharepoint you put your control in the controltemplates folder which is mapped to the _controltemplates virtual directory in iis by default sp has access to this folder

1170274
getter	setter
multiple properties can share a single getter or setter differentiated by an ordinal index

1170345
inherited	properties	width	height
then use the x y width height properties of each control inherited from control

1170365
libs	buildpath
in any other case create either a copy of the libs directly in your project i suggest lib jung.jar and add that libs to your buildpath right-click on libs or create a user libs with the jar s and add that user libs to the projects buildpath

1170375
versioning	upgrade
after we get to a persistence point we upgrade to versioning 2 we need to be able to let the old instances continue to run with the old versioning of our assemblies

1170379
jboss	glassfish
it scale very well because you can deploy it inside an application server like glassfish or jboss

1170390
actualheight	actualwidth
yes you can check actualwidth and actualheight on any frameworkelement to figure this out

1170407
itunes	apple-id
ideal here would probably be to have access to the apple-id the user has registered with itunes

1170416
postgresql	mysql
oracle as well as mysql and postgresql and some others can handle multiple transactions and commits basically if you use a database with a website a more secure and stable database would be oracle likewise an application

1170417
equals	tostring
is anyone aware of a library that uses the the techniques annotations and classworking described in this article for automatically generating the standard object methods tostring equals and hashcode for standard java classes

1170422
width	height
two images one is 300x400 pixels height x width the other is 500x600

1170422
width	height
how can i make them appear side-by-side scaled so they are the same height on screen filling the whole width of the page or container div without changing the aspect ratio of either image

1170433
width	height
why not simply setting the image height attribute value without attributing the width

1170433
width	height
you can also achieve this via css same principle you set the height and not the width

1170478
width	height
every product has a weight length width and height as well

1170497
vb6	vba
this vb6 code is compatible with vba

1170583
getter	setter
mypluginthatrocks i have a file named myawsomeproperties .properties how can i open it and read it easyly with a sort of getter setter system like or or any other mean in that type if you get what i mean .

1170593
fast-forward	merge
i ve found that this doesn t seem to work if master hasn t changed over the lifetime of the branch â the commits just get fast-forward in with no merge branch message â so it s best add the --no-ff flag to git merge

1170608
vb.net	vb6
performing a complete rewrite to .net is far more costly and difficult to do well than converting vb6 to vb.net semi-automatically .

1170640
folder	directory
each user will upload some files to his profile.should i place all files in a single directory or do i need to create folder for each user and keep the files there

1170698
versioning	upgrade
they may simply need to upgrade their axis versioning

1170707
debian	linux
i would suggest nix based linux would be great if it is possible because you can get the package easier with the built-in package manager e.g apt for debian yum for fedora etc

1170740
folder	directory
once i get the access to this directory i will create a nested directory inside it with different extensions of files but the problem is when i tries to access this folder by unc path it is giving me error like could not find a part of the path comp01 ibc

1170752
versioning	upgrade
the way i would try to solve this is by getting the other developer to upgrade to visual studio 2008 as you are able to target older versioning of the framework in the compiled binary is there any reason for them not to upgrade

1170761
fastcgi	scgi
cppcms is traditional mvc framework optimized for performance it has many features like template engines forms processing i18n support sessions efficient caching and so on support of various web server apis fastcgi scgi and cgi

1170835
tcpdf	fpdf	tcpdf	fpdi	fpdf	fpdi
we have chosen to use fpdf over over tcpdf due to compatibility problems detailed on the fpdi website as fpdi is the core component in this dropping fpdi was not an option

1170855
config	ini
searching for ini config gui solutions via search engines returns a lot a false positives

1170879
equals	tostring
i find that automatic tostring generation is not usually what you want when scouring log files and most ides will have tools to allow you to generate hashcode and equals implementations although granted these do not automatically reflect any schema modifications within your class

1170890
google-chrome	firefox
when i visit this url in firefox google-chrome etc the decent browsers all is well the browser correctly selects a plugin such as acrobat reader to render the file within the browser

perl	tcl
depending on the implementation chosen there are perl java python along with the original tcl you can then use the corresponding gui toolkit swing to java

1171010
post	get
my aim is to implement an http client in j2me which can only do get and limited post but first i need to understand the http protocol better hence the c# attempt

1171087
idictionary	ilist
are even more options although idictionary k ilist v is not something that is

1171112
webclient	webrequest
otherwise you should just stick to the webrequest and webclient classes

1171122
width	height
if your wrapper doesn t have a width and height on it you may get some strange results as it shrinks once the image element is removed

1171122
width	height
to see add a border and fixed height width around the wrapper

1171169
put	get
if they don t understand i would say that maybe you could put together a presentation on design and get them up to speed so you can have those is this a good design conversations

1171185
hash	md5
as for alternatives to md5 goes i think the sha family of hash functions are considered the de-facto replacements

1171214
squash	branch	git-rebase	amend
you can interactively git-rebase your local branch against the subversion tracking branch which provides you with an opportunity to squash and amend the commit

1171285
hash	md5
an alternative to md5 is would be the md6 hash algorithm but it is not ready yet

1171363
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried to use the mouseenter mouseleave events since they seem to look in detail for the divs they are dealing with as seen here but nothing changed

i thought i would put an echo right at the top as this will surely work but when i get to this script via post request from a form

1171456
pull	push
you mention having set up the replication as a pull rather than push because it got you past login issues

1171490
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox safari and google-chrome the response is still being returned with the appropriate http 200 code and jsonp content the only difference is that the xmlhttprequest object being used by jquery is setting the status code to 0 and the responsetext to empty

1171490
post	get
to get round this i modifed the jquery library to not set the custom header and change the content-type to text plain instead of application json and firefox finally starts bypassing the options request and just plain post

1171494
children	parent
the child windows have formborderstyle.none and controlbox false so that no border stuff from the mdi children is displayed in the mdi parent

1 by richards stevens and i found that there is a third transport layer standard besides tcp and udp sctp

1171555
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
summary sctp is a transport-level protocal that is message-driven like udp but reliable like tcp

1171556
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox 3.x and google-chrome

1171581
width	margin
i ve personally always stuck to max width of 1000px centered in the middle of the page via margin left right auto

1171591
hide	show
inside a style tag not linked with a link tag that i want to show hide depending on the state of the page the page works like a wizard using a multiview control on the page

websphere	ibm
i observe in consecutive javacore dumps that the addresses of classloaders are changing in websphere 6.1 ibm jvm 1.5.0

1171672

sctp is born too late and for many situation tcp is enough

1171696
width	height
but i want width and height of the image

1171696
width	height
and please let me know if there is another better way to get the width and height of the image

1171697
postgresql	mysql
for dbi alone we have sqlite mysql postgresql oracle

int	double
if it won t use them up any time soon go with int otherwise double the key size and go with bigint

1171847
equals	gethashcode
be sure to override equals and gethashcode and define and as appropriate

1171856
equals	gethashcode
be sure that it s gethashcode and equals is based upon the two contained elements

1171874
nexus	artifactory
if you use an internal repository manager obligatory nexus and artifactory references here the overhead of purging the local repository is greatly reduced - you ll just have an increased local network traffic load

1171880
width	height
i have a sprite sheet of images of differnet width and height which i have the coordinates to

1171892
integer	unsigned
to do so cast the pointer to an unsigned integer type longword if i remember it right

1171909
range	max	range	min	min	max
this is a bit hackey but you could also use a range validator that sets the min value to 1 and the max value to some very large integer that isn t likely to be entered

1171961
equals	gethashcode
create a custom key class and implement equals and gethashcode so that any one component of the key is sufficient to find the entire key

1171993
children	parent
i think your problem could be that you aren t setting the child s of profile to now have parent as it s their parent unless children with parent can t also be parent in your system which i do not believe to be the case

1172035
agile	sprint
how do you prevent agile methodology with monthly sprint iterations causing a fragmented design

then you capture via get or post the user s email and comment and you insert everything in the db

1172071
temporary	tablespace
but how do i set up the temporary tablespace if i don t know the temporary tablespace the existing database uses

1172115
children	parent
if the result of the move never intends to change the topology of the tree when x becomes the parent of its old parent y it gives all its children to y then the simplest might be to decouple the notion pyramid nodes from the users with one-to-one relationship

1172115
children	parent
since the topology of the tree does not change this would automagically take care of the children having a correct parent

if you want to find other temporary tablespace within the database you can do

1172213
pull	push	versioning	upgrade
you could upgrade your spring versioning it s unlikely that you ll have any problems and if push comes to shove you could pull just that org.springframework.transaction.jta.websphereuowtransactionmanager out of spring 2.5 and add it to your application

1173988
postgresql	mysql
sql server express seems to me like the much more natural upgrade path for such an app though it has a 4gb limit on the total size of the database so you re not gaining all that much over jet ace s 2gb limit and one could certain consider open-source databases like mysql and postgresql that are entirely cost-free in terms of licensing

1174239
inherited	properties
attached properties are dependency properties and as such support dependency properties value inherited

1174239

inherited	properties
a dependency properties attached or not inherited its value downwards if its metadata is set with the frameworkpropertymetadataoptions

1174239

1174420
jar	war
note i d recommend having a separate war project to your jar projects then adding the jars as dependencies to the war

1174421
submit	submission
however as many people have mentioned the enter key submission a form is expected behaviour so you can always alter the function to do basic validation on the fields allowing the enter key to submit the form if all the required fields have been filled in

1174422
width	height
should just be able to swap your width and height loops values

1174447
inherited	properties
in other words having properties implementation in your interface would lead to name clashes and from there to other multiple inherited problems diamond

1174447
getter	setter
however having just a getter or a setter with no implementation should work

1174467
fadein	fadeout
i think you can try using fadeout fadein too

i understand that ie s box model includes border and margin in its width calculations so with that given as understood i still can t figure a way around this

1174807
folder	dir
so you need to get the mozilla profiles dir and retrie the folder

1174845

1175737
integer	unsigned
so what you need to do is cast the object to an unsigned integer type before performing the bit manipulation to get the desired result

width	height
if you really want to stretch your image just make the width 100 and set height equal to the actual height of your image

1176147
width	height
you can use an image tag and give the width and height to 100 to achieve this

1176156
hide	show
the easiest way is to add an isselected trigger to the datatemplate itemstemplate of the combobox i think you have two groups of visual elements one for the regular data display and another for the selected visuals when isselected property set on the comboboxitem you need to make the regular visuals hide and the other one show

1176164
datamapper	activerecord
it s common for a datamapper implementation to use a tdg rdg or even activerecord pattern to provide the data access logic for the mapper object

1176498
getter	setter
my second submission is getter and setter

1176498
getter	setter
efficiently combining getter setter and result caching is a little messier because you have to prevent the invalidation or do without automatic invalidation on set which is what the following example does

1177393
width	font-size
you can however combine two solutions - first approximate font-size using some character-counting algorigthm for example - assume that characters have fixed width and then correct your calculations with client-side js if js determines that line has been split anyway

1177422
stateless	stateful
i have always advocated the stateless web but would like to know what the advocates of the stateful web are saying

1177544
gridview	objectdatasource
i am binding a gridview to this table via an objectdatasource and have a templatefield like so

1177568
int	chars
you go via the int value of each of those chars to get back to a genuine utf-8 string which you then decode as normal

1177571
hash	md5
both the sha1 and md5 hashing algorithms result in an even distribution of hash values for a set of random inputs

1177571
hash	md5
if the probability of discovering a string that collides with another s sha1 hash is p1 and similarly p2 for md5 the naive answer is the probability of finding one that collides with both is p1 p2

will not work because there is no string constructor that takes a chars or int argument

1177930
cassini	iis
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation

1177978
uiview	calayer
they are different names because uiview and calayer are different and have different terminology associated with them but they are functionally equivalent

1177979
apache	nginx
i m trying to migrate to nginx from apache using passenger in both instances to host a rails app

1178212
nfa	dfa
the resulting dfa s states represent power sets of the states in the nfa

1178212
nfa	dfa
the states in the nfa are linear to the size of the regular expression and therefore the dfa s states are exponential to the size of the regular expression

1178248
filtering	grouping

it has a cocoa-bridge and the user interface is written with it but based on a portable substrate - so the same development environment is available for windows and unix linux freebsd

1178457
put	get
if you don t put a leading then you get the normal rails generated error message

1178470
profiling	instrumentation
the only profiling i can find for wince is the remote call profiling which requires the application be built with the platform builder so the instrumentation hooks can be compiled in

1178472
updatepanel	onclientclick
i would expect that the onload function of the parent updatepanel would never run except on the actual page load and that the button s onclientclick function would be executed on every click updating the child updatepanel

1178631
super	self
because the super s init method may return a separate object from the current self

1178664
getter	setter

1178676
fflush	gets
i like the idea of a cache that gets fflush when a threshold is reached

1178731

mouse	keyboard
open system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts

1179065
lisp	scheme
new lisp is an easy install from the os x gui installed from a os x package making it the easiest install of all lisp except perhaps for plt scheme

1179065
lisp	scheme
if you are new to lisp and not too picky that it be common lisp you should look at plt scheme

1179099
chunked	transfer-encoding
anyway it s a good idea to use curl or another http library because implementing a protocol with all its subtilities like chunked transfer-encoding in hmtl is a lot of work much more than twice the work to implement a basic protocol handler which will work only on one basic case

1179153
xlib	gdk	xlib	motif
i m not using gdk or qt - just plain xlib xt and motif

1179154
getter	setter
from what i ve read properties and synthesize are used to tell the compiler to to generate getter and setter for various properties of our class

1179193
min	max
i want to display max time and min time for a day in grid control using visual basic from sql database

1179204
getter	setter
by encapsulating the members as a property with getter and setter the implementation details of the field may change while those details are abstracted by the getter setter

1179211
put	get
i can t just put i in there as the counter for the loop and get four instances out named player1 player2 etc

1179276
aggregate-functions	sum

i suppose if you put dashes or spaces in you could even get us a little insight into the customer s purchasing habits

1179563
fdt	swc
well one possibility is to do the majority of your development with flashdevelop fdt or flexbuilder soon to be called flashbuilder and have your output be a swc

1179563
fdt	swc
we build the majority of our flash projects in this manner or sort of in reverse where we build the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development environment we prefer fdt

1179572
put	get
also if you put in the form on page 2 with your variables posted from page 1 they should get passed right along

1179588
webrat	cucumber
if i visit it will redirect to but i can t get the cucumber webrat tests i ve written to pass as i always get an error like this

1179617
google-chrome	firefox
update i tried using google-chrome instead of firefox and this particular problem doesn t appear

1179653
boost	stl
it was also supposed to fix the long-standing problem of stl and boost and template libraries in general being hard to use because of lax compile-time duck typing nature of c++03 templates and the consequent troubles with compiler error reporting

1179664
std	ostream
then you can provide your own descendant of std basic_streambuf wrap it in a std ostream and use standard c++ i o on it

1179669
free	realloc
i m aware that there is a realloc function that would allow me to resize the memory block and it s paired with a free function

1179669
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
is there an equivalent keyword to realloc in c++ that would allow me to achieve the same goal when the memory is paired using new delete rather than malloc or realloc and free

1179690
puts	gets
this suggests that it only gets messages that are sent sendmessage which calls the window procedure directly not posted postmessage which puts the message in the message queue

1179715
int	boolean
in vb int are converted to boolean automatically 0 - false everything else - true

1179728
bazaar	git
in distributed version control system like git mercurial or bazaar where you have local copy clone of a whole repository almost all commands are performed on client

1179794
superclass	subclassing
if i pass a subclassing object in as a parameter to a method which takes a parameter of type superclass i should certainly be aware of that and know the internally the called method will be working with the superclass aka baseclass object only

1179851
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
on webfaction to save processing power and more importantly memory it is better to serve these from your secondary apache server or even better from nginx or lighttpd without having to go through mod_python and django

1179866
peer	p2p
in a corporate environment yes corporations do use p2p any number of network reconfigurations may take place all without informing the peer about changes in ip address

1179874
bindparam	bindvalue	bindparam	pdostatement	pdostatement	bindvalue
what is the difference between pdostatement bindparam and pdostatement bindvalue

1179903
free	malloc
you malloc in every loop iteration but only free once at the end

1179908
fseek	fread
i would recommend checking the results of fseek and fread

1179908
fseek	fread
provided that fseek is succeeding fread should tell you the total number of bytes read

1179924
bindparam	bindvalue
to bind those parameters you ve got to use bindparam and not bindvalue

1179927
pdostatement	bindvalue
unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that pdostatement execute is called

1179927
bindparam	pdostatement
call pdostatement bindparam to bind php variables to the parameter markers bound variables pass their value as input and receive the output value if any of their associated parameter markers

1179928
put	get
i have a div tag and i need to put one ascx on the left that will get swapped out from time to time with another ascx and then a static ascx on the left

1179974
postfix	dovecot
here is a tutorial for using postfix for sending mail and dovecot for accessing mail via imap

1179992
int	chars
i believe they can be up to 2 31-1 chars as they are held by an internal array and arrays are indexed by int in java

1180023
hide	show
jquery using show and hide would work

1180115
pypdf	reportlab
edit pypdf and reportlab look good but neither one will allow me to edit an existing pdf are there any other options

1180126
bufferedreader	ioexception
private static function readint bufferedreader reader throws ioexception

1180139
disk	ram
if for some reason you have to touch each entry in the csv file every time you run i might recommend storing it on a ram disk instead of physical disk

1180158
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
right now i am adding the uidatepicker subview with a couple buttons on a navigation bar to a temporary uiviewcontroller and initializing a uinavigationcontroller with that temporary controller as the root

1180161
codeigniter	cakephp
i have looked at zend cakephp and codeigniter and i have not been able to find an intuitive way to accomplish this

1180274
dictionary	map
python s dictionary and set are both unordered containers which map to the basic data structure of a hash table

1180295
width	height
how can i use a canvas to resize automatically and adapted to the browser 100 width and height

1180321
min	max
this will display the min and max time per each user and date

1180340
opera	google-chrome
the browser might be mozilla ie opera google-chrome or any other mobiles device such as sonyericssonk610i samsung-sgh-e370 sonyericssont700 or nokian73-1

1180347
free	malloc
but if you start using malloc then you must do housekeeping be sure to call free at the right time memorize the size of the array somewhere and perhaps even have a size different from the array capacity you allocate more to avoid doing too much reallocs

1180354
jboss	glassfish
i am not sure if this is true for glassfish or not but in case of jboss if you turn on debug you can notice the jndi name that would be used

1180416
put	get
because the only thing that i get is the size of the longest path equivalent to the height and i cant put in the array the values regarding to the height of the bst.

1180423
cng	cryptoapi
in my experience these implementations are rock-solid provide numerous options for example you ve usually got a cryptoapi cng and managed implementations of each algorithm to choose from and you re not going to get it wrong since you re only using the implementation

1180443
post	get
i can get code to be called on a post back for any check box that has changed

1180463
hide	show
that gives you an opportunity for example to hide a spoiler in final page but show it in normal view in the editor window

1180466
post	get
i m wondering if you can also eager load counts like if i wanted to get the number of comments for each post without loading all the comments themselves

1180466
post	put	post	get	put	get
extra bonus points if someone can show how to not only get the count but put some conditions too like count of only post which have been approved

1180469
folder	directory
the problem seems to be that eclipse does not realize that the directory src mycompany logging is a package directory --- instead it thinks it s a source folder in its own right analogous to src and that logentry is part of the default package in that folder

1180475
width	height
if you remove the width and height and alignment parameters then the silverlight app should stretch to fit its container

1180477
children	parent
in this case the parent your layer would loop through all children presumable stored in some form of collection and handle updates to all those who say they ve been changed

1180554
trie	tree
to optimize contains you need a tree or trie structure of your positive negative words

1180595
clang	llvm
llvm perhaps using clang but it might not be ready for primetime

1180606
stdout	stderr
warning this will deadlock if the child process generates enough output to a stdout or stderr pipe such that it blocks waiting for the os pipe buffer to accept more data

1180606
stdout	stderr
i do need the return value from the exec and do parse and use both the stdout and stderr

1180607
actioncontroller	activeresource
one caveat of this solution this changes the logger level for all of activerecord actioncontroller actionview actionmailer and activeresource

1180614
uicontrol	uibutton
yes you have to add your own uibutton views or other uicontrol subclasses to the navigation controller yourself

1180627
accessor	properties
yes a properties is just syntactic sugar for the call to get accessor method

1180641
stdout	stderr
if the application writes a lot to stderr and nothing to stdout then your process will sit waiting for data on stdout that isn t coming while the program you re running sits there waiting for the stuff it wrote to stderr to be read which it never will be--since you re waiting for stdout

1180641
stdout	stderr
another simple approach is to redirect stderr to stdout so you only have one incoming file set

1180641
stdout	stderr
this lets you read in a non-blocking way you get data whenever data appears on either stdout or stderr

1180648
ienumerable	icollection
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one

1180648
ienumerable	icollection
this would leave out string but also icollection-of-t because it does not inherit icollection ienumerable-of-t is the only generic collection abstraction that s backwards compatible - it inherits ienumerable

1180674
vsto	add-in
i see how i can do this with vsto as an add-in to outlook but i d like to make it a standalone app

1180674
vsto	add-in
is there an easy way to access update outlook contacts outside of vsto or would i be better off simply sticking with creating an add-in

1180727
post	put	post	get	put	get
when i deploy it to an iis 6 site with integrated windows authentication turned on all requests get post put and delete work fine for me because i am an administrator on the box

1180727
post	get
however when a non-admin user hits the service only get and post requests work

1180727
put	get
when they try a put or delete request they get an http 401.3 access is denied error

1180732
button	checkbox
in your submit button s eventhandler you would loop through each table row cell then determine whether the cell s children control contained a checkbox

1180732
gridview	datalist
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option

1180755
disk	ram
are you sure you re not using up all your ram and paging to disk

1180782
jobs	cron
i would not recommend trying to create and manage cron jobs scheduled tasks from within php

1180782
jobs	cron
if cron jobs scheduled tasks don t work out for you you can also consider piggy-backing on ordinary requests to your website

1180789
inherited	properties
perhaps a properties that returns all of the inherited objects

1180830
put	get
also there are things that get put on the stack that you may not be aware of return address stack frame registers etc. and not jumping past when trying to grab things higher up on the stack

1180860
getter	setter
we re often told we should protect encapsulation by making getter and setter methods properties in c# for class fields instead of exposing the fields to the outside world

1180864
public	protected
so when you have an interaction point with other classes - any public and generally protected member you want to plan for future growth

1180892
hex	binary
use dumpbin all to dump all details of a binary to a text hex dump

1180895
post	get

1180910
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome though text-decoration none is ignored and the underline stretches unattractively across the bottom of the icon

1180927
xna	spritebatch
basiceffect and spritebatch objects are just shaders that the xna team bundled with the release

1180973
getter	setter
use that only if you have existing code that uses public property and you suddenly need getter setter for it like your example with age

1180973
getter	setter
if you need to execute some code when property is read written make it read-only or lazily fetch from the database then you should use normal getter setter getage setage

1180986
google-chrome	firefox
my current implementation is below which works in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome

1181002
ubuntu	linux
i ve attempted this thus far on my mac os x machine and on a linux ubuntu virtual machine that i m running

1181032
struts	wicket
technologies included here are java struts spring mvc jsp wicket and a few others

1181032
put	get
i d like it not to focus so much on patterns and other principles as much as just how to get started and actually put my thoughts in a professional document that i can use to build my project from

1181041
getter	setter
synthesize basically creates setter and getter for you and if you call out retain specifically the setter is going to retain the object passed in to it

1181048
rss	feed
yes this is used to indicate that the url can serve an rss atom feed that can be fed through a reader such as google reader

1181052
rss	feed
number 4 is so that when you go to a page in ff or ie7+ the little rss icon at the top of your browser lights up and you can add that feed to the browser s built-in feed reader

1181065
rss	feed
this allows rss readers to find the feed for a given website basically making it easier to add to your rss reader

1181081
int	chars
so if a signed int was used you d be unable to create strings larger than 2 31 chars

1181135
stdout	fflush
however even when i explicitly fflush stdout the server seems to wait for the script to complete before sending the response to the client

1181158
nofollow	noindex
how about noindex and nofollow

1181198
profiling	benchmarking
in other words benchmarking it and see if the performance is acceptable for realistic input data and if not the profiling it to see where the real bottlenecks are

i m not sure if i m putting the rules in the right place and i understand that you can do this in a httpd.conf file and not the .htaccess

1181358
put	get
after you get the transformed string you can just use eval and put its value into the residual or f vector in your case

1181373
width	height
how can we increase the the height and width of a cell in list

1181415
width	height
set the cell height and width in the

1181496
int	double
since bool is a value type just as int long double datetime and some other types it will always be initialized to a default value false in the case of a bool 0 in the case of an int

1181503
pull	push
i would like to learn about ajax push and pull concepts

1181521
pull	push
here is a nice a comparison of push and pull

1181524
addslashes	multibyte
with regards to this vulnerability when character set-unaware escaping is used for example addslashes in php it is possible to bypass the escaping in some multibyte character sets for example sjis big5 and gbk

1181524
versioning	upgrade
if you are unable to upgrade mysql to a versioning that includes the fix for the bug in mysql_real_escape_string parsing but run mysql 5.0.1 or higher you can use the no_backslash_escapes sql mode as a workaround

1181529
width	height
if you need to use the input field and have it display inside the entire width and height of the browser window at the time it is seen you need to redo the css like this

1181592
fink	macports
this finds the latest version 1.3.1 at time of writing and i don t use macports or fink installs it nicely with no fuss at

1181669
vim	emacs
emacs vim nano etc

1181683
postgresql	mysql
3 storing or manipulating data mysql postgresql you can say as database

1181744

to hash stings i usually use as3crypto code.google.com p as3crypto - but i know the abode utils package has a md5 and sha-1 implementation

1181759
int	boolean
if you have a primitive type string int boolean you may want to use const instead

1181770
width	height
in my air project i used current state size is width 441 height 358

google-chrome	firefox	width	height
i m trying to get a 100 width height canvas element to draw on but i m hitting something of a catch 22 because both google-chrome and firefox create scrollbars

1181796
post	get
using the above statement i will get the thread object and i only want to display lists of 20 items so i will access the post collection property of the thread object which due to lazyloading will fetch all 300 ready for me to handle how i please

1181814
post	get
i am making such query to get count of comments for every post

1181828
post	get
also a single method would be enough to get the paged post collection and the total number of post

1181839
width	height
you re probably being hit by the borders or margins on the body element -- you re asking for document.width height effectively but putting it in an element with a border so the total width of the page canvas.width+ left right borders is then bigger than the width height you originally asked for

1181840
disk	ram
a simple query like this should not take more than some tens of seconds provided you have enough ram to avoid disk thrashing

1181840
disk	ram
if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound

1181840
disk	ram
of course adding more ram could help but you need to check if the query is killing the disk or the cpu first

1181864
hide	show
this has a show hide link which i don t want

1181864
hide	show
how do i remove the show hide links on a subgroup in activescaffold

1181875
disk	ram
the limits for the current version are 4gb disk per database 1 cpu core 1gb ram

1182018
spaces	delimiter
the w command shift+w moves to the next word delimiter only by spaces not whatever vim is configured to consider a word as unshifted w does

1182072
freebsd	linux
modern operatingsystems have alternative interfaces linux has epoll freebsd has kqueue

1182130
gif	png
it makes creating graphics pretty trivial and has a wide range of output formats including png and gif

1182133
nsstring	nsxmlparser
void parser nsxmlparser parser didstartelement nsstring elementname

1182135
folder	directory
here is a windows batch script that will delete all .svn folder from a subversion working copy directory

1182137
nofollow	noindex
and bing live support noindex and nofollow in the meta directives

1182162
superclass	subclassing
for subclassing where the superclass already has overloaded constructors i would tend to assume that it is reasonable to treat any of the parent class s constructors as primary and think it is perfectly legitimate not to have a single primary constructor

1182195
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
opacity is applied in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie and opera

1182200
sorting	grouping
also by sorting the rules before-hand successive rules in the same grouping may be discarded without even testing for incompatibility with the right data structures

1182205
iwork	keynote
i m working on a cocoa application i d like to use to remotely on the same machine from a different process control which slide is currently displayed in a running apple iwork 09 keynote presentation

1182271
folder	directory
i hosted a domain ipointing to a sub directory of the www folder

1182273
versioning	upgrade
new versioning are published though but i wish we should develop an all time running and self learning software which upgrade itself without going down ever

1182307
post	get
i have read several other post here so i get the idea on the pro vs

1182316
uiview	subviews
this sample employs a container uiview in which you can swap between two subviews

1182381
google-chrome	firefox
however this show effect only occurs in firefox -- google-chrome and ie are confused

1182385
stdout	stderr
so 1 pipes only stdout 2 pipes stderr pipes everything

1182388
postgresql	mysql
it uses jdbc drivers to connect to microsoft sql server 2005 frontbase mysql openbase oracle postgresql and sybase

1182408
put	get
if you put an alert in your callback function does it get shown

1182427
width	height
so i placed two dummycubes at the position of the target cube each sized to fit either the width or the height of the viewer with appropriate values for scenescale camera distance and focallength

1182436
int	double
please do note that although some msdn documentation claims that reading to or writing from a value-type int double etc is an atomic operation and hence thread-safe this is seldom true in actual vb code

1182468
mouse	keyboard
if i ve changed altered gui keyboard and mouse should i hierarchically merge - ie mouse+keyboard then merge this with gui then commit gui to master

1182504
put	get
i can t access aviary.com right now some dns problem but if you can get to the swf then you can put it into my is it flex

1182511
mouse	keyboard
as for the second part of your question dealing with mouse keyboard branches this is how i would normally do it

1182511
bazaar	svn
note that i m hardly a bazaar expert but this is the way i ve been dealing with svn repos

1182519
serializable	deserialization
these 2 static classes will handle all of your serializable deserialization needs for string representation of xml in silverlight and any .net

1182548
gif	png
that png or gif that s only 10kb might actually be much much greater in size once the browser loads it in memory

1182606
vim	jedit	aptana	radrails
i have tried aptana radrails vim with ruby scripts jedit with ruby support etc

1182611
children	parent
otherwise just do two queries one for the parent one for the children

1182634
post	get
can you do the anonymous id and get post check when the page renders and just not render the buttons if they don t have permission

1182648
mouseover	mouseout
i solved the problem using hover insted of mouseover mouseout

1182686
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you probably serialized to a stringwriter or directly to a stringbuilder

1182695
yacc	bison
template metaprogramming can be used to easily write recursive descent language parsers and these can be inefficient compared to a carefully crafted c program or a table-based implementation flex bison yacc

1182708
google-chrome	firefox
both of the above approaches work on ie firefox and google-chrome browsers

1182753
versioning	upgrade
obviously you want to try to run the latest versioning to make upgrade less painful

1182779
hash	salt
you might also want to salt the hash properly

1182810
stdout	stderr
however the best way of solving this problem is two create two threads one for stdout and one for stderr which read those respective streams until exhausted and do whatever you need with the output

1182810
stdout	stderr
however this buffers the stdout stderr of the subprocess in memory and you get those returned from the communicate call - this is not ideal for some scenarios

1182810
stdout	stderr
another example is in a package i maintain python-gnupg where the gpg executable is spawned via subprocess to do the heavy lifting and the python wrapper spawns threads to read gpg s stdout and stderr and consume them as data is produced by gpg

1182810
stdout	stderr
data produced by gpg to both stdout and stderr can be quite large in the general case

1182817
int	chars
i was storing getch calls as chars s when they were supposed to be int s

1182829
multiplying	add
if you want to know what the decimal version is multiplying the left numeral by 16 and add it to the right numeral keeping in mind that a is 10 b is 11 etc

1182837
calloc	malloc
i m currently facing the following problem every several hours my server crashes with a segfault and the core dump shows that error happens in malloc calloc which is definitely a sign of memory being corrupted somewhere

1182860
uiview	calayer	width	height
while an uiview has a memory footprint of at least 4 width height pixels i wonder how that would look when i create a calayer only

1182878
google-chrome	safari
mozilla s and safari google-chrome s engines are just trying to make life a little easier

1182888
google-chrome	safari	webkit	blink
safari google-chrome and konqueror use webkit although on 04 03 2013 google announced that google-chrome will use its own fork from webkit named blink

1182897
uiview	calayer
so is it any useful to make a calayer only instead of an uiview that comes along with a whole bunch of them all those trees...

1182910
entity-relationship	diagram
my entity-relationship diagram is

1182919
memcpy	memset
examine all memory related functions memcpy memset sprintf new delete delete

1182923
integer	unsigned
uint means unsigned integer which means it can only represent positive values

1182931
margin	height
self.tableview.frame cgrectmake 0 44 + 20 height of navbar + some margin 320 416

1182972
uiview	calayer
you use calayer when you are not getting any benefits from using uiview and when it s not possible to do the thing you want to do with uiview

1182976
gif	png
gif images only support transparent not transparent unlike other formats like png that have full alpha support so you can do things like have 40 transparent pixels

1182996
erd	diagram
viewing the second diagram as the physical erd model - there s no benefit to having two tables with a one-to-one relationship

1183004
post	get
at that point in time abstracting the details of the web with controls and post backs was a great way to get people started

1183019
width	height
mehrdad assumes that the width is one since there is no real way to determine either the width or height from a one dimensional array by itself

1183028
onmousedown	onmouseup
in onmousedown you simply remember the button pressed and in onmouseup just check what buttons were remembered as well as clear the state for the button

1183073
width	height
while an uiview has a memory footprint of at least 4 width height pixels

1183073
uiview	calayer
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated

1183125
wordpress	joomla
two most important features i m looking for that i couldn t find in any popular cms blogging engine from my favorite textpattern to wordpress joomla and drupal are

1183145
mouseup	mousedown
i would personally use the mouseup and mousedown events for a more cleaner way to handle it and to avoid interop

1183150
versioning	upgrade
if there s a fundamental problem with the upgrade you can keep using the old versioning until the problem with the library is fixed

1183151
int	boolean
i m constantly running up against this when writing queries with linq-to-xml the value property of an xelement is a string but the data may actually be an int boolean etc

1183215
executable	upx
or you can create a single compressed executable with all the needed assemblies that is auto decompressed when started like the popular aspack and upx do for windows executable

1183224
post	get
anders heilsberg s post on this thread is i think the answer to steps #2 and #3 above if i could get the syntax right

1183224
filtering	grouping
optimally the group-by-title step could be done first so the inner grouping first by source to compute the index then by index to filtering out duplicates can operate on small numbers of objects in each by title grouping since the # of documents in each by-title grouping is usually under 100

1183273
rsa	dsa
what this means is do not roll your own rsa dsa whatever encryption algorithm

1183295
sorting	grouping
sorting and grouping posts

1183295
sorting	grouping
or sorting and grouping elements

1183337
width	height
i am trying to set up css tabs and i d like them to be the same height and width

1183368
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works across ie firefox google-chrome safari and supposedly opera too but haven t tested that

1183386
stdout	stderr
it handles the complexity associated with invoking gpg which would normally involve creating multiple filehandles other than stdout stdin and stderr among other things.

1183405
put	get
and if you want to skip lines until the closing tag you can do that where i put -- but it s becoming to become harder to read understand and parsing html by-hand might not be such a good idea if you want to get to something complicated

1183409
vb6	vba
not sure how well it works with vba but in vb6 this is what i would use

1183447
apache	nginx
if you use nginx apache nginx is my preference to run your app on passenger then why couldn t your chosen web server just serve your static files

1183449
post	get
i ll update this post when i get questions to guide what i m looking for

1183459
udp	tcp
i m rather new to the topic of network programming never having done anything but basic tcp udp on a single local machine

1183475
put	get
2 to get put a index in every item you can use the select extension method passing a func selector function

1183507
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
does this method work for major browsers ie 6+ firefox safari google-chrome

1183554
int	double
my question is whether there s a clever way to derive from the basic types int float double etc

1183578
filepath	unc
i admit it s not like you re off doing network i o in the constructor unless of course a unc filepath is passed in and you re not going to have to wait long in the constructor unless there are networking problems or you generalize the class to be able to read the html from places other than a file some of which might be slow

1183622
postgresql	mysql
don t ignore postgresql -- every bit as open as mysql not in the middle of a muddle caused in mysql s case by acquisition by sun then by oracle core developers leaving forks into drizzle mariadb ourdelta ... and just about as functionally rich and sql standards compliant as ms sql server if not more i miss recursive ctes a lot when i have to use mysql -- both sql server and postgresql have them though just as the sql standards require

1183646
width	height
if you want the links to size up to the same width and height declare the links in the list themselves to show up as block elements

1183646
width	height
otherwise any setting of the width and height will be ignored since it is an inline element

1183646
width	height
now you will be able to set the height and width of the links in the tab list to the size you wish

1183647
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this method doesn t require javascript doesn t cause to lose cleartype text in ie and is compatible with firefox safari opera ie6 7 8.

1183648
folder	directory
include_once dirname file . directory ... and what this does is if im inside of a folder and im trying to include a file that is one level up into the current page it wont work

1183648
folder	directory
and instead of it using the main root directory it includes the folder im inside as well

1183682
width	height
set the width and height of the td tag using css

1183707
ant	maven
appfuse used ant or maven to build a web application

1183716
accessor	properties
i seem have run into a problem trying to create python properties from some accessor functions i have for methods like the following

1183742
stdout	stderr
it could be that this program is poorly written and outputs its information to stderr instead of stdout

1183756
hide	show
obviously we can enable disable show hide more responding to user s actions instead of enraging users

1183760
kde	gnome
both gtk and qt have bindings for d-bus most desktop environments or at least gnome and kde expose various services via d-bus and many desktop applications can be controlled via a d-bus interface

1183775
folder	directory
otherwise try duplicating the directory and deleting the .git folder in the duplicated directory

1183848
klocwork	coverity
solutions like coverity and klocwork have an extensible rule set where you can write your own rules

1183905
width	height
if you can get a reference to the nativewindow you can set it s size with the width height using actionscript

1183916
stringbuilder	stringwriter
stringwriter uses an internal stringbuilder to write to

1183932
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
- bool tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller tabbarcontroller shouldselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

1183936
postgresql	mysql
my postgresql is rusty so if the mysql query works on postgresql i d like to know

1183956
postgresql	mysql
by the way i ll be using pylons a python framework and mysql 5 though i m open to postgresql if there are any weird utf8 restrictions i converted the whole database which was previously latin1 to utf8 by the way with iconv

1183984
webrat	cucumber
finally the pragmatic book on rspec still in beta is a great resource on how to use cucumber webrat and rspec together and drive your application development with bdd

1183989
min	max
finding the min and max is done simultaneously

1183989
min	max
then there is an algorithm that finds the min and max in 3n 2 number of comparisons

1183989
min	max
the larger of the pair should be compared with the current max and the smaller of the pair should be compared with the current min

1183989
min	max
however if one only cares about finding min and max of a few numbers as eric belair does no one will notice any difference in todays computer with any of the approaches above

1184000
min	max
min 0 max 20 name less than 20

1184000
min	max
the association between the product is on the price and the min and max

1184006
pop-up	dialog
i need to detect this mouse click so i can redraw the button in the normal image and if i am using my own dialog as the pop-up menu to hide the menu

1184028
postgresql	mysql
database mysql postgresql sqlite oracle mssql couch

1184041
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that in code below eventlistener not being fired in ie working just fine in firefox and google-chrome

1184093
decoder	encoder
now there is a png encoder in as3 in the as3corelib and i guess there are even others but probably most people considered it pointless to write a decoder since flash does this in its own and also encoding is easier than decoding because decoding means you have to implement the whole format .

1184106
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome use the webkit rendering engine which incorporates css rendering and the dom i would say it s one of the best rendering engines in addition to opera s - i think it could be of use

1184107
spaces	delimiter
all line breaks are normalized to spaces so just put them on a separate line if the spaces delimiter can handle arbitrary whitespace

1184108
fink	macports
from the documentation it appears that fink and macports install version 1.2

1184139
ggplot2	lattice
lately the author has been doing a visualization series comparing lattice and ggplot2

1184150
google-chrome	safari
same in google-chrome and probably safari

1184162
hash	salt
if storing as files ask for a name salt with current time and generate a hash for the filename

1184167
maven	pom.xml
that file is called pom.xml and provides a definition of your project to maven so it would be able to build it

1184180
hash	md5
modern hash algorithms not md5 can be considered collision-free

1184185
hash	md5
you can also hash the file eg md5 hash but then you can t list the files the user put in not with a meaningful name anyway

1184207
postgresql	mysql
there are some things mysql has and postgresql doesn t replace for example - usually if something is not in postgresql there are good reasons for it and or a workarounds

1184213
qpushbutton	qstyle	qitemdelegate	qpushbutton	qitemdelegate	qstyle
if you want the cells to look like qpushbutton s you should probably inherit from qitemdelegate and implement paint to use qstyle to draw you a qpushbutton something like this

1184241
ia-32	x86
of course all of the following applies only to x86 and x86-64 assembly language for ia-32 and amd64 processors and operating systems.

1184241
thunk	trampolines
this part is generally not portable between oses unless you use trampolines thunk basically another layer of abstraction that has to be rewritten for every os you intend to support

1184241
freebsd	linux
while every os is different most modern oses follow a general pattern you load the number of the system call you want into a register typically eax in 32-bit code then load the parameters how you do that varies wildly and finally issue an interrupt request it s int 2e for windows nt kernels or int 80h for linux 2.x and freebsd and i believe osx

1184260
maven	pom.xml
in maven 2 that model is defined in the pom.xml in maven 1 the file was called project.xml

1184260
maven	pom.xml
maven expects to find the pom.xml in the root directory of the project though this can be overridden

1184260
maven	pom.xml
when you run a maven goal the pom.xml is parsed from pom.xml maven determines what dependencies and plugins are needed downloading them from the remote repositories then runs the plugins that are configured for the project

1184260
ant	maven
if you are familiar with ant have a look at the comparing maven with an t section to understand the differences

1184271
width	height
since you re defining explicit height and width for the boxes anyways it s probably more clear and robust to just use absolute positioning with position relative set on .page1

1184276
folder	directory
poking around a bit in iis and discovered that for whatever reason the scripts folder had been made a virtual directory

1184292
public	protected
it differs from having to make a base class and then extending it with a cat and a dog and therefor have to make the sound method protected or overriding the public eat method

1184360
ironruby	ironpython
it seems to me that if i want to provide scripting capabilities in my .net app i can use the dlr and so enable scripting in ironpython or ironruby or whatever other iron languages are available for the dlr or host a powershell runspace

1184360
dynamic-languages	first-class
as a dynamic-languages itself and a first-class .net language at that why doesn t powershell also target the dlr

1184406
direct3d	directdraw
aoe 2 is a directdraw application not direct3d

1184419
put	get
after worked on many small addon i want to put those add on on my server so that people can download it and use it so that i can get the feedback from the people ..but when i am downloading it from my server it is a xpi file getting following error

1184421
for-loop	loops
since you are just calling a subroutine from the for-loop there is no way for this subroutine to exit loops directly

1184423
postgresql	mysql
as a secondary consideration clients often have less choice about which db they use postgresql mysql oracle etc than which application language they have available

1184436
postgresql	mysql
for relatively small ones stackoverflow bbc etc a normal relational database should be enough - like mysql postgresql or oracle

1184488
folder	directory
currently i am publishing the application and placing that folder in the server and creating virtual directory and providing windows authentication

1184518
pull	push
now however i want to be able to push and pull from this remote repository without having to specify where i m pushing to or pulling from

1184528
postgresql	mysql
as to skaffman s point you may want to have a look at postgresql if mysql isn t scaling for you

1184528
postgresql	mysql
the time to make the switch is highly dependent on you application environment however if you need clustering and replication to work properly 100 of the time then postgresql will not let you down as mysql has for me in the past

1184546
actionscript	mxml
amf an http-based binary format that performs serialization between actionscript mxml and server side languages

1184549
mouseout	mouseleave
you might want to try stopping the propagation of the hover event to see if that prevents the mouseout on the child from triggering mouseleave on the parent

1184554
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are very widely used by a huge number of startups because its open source and there is a lot of support out there for people using it

1184569
icmp	tcp
ethernet does not care if it s transporting icmp tcp if they are valid or not

1184634
erd	diagram
i started my first mysql project designing the erd logical and physical diagram

1184634
erd	diagram
however he uses a relational database diagram where he designs interfaces and other parts first before making the erd

1184657
fadein	fadeout
...and you can always use jquery to make it fadein or fadeout

1184680
opera	firefox
if you worry that the onscroll event does not work in opera firefox you can try changing

1184687
margin	height
change the top and bottom margin height

1184728
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby donâ t have the same integration to windows as does powershell

1184731
folder	directory
_root is the path to the directory where the application folder resides

1184738
post	get
all this thanks to the excellent post from jomo fisher here linq to sql trick get all table and column names

1184743
getter	setter
now the goal of getter and setter is to provide an interface to properties of a state of an object which might not have anything to do with how it is actually implemented

1184743
getter	setter
granted most of the time these properties are fields in the object and the getter and setter just shallow shells

1184743
getter	setter
on the other hand you have the freedom to change the internal implementation because the getter and setter will ensure interface compatibility

1184743
getter	setter
if however these properties are too related to the actual implementation and not so much with what the object is about then you should consider removing such getter and setter

1184749
post	get
all the new post don t get this hover effect even though they belong to the same class

1184749
post	get
how can i get the ajax-ed post to have a onhover effect

1184759
mouseover	mouseout
unfortunately live doesn t support hover so you have to split your code and define mouseover and mouseout event handlers

1184770
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the navigation bar displays fine

1184806
aptana	radrails
i am trying to install an amazon web service gem into my project i use window and aptana radrails but it asked me to update current ruby version 1.8.5 to 1.8.7

1184806
versioning	upgrade
so could you tell me how can i upgrade my ruby to new versioning

1184808
width	height
what about dividing the width and height of the view by itself then draw width x height squares

1184808
width	height
you could just use an nspoint and increase it by one until it hits width x height

1184877
int	boolean
even plain int and boolean can cause interop problems and more complex structures like nested arrays with optional values are very difficult to make work across different type systems

1184885
post	get
my initial plan was to use the routing object to sniff out get and post data but that data doesn t always indicate the presence of a form

1184910
width	height
returned constrainedsize should have correct width height of text

1184930
post	get
however this obviously won t catch get requests and ajax can also generate post requests so...

1184950
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1184955
mouseup	mousedown
when i mousedown and mouseup over the element i get the down and up alerts however i also get the click alert of the li s event handler too

1184955
mouseup	mousedown
i thought that this should be prevented from by the call to event.stoppropagation in the mousedown and mouseup handlers

1184963
mouseup	mousedown
the key here is that click mousedown and mouseup are distinct events

1184963
mouseup	mousedown
although you might think of a click as being a mousedown followed by a mouseup in reality you might have click events triggered by user actions that don t even involve the mouse as well as combinations of mousedown and mouseup that don t result in any click events at all

put	get
one way to do this is to make a new table in your database in which a user is put as soon as he logs in to the chat - even non-members can be helped this way as they will probably need to have some alias anyway so when they come into the chat they either have to choose a name or get one randomly - this name can be linked to an id that only goes in the chatroom with which you can easily start conversations to someone

gridview	sqldatasource
i ve just done a quick test with a gridview and sqldatasource and gave me the new value as expected

1185036
doxygen	tex
when compiling formulas doxygen will take the contents of your latex equations copies the ones that haven t been generated to html _formulas.tex relative to the output_directory specified in the doxyfile attempt to compile the tex file and then copies the result to png files

1185056
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby as well as anything other language targeted for the dlr will likely remain more familiar to the developer audience

1185060
ironruby	ironpython
but we do have a start on that in the form of the hosting apis we ship on codeplex w dlr and ironpython projects and also w ironruby over on github

1185060
ironruby	ironpython
therefore every language more or less has it s own hosting story except for ironpython and ironruby right now

1185067
client-side	server-side
would it be best done client-side or server-side

1185085
getter	setter
- per point of extensibility and generally supply getter and setter methods or properties or whatever s appropriate to the specific language to access and change that instance

1185123
haskell	sml
i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time

1185127
move	drag
my page has 2 columns and you can drag items across the 2 colums but now it only drag on the left column and items in the right colum will not move

1185185
post	get
your first query should be entirely unnecessary as facebook always provides the uid to an application via the fb_sig_user parameter post or get

1185198
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar and java.util.date both seem to cause the xsd datatype to be datetime when rendered in in wsdl xsd

1185260
width	height
if you this when the page is loaded completely not only the dom you can check the width and height of your ad images

1185274
width	height
now i want to know the width height of the the context in pixels

1185384
qtreeview	qabstractitemview
i took a look at the qt source v4.5 though i don t expect much difference between v4.4 and v4.5 for qabstractitemview and qtreeview and i don t think they support incremental lazy loading of child nodes

1185447
wordpress	joomla
drupal joomla as mentioned wordpress

1185455
width	height
the size width height for a single texture is limited by gl_max_texture_size

1185468
hide	show
my end goal is to ensure zoom controls are always displayed on the screen instead of the default hide show behavior

1185478
cvs	svn
versioning system cvs svn ... where developers commit regularly minutes hours

1185490
freebsd	solaris
this feature is only expected to work on os x solaris and freebsd

1185569
fiddler	charles
i ve found fiddler a little slow as well and i ve switched to using charlesproxy instead however if you always have them running and have them logging all browser interactions then they will make your machine slower as all browser requests all go through the fiddler charles proxy system and be logged and use up memory

1185579
children	parent
remove the explicit ids you should setup some class-based handler or at the very least target the parent id and find the images to attach to as children something like this

1185631
entity-relationship	diagram
this generated the following entity-relationship diagram

1185652
width	height
and note the data binding for the width and height works fine--all windows show up as the correct size

1185652
width	height
if i create multiple window instances but don t open any windows the width and height properties of all window instances are nan

1185652
width	height
if i then open just one of the instances the width and height properties of all window instance are suddenly valid numbers not just the width and height of the window i opened

1185686
hide	show
that said an even easier method for the functionality you want is just to use hide and show on two already-existing divs

1185703
put	get
by their get first put later nature ndash

1185725
hide	show
in the case where the countryid doesn t match i would hide the select probably clear it s value too and show an already existing input that was previously hidden

1185742
postgresql	mysql
is there an equivalent to postgresql s dblink for mysql

1185750
svg	vml
i would take a good look at dojo or more specifically dojox.gfx which allows svg rendering using canvas vml for ie or silverlight

1185755
post	put
try changing the request method to post and put those query string parameters into the request body

1185785
httphandler	httpmodule
but unlike file types such as .aspx and .ashx file types such as .js and .css that you have used in your example are not by default registered with the asp.net dll within iis so when they are requested iis doesn t pass the request through the asp.net pipeline so no httpmodule or httphandler will run

1185799
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome

1185800
pop-up	dialog	sudo	passwd
notes the sudo command will ask for me s passwd and then hdiutil might pop-up a gui dialog asking for the filevault master passwd

1185815
ethernet	wireless
it doesn t know whether it s broadband 3g ethernet wireless or any of the details - just that it s there

1185825
google-chrome	firefox
not sure how it works in firefox and google-chrome since there is no handlearrowkeys function

1185838
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
i am a .net developer and i want to turn my usb hid device mouse dance pad guitar or drums specially drums into a keyboard with few keys i know

1185840
nunit	mstest
i have some class libraries with nunit tests and i want to convert the project to use the vs 2008 mstest integration

1185894
width	height
could your width and height bindings be getting in the way

1185894
width	height
if you don t set the width and height at all does the window appear in the correct location

1185894
width	height
if all that is true then it sounds like wpf is computing the location of the window prior to getting the value of width and height from your bindings

1185894
width	height
i m not sure of a good way to get around this - maybe set width and height manually at first either in xaml or the constructor then set up the bindings once it has been displayed

1185909
disk	ram
as far as you question no you re not likely to get php to execute a modified script without writing it somewhere whether that s a file on the disk a virtual file mapped to ram or something similar

1185980
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i really want to build in all 5 well-known browsers ie firefox google-chrome opera and safari but right now i am having to right click the actual html files and open them in different browsers

1185985
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried setting staysopen true in mouseenter of popup and staysopen false in mouseleave but mouseleave fires as and when mouse is over winform control resulting in unexpected behaviour

1186007
post	get
if you are unable to get flash to post the cookie then you ll have to identify the user within the upload url

1186053
post	get
here s a blog post from o reilly radar on tips for using mechanical turk to get your work done

1186100
superclass	subclassing
you create superclass to contain common behavior among subclassing

1186100
superclass	subclassing
in some cases the superclass cannot be a complete class because each subclassing must provide an override or extension

1186100
superclass	subclassing
we provide a abstract superclass because we need subclassing to provide the missing features

1186106
getter	setter
at that point you can use a static property and maybe a pair of static getter setter methods

1186107
rss	feed
i m trying to read an rss feed from flickr but it has some nodes which are not readable by simple xml media thumbnail flickr profile and so on

1186111
spaces	delimiter
the article tags is a spaces delimiter string of text values that a user has tagged the aritlce with

1186112
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
have you implemented clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml on the wcf service

1186123
int	chars
int and getc return most chars if i printf c them including multibyte like â or even â

1186133
maven	pom.xml
how can i execute pax-runner tasks using a maven plugin which i can specify in the pom.xml file

1186143
typedef	struct
however this convention is a remnant of older versions of c where this syntax was required in order to name struct and so nowadays you can simply write something like the following omitting the typedef and the typedef names

1186154
gtk	fltk
use a cross platform library such as gtk c++ wrapper gtkmm qt wxwidgets or fltk that wrap the specific os s api

1186154
gtk	fltk
for the examples given gtk gtkmm is license under lgpl qt is under various licenses including proprietary option wxwidgets is under its own wxwindows licence with a rename to wxwidgets licence and fltk is under lgpl with exception

1186250
int	chars
the reason it returns an int is so that the eof value can be distinguished from any of the possible chars values

1186258
google-chrome	firefox
when view this page in google-chrome or firefox it looks great

1186263
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
one way to handle the user interface you mentioned would be to use mousemove mouseup and mousedown events of the trackbar

1186274
for-loop	arrays
i know i could do this with a regular for-loop by accessing the indeces of the arrays but this wouldn t be as clean

1186292
subtract	add
you could create a class for numeric values but then manipulating it would require methods as add subtract etc

1186327
debian	linux
if you are using a debian based linux .

1186379
valgrind	memcheck
i then used valgrind memcheck tool but the messages it gives are cryptic and not very conclusive it shows leaks in graphical elements of qt which on scrutiny can be straightaway rejected

1186391
subclass	abstract-class
you might want to implement a subclass of mouseadapter an abstract-class that provides empty implementations of all of the methods defined in the interfaces

1186398
curb	libcurl
you rather need something like libcurl or curb on rubyforge which are ruby bindings for libcurl or patron on rubyforge

1186398
post	put	post	get	put	get
these libraries can make a request header as per your liking setting content-type choosing among get put post delete head etc. and obtain the response and probably follow 302 redirections when needed

1186408
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram

1186408
entity-relationship	diagram
i know this is not uml but a good database design upfront is important and an entity-relationship diagram would help you to organise and plan how different tables relate with each other

1186415
config	ini
i m trying to make an install using wix and i need to modify a config file not xml or ini with entries that a customized wix dialog

1186426
width	height
i believe that aspect ratio is width divided by height

1186440
valgrind	memcheck
you said you tried valgrind memcheck tool

1186464
stateless	stateful
since windows forms are stateful opposed to stateless for web forms you can just use a field in your form class

1186470
width	height
width height gets you a decimal converted to a fraction with in place of gives you a ratio

1186547
webrat	cucumber
cucumber generates out some neat webrat regex steps

1186550
put	get
unless you put it in an tag you can not get the visited active etc colors without javascript

1186554
put	get
however if there is a possibility that you will need more this can get wasteful so i agree with other answers you should put them in a collection of your choice and use it to loop through them to see which ones are checked

1186605
boost	stl
before becoming a c# developer i was a hardcore c++ stl com programmer but never really used boost back then apart from playing around with a smart pointers from boost

1186687
rss	feed
i developing a website where i need to read the rss feed from users blogs websites and store it in database

1186715
pop-up	dialog
when you press print in calendar print preview the print dialog that pop-up has more options cross browsers

1186717
stateless	stateful
the straightforward difference is that static methods are stateless whereas non-static methods are stateful

1186726
put	get
selecteditem is the closest to what you re looking for but since it s an object you have to cast it to the type of the items you put in the listbox to get additional properties

1186745
portrait	landscape
i would play around with css and javascript on that print page and see if i can mimic something like that by switching between landscape and portrait using js and css rules make 2 buttons - landscape portrait when user clicks on them you change css rules for your calendar so that it fits given paper size

1186764
many-to-many	one-to-many
this could be one-to-one for private tuition or it could be one-to-many if the students attend classes with the teachers or it could be many-to-many if students attend several classes

1186807
webkit	gecko
as opposed to writing 50-100+ lines of dom scripting to account for inconsistencies of the dom api across webkit gecko presto trident et cetera

1186828
draggable	droppable
from what i understand you have a bunch of draggable that share a common purpose but their droppable need to change depending on which one was dragged

1186828
draggable	droppable
all that s needed is to hook into the start event of the draggable and conditionally change the accept options of the droppable you want them to work with

1186828
draggable	droppable
but instead of hooking into the drag method of the draggable to constantly monitor which element it is over you can simply use the over and out methods of your droppable to add and remove a class to the draggable-helper

1186836
free	malloc
you need to in program.c to for example use malloc and free

1186836
dlsym	dlopen
similarly you need for dlopen and dlsym . if you don t do that the compiler will complain that it doesn t know what those names are and halt with an error

1186836
dlsym	dlopen
one last thing dlopen and dlsym are not the normal method of linking

1186873
jar	war
the structure of a war file is very different then a jar so it doesn t work

1186873
jar	war
the java class files are kept inside classes directory of the war whereas jar directly have the java class files

1186875
jar	war
basically extract out the common functionality make it a library as a jar file and either include that jar file in both war files or add it to a common part of the classpath

1186880
put	get
if you do have a secret code or something you need to hide from people usually as part of a drm or drm-like system one way to made it harder to get to would be to not directly put the code in your app

1186895
width	height
the jpeg format compresses color information in squares of 2x2 pixels by getting an average color to represent all four pixels so if your image width and height are divisible by two you will lose less quality as most of the information removed in the compression is information that was interpolated in the decompression

1186895
width	height
likewise the brightness information is compressed in squares of 8x8 pixels so if your width and height are divisable by eight the grid will align after rotating the image and you will lose less actual information

1187006
wordpress	joomla
wordpress joomla is web based and on a hosted server going from page to page takes time

1187017
profiling	debugging
though not a full blown profiling with a yummy gui you could use windbg + sos to debugging your silverlight app it would require a lot of manual work but you can then walk your managed heap

1187025
wordpress	joomla
you mention that it takes a long time to go between pages on wordpress joomla but think about how much longer than that it takes for your users to load up whatever monstrosity you may have concocted in flex

1187125
unix	bsd
you could use the low level bsd unix style network socket calls but luckily you don t have to

1187130
division	modulo
zerodivisionerror integer division or modulo by zero

1187157
width	height
i ve done all steps to load the texture but when i call getdesc the fields width and height of the d3dsurface_desc struct are of the next bigger power-of-2 size

1187165
cpython	ironpython
ironpython s main strength is in integration with the .net ecosystem - it s not a drop-in replacement for cpython

1187202
rss	feed
for instance i have a single very large statement which converts items in my database into an rss feed

1187216
rss	feed
for creating rss feed i prefer there classes work really well and since you are working with objects it makes generating your output quite easy if you have a dal of some sort

1187236
equals	gethashcode
i d recommend using a struct and overriding gethashcode equals and implementing iequatable structname which is used by dictionary tkey tvalue

1187247
post	get
it s huge though - 24g compressed - you need to get it by post on dvds from ldc

1187257
width	margin
change your window.showmodaldialog options to use width 300px instead of dialogwidth 300px - the horizontal scrollbar disappears and the vertical scrollbar is to the right of the margin

1187280
folder	directory
i have an asp.net web application which has 3 projects to handle 3 different layers of the application ui bl and data access .when i publish the ui project a directory called precompiled will be created in the solution and files will be available there.this folder will have a bin directory which holds required dll s referenced dll s and dll of business layer project dll of dataaccesslayer project too

1187280
folder	directory
so i created a website and under that i created virtual directory for the above sites.i put index.asp of the ui project i had in my solution in the folder which is mapping to one virtual directory and when trying to access i am getting an error like the following

1187280
folder	directory
root folder - bin folder various ui related files folder a folder which is converted to a virtual directory now websitea

1187280
folder	directory
if i copy the bin folder from my root and paste it in each of the virtual directory folder along with the index.aspx its working.but i dont want to have same bin folder for each sites.i want to have only one bin which should be in the root folder

1187290
boost	stl
the most important books i read were all herb sutter books because idioms used in boost and cetainly in stl are pretty well discussed there exceptional c++ more exceptional c++ and exceptional c++ style

1187310
width	height
to fetch the height width

1187323
maven	pom.xml
i m quite new to maven and i don t know how to write the pom.xml file that does this and couldn t find a similar example in the maven book

1187324
post	get
if you get a chance post your answer as i ve recently run into the same issue

1187358
width	height
when rasterizing svg file i would like to be able to set width and height for the resulting png file

1187358
width	height
with the following code only the canvas is set to the desired width and height the actual image content with the original svg file dimension is rendered in the top left corner on the 500 600 canvas

1187358
librsvg	cairo
also documents for librsvg python binding seem to be extremely rare only some random code snippets on cairo site

1187390
innodb	myisam
as each row will take at least 16b you can have up to 250m rows in the table before the table uses 4gb fat32 limit if there is one archive per table which is the case for myisam and innodb

1187426
int	chars	subtract	add
you can only add subtract int from a chars pointer

1187469
fseek	ftell
eg if you are using c language then you can go to the end of the file using fseek fp seek_end and then use ftell fp which will give you the current position of the file pointer

1187549
gif	png
i tried with transparent backgroud images png and gif formats and it always draw something surrounding the star

1187642
children	parent
is there any way we can connect less often and bring back larger chunks of data via the use of multiple result sets we use stored procedures. so instead of each child object loading its own data the parent will fetch all data for itself and its children

1187689
free	malloc	puts	gets
we don t directly perform malloc new free delege .instead we call osa layer s routines and it gets the memory from os and puts it in a list then returns this memory to application. routines xxalloc xxfree xxrealloc

1187744
post	get
i m programming a service for a program that uses http post get requests so i handle all incoming requests with a hook method that takes a system.io.stream and returns a system.io.stream

1187744
filepath	unc
when i return a filepath a windows unc not going to explain why i do that i initially url-encoded the string before converting to a stream and returning it using a return-statement the client seems to get a doubly-coded string

1187765
cvs	svn
install svn cvs git plugin

1187784
int	double
update since you specify a need to distinguish int from double with zero-value decimal portions i think you ll have to do something like the following

1187786
int	double
as you are essentially trying to figure out if a double is an int or not you can create a bigdecimal and test its scale method

1187825
getter	setter
right click then source equally useful with a special mention to generate getter and setter and implement methods

1187844
client-side	server-side
your mindset changes depending on if you re writing code for the client-side or server-side

1187882
versioning	upgrade
do i have to upgrade my quartz versioning

1187915
pull	push
the hg command push and pull move changes between repositories and update and commit moves changes between your working copy and your local repository

1187926
firefox	safari
for example safari has sqlite support and firefox now has web workers

1187939
versioning	upgrade
wizardby can also be integrated into your build process as well as into your application on each startup in can attempt to upgrade database to the most recent versioning

1188000
shadowbox	lightbox
fyi shadowbox is a javscript media viewer lightbox

1188000
width	height
the swf loads with a width and height of 300x300

1188033
put	get
are you sure the html you get back from your ajax is the same as the code that you are using when you put it in statically

1188034
post	get
you can pretty much google svn dropbox and you ll get all the information you need if these two post are missing anything

1188077
tolower	toupper
i prefer the comparer approach to doing some sort of tolower toupper on everything dictionary-related

1188090
post	get
you can not get post variables through rewriting to different domains like that because it has to redirect the request

1188140
put	get
the other thing you get with the dispatchtimer is that it s tick event is automatically evaluated on the dispatch queue so you don t have to explicitly put it in the dispatch queue.

1188147
profiler	aqtime
aside from the clr profiler i ve used aqtime to pinpoint bottlenecks in my projects

1188189
getter	setter
in .net 2.0 methods including property getter setter would be inlined if they had fewer than 32 bytes

1188192
getter	setter
yes in java you need a lot of lines but i just write my attributes and tell the ide please create getter and setter for me

1188271
apache	nginx
bundled with nginx generally all apache does is cost you resources

1188311
rdf	owl
the core principles would include understanding of rdf rdfs owl and

1188417
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1188430
post	put
than i wonna put this post inside include tag to render in more detail context

1188449
jar	war
should it be the war file with production settings or a jar of all of the classes and none of the resources

1188465
children	parent
basically i want these events to be propagated to children but not to parent like one way binding

1188555
children	parent
i thought maven would support this as it has info on the parent and the parent has info on the children but i think i was inferring too much

1188580
post	get
you get the id of the insert either with mysql_insert_id or last_insert_id from mysql directly so to post some connected info you can do either

1188580
multi-query	mysql
depending on your language and mysql libraries you might not be able to issue the multi-query approach so you re better off with using the first approach

1188606
packets	multicast
i have a quick and dirty proof of concept app that i wrote in c# that reads high data rate multicast udp packets from the network

1188678
pull	push
people can still push and pull from you because the repository still has all the data about the changesets

1188678
pull	push
you re never going to log in to bitbucket s servers edit your code and commit there -- you re only ever going to push pull clone

1188770
opera	firefox
so now with the new firefox opera ie is it finally time to start developing sites with html5 or is it still a little premature and will cause compatibility issues

1188805
debian	linux
client is running windows based os server that will export him the java web app is running linux debian

1188806
inherited	properties
the case where this is not ok is the case pet inherited from person â in this case the managed object model compiler will generate an error about conflicting properties names when it compiles your model file

1188817
fflush	gets
supposedly a flush.php in a maintenace folder will fflush it s cache which is invconveniently separate from the rest of drupal s cache but trying to execute in browser gets me an error

1188832
versioning	upgrade
i recommend keeping a list of all software that your project utilizes along with their versioning and last upgrade date along with other important information such as licensing info support info etc.

1188832
versioning	upgrade
software on this list with an old versioning date and a newer versioning available may be incentive enough to convince management that an upgrade should be done

1188853
submit	submission
for instance rather than submission the full path c users ericlaw documents secret image.png internet explorer 8 will now submit only the filename image.png

1188910
mantis	bugzilla
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

1188940
salt	md5
you can md5 or encrypt for better security the client ip using a secret salt + date and pass this as a parameter in iframe src url

1189002
put	get
when i cut out something and put it somewhere else i sometimes get something else like a messed up part of my previous selection or just some whitespaces

1189010
qtkit	quicktime
i believe that kmovieloadstateplayable belongs to a quicktime framework and i have both qtkit and and the quicktime framework in my program but i can t figure out why it is erroring here

1189014
pthreads	fork
this did not make sense to me so i tested on the simulator pthreads works fork doesn t

1189029
getter	setter
if you have a public getter and setter that strictly copies the value passed to class field i think that s just overcomplicated approach

1189029
getter	setter
the only situation i can think of where you would want to use getter or setter is when you have to process the value somehow

1189032
folder	directory
right click your project go to properties go to msbuild options tab you will see an output folder by default it should have some path called precompiledweb that s where your output is and you need deploy this to your iis directory

1189045
getter	setter
the right thing to do from a purist oo perspective is create your own setter getter method ideally by overloading php s that makes the relevant data available

gridview	repeater
i am using a group by key and count which i evaluate in the aspx page for a master detail gridview with a repeater

1189058
getter	setter
just do good oop i suggest you to declare getter and setter against accessing variables directly.. and forget about __get and __set

1189059
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote a function that does this in ie by creating a button object and setting value view but in firefox and google-chrome the button displays with no text

1189063
pthreads	fork
and as you said pthreads work and fork doesn t so its logical it would work on the real one as well

1189064
freemarker	velocity
have you considered using a templating engine such as freemarker or velocity

1189073
gridview	sqldatasource
you might also use the sqldatasource and gridview controls they help a lot

1189078
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
i added this new view to a uiwindow after adding the uinavigationcontroller s view

1189102
getter	setter
that s why we have the terror of getter and setter methods

1189114
getter	setter
not only in php but in object oriented programming in general if a class has member variables for which it s not necessary to execute code when they are accessed there s no need to make setter and getter and the variables can be accessed directly

1189126
getter	setter
but note that using getter setter is said to have a cost it costs some cpu when you speak about performance as you have to call a method

1189126
getter	setter
when i don t need to check anything i don t use getter setter

1189126
getter	setter
when i need some special behaviour i declare my variables as protected private and create a special getter setter like getname setname

1189194
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer will allow you to ajax remote domain when running from file but firefox and google-chrome won t

1189209
ienumerable	iqueryable
neither ienumerable nore iqueryable will not work

1189221
many-to-many	one-to-many
many-to-many and one-to-many relationships are modeled with plain collections

1189233
findwindow	showwindow
i realize this has been answered but you could force a window to hide with unmanaged calls to findwindow and showwindow

1189256
filtering	grouping
this only has the option of including grouping of output and excluding files via the filtering

1189260
getter	setter
no further structure or control than getter and setter

1189260
getter	setter
is there some sort of super awesome compiler trick going on that involves reflection getter and setter and the need for some very awkward but compiler optimized static associative arrays

1189347
rsa	dsa
dsa doesn t work but using rsa does

1189378
trac	bugzilla	trac	mantis	mantis	bugzilla
from free ones you can use bugzilla mantis or trac which i was able to get running on windows but there are many hostings available too

1189382
getter	setter
getter and setter are great if you want to override the access to your data for example for logging security or returning a value different from the original class

1189390
getter	setter
people do overuse silly getter setter no doubt about that

1189429
post	get
how can i override that setting and get all post in that category regardless of the maximum post setting

1189443
nsstring	nsdata
you were creating a ton of autoreleased nsstring and nsdata objects and converting strings to data every time just to append data bytes

1189479
getter	setter
this allowed auxiliary tools to be built which were based on at the time novel ideas like specifying exactly what the name of getter and setter were and an expectation that specific methods would exist without needing to ascribe to an interface

1189514
linqdatasource	detailsview
i am now using a detailsview that has a textarea as one of the fields and uses a linqdatasource as its datasource

1189523
merb	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	merb
which i believe is a syntax that is used only by ruby-on-rails not by merb sinatra or ramaze

1189572
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
imagemagick graphicsmagick gd

1189599
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
one benefit is it allows you to prototype your applications in a dynamic-languages and then optimize them in a statically compiled-language

1189660
mp3	speex
the problem is the gui only allows for some encodings mp3 nellymoser raw etc but not speex

1189697
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome and even firefox do support it

1189725
getter	setter
a bean property is usually defined by a variable declaration with matching getter and setter methods

1189729
isnull	nullif
easier to isnull or nullif in sql to deal with empty strings and other such

1189733
getter	setter
getter setter are ugly but are embedded into so many tools that make assumptions about class method field names spring that aside from their obvious value for encapsulation they ve effectively become a near requirement unless you re working in a very limited and private context

1189738
symfony	kohana	codeigniter	kohana
i agree with tom -- you should look into using a framework such as zend cake symfony kohana codeigniter ez-components or seagull

1189797
daemons	systemd
your pylons controller makes a systemd call to your 2nd process passing whatever data is needed and the 2nd process immediately becomes a daemons

1189838
inherited	subclassing
could you not inherited say a skeleton of the sql then use a function in each subclassing to complete the query based on its needs

1189879
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a button gridview and sqldatasource at the top of the page and another button gridview and sqldatasource with the second query at the bottom

1189917
tcpclient	networkstream
when i read from the networkstream object that i get from the tcpclient class the networkstream read method does not block if there is no data available

1189942
post	put
when i make a post or put http request

1189942
post	put
and the post or put creates a change to the google app engine database

1189942
post	put
after the post or put request returns

1189942
post	put	post	get	put	get
put simply i wish to know if when i get a response from a post or put if there is a guarantee that all future request to the datastore will have indexes reflecting the changes that the post or put made

1189972
cos	sin
a rotation would be x cos theta y sin theta where theta is the angular value that you wish to rotate by and a scale would be a x b y with a being the scale factor along the x-axis and b being the scale factor along the y-axis

1189984
ubuntu	opensuse
i m working on a java applet and i was wondering where the heck system.out was going in ubuntu opensuse

1189984
ubuntu	opensuse
in windows i just pull up jconsole but i ve not found this in ubuntu opensuse

1190010
int	boolean
number int uint boolean use the standard string representation for a literal

1190066
post	get
no matter which form i post i always get the same array returned

1190100
post	get
if the css is rendered inline blame ms for that lol post back here and i ll try to get back with a workaround

1190133
hide	show
below is my full code its basic you select a country and it show or hide the correct form underneath problem is it gives an error

1190161
vsto	add-in
i have vs2005 but that plus vsto 2005 se can only do application-level add-in not document-level macros

1190185
client-side	server-side
it includes client-side support for javascript .net mono ios mac os x java silverlight windows phone windows runtime and .net compact with server-side support for .net mono and php

1190248
cobertura	emma
a better approach is to track code coverage using a tool such as cobertura or emma which happens to have a nice eclipse plugin that allows you to see inside your source code what code is being covered by tests and which isn t

1190265
firefox	safari
this sounds like a bug in firefox safari where a flash movie with wmode set to transparent or opaque contained in a floated element doesn t properly register click events

1190322
actionscript	mxml
is it possible to create an instance of the main mxml and use it inside the actionscript class

1190336
hide	show
how can i show or hide a web part in the add web parts pop up window

1190369
google-chrome	firefox
specifically what causes a page to look different in firefox google-chrome ie what are the gotchas when developing how can this issue be addressed in a new project etc

1190371
inherited	properties
even then though you would bind a properties on the mxml file either in an mx script or in code-behind via inherited and then have your textfield bind to the properties

1190395
children	parent
this then makes the actual mdiclient area smaller so we can see what is behind it the bit which hosts the children forms and it is blatantly obvious that the parent form is not painting or something

1190413
cvs	svn
i am trying to perform a migration from cvs to svn on my our new xserve server which is running os x server

1190444
actionscript	mxml
how can i call mxml components inside my actionscript class

1190444
actionscript	mxml
i need to access the username and password fields of mxml in my actionscript class

1190484
post	get
if i get an answer i will post it here too

1190551
ant	maven
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

1190586
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up there s a text box for the location

1190602
implements	extends
when you want a certain task to be executed by another thread you can extends thread or implements runnable

1190603
int	chars
i didn t know you could do that and after studying it i can see that all that happens is the binary value of the chars you re using gets thrown into an int

1190625
int	chars
chars are just 1 byte int so why not

1190638
google-chrome	firefox
i have one site that is https - it will track visits from ie but not from firefox or google-chrome

1190638
google-chrome	firefox
i tried replacing their piwik.php with a simple file of my own that just writes a text file - this works from ie from firefox and google-chrome it doesn t even create the file

1190654
filtering	grouping
i usually think of a vm as a filtering grouping and sorted collections of model classes

1190656
setinterval	settimeout
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

1190662
memcached	apc
even when i store the object explicitly in apc or memcached the time to unserialize it and load all of the classes takes almost as long as creating the object in the first place

1190687
int	chars
using a chars literal in an enum is essentially the same as assigning a chars to an int â it s totally legal and can be quite useful in many situations

1190742
cvs	svn
port install git-core cvs cvsps svn if necessary

1190742
cvs	svn
now add the cvs git repo to svn repo

1190742
cvs	svn
now merge the cvs master branch to the local svn master branch

1190748
maven	pom.xml
as well as the require-bundle form of dependency management most similar to maven s pom.xml dependencies it s also possible to have import-package dependencies

1190751
children	parent
my question is some of the nodes have children and if you click the little + box next to that node it will expand the tree but it will also select that parent node

1190768
folder	directory
typically applications will write their temporary files to temp if they just need temporary non-recoverable file access however you will probably be better off writing them to the users directory in your own folder you have created there

1190768
pop-up	dialog
this folder is typically going to be the same spot that the user would choose when the save dialog pop-up

1190813
keydown	keyup
i tried faking the dispatch keyboard event keyup keydown with keycode 8 and keynumber 8 without success

1190840
client-side	server-side
your server-side code php cannot know about the actions that have been taken on the client-side without having communicated with the browser

1190847
memcached	apc
in general however caching mechanisms apc memcached etc are really trying to remove the db connection s more than improve performance and thereby decrease the overall db strain

1190903
post	get
it looks like you re populating the control only if there s no postback so what happens here is that on post you get your control with no items and obviously no value

1190911
range	min
where range is how many consecutive numbers you want to choose from and min is the smallest of these

1190911
range	min
so to generate a number between 1 and 100 range is 100 and min is 1

1190935
move	drag
currently the drag functionality i have set up is fine and dragging the image does move it around the screen the trouble is that you don t have to drag the image view to move it you can also drag anywhere on the screen and it will move the image

1190937
disk	ram
at that time the disk encryption key is in ram a reboot later the key could be in the bad guy s possession.

1191039
mp3	wav
achieving this with a recording of a horn as a wav or mp3 file or whatever is a relatively difficult programming task especially for someone who s never worked with audio before

1191052
stdout	stderr
for what purpose are there deferr defout and why there is no defin if there are stderr stdout and stdin and also stdin stdout and stderr

1191061
firefox	safari
i ve lost count of the my site looks great in firefox ie safari but it s all screwed up in ie safari firefox. questions

1191085
pdfsharp	itextsharp
i need to add a table using itextsharp or even pdfsharp if it can do it into an existing pdf template at a particular location in the template

1191103
ant	maven
i know that ant would be better for this but i m using maven in my project

1191103
ant	maven
i m not going to switch to ant just for that i m asking how to do this with maven

1191103
ant	maven
there is ant ant plugin but it just generates ant build.xml that points dependencies to local maven repo

1191105
ubuntu	linux
i run a q6600 2.4ghz 4gb of ram 64-bit linux ubuntu 9.04 system and this query can take up to 6.7 seconds to run i do have a huge database

1191107
hprof	jprofiler
jprofiler is pretty nifty but you can get the same information using hprof which was introduced in java 5

1191112
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

1191112
hash	salt
the necessity of hiding the salt for a hash

1191112
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
clients-side md5 hash with time salt

1191113
submit	submission
add a click event handler to the submit button so that it enables all of the disabled dropdown menus before submission the form

1191115
width	height
the width height of r1 r2 r3 and r4 are unknown

1191115
width	height
the problem is that i do not know width or height of the content and thus not of the r1 through r4 s

1191122
hash	salt
why not add a random salt to the password and hash that combination

1191122
hash	salt
next concatenate the hash and salt to a single byte and store that in the db

1191124
hash	salt
many systems will store the plain text salt in the database in the column right next to the hash password

1191124
hash	salt
without the random and unique salt for each password the hash values would be the same and obviously if the password for user a is cracked then user b must have the same password

1191124
factors	mean
the variations in work factors will mean more tables would have to be built

1191128
width	height
if you don t set the width or the height they will naturally form

1191128
width	height
the height is determined by the length of the content and the width if not specified will fill the width of the container it is in

1191145
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are global stream constants default values

1191145
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are global variables initialised to the value of the stream constants

1191145
stdout	stderr
i believe defout and deferr were deprecated some time ago with the release of ruby 1.8.2 and current best practice is to use only stdin stdout and stderr

1191158
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
expect string comparison to be case-sensitive is and eq operators are case-insensitive

1191164
firefox	safari
firefox safari will continue working

1191226
vbscript	jscript
finally before you even think about using vbscript go and read why vbscript and jscript msi customactions suck

1191258
floyd-warshall	clrs
however if you assume that floyd-warshall is the only algorithm for computing such a thing big-theta of |v| 3 then i have a bit of good news for you johnson s algorithm for sparse graphs thank you trusty clrs

1191265
mako	formencode
i m working in pylons with mako and i d like to create forms and validations with formencode for several parts of my application

1191269
int	double
taking the int into floats or double only brings in all the quirks of floating point numbers such as their ability to represent more numbers close to zero than close to one

1191319
dojo	dwr
we are using jersey jsr-311 for rest on server and was wondering that instead of using libraries like jquery or dojo if there is a library that can take a rest class annotated using jsr311 annotations and create javascript stub like dwr does

1191322
hash	salt
random password generation which is basically picking random symbols of a certain minimum length and password storage which in practical terms involve storing a hash of the password with a salt so that the plaintext password can t be discover just by reading the database

1191322
hash	salt
so to protect against that a random per user salt value is added to the password before it is hash

1191331
children	parent
i would like to know how to properly eager load associated children with minimal queries and possibly how to accomplish my routine generically not knowing how far down i need to build the hierarchy but given a parent entity grab all the associated child collections and then do what i need to do

1191348
hash	salt
for example if your users have 4 letter passwords it could probably be cracked in seconds even with a salt and the newest hash algorithm

1191378
jlist	jtextfield
use a jtextfield to enter in the calculations and a jlist to display the old ones and their answers

1191381
folder	directory
when you are designing an application assumed in english and you ask the user to provide a path to a directory folder do you use the term directory or folder

1191386
firefox	safari
he forwarded it to all his friends and they all use firefox or safari now

1191388
folder	directory
for command-line applications directory rather than folder seems to be the norm everywhere including win32

1191405
hide	show
when you select usa from the country list it hide the othstate field when you select any country other then the usa it hide the usa statelist and show the input field

1191410
folder	directory
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder

1191416
spaces	delimiter
another problem with your approach above is that there will probably be some delimiter between the words typically one or more spaces for instance you will need to handle read write on these too

1191428
mouse	keyboard
keyboard mouse disks they all just stop and the image on my screens are frozen

1191431
jlist	jtextfield
if you are open to different interfaces you might want to try something like a jtextfield at the top of your view from which you can receive as input your new inputted equation and then below it with the same width a jlist that would scroll to have all of the previous equations and their results

1191446
mouse	keyboard
note that if you actually need to simulate a general click regardless of whether it s performed by mouse keyboard touch input or other method or other high-level interaction with the control you should probably use wpf automation api instead

1191484
put	get
i put all my shorcuts and commands in here and i attach it to the win-r key so i can get to them easily

1191525
gif	png	png	tga
i ve tried png gif tga

1191556
getter	setter
and it s not possible with setter getter function you have to call setlabel bla from the script

1191556
getter	setter
2 properties are basically the same functions as setter and getter

1191585
ant	maven
i have seen this problem often when there was a script ant maven ... that would handle the xmlbeans compilation and another mechanism was used for compiling and running the rest of the code

1191603
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme	ocaml	scheme
functional programming haskell scheme ocaml lisp others tend to espouse pure functions

1191646
serializable	deserialization
a good way to figure out how a particular collection is expected for deserialization is to return that collection from a test method and examine how javascriptserializer has serializable it

1191681
vim	emacs
emacs vim vs express

1191751
google-chrome	firefox
this works for a new tab in firefox and google-chrome doesn t seem to work in ie 8 but this may depend on the doctype

1191757
eurekalog	madexcept
madexcept free or eurekalog paid may help

1191766
actionscript	mxml
on a bit of a different line of thought -- is this an mxml flex project or an actionscript flex project

1191768
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

1191793
cvs	svn
in general i tend to prefer not branching until as late in the process as possible as branching and merging with cvs svn tend to be heavyweight processes

1191820
octal	hex
i see it s stuck in a number of websites but all the characters have been replaced with their hex or octal equivalent

1191829
ssl	https
when you purchase a certificate from verizon instant ssl they will give you some encrypted code using which you could configure your open ssl software and then having https urls will work

1191876
serializable	deserialization
remotely call the rules engine in process - a classic batch style trick to avoid the overhead of serializable and deserialization

1191890
public	protected
note you should make your base classes explicitly public private or protected rather than relying on the defaults

1191892
folder	directory
for example i have html folder and xml folder in same directory

1191908
int	boolean
rbt int is a set of int s rbt bool is a set of boolean etc

1191945
width	height
since opengl requires all textures to have 2 n width and height i basically put the 100 x 200 graphic right into a 128 x 256 image for this

1191955
perl	tcl
i am working with vmd a molecular dynamics visualization package and i want to open vmd from a perl script run a tcl script print the output to a log file then close vmd and return to the perl script

1191983
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in c++ when a class inherited other class if i create an object for the subclassing then will the subclassing object create memory for all data members and member functions for the superclass too

1192000
superclass	subclassing
vtables are another issue and are per-class and not per-instance anyway -- an instance of the subclassing embeds if you will one of the superclass

1192000
superclass	subclassing
say all instance variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instance of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance variables plus 12 for the instance variables of the superclass

1192043
ubuntu	debian
looks like you re missing some package like python_dev or the like -- debian and derivatives including ubuntu have long preferred to isolate everything that could possibly be of developer s use from the parts of a package that are for everybody .

1192052
sorting	filtering
you could look at using ibindinglistview if you want sorting and filtering

1192055
google-chrome	firefox
it is not browser specific and happens on ie firefox google-chrome

1192059
udp	tcp
if the server and client are running on networks separated by a hub switch that won t forward udp the most likely case then i have a server instance running on each segment and they forward client requests to each other via tcp - but i need to configure this for the server instances simple but still a pain for tech support. this is the main problem that i need to address

1192083
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
it has no virtual methods that you can override except equals gethashcode and tostring

1192083
public	protected
be sure to read the documentation - this is a very easy class to derive from but you have to realize the difference between the public non-virtual and protected virtual methods

1192094
ubuntu	centos
i don t know if it s activated by default on centos but it might be considering it is on ubuntu which is less entreprise oriented

1192094
post	get
request post get and session vars

1192105
super	implements
you can verify if they are the culprit by setting a breakpoint on them or implements them to call super and breaking on your own code.

1192136
packets	multicast
the clients then send their initial discovery request as a udp packets to the pre-ordained multicast address

1192146
swt	swing
it feels as though swt is waning just an opinion based on literature i can find and swing is surging

1192154
expander	togglebutton
i think you could achieve this by binding a togglebutton which expander uses too internally to the maxheight property of your listbox

1192165
apache	nginx
i m building a website using django + apache and nginx to serve my static content

1192197
implements	extends
extends thread directly is considered bad practice prefer to implements runnable instead

1192201
int	chars
for instatnce in c c++ almost evertying but specialy values defined as chars int long float and arrays of course go on stack

1192201
disk	ram
but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there

1192226
melt	reshape
you can also use melt from the reshape library i think it s easier to use than reshape itself - that ll save you the extra step of having to add the time column back in.

1192236
redhat	fedora
some linux distros for example fedora and redhat disable ec due to patent concerns

1192282
versioning	upgrade
i also display a wizard page where the user can select the versioning he wants to upgrade from

1192282
folder	directory
the libraries can be found in the sdk folder of your wix installation you ll mainly need microsoft.deployment.windowsinstaller.dll documentation is in the dtf.chm in the doc directory

1192290
int	chars
in particular concentrate on every place where the encoding could be going wrong and make sure that whenever you display a string you dump out the exact unicode chars as int so you can check those rather than just whatever your current font wants to display

1192290
int	chars
make it dump the individual unicode chars as int before and after

1192290
int	chars
i don t know the oracle functions to convert strings into sequences of individual unicode chars and then convert those chars into int but that would quite possibly be the next thing i d try

1192295
hide	show
then to show or hide the tooltip

1192312
int	chars
c - the argument is treated as an int and presented as the chars with that ascii value

1192312
integer	unsigned
u - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as an unsigned decimal number

1192391
eurekalog	madexcept
those tools eurekalog jcl or madexcept are needed if you distribute your program among users and want to gather bug-reports about problems on client side

1192395
children	parent
children are not created until initialize is called usually via addchild when the component is added to it s parent

1192408
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you can try to subclass uiimageview and implement touchesbegan and touchesmoved on it directly

1192417
mouseover	mouseleave
for some elements especially elements with the disabled property set the mouseout-handler hiding a tooltip by setting it s display property to none just doesn t get registered so the tooltip stays visible when the mouseleave the element mouseover does work

1192447
for-loop	arrays
edit to clarify i m obviously familiar with the option of a for-loop however it s not an arrays i m going through but rather an unordered collection

1192464
filesystems	ntfs
the simplest way of doing it would be use the access rights in windows ntfs filesystems

1192477
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
in any case neither the folderbrowserdialog nor the savefiledialog offer any in-built means of restricting the user selection

1192521
udp	tcp
some of the compiler semantics and necessary header files may have changed a bit over the years but the basics of setting up a udp or tcp sockets and doing basic dns stuff discussed are still valid today

1192582
stdout	stderr
if i run the program from the command line everything works there is something written to the stderr and i also tried by using the stdout with the same result

1192596
maven	m2e
i m using m2e and have it manage dependencies for me so i had expected maven to take care of this

1192622
google-chrome	firefox
i have a web page using css and it s run ok in firefox 3.5 but not in firefox 3.1 and google-chrome

1192637
google-chrome	safari
this script will run correctly in safari and google-chrome

1192642
post	put	post	get	put	get
webservice process methods with data recieved via the html-actions put post get delete

1192650
google-chrome	firefox
it behaves as i expect in firefox ie8 but not in google-chrome

1192685
division	modulo
is modulo remainder after division

1192810
collabnet	svn
there is a plug-in named ankhsvn available on collabnet is one of the best add-on for visual studio for svn client

1192853
zlib	system.io.compression
use the built in compressing library within system.io.compression or the zlib library which is simple and incredibly good

1192895
width	height
it s grabbing the width and height from the assigned data property so you might need to set variablerowheight to true in your actual list for it to work as expected

1192937
post	put
i need to put the comments inside the table cell of the status post somehow

1192937
post	get
in the image below there is 1 status post and 3 comments for that post what i am trying to do is get the comments to show up in there own table that will be nested in the right side right under the status post

1192943
perl	tcl
in the perl script before calling vmd write the parameters to a file in tcl syntax

1192951
folder	directory
each folder contains data for one day and we will have around 18 months of directory 550 directory

1192996
versioning	upgrade
it should check a field in the database to see what versioning the schema is at and handle the upgrade to the latest versioning

1192998
addclass	removeclass
for dealing with classes jquery has some helper methods addclass class removeclass class and hasclass class

1193008
listview	checkboxlist
within my listview i have a checkboxlist bound using linq

1193093
firefox	safari
both firefox and safari seem to not care about refreshing to reflect the changes

1193129
post	get
i m wondering if the issue is that this is a get and not a post

1193140
persistent	transient
org.hibernate.session.update is not for transient objects - it s for updating persistent objects

1193158
getter	setter
a members should be private - so you may get problems using them in derived classes so you have to add getter and setter methods which blow up your interface

1193167
post	get
i reckon francisco is on the right lines tho i d suggest implementing a post rather than a get as you are updating something

1193184
maven	pom.xml
my maven build however runs without even a warning using the following settings in my pom.xml

1193189
min	max	min	median	median	max
min mean + -sd median max

1193203
firefox	safari
40px is the default left padding for ul elements in firefox and safari whereas ie sets a 30pt left margin

1193222
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
when a user is using tortoisesvn and rapidsvn he sees the files as they are on the server and thus has the ability to delete them

1193260
getter	setter
so i wound up with two classes which is more of a pain to maintain but the updates run through getter setter instead of binding which might scale better since it s not waiting on the change event

1193279
installation	upgrade
however you can install jrails then upgrade the jquery installation simply replacing the javascript files except jrails.js in the javascripts folder

1193306
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
here is a working css tested under firefox ie7 safari google-chrome opera

1193316
rss	feed
as a sidenot and not really an answer to your question but zend_feed has some drawbacks like returning different kind of data depending on the feed s format -- rss vs atom for instance

1193316
rss	feed
there will be a zend_feed_reader component which should be more useful when consumming both rss and atom feed

1193364
rss	feed
there might be some services that offer the exchange rates in an rss feed or similar feed

1193382
post	get
have the method you call via post get would work too since you aren t passing any data do the existence check then create a link to a document handler url that does the actual download

1193387
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i have tested this in recent versions of firefox opera and safari and ie6 ie7 and ie8

1193403
width	height
imgclient width 784 height 66 and 2

1193403
width	height
imgclientextra width 1 and height 66

1193410
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie6

1193419
swt	swing
on the other hand using either your home-grown toolkit or swing is generally a bad idea when working with eclipse as it already embeds the swt toolkit

1193419
swt	swing
the main advantage of swt over swing is that it use the os native widgets

1193456
boost	stl
you could implement the same without stl or boost if it is required

1193470
post	put
you then need to put some logic in your edit post method to pull off the selected value from the formcollection and put it on to your instance before committing your changes

1193477
free	malloc
the problem sounds similar to what a malloc implementation must do every free d memory block belongs to a range of available memory and the malloc implementation must find out to which one so how do those commonly solve the issue

1193498
int	chars
but if you look at those 16 bit chars each one could equally represent an int a pair of bytes a pixel and so on

1193529
exponent	modulo
because rsaparameters have the following members d dp dq exponent inverseq modulo p q

1193547
uiview	subviews
i have added a subclass of uiview as a subviews to an mkmapview when a button is pressed

1193558
exponent	modulo
the public key is identified by modulo and exponent

1193560
exponent	modulo
exponent and modulo are the public key

1193566
post	put
then i want to include automatical a before_filter in every controller which checks if the current request is via post put or delete-method

1193566
post	put
why only post and not also put and delete

1193631
gif	png
is there a way to have jmeter actually create jpg gif or png files or whatever format that can be embedded in html

1193666
getter	setter
make them as hidden as possible and use getter and setter if you need to preserve class invariants

1193696
post	put
why only post and not also put and delete

1193725
hash	salt
they may not ask for passwords being stored securely hash and salt because they re not the experts

1193751
disk	ram
my strategy so far has been to create mnesia tables in ram with disc_copies enabled so to have mnesia automatically dump the memory to disk when the log size exceeds a certain size

1193751
disk	ram
a different approach would be to instance two tables one ram only and one disk only and have a process copy from ram to disk every minute or so

1193769
bmp	png
java on windows knows how to export jpg png and bmp as far as i know

1193776
portrait	landscape
you could also stick a rotatebox around the whole graphics include to fix a portrait landscape incompatibility

1193790
post	get
note there will be different limitation between get and post requests mainly the maximum url length and encoding so this may not always work depending on your situation

1193824
stdout	stderr
i made some changes since getstatusoutput duplicates stderr onto stdout

1193824
os.path	shutil
investigate the contents of the os os.path and shutil packages instead

1193892
put	get
do not get confused by the literal english-meaning of the words as they both can be used interchange-ably in the context you try to put them in

1193897
mef	prism
i am currently working on a wpf project using prism cal and am wondering if it is a good idea to use both prism and mef in one project

1193897
mef	prism
i would use prism for modularity and mef for extensibility

1193897
mef	prism
my project is a paint-like application so prism would provide the module-separation toolbox canvas as modules etc. and mef would be used to provide an extensibility point for new shapes to paint ie

1193905
hide	show
hide the content you don t want to show with the css property

1193931
uiview	calayer
and then applying that transform using the appropriate property on your calayer or uiview s backing layer will tilt the layer in 3-d

1193976
hide	show
this code will show and hide an animated gif progress bar while an ajax request is running

1193980
esx	xenapp
xenserver is now free which is a big selling point for us - xenserver v5.5 is a good product and we re in the process of replacing esx server - first as the host for our xenapp terminal servers

1193980
vmware	esx
citrix s offering now makes vmware esx server seem overpriced

1194001
inherited	properties
one use i sometimes have for the new keyword is for poor mans properties covariance in a parallell inherited tree

1194078
spawn	execv
the problem is that i m spawn the pip process from my bootstrapping scripts using subprocess.popen and then waiting for the process to complete but this is happening too early due to the fact that pip uses execv to relaunch itself under the new virtualenv it creates

1194128
sorting	grouping
the sorting and grouping is easy to use and understand for both the developer and end-user

1194160
firefox	safari
the problem doesn t occur in firefox or safari only ie

1194171
jaxp	saaj
after being plaguged with the nightmare that is saaj and jaxp and getting compatible versions working on jboss i m done with singletons and factories

1194226
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
you should then use a repeater or other databound control and then use list controls like the checkboxlist and radiobuttonlist

1194226
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
accessing the chosen answers should then be possible by iterating over the repeater items and finding your radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist controls probably using the findcontrol ... method

1194255
mouse	keyboard
i can use the context menu key on the keyboard to activate the menu but not the mouse

1194280
mouse	keyboard
i am looking for a method that doesn t involve send keys because it locks the keyboard and mouse until the macro completes

1194313
manual	rcs
from the rcs manual

1194318
newid	hashbytes
the stored procedure create a new guid using newid then i use the hashbytes sha1 function of sql server to create the password based on the guid+password provided then i insert the values into the table above

1194352
width	height
if i know the pixel coordinates of the corners in this picture how can i calculate the original proportions the quotient width height of the rectangle

1194352
width	height
there has been some discussion on whether it is possible at all to determine the width height ratio with the information given

1194386
post	get
it s too big of a topic to cover in a so post but the following article will help you get started on custom actions

1194422
ant	maven
i would consider managing these things with the ivy extension to ant which has the benefit of being maven compatible should you ever want to go that way

1194478
google-chrome	safari
some browsers have a bug google-chrome safari where they do not expand the html body background correctly until a reload occurs

1194484
updatepanel	scriptmanager
there is a scriptmanager control i put to root.master in case i can use updatepanel in any page

1194524
free	malloc
you can implement most of it in terms of malloc and free - in fact a lot of c++ memory managers are implemented even if they don t have to be

1194524
free	malloc
you could start with a simple implementation that maintains a log of all allocations and deallocations but forwards the regular allocations deallocations to malloc and free

1194524
free	malloc
implement global new and delete as wrappers that first log the access in the above data structure and then forward the call to malloc or free

1194532
versioning	upgrade
data flow task dts.pipeline the component metadata for component trimcolumnscomponent 1909 could not be upgrade to the newer versioning of the component

1194545
post	get
i ve followed the spring http proxying tutorial as closely as possibly but i still can t get it to work at runtime my configuration is largely identical so unless i ve missed a typo there is no need to post it

1194548
free	malloc
so when the last unicode object is free it isn t returned to malloc right away making all the other pages stuck

1194563
erlang	lisp
you re wondering why a project doesn t write say one component in java another in lisp and a third in erlang and then link them all together as some unified deliverable

1194563
erlang	lisp
if you really believe that you have three components that are best expressed in say java lisp and erlang then it is to your advantage to write those components in those languages

1194568
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome and firefox 3 it didn t work returing the following exception

1194579
put	get
in fact even if you choose not to put the class in the session and to create it on each page load it seems like overkill to get order history

1194594
gif	png
b ends with jpeg jpg gif or png

1194602
getter	setter
if you use attr_accessor to create an attribute ruby just declares an instance variable and creates getter and setter methods for you

1194609
expression-blend	silverlight
there are a lot of other videos that should help to find your way around expression-blend and silverlight

1194627
freebsd	solaris
i ve been looking into solaris servers freebsd servers just using 64-bit windows.

1194628
profiling	debugging
rather than adding extra code for debugging you could use a debugging tool or profiling

1194640
children	parent
so if any of the children close the db connection which will happen when they finish and shutdown it will kill it out from under the parent process

1194660
getter	setter
in this case i use the attr_accessor class method to define the point property along with an implicit getter and setter methods for point

1194667
versioning	upgrade
generally this means that the component was upgrade after the package was saved and so it s at the wrong versioning number

1194685
valgrind	memcheck
also since you mention that you want to make a memory manager that is useful for debugging you may want to consider reading this paper by the developers of memcheck valgrind a wonderful memory debugger for linux

1194782
xrange	enumerate
in some cases you may find loops that can benefit from enumerate replacing the range xrange business

1194812
hide	show
i noticed this occurs only when i use slideup down.if i use show hide everythings ok

1194812
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

1194836
maya	3dsmax
the more i work with level editors though the more unrealistic this whole idea of level building in maya or 3dsmax really seems

1194836
maya	3dsmax
so the question is does anyone use maya or 3dsmax or milkshape for level design at all ever

1194844
post	get
the get post function is already in use inside the plugin and returns category information

1194852
datatrigger	eventtrigger
eventtrigger datatrigger and

1194854
pop-up	dialog
i want to have an edit link on each row that will pop-up a jquery dialog so that the row can be edited

1194866
ubuntu	debian
simply install ubuntu or debian for amd64 on a suitable machine

1194866
freebsd	opensolaris
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation

1194878
button	checkbox
you might be thinking - why not just display a series of radio button or checkbox

1194925
opera	firefox
after an hour the session times out and redirects me to the error.jsp in ie and opera but in firefox it redirects me immediately

1194926
ubuntu	debian
and as wazoox mentioned installation of debian or ubuntu is a breeze especially with the smaller more focused server flavors

1194985
jquery	jqmodal	jqmodal	thickbox
the jquery dialog will then simply load the controller action in that window i was doing this with thickbox but now use jqmodal

1195061
public	protected
basically you can t start an identifier with an underscore - this violates cls compliant on a visible public protected field

1195067
public	protected
protected public members should be properly cased and named

1195096
folder	directory
directory and folder behave differently

1195096
folder	directory
a great percentage of questions on unix mailinglists but also here on serverfault and on superuser about what to the asker seems to be confusing filesystem behaviour can be traced directly back to thinking about folder when unix does in fact have directory

1195096
folder	directory
so in other words use folder when dealing with folder and directory when dealing with directory

1195126
post	get
sorry for the delayed response i didn t set the question up right so i would get notifications of any responses then i ended up forgetting about the post all together

1195127
nscopying	nsmutablecopying
this can become more complicated if some elements don t conform to nscopying or nsmutablecopying

1195169
int	double
however the use is a little verbose obj.isoneof typeof int typeof bool typeof double and i am wondering about alternative approaches to defining one method taking an arbitrary amount of generic arguments

1195203
ssl	https
i know that data retrieved over ssl https is encrypted over the wire but once it arrives at the browser is it stored in the client s browser cache

1195226
int	double
there is no typedef in java as of 1.6 what you can do is make a wrapper class for what you want since you can t subclass final classes int double etc

1195230
mbunit	nunit
if we decide to go the other route in using something like xunit mbunit or nunit then we are most likely going to have some maybe significant cost

1195244
union	distinct
in postgresql 8.3 and below union implied distinct which implied sorting that means order by union and distinct were always of same efficiency since the atter two aways used sorting

1195244
union	distinct
select distinct and union intersect except no longer always produce sorted output tom

1195261
free	malloc
essentially it has custom implementations of malloc and free that provide the debugging

1195324
put	get
on the messages pane and the temp table doesn t actually get anything put into it

1195358
post	get
the reason post was invented was pretty much to get around length limits in get

1195379
post	get
if the issue is just that the client will not send the long get string perhaps you can post to a proxy server which then forwards the request as a get

1195420
mouse	keyboard
edit in relation to the preprocessmessage i believe that is only for keyboard input not mouse

1195429
post	get
all you then need to send retrieve client-side is that session id as well as client generated information get post fields

1195438
put	get
correct me if i m wrong but this will require me to get the definition of the orderstatus class manually via email or whatever and put it in my solution

1195448
public	protected
the property is not cls compliant because it starts with an underscore and is public note protected properties in a public class can be accessed from outside the assembly

1195605
many-to-many	one-to-many
your links table looks like many-to-many mapping table between location and endpoint rather than one-to-many

1195607
winforms	treelistview	treelistview	objectlistview
objectlistview an open source wrapper around .net winforms listview has a treelistview flavour which could very easily be configured to behave in this way

1195617
put	get
i want to put a check if the location given is the any of the partition that is c or d then it should not get deleted

1195673
listview	gridview
how can you download a file from within a listview or gridview that is nested within an updatepanel

1195677
fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
just replace the bytearrayinputstream with a fileinputstream

1195686
listview	gridview
can you just embed the fileupload control in a template field in the case of a gridview not sure about listview

1195707
width	height
in the general case a quadruple a b c d of four non collinear points of the z 0 plane is the projection of infinitely many rectangles with infinitely many width height ratios

1195765
public	protected
however javadoc is only generated for public and protected types

1195778
width	height
i would like to find the height width of an image on disk without opening it if possible for performance reasons

1195778
width	height
the windows properties pane for images contains information like width height bit depth etc. which leads me to believe that it is storing metadata on the file somewhere

1195800
width	height
this will be your width and height

1195803
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to make an action that returns a file from disk to the user via little download dialog pop-up box. i ve got it working great except somehow a newline is being inserted as the first character

1195804
mouseleave	mousedown
i am no expert in this but i think you have to look at mouse button up down events wm_lbuttondown wm_rbuttondown also you may want to track mouse move events so that a mousedown on the button mouseleave the button acts as a release

1195818
gif	png
if you re dealing with only a limited number of different image formats only jpeg png and gif it shouldn t be too hard to read the size from the image header yourself

1195830
put	get	width	height
in order to get the width and height of an image essentially as you put it the metadata you will have to open the file parse some kind of header information and obtain what you want that way

1195926
post	get
i dont mean to just post a link in here but this should get you going in the right direction

1195967
rss	feed
i have a script where i need to pull two seperate and different rss feed break them up assign variables and execute code thats different for each file

1195979
int	chars
the only thing i can think of is overloading a operator that reads a chars at a time and if it sees 0x or 0 at the beginning of the input then it stores the whole input into a string before it is read into an int

1196029
octal	hex	octal	decimal
the i interprets the input as hex octal or decimal depending on its format just like you describe

1196043
apache	nginx
- it is a plugin for apache and nginx that lets you very easily run a ruby app as a virtual host

1196052
firefox	safari
firefox safari and most browser use the opacity property whilst ie uses filter alpha opacity

1196097
put	get
into the sql i get no results when the textbox is blank and ora-01722 invalid number as soon as i put characters in it

1196123
google-chrome	firefox
it runs in firefox and google-chrome but will require modifications to run in ie

1196179
superclass	subclassing
the class hierarchy is straightforward an abstract superclass that encapsulates common behaviors attributes and about half a dozen concrete subclassing that deal with field specific stuff

1196183
post	put
yes you simply put in the date that you want it to be while the post status is on draft press ok and then the publish button should turn into a schedule button

1196195
boost	allocator
regarding shared memory boost variant does not perform heap allocator so you can place it into shared memory just like an int assuming proper synchronisation of course

1196207
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
the runtimeexception s which may be thrown are either securityexception s if the jvm s securitymanager will not allow you to change a field s accessibility or illegalargumentexception s if you try and access the field on an object not of the field s class s type

1196209
internationalization	localization
the other approach i am thinking of is actually performing the whole internationalization process nslocale localization files etc and somewhat at the app startup skip the user s locale and set either language programmatically here i would only need to know is how to skip such default i18n process to set a specific language

1196234
put	get
along with that you might also get stuck with upgrade issues like if apache or iis or some subcomponent your application requires like openssl for example has some update come along to plug a security hole will you then opt not to disrupt your customer s production environment because they re most likely not going to be a victim of that hole or will you mandate that they upgrade or else you won t take responsibility for the consequences even though you whisper to yourself you put them in that situation in the first place

1196275
postgresql	mysql
if you need to do more complex geographical calculations you can investigate postgis for postgresql or mysql spatial extensions for mysql

1196284
post	get
so the question now is how would i get the co-ordinate of a non-active element i.e get the co-ordinates of an element by its id in a page - because as mentioned in my earlier post the code i try only returns me the co-ordinates of the top-left corner of the ie window

1196334
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this script was tested and works fine in ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 google-chrome 2 3 and safari 2 3

1196397
visualvm	jprofiler
what other options are there netbeans visualvm jprofiler and how good are they

1196433
rss	feed
just subscribe to the rss feed

1196464
integer	fractions
if you ll be converting to from degâºmin sec fractions notation often i d consider storing each value as an integer type smallint tinyint tinyint smallint

1196543
uiview	subviews
you can use the touchesmoved withevent method of your container uiview and hit test each subviews aka key with something like

1196595
webclient	httpwebrequest
instead using webclient like kenney you can use httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse and process the result with a streamreader and xmldocument

1196642
for-loop	loops
if in the real code the enhanced for-loop is really worth it then you could add the items to a temporary collection and call removeall on the list after loops

1196656
sorting	grouping
i m looking to access all rows in a view as an array so i can apply some array sorting and grouping functions before display in a display output

1196663
int	chars
i don t know what you consider to be a int or chars valid values but you can try comparing the chars to for example ensure that

1196663
spaces	linefeed
another possible test would be to see if the character is a printable ascii character which also includes punctuation spaces and cr linefeed

1196750
addition	multiplication
and is boolean multiplication whereas or is boolean addition

1196758
post	get
now i ve already read the post regarding uinavigationcontroller and autorotation and i get the sneaking suspicion that i m going about this the wrong way and making it way more complicated than necessary

1196761
apache	nginx
then we front the tomcats with a load balancer like apache or nginx the later which i m favoring recently and use sticky sessions

post	put
1 method of getting the friends list to know what status post to show to a user is to run this query below and put the results into an array

1196840
min	max
apparently .net 4.0 has a sequence.range min max method

1196853
int	chars
if you want to preserve the base information hex oct dec you will need to store that information separately from the int value itself and it will require you to parse at least the first couple of chars of the input string sscanf strtol etc. won t preserve that information for you

1196885
folder	directory
i m trying to get only the directory of an folder

1196955
datagridview	radgridview
in the application i am working on i have a tableadapter and a radgridview telerik control - their version of the datagridview

1196977
g++	gcc
i suppose the gfortran uses the same back end of gcc and g++ but what of the intel compiler

1196986
int	chars
i came from the world of c++ the paradigm there was to use a singleton which load the parameters on first and only instantiation and export an interface with relevant get ters like int getval chars key int val the singletone was accessible from all parts of the application is there anything like that in php

1197052
webkit	gecko
if you still need to embed a browser you could use gecko mozilla s engine or webkit chrome s engine - i don t have any hands-on experience with them but probably they have more consistency between embedded and stand-alone versions

1197092
vmware	esx
i want to run this code so that the task is executed in another virtual image vmware esx

1197111
int	chars
i have an arduino application well actually a library that has a number of status flags in it - and originally i simply declared them as int well uint8_t so 8 bit unsigned chars in this case

1197130
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller created programaticaly that manages 4 subclasses of uiviewcontroller

1197159
viewdidload	viewwillappear
what you can do instead is create your own placeholder view controller that in its viewdidload or viewwillappear methods replaces itself in the tab bar controller with its actual view controller

1197189
min	max
set the min and max size to the same value

1197194
width	height
get rid of your height and width 100 requirements.

1197196
maven	pom.xml
i put the properties in my maven pom.xml

1197196
maven	pom.xml
so you can see how the log.filename property from the pom.xml is used due to maven s filtering

1197317
sorting	filtering
that would at least isolate you from the sorting filtering issues

1197321
range	minimum
for example if i have a range from a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 10 and an average of 7

1197321
range	minimum
lets say i need to generate a random number with a range of minimum of 4 and maximum of 10 and i want the majority of the numbers returned to center around the number 8 with a natural fall of based on a skewed bell curve

1197324
perl	tcl
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

1197367
ant	maven
many more than you might think developers are not familiar with build tools such as ant or maven and when they are they only use limited features of those build tools

1197367
ant	maven
creating osgi bundles is best accomplished with eclipse ant tasks or maven bnd plugin vs a script or a manually written manifest for the jar archive

1197405
post	put	post	get	put	get
another positive point on rest is that you use the 4 http verbs get post put delete to manage url representative entities which makes - in my opinion - the code and operations clearer

1197436
hash	salt
it costs basically nothing to hash a password preferably with a salt into the database so why not

1197486
folder	directory
the only difference between these two directory i see is that the name of my application in vs and folder is addfiletosql but name i gave this folder under c inetpub wwwroot was afs

1197530
instances	transient
i could serialize the session as a way to estimate how much stuff would be gc ed but that relies on the vendor implementing serializable and marking instances variables as transient appropriately

1197556
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in general you should put loading code that only needs to run once but may run multiple times into viewdidload code that needs to run every time a view is shown in viewwillappear or viewdidappear and code that can run even before the view loads or absolutely needs to only run once into initwithnibname bundle

1197562
hash	salt
i believe it is being salt as none of the hash on worked

1197575
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the script loads into the dom but it is never executed at least in firefox and google-chrome

1197580
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i need to take text from a source as plain text and display it in a jtextpane or jeditorpane

1197610
lisp	scheme
unlike scheme emacs lisp is a 2-lisp which means that each symbol has two separate bindings the value binding and the function binding

1197627
folder	dir
personally i d likely create a folder structure that uses a users id as its base dir

1197632
put	get
i d like to put timers and set times so i for instance get a popup at 2pm saying don t forget... i know i could make my own notification bubble but i d prefer the wlm one

1197661
super	extends
however since your baseclass declares a constructor and therefore doesn t have the default no-arg constructor that the compiler would otherwise provide this is illegal - a class that extends baseclass can t call super

1197712
post	get
i can t answer but you can probably find an answer on our metastorm bpm forums or post the question there and you can get a quick response

1197724
short	base
i ve inherited a large project that already has a large markup base coupled with a short deadline so a complete rewrite is out of the question

1197729
post	get
does anyone know of a way to get only post parameters from an httpservletrequest object

1197729
post	get
httpservletrequest.getparameter string will include the get url parameters even if the http method is post

1197801
getter	setter
overall classes are used to keep things together that belong together keep things apart that should be apart namespacing enable easier consistency checks getter setter validating variables before changing them and more.

also for client-server applications you have an abundance of choices for production-quality app servers that have the same j2ee interface ibm websphere bea weblogic jboss

1197838
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the trick is to make your view controller not be a subclass of uitabbarcontroller but rather uiviewcontroller and implement uitabbardelegate

1197838
uiview	subviews
i created the view for this in ib laying out the tab bar with the proper # of buttons images tags etc. and a placeholder uiview which is used to properly place the subviews that are swapped in and out

1197869
lwjgl	jogl
you are mixing libraries and levels of libraries jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrappers around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrappers for openal audio

1197875
int	boolean
in c# this would refer to bool boolean int int32 float single long int64

1197875
int	boolean
and in my opinion int16 int32 int64 boolean etc makes a heck of a lot more sense then short long int

1197890
post	get
by the way i get multiple examples of this post s title error also when trying to run this database filling script which i was alluding to before

1197890
portrait	landscape
otherwise sometimes they are landscape sometimes portrait

1197900
rss	feed
first i d check for an rss feed

google-chrome	safari
i tested it and can confirm that it works in ie5.5 6 7 8 ff3 google-chrome and safari

1197918
prng	random
this bugs are the real threat they go on for years and how do you test that a prng is really random

1197932
post	get
from my understanding there are no such things as post parameters and get parameters in http there are post and get methods

1197967
integer	unsigned
how would an orm decide what a large column is - would this be for example a blob column that can contain a lot of data compared to say an unsigned integer column

1197986
folder	directory
i will have a folder on my live server containing each release of the application and i ll have a symlink in the web directory pointing to the current release

1197991
post	put
to parse xml requests presumably coming in as the body of http post or put requests you have several options pyexpat or minidom on top of it see this thread for example especially the last post on it

1198006
post	get
anything you grab via getparemeter inside of dopost is a post and anything inside of doget is a get

1198070

int main int argc chars argv

1198117
dictionary	map
keep the command and associated object that can perform action in an associative container std map in c++ and dictionary in .net

1198167
disk	ram
if you can parallelize disk access by using multiple disk faster disk a ram disk ... you may benefit way more

1198169
profiler	yourkit
i personally would recommend yourkit java profiler i ve found it much more user-friendly than tptp and while i haven t tested it it should work on os x

1198175
children	parent
since the skin elements are added as children of a component s display list in rawchildren the event will still bubble up to the parent

1198215
hide	show
i would like to have the dialog box described by miscsettings to be instantiated when the program starts up destructed when the program exits and show hide according to whether the user select a particular menu option vs

1198215
pop-up	dialog
at this point i m not sure what would be the cleanest way of transferring the settings on the child pop-up dialog to the rest of the application

1198215
pop-up	dialog
settings pop-up dialog to show pre-configured settings when it first appears when the user selected the menu option for the first time

1198223
folder	directory
you can look at checking out the top level directory strcuture of any given folder but make sure that you retain the names consistently to avoid confusion

1198309
hide	show
and show hide according to whether the

1198340
touchescancelled	touchesended
you can t track touches with subviews because once a touch is being tracked by a view it continues to track the touch until touchesended or touchescancelled is called

1198392
post	get
i can get the echo to output but i dont get the id and for that no title or post this method is a copy of get_title stripping out everything but the protected part string

1198433
metaphone	soundex
if you implement it yourself you should look into the metaphone or double metaphone algorithms i d recommend them over soundex which is not nearly as good at this type of task to store phoenetic representations of all your words

1198453
yacc	bison
if you don t want to include an external library you can parse your xml with flex bison lex yacc

1198464

1198523
children	parent
each object have 1 parent and may have n children

1198531
disk	ram
in ram postgres uses quicksort on disk it uses another algorithm which is much more suited to harddisks

1198532
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction are trivial #defines

1198532
iboutlet	ibaction
so no the existence of the iboutlet ibaction property is not stored and cannot be accessed nor can you add your own properties

1198535
metaphone	soundex
if this is for single word searching you could try using soundex or metaphone functions

1198611
inherited	properties
you could create your own control that inherited from that control and create your own text properties that will fire an event when assigned a new value

1198621
children	parent
delete all children when deleting the parent

1198631
bonjour	avahi
better option would be to use a service discovery protocol like bonjour or avahi than rolling your own as they have solved a lot of problems already

1198646
mouse	keyboard
the tool will capture screen shot with random interval count the keyboard event number and mouse event number for every minute

1198671
versioning	upgrade
everytime i release a new versioning for bug fixes or minor upgrade

1198671
versioning	upgrade
in the setup project properties i increment the versioning number and change the product code i always leave the same upgrade code

1198671
versioning	upgrade
i am wondering is it possible to get back the original upgrade that was used to install those versioning

1198709
getter	setter
the problem is that the custom class has public access for the properties and also it has getter setter methods

1198718
tstringlist	tlist
only use tlist or tstringlist if you need lots of size changing flexibility

1198767
mockups	balsamiq
i use balsamiq mockups and their site has a good collection of mockups you can look at

1198792
initializer	class-method
in plain c++ templated class-method are only initializer if they are actually used within the linkage scope

1198818
width	height
of course i could set the size programmatically by setting width and height to fitting values but first i need to know if there is no automated way to solve my problem and if not what is the best approach to realize this

1198872
swt	swing
the problem is that jfx script can t be embedded into swing nor eclipse swt

1198886
inherited	properties
the problem i am coming into is that the particular object is inherited from a base class and those base class properties values are not updated

1198906
put	get
if i leave out the above lines at least i get the welcome page but then the directory where i put the phpjavabridge application only shows the resource not found error

1198919
ssl	https
on a side note https is not using ssl exclusivley anymore tls the successor to ssl see rfc2818 is more modern

1198920
put	get
best bet is to get hold on an iphone and put your application on it and test it

1198934
public	protected
if you need or want to use inheritance for whatever reason at the very least make it private or protected inheritance so you don t inherit publicly from a class with a public non-virtual destructor

post	get
this post could get stupidly long so i ll provide a link to the web page rather than post the html

required	placeholder
1 the way i think i would do this is to not put any content in the designer that required the scriptmanager and to put placeholder where such content needs to go

1199254
versioning	upgrade
in reality clickonce upgrade only leave the previous versioning behind and versioning before that are cleaned up

1199301

since i had to generate my models from the databases and not vice-versa my models are too close to the database the fields have very similar names to the database columns to get objects you have to query in what is essential sql where do i put that code and how do i test it

1199793
post	get
when i use google chrome to make an ajax post request i get extra empty parameter _ on server-side

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i test the code in ie7 firefox google-chrome safari and this problem occurs in firefox only

children	parent
that is somefunc t1.id would be random but would always return the same result for a given value of t1.id keeping all the children with the correct parent

1199915
firefox	safari
by that i mean if firefox renders exactly in the same way on win mac linux and safari on.

1199951
filtering	grouping
i d split that up so that you don t have to use string operations on the game column and also put indexes on the new columns so you can filtering and grouping them properly
