int	chars
you will have to read the int chars by chars and roll your own implementation of bigints which is the difficulty of the problem here i surmise

1500008
folder	directory
i want to create a windows service that schedules tasks much like the windows o e but it would run c# assembles dynamically from a local folder schedule rules via a xml file for that task so i don t have to create a windows service or console application every time i want some automation code but can build an assembly upload it to a directory with a xml config for the timing and it will run be detected b a folder watcher

1500053
put	get
and if you look in the code you can see the php code hidden by firefox - which is the behaviour you get if you put php code on a plain html page

1500057
yacc	bison
technically bison . if the shell is really really simple like a homework shell yacc may be overkill

1500116
imagemagick	libtiff
tesseract seems to use libtiff for it s io imagemagick seems to use libtiff for it s tiff handling so i figured i should somehow be able to use imagemagick with tesseract without meddling in the filesystem and additional unessesary disk io

1500118
hash	md5
keep in mind though that you don t want to make the hash too obvious so that a determined attacker would easily figure it out just taking the md5 of 2134 or whatever number you had

1500135
cpu	irq
all those f tell us that the interrupt load from irq 21 is load balanced between all cpu s

1500155
actionscript	mxml
i m trying to convert an mxml component to an actionscript class

1500192
subclass	abstract-class
up until a few minutes ago i was having a similar problem with an interface abstract-class and concrete subclass

it takes the image width height bpp and the raw uncompressed data which you should be able to get from imagemagick

1500327
itunes	iphoto
it is also what apple has implemented in iphoto or itunes

1500333
post	get
i posted this post some days ago but the answer here didn t really help me because i can t even get the value from a textbox on the new page

1500348
coalesce	isnull
sticking to your logic and not using isnull or coalesce try this

1500374
mouseup	mousedown
i am dong it this way as my table view for some strange reason does not recognize mousedown or mouseup or menuforevent events

1500377
ant	maven
there are also dependency management builders maven and ant being two popular ones that can package up projects with their dependencies inside

1500377
ant	maven
this is one reason why using an ide like eclipse and build tools like maven or ant are so nice in large projects as when you have 20 dependencies for a project that can become pretty unmanageable

1500423
dokuwiki	screwturn
we re trying dokuwiki screwturn and mediawiki

1500462
pylons	turbogears
if you d rather have easy database code you want to use an orm you re better off going with a turbogears pylons plain wsgi project probably hosted using apache and mod_wsgi

1500467
next	except
the default tempdata provider uses the session so there really isn t much of a distinction except that your tempdata is cleared out at the end of the next request

1500490
maven	m2e
i recommend using maven eclipse and m2e

1500539
post	get
warning given your question i think there is a slight misconception concerning the difference better the lack of a difference between get and post requests

1500539
post	get
get and post are just two different but mostly equivalent methods of transmitting data from the client to the server

1500539
post	get
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

1500539
post	get
with a get request the token does exactly the same as with a post request - it proves to the server that the submitted data comes from the same browser on the same machine as the request he build the form for

1500551
jsf	seam
i would suggest to learn seam as it builds further on jsf an industry standard

1500584
cos	sin	cos	exp
edit for intensive i mean a lot of sin cos exp happening in tight loops

1500586
int	double
a double is not an int and d and f are not interchangeable

1500588
hex	binary
some libraries put the binary content encoded as hex characters

1500589
getter	setter
i should totally remove the setter-method for the id property and just have a getter for it and then have setter and getter for the other properties that make up the id

1500600
range	max
if the colour range are continous your example is missing 1.25-1.5 and are guaranteed to cover all possble values in the matrix file i would first have built a using the max value from the colour file as map key

1500672
post	get
irrespective you ll probably find that you get more answers if you do the ground work yourself and then post questions for any specific architecture design implementation issues you get stuck on

1500677
gif	png
you can find this information quite readily on the internet in each format s spec jpg bitmaps gif png whatever

vim	emacs
i m not interested in solutions involving vim emacs

1500744
post	get
i gather that there basically isn t a limit to the amount of data that can be sent when using rest via a post or get

1500746
post	get
use jquery to post the type of query you want to get

1500777
put	get
no matter what protections you put in place they will find a way to get around them

1500843
serializable	deserialization
if you need to reliably serializable your components you re probably better off writing your own serializable deserialization methods

1500843
inherited	properties
the most appropriate way to do this would be by creating a base component one that inherited from uicomponent that offers these serialization methods and have each inheriting class override it with its additional properties

1500843
super	extends
finally each extends class should call the super method to get the serialized properties of the base class

1500850
hide	show
the only image you will see in the markup example above is images thumbnail-image1.jpg lightbox will automatically hide the rest of them and then show each one at the appropriate time

1500868
queue	fifo
should autoresetevent s lock queue behave as fifo

1500903
hide	show
create all of your drop down lists in the view and pass all the select lists through the view data and then hide or show them based on your selected product

1500930
gridview	rowdatabound
just a little more would there be a way to alter the itemtemplate for a single cell say by overriding the rowdatabound event handler of the gridview

1500933
unix	sunos
on some unix machines certainly all sunos you could link a setuid shell script to a file called -i

1500939
getter	setter
anyway your problem is easy to solve with getter setter

1500962
hide	show
the mouseenter on all the menu items hide all those same div s except it show the one that has identical text inside the menu item s link and the submenu s h2 header

1500962
mouseleave	mouseenter
to keep the submenu visible while the mouse is on it add mouseleave and mouseenter handlers for div.submenu div as well

1500973
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
rather the difference between django and grok - or pylons or turbogears - is really one of approach

1501075
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
which works swimmingly in firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1501105
hide	show
i m not married to this javascript solution in fact i tried a few other methods of my own using simple javascript show hide methods

1501186
serializable	deserialization
what condition should an object satisfy so that the object maintains its behavior under java s default serializable deserialization round-trip

1501256
hash	md5
you cannot un-hash sha1 md5 or any other one-way hash method unfortunately

1501305
vbscript	jscript
the best option i ve heard for that is apache asp although it does have limitations such as not handling vbscript or jscript without 3rd party commercial tools

1501310
sqldatasource	detailsview
when users go to a specified page i have a detailsview attached to a sqldatasource and already setup in insert mode

1501334

rss	feed
basically i need to create a php document that will read an rss feed and the write the information to a mysql document

1501406
range	max
if requestedsize bigger than preferred size but fit into max size of the range

1501406
range	max
if requestedsize bigger than max size of the range

1501417
rss	feed
that will get the rss feed into usable parts

1501453
streamingmarkupbuilder	xmlslurper
for this kind of work i tend to use xmlslurper along with the streamingmarkupbuilder

1501483
user-controls	tabcontrol
so do we have a user-controls that behaves similar to tabcontrol so that all the user controls can be organized visually in designer during design time

1501492
pkcs#12	pfx
the constructor you are using data password is intended to be used to get a certificate from a pkcs#12 file pfx file

1501500
hide	show
i m on the hunt for a text editor for windows that will let me enter text in either regex or grep-style syntax and automatically show hide the relevant lines

1501505
int	double
so you should be able to implicitly convert any float into a double but not the other way around just like you can convert any short int -32 768 to +32769 into a long - 2 billion to + 2 billion bit not the other way around

1501506
children	parent
i don t know whether root node and child node are the same class a child node might be a subclass of root node because both types of node have children but only child nodes have a parent node

1501586
maven	cargo
another option would be to use the cargo maven plugin

1501588
expression-blend	silverlight
for me the open in expression-blend is only available in silverlight projects for wpf projects the option does not exist

1501602
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
but if you wanted it to work on ff3 opera safari and google-chrome then you can implement it but it would have to be done by hand as i don t know of any javascript library to do something like this

1501622
vbulletin	phpbb
thus they go after popular packages like phpbb and vbulletin because getting into those will get them into a lot of sites

1501641
mp3	wav
update after reading your question again i realized that it might actually be possible to do what you re discussing in javascript even if the files are in mp3 format and not wav

1501641
mp3	wav
to locate the silent stretches you wouldn t necessarily need to convert the frequency-domain data of an mp3 file back into the time-domain of a wav file

1501642
post	get
and yes you must code your app around the webrequest.begingetrequeststream for post s with content and webrequest.begingetresponse for get s and post s

1501646
put	get
then while i was trying to wedge all those actions into a consistent url scheme i found myself wanting to put some information into the get requests that seemed a tad sensitive

1501731
for-loop	arrays
if this is a dynamic arrays have your for-loop go from 0 to high data

1501736
many-to-many	one-to-many
it simply has a one-to-many relationship with suppliers or perhaps many-to-many

1501763
hash	md5
i want users to be able to enter in variable-length passwords so i decided to hash the password with md5 and then use the hash as the key

1501771
hash	md5
md5 sha-0 sha-1 are all broken hash and you should not use them for any cryptographic purpose use sha-2

1501802
submit	submission
it is similar to what you would do after submission a form submit the form to a page that enters the data to the database then pass the browser along to a new page telling them it is complete

1501834
lisp	scheme
my own advice for a completely different language would be scheme -- basically lisp with a good housecleaning

1501842
tapestry	wicket
for example wicket tapestry and javaserver faces allow you to think in terms of components buttons labels drop-down list etc instead of http protocols

1501861
button	checkbox
unfortunately the behavior is a bit strange in ie in that for a checkbox or a radio button field the event doesn t fire when it is supposed to right when you click the option you want to choose but instead it only fires when you click elsewhere on the page form or if you explicitly call blur

1501908
folder	directory
the default is the first one which means xcode creates a yellow folder in your project but it ll ignore the directory hierarchy on disk when time comes to generate the output bundle

1501918

1502021
versioning	upgrade
i don t know that the different versioning of the framework would process the same code differently so i would bet that the difference is code that you ve modified as part of your upgrade to 2.0

1502025
getter	setter
but this goes against oo best practices by which myitems should be private and only accessed via setter and getter

1502027
rss	feed
part of an app i m building needs to check rss feed for updates

1502027
rss	feed
and i know that a few years ago when i was maintaining a podcast rss feed manually i never changed the item

1502027
rss	feed
so i need some way to reliably check rss atom etc feed for new entries since they were lasted checked

since silverlight 2 beta 2 many controls dont fire the mousedown mouseup events and i believe that slider is one of them

1502347
ubuntu	debian
it is for debian or ubuntu

1502393
children	parent
if all your selects are siblings children of one parent use previoussibling to detect prev select

versioning	upgrade
while later versioning of java will be able to execute that bytecode you can t upgrade it later versioning of the class files have a different format

1502482
post	get
a method decorator also gives you more control - eg you could allow get requests unauthenticated but still require authentication for post requests

if it returns a script-based object such as an object created using jscript or vbscript s new operator it will be of type object .

1502557
google-chrome	firefox
which works perfectly well with firefox and google-chrome

1502560
vbscript	jscript
you may find this helps script output is not displayed as expected when you run vbscript or jscript scripts in windows vista service pack 1 in windows server 2008 or in windows xp service pack 3

1502628
versioning	upgrade
we are evaluating to upgrade castle windsor container to versioning 2 which was released in may this year

1502639
ubuntu	debian
the 2 downsides are you ll need to do this for each distribution debian ubuntu suse redhat is probably a good start and you will need to maintain them as time goes on some libraries will no longer be available in a specific version and thus the user will get dependency problems

1502700
put	get
it s worth it to salespeople to put a lot of time into nice demos or download one but how long would it take a customer to get it to that point

1502721
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
alternatively it is possible to attach additional artifacts to a build so they are deployed alongside the primary artifacts assuming they ve already been packaged you can use the build-helper-maven-plugin to attach an arbitrary file to your pom.xml so it will be deployed with the specified classifier

1502794
many-to-many	one-to-many
and the same for entity relationships both one-to-many and many-to-many

1502860
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
personally nullpointerexception and illegalstateexception are the most commonly used in the softwares that i have created

1502898
width	height
a side note - if you want to randomly position a movieclip on the stage you should use stage.stagewidth and stage.stageheight otherwise you are only getting the width and height of objects on the stage not the stage itself

1502955
memcached	apc
in my situation on a high traffic site where i need all the memory i can for memcached and apc and all the other server activities i am just curious if i should use it or not the only real reason it comes in handy for me is for redirecting pages sending headers i should say after a header has already been sent my site has header body footer file setup so sometime i need to redirect depending on what is in the body file so if the header is already shown ion screen that creates a problem using output buffering is 1 solution but there are other solutions so just curious about performance

1502961
width	height
if the width and height are not specified wpf uses 60 of the width of you primary screen where the windows is actually displayed and 60 of its height

the for-loop first loops through 30-255 addresses

1503214
salt	md5
i m thinking of using md5 or murmurhash2 with the username and a random number salt with a collision detection but i m wondering if there s a more efficient solution a better algorithm and whether 32bits is too much too little for this kind of thing

1503247
put	get
the block it has put into the app.config is i have changed the names but you ll get the idea

1503255
ubuntu	debian
if you have a file on your machine and you want to know which package is responsible for it then on debian ubuntu it s.

1503302
mouse	keyboard
in addition to generating mouse events it can also generate keyboard input

1503307
integer	unsigned
i would like to save the state combination as an unsigned tinyint max 255 into a database and be able to derive the states from the saved integer

1503337
tinyint	boolean
if the tinyint has a maximum value of 255 you have 8 bits to play with and can store 8 boolean values in there

1503350
onclick	onchange
in this scenario the onchange of the textboxes still fires but the onclick event of the button does not

not as such but having gazillions of folder in one directory or the same for files isn t recommended it s a real hit to speed

1503420
width	height
it seems like the width and height are set to 16 pixels in the panel class createchildren method

1503452
int	chars
so implicitly converting from chars to int will work in c#

1503452
int	chars
edit as others pointed out a chars is a 16-bit number in c# so this conversion is just from a 16-bit int to a 32-bit int which is possible without data-loss. edit

1503453
int	chars
the chars is implicitly cast to it s unicode numeric value which is an int

1503460
int	double
â from int to long float double or

1503460
int	chars
â from chars to ushort int uint

1503472
int	double	int	chars

int	chars
here chars is 16 bit and int is 32 bit

1503516
serializable	deserialization
if you only ever want to store an array of numbers then writing your own manual serializable deserialization routine would work

1503598

1503725
bash	zsh
it should work on bourne bash korn and zsh

1503738

public	protected
why not define a protected virtual method that creates the excrement and keep the public property that returns the excrement non virtual

1503918
getter	setter
generally .net stuff such as auto-implemented properties don t need unit tests making sure that the getter and setter work

1503934
for-loop	loops
defining the logic using exceptions where a for-loop or any form of loops would suffice

1503936
stateless	stateful

unix	bsd
another interesting example of this is the bug found in i believe bsd unix

1504024
stateless	stateful
advice it does not makes sense call a stateful inside a stateless

1504035
implements	extends
then i d extends the textbox control to create a new spellcheckedtextbox which implements ispellcheckable

1504071
gif	png
the compression of images at least for gif and png images are based on repetition so if you make the image larger by repeating it the extra image size will add very little to the file size

1504133
width	height
update the code in the link above physically resizes and saves the image if your intention is to resize the image file in order to save space otherwise as mentioned you could just manually set the height width on the image control

1504136
width	height
if you load up an image then you can just set the width height properties

1504243
opera	firefox
optionally you may also wish to strip out all the firefox ie opera etc menus leaving you with just image

1504302
try-catch	exception-handling
the only exception-handling thrown in the try-catch are my own

1504316
udp	tcp
there are certain issues if you are dealing with a severely high traffic environment one is the choice of filesystem reiserfs performs 5-10x better than ext3 because of some internal caching of the fs tree it does not have udp support tcp keepalive is quite an overhead if you use sharedance only memcached has udp thanks to the facebook team and scaling is usually done on your aplication by sharding data across multiple instances of sharedance servers

1504359
int	chars
i tried long int short chars chars but none of them worked

1504371

the only way is to use javascript then get the javascript to post to it to your php if you really need there res server side

1504488
division	modulo
modulo returns the remainder that is left after division

1504576
put	get
be sure to keep the id s sufficiently different that internet explorer doesn t get confused it has namespace bugs around id and name it tends -- completely incorrectly -- to put them in the same namespace

1504590
scipy	scikits
the standard approach to solving this is using expectation maximization scipy svn includes a section on machine learning and em called scikits

disk	ram
i know i can measure different things like cpu usage ram usage disk io etc but is there a generic load measure for example the server is at 40 load etc

1504612
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
everything seems to work fine in firefox google-chrome safari and ie7 so what is it that ie8 doesn t like and how can i find that out

1504619
ironruby	ironpython
if you really want to just see how a large project works in vs grab something like ironruby or ironpython or even something like the witty twitter client

1504631
children	parent
basically a given branch of the tree may be found under more than one parent branch but wherever it is found it has the same children

1504631
children	parent
likewise there s no problem with multiple children per parent

1504631
children	parent
however given a category s id its children will be the same regardless of what parent category led you there

1504635
width	height
the fillrate becomes width x height of your rendered triangle

1504635
profiler	gprof
gcc has the gnu profiler gprof

1504655
multiplying	add
the math is as following multiplying the difference between the minimum and maximum by a random percentage and add to the minimum with rounding to an int

1504660
put	get
if you need to get a cwnd object that doesn t put its hwnd reference in the temporary handle map you can call fromhandlepermanent

1504682
getter	setter
the setter method created is named setfido and the getter method is just named fido

1504682
getter	setter
when you specify readonly i believe that simply tells the compiler not to create the setter method but only the getter

1504683
firefox	safari
this just doesnt work in firefox or safari

1504697
switching	screens
the bottom of the screens switching to

1504730
tolower	toupper
also the tolower or toupper function in might help you

1504733
cout	cin
use std cout or std cin or std cin.getline .. instead of what you are using

1504757
getter	setter
the setter and getter for the datasource is not the appropriate place for that code

1504801
keydown	keyup
note that keycode is part of the args passed for keydown and keyup but not for keypress

1504812
gridview	datalist
from what i know the datalist control does not contain a built-in paging mechanism like the gridview control however there are a few ways round it

1504820
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the original application stores user s passwords in a md5 hash format with no salt in the database

1504838
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

1504865
salt	md5
i had a similar situation recently- an old application of mine used a salt md5 and i very much wanted to upgrade without affecting my users

1504865
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
for example my initial hash was md5 pass + salt

1504899
profiling	instrumentation
i am profiling my iphone application with the activity monitor instrumentation

1504938
next	except
the second line does something similar except when you are working with an array in php you can use the operator to automatically add another element to the array with the next available index

1504956
post	get
if you can recreate the list on the server side then all you need to do is post the index of the list that you want to get a handle on

1504956
post	get
this is using a get if you want a post you can do that and make the listindex a hidden field

1504959
int	chars
first code which has an implicit conversion from chars to int note this is not an implicit cast this is an implicit conversion is legal because the c# specification clearly states that there is an implicit conversion from chars to int and the compiler is in this respect a correct implementation of the specification

1504959
int	chars
why is there an implicit conversion from chars to int

1504959
int	chars
a chars is implemented as an unsigned 16 bit int that represents a chars in a utf-16 encoding so it can be converted to a ushort without loss of precision or for that matter without change of representation

1504959
int	chars
and since chars to ushort is a good idea it seems reasonable that char-to-anything-that-ushort-goes-to is also reasonable hence chars to int

1504959
int	chars
which take chars and int which means

1504959
int	chars
when calling a method overloaded as m int and m chars when you pass it a ushort odds are good that you want to treat the ushort as a number not as a chars

1504959
int	chars
there is a long tradition in c programming of treating chars as int -- to obtain their underlying values or to do mathematics on them

1504961
integer	fractions
for example when casting a float to an int the data is actually transformed from the form used to represent floating point values usually an exponent mantissa form to a plain old integer with any fractions part lost

1504967
profiling	instrumentation
i ve seen this cause incorrect results in instrumentation memory profiling since those instances will hang around

1505008
tinymce	freetextbox
there are many text area replace editors such as fckeditor or freetextbox but my current favorite is tinymce editor

1505021
vmware	virtualbox
now an iso seems to work with virtualbox because i can tell it to mount a cd dvd drive and use the iso instead of a physical drive but the vmdk and vmx files are always listed as being for use with vmware virtualbox

1505056
public	protected
the class is not public so it can only be extended by other classes in the same package and m is protected so it can be accessed by derived classes

1505065
public	protected
alternately you could create a protected or public even get function

1505073
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in ie7+ firefox and google-chrome

1505115
daemons	launchd
i have my own launchd daemons starting an app launchd when the install starts

1505131
wxpython	pyqt
the different solutions that popped in my head were to use a gui library like wxpython or pyqt or maybe even a pdf generator like reportlab

1505156
vmware	virtualbox
vmdk vmx are vmware file formats but you can use it with virtualbox just create a new virtual machine and when asks for a hard disk choose use an existing hard disk and click on the button with folder and green arrow image on the combo box right which opens virtual media manager it looks like this you can open it directly pressing ctrl+d on main window or in file virtual media manager menu .

1505190
subtract	add
i d like to add some functionality where users can enter + or - to add subtract a day from the value

1505201
post	get
so #1 and #2 work great but how to get the #3 to display the single post that it is supposed to - for example from link the post titled one-post should be displayed

1505210
des	aes
closer to just strings is symmetric key cryptography aes des xdes rc4 where your application has a secret key used both to encrypt and decrypt

1505251
scrummaster	sprint
so when he she is not doing scrummaster duties they default back to burning down tasks on the sprint backlog

1505269
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
using class table inherited it is recommended that the subclassing refers to the superclass and not the other way around

1505274
children	parent
i am going over the children in a loop and call every child s clone method and then add it to the parent

1505342
put	get
what is the best way to put a text box on the following html page and then without reloading the page get its content in php when the user clicks the button

1505356
public	protected
access rights are controlled by whether the member has been declared in the public private or protected sections of the class definition

1505365
cvs	svn
so we re gradually moving all our projects across into svn from cvs

1505383
int	boolean
a b is a boolean expression that returns a boolean and a b is a bitwise expression that returns an int if a and b are int

1505458
public	protected
other access modifiers are protected meaning they can be accessed by other class functions and in functions in classes that inherit from this class and public meaning they re fair game for everybody to use

1505476
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
that table is inherited from the superclass of a particular class and extended with regard to the new methods of a subclassing

1505491
xna	slimdx
i m working on deciding between managed directx through ms api codepack slimdx library managed wrapper for directx xna managed wrapper++ for directx9 only or unmanaged directx 20 + extra development time

1505507
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade jquery from 1.2.6 to 1.3.2 and i also upgrade the jquery ui library to the latest versioning

1505510
boyer-moore	rabin-karp
for large strings and large numbers of patterns to be searched it is faster than applying a linear time search kmp rabin-karp boyer-moore for each pattern

1505532
awt	swing
generally swing components should be used from the awt event dispatch thread edt

1505549
postgresql	mysql
is there a way to do this with a single query hopefully a generic method that would work with mysql postgresql sql-server and oracle

1505597
many-to-many	many-to-one
hibernate does not support such many-to-many mappings so you ll have to decompose them into many-to-one mappings instead

1505613
uiview	uiwindow
it just so happens that uiwindow is a subclass of uiview we we can easily disable user interactions for out whole app

1505637
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
as an aside i would personally recommend that you avoid java.util.date and java.util.calendar completely and use joda time instead

1505645
inherited	properties
if your myclass extends anotherclass it inherited all the methods and properties of anotherclass except those marked private

1505667
floating-point	fixed-point
unfortunately there is no fixed-point arithmetic in javascript - all numbers are double-precision floating-point numbers

1505674
maven	pom.xml
one final alternative if you re on maven 2.1.0+ is to deactivate the profile via the command line for the parent pom.xml only this is still obviously not ideal

1505675
int	double
currently the calculations where int pow double a double b is included are wrong

1505675
g++	gcc
but here is the odd part i made my script in linux with geany and g++ gcc compiler and had just pow a b the script compiled and worked fine

1505675
int	double
in dev-c++ the script didn t compile with an error int from double

1505723
button	checkbox
you could make all the fields checkbox or add another table called #attributesgroups and group some together and use radio button

1505727
public	protected
the myclass class now has access to all the methods of anotherclass that are public or protected

1505743
int	double
instead of casting the double to an int in the int pow double a double b line try rounding the results of pow and then cast to int if necessary

1505770
ant	maven
if you have a well documented build procedure in place either using ant or custom scripts i would suggest it is less important to introduce maven than to add unit tests

1505774
mouseup	mousedown
again i ve attached preventdefault-ing mousedown mouseup and click handlers to all of the elements involved but it doesn t help

1505788
subtract	add
then you can add or subtract 1 or as much as you want and convert back into an ip address

1505794
onmouseover	onclick
i changed the onclick event to onmouseover event and it seems to work fine

1505959
ant	cruisecontrol
in ant scripts and ms build files you can set properties at the top how do i do this in the cruisecontrol file ccnet.config

1505968
folder	directory
if you need to remove a whole directory folder from the staging area use

1506012
firefox	safari
i recently designed a site in drupal and it is perfect in firefox and safari but wont display correctly in ie6 or ie7

1506023
rss	feed
in this first script of mine in which i m parsing twitter rss feed entries and inserting the results into a database there is one remaining problem that i cannot fix

1506023
rss	feed
as a bit of background i originally found a base script on halotis.com for downloading rss feed and then modified it in several ways 1 modified to account for idiosyncracies in twitter rss feed it s not separated into content title url etc.

1506023
rss	feed
rssfeeds which contains a list of twitter rss feed

1506023
rss	feed
in short the script below grabs the five test rss feed from the rss feed table downloads the 20 latest entries tweets from each feed parses the entries and puts the information into the rss entries tags and entry_tag tables

1506086
width	height
we need the ability to gracefully resize any photo image to an exact width height without skewing the image

1506086
width	height
resizing the width to 200px would proportionately put the height at 128px so that extra 28px would be cropped off of the top and bottom

1506086
width	height
resizing the width to 200px proportionately put the height at 80px so we would need to catch that and resize by height first

1506086
width	height
putting the height at 100px would proportionately put the width at 250px

1506086
width	height
resizing the width to 200px would proportionately put the height at 238px so that extra 138px would be cropped off of the top and bottom

1506189
packets	pcap
write an inputformat that reads pcap files returning something like longwritable for the key the nth packets in the file and packetwritable as the value containing the pcap data

1506212
rss	feed
data can be mails rss feed etc.

1506223
subtract	add
you have to add one because it s subtract and thus if the first of the given month is sunday you d end up with 0

1506232
cdr	cons
then customise erc-keywords which can contain regexps and cons cells where the regexp is in the car and the face in the cdr

1506235
width	height
the algorithm for fitting an image into a given rectangle isn t too tricky work out the ratios of width height for both the image and the target then resize based on either width or height

1506250
getter	setter
would you go so far and call it a duck typed thing that is reduced to getter and setter in other words a data transfer object

1506320
maven	pom.xml
as pointed out the maven way to launch a goal lets say mvn install on a set of modules is to organize them as a multi-module project and to launch the goal on the parent pom.xml

1506337
sequence	permutation
note that if we take our algorithm to permute a list using our index sequence and apply it to the identity permutation 0 1 2 ... n-1 we get the inverse permutation represented in the common form

1506427
public	protected
you are using a third party framework which allows you to extend by overriding protected virtual methods the path from the public methods to these virtual methods are generally treated as black box programming and will have all sorts of dependancies that the framework provides that you don t want to know about

1506429
rss	feed
data can be mails rss feed etc.

1506445
yacc	bison
so i m doing a parser where i favor flexibility over speed and i want it to be easy to write grammars for no tricky workaround rules fake rules to solve conflicts etc like you have to do in yacc bison etc.

1506464
hash	md5
string comparison will be more efficient than either crc32 or md5 or any other hash algorithm proposed

1506482
int	double
c++ standard doesn t have int pow int int it has double pow double int float .

1506505
inherited	properties
then my child class would have his own properties and should inherited from my identitybase

1506518
children	parent
for instance if you want to animate the switching from list to grid this wont help you since it will only animate to parent styles to its own new styles not its children

1506568
tabcontrol	tabitem
i m trying to style a tabcontrol and have got 75 of the way there but i m having difficulty styling the actual tabitem

1506575
put	get
further if i reverse the mappings put a ilist carriers on the company entity and try to get a filtered list of companies by a carrier it works every time but i don t know why

1506587
fflush	gets
as far as fflush current behavior i ve looked into trying to break this out but it gets very complicated - inserts which depend on deletes would have to execute after the deletes but updates which depend on inserts would have to execute beforehand

1506606
ceil	floor
you multiply the value by 16 use the floor or ceil method and divide by 16

1506628
post	get
i ve been struggling to get fluent nhibernate working and subsonic doesn t support relationships which makes doing stuff like get all comments for a single post pretty difficult

1506636
subtract	add
don t use any of the deprecated methods and don t use tostring unless you understand what it is displaying. to display format convert add subtract time etc date time always use a calendar instance or dateformat implementation and it is hard to go wrong

1506677
try-catch	exception-handling
this method has a try-catch block and the exception-handling was handled there printing the stack trace using system.err

1506745
width	height
given a rectangle of fixed height but variable width is there an efficient way to determine the largest size of a given font that will fit in the rectangle height-wise without risk of losing ascenders descenders

1506753
hide	show
edit to show or hide an image the javascript looks like

1506769
stdout	stderr
you can configure the logger to print to stdout or stderr instead not to mention filter out unimportant information

1506782
codeigniter	cakephp
i keep seeing cakephp and codeigniter referred to as full stack mvc frameworks whereas zend framework is said to be non-full stack

1506801
openbsd	debian
on a debian box and an openbsd server the order is utterly random

1506801
openbsd	debian
the debian box is 5.10.0 as is the openbsd machine

1506829
multiplying	modulo
continuing left for the 3rd column we divide by 6 because the columns to the right have 3 and 2 possibilities each multiplying to make 6 and then take the remainder modulo 4 because there are 4 possible values in this column

1506829
next	except
this next bit takes the sequence of elements between indices j and j + tempj and rotates it rightward - every element moves up one index except the last one which moves back to the start

1506841
post	put
here i define formatting precision of the output and plot parameters for my matlab session for example i use a larger plot axis font size so that .fig s can be seen plainly when i put them in presentations. see a good blog post from one of the developers about it

1506874
ssl	https
now problem is that there is a known feature in ie which sets the response cachecontrol header to no-cache by default for ssl https sites

1506875
qtableview	qheaderview
you can get a pointer to a qheaderview object using qtableview s verticalheader and horizontalheader methods

1506896
post	put
i m a wordpress user and i have a php code and in that php code there is an area to put a url in well in wordpress you can call post permalinks with this code what i want to do is putting instead of above in the php code

1506906
firefox	safari
something that isn t working on firefox safari but is working on ie on itself is already pretty weird but i can t seem to figure out this problem

1506906
firefox	safari
on my site there are links to social media in the top right corner youtube facebook and flickr on ie they are linked on firefox safari they aren t

1506906
firefox	safari
if i enlarge this to say 1200px the links do work on firefox safari

1506927
subobject	instances
there s also a possibility that pointers could rather point to subobject within an instances of z and looking at pointer values themselves there s clearly no way to tell

1506942
int	chars	int	boolean
one common method is to make a memorystream out of an array of bytes and then make a binarywriter on top of that memory stream and then write int boolean chars strings whatever to the binarywriter

1507011
put	get
i could try to put all the quotes which i probably should but i don t know how to get to that variable anyway because i m doing all of this from whithin the person view etc

1507063
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview the contains many subviews that represent a path to travel along

1507063
uiview	subviews
i have implemented an imageview to represent the sprite and is attached to the main uiview as is the subviews

1507123
post	get
this should get effect 4 insert sqls one add post and three 1st tag 2nd tag all tag

1507140
onfocus	onblur
my guess is that there is something we can do with jquery that looks at everything with a class of formthingy and changes it onfocus and back onblur i m just not sure where to start

1507189
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve done some work with scriptaculous and now i m dipping my feet in to jquery to see which of the two frameworks i like working with the most

1507214
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups look no further

1507251
ant	maven
i d suggest looking into maven or if you don t want to move to maven ivy which integrates with ant - it s not really the ci server s job to handle artifact dependencies like you re talking about

1507268
x86	64bit
in .net the platform target any cpu compiler option allows a .net assembly to run as 64bit on a x64 machine and 32 bit on an x86 machine

1507334
filesystems	ntfs
it integrates the sql server database engine with an ntfs filesystems by storing varbinary max binary large object blob data as files on the filesystems

1507350
x86	64bit
so if you write a small console application and build it as x86 and another as x64 running one or the other will cause other assemblies loaded into the process to run as 32 or 64bit

1507361
int	chars
for the operators + - you can directly store it as an ascii chars since chars are one byte int

1507366
gif	png
are there any asp.net apis for generating a gif jpg png preview of an html page

1507410
cairngorm	puremvc
i would say the puremvc framework is the most popular implementation of this pattern for as3 followed by cairngorm

1507419
uiview	subviews
and then in interface builder create a view usually by making a view xib or by dragging out a custom uiview object onto well into another uiview in the xib thus making it a subviews and then in the inspector pane set its class to be myview

1507438
google-chrome	firefox
another problem seems to be using any function other than show causes 100 cpu in linux for firefox and google-chrome and they become unresponsive until i get a warning about a slow script

1507453
post	get
i remember that there is a folder in the c windows system32 where all the http post and get request are logged

1507481
bazaar	git
that s why new version control software has come out with better merging capabilities git mercurial and bazaar come to mind

1507495
udp	tcp
this is part of the nature of udp one of the bits of reliability you give up when you switch from tcp

1507500
udp	tcp
one option is to change the network protocol use tcp or implement some acknowledgement + flow control using udp

1507503
spaces	delimiter
i need to be able to in c language loop over a few lines of text where each line has some text in it where words are delimiter by a variable number of white spaces

1507510
children	parent
more specifically it looks like its deleting parent records with no children

1507510
children	parent
so it looks like it continues to run deleting parent records without children until the number of deleted records is 0

1507510
children	parent
it probably loops like that so if a parent record has no children its deleted

1507521
spaces	delimiter
it shows how to use strtok and split lines into words by spaces delimiter

1507578
children	parent
this way when a child has no other differences it just goes away -- and so does the entry in the parent s children map that has that child as the value

1507604
udp	tcp
you should only ever be sending udp packets to those never tcp connections

1507631
x86	64bit
in other words in 64bit machine when a.exe calls it it will behave like x86 dll whereas when b.exe calls it it will behave like x64

1507662
width	height
in my main process i have the following note that i ve snipped headers footers and the positional x y height width attributes

1507666
onfocus	onblur
use a three-layered approach where the bottom layer is the normal page the top layer is your popup div and the middle layer is a transparent full-screen catch-all div that has an onfocus event that closes your popup rather than using onblur

1507667
width	height
has 2 values a width column and a height column

1507699
stdout	stderr
then you need another trick that can swap stdout and stderr this little monstrosity here

1507699
stdout	stderr
as already mentioned predate.sh will prefix each line with a timestamp and the tstdate.sh is simply a test program to write to stdout and stderr with specific time gaps

1507699
stdout	stderr
when you run the command you actually get d to stdout written to stderr but that s your tty device or whatever else stdout may have been when you started

1507742
post	put
now i have got it working another way previously another tutorial but had to put something like users user.find_all in the post controller

1507742
post	get
so how the hell can the post s table get it link to the user table

1507760
interbase	firebird
you can try ibprovider ole db firebird driver and interbase provider this very well documented updated last version 13-08-2009 and has great support

1507780
hex	binary
example i m searching for the byte sequence deadbeef in hex in a binary file

1507789
post	get
in the end the problem was that i was trying to load a 32bit binary with apache running in 64bit mode base as described in this post i was able to get it running immediately by doing the following

1507827
stdout	stderr
you can use the following trick to swap stdout and stderr

1507827
stdout	stderr
provided stdout and stderr both pointed to the same place at the start this will give you what you need

1507827
stdout	stderr
sets stdout to got to the current file handle 2 original stderr then closes 2

1507827
stdout	stderr
sets stderr to got to the current file handle 3 original stdout then closes 3

1507851
int	chars
int j 65 the chars equivalent would be a

1507921
folder	directory
ok i just downloaded junit 4.7 unpacked the zip file changed directory into the folder and ran the following command successfully

1507933
width	height
set the innertubewithborder to be fixed as well and used the same ie css hack to make it 100 height width then set it s overflow to auto

1507935
jgit	egit
the jgit egit eclipse plugin is also known to have a few issues

1507973
width	height
i draw an image on every sprite within a rectangle 0 0 width height and use matrix.transformation2d to place the image in the rendered view

1507991
subtract	add
you basically just need to add for lighter or subtract for darker equal amounts from each of r g b components

1508021
uitableview	reloaddata
take a look at the reloaddata method on uitableview - it tells the view to redo everything that causes it to display cells from the data fetches on up

1508039
getter	setter
getter and setter omitted for brevity

1508052
getter	setter
things like converting getter and setter to properties and sometimes indexers for example

1508077
portrait	landscape
there is also an event which is triggered when you change the orientation of the phone where you specify the allowed mode portrait or landscape

1508098
ubuntu	debian	stdout	stderr
the devscripts package in debian ubuntu contains a script called annotate-output which does that for both stdout and stderr

1508103
hash	salt
if the user s password is secret and the salt is abc then instead of making a hash of secret you hash secretabc and store the results of that in your database

hash	salt
the only reason to safeguard the hash passwords and salt is that if an attacker has a copy of it he can test passwords offline on his own machine rather than repeatedly trying to log in to your server which you would probably lock him out after three attempts or something like that

1508105
slideup	slidedown
when should we use slideup slidedown and when to use slidetoggle functions in jquery

1508106
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to edit the browser caps for my asp .net application in web.config but it seem after editing the effects are not realized in my browsers e..g firefox and google-chrome so i heard that you can put your browsercaps in machine.config but after doing that when i run my applications on my server its now saying service not available...as in like something evil happened to my machine.config file

1508129
slideup	slidedown
you should use slideup or slidedown if you have either multiple triggers or multiple effects

1508129
slideup	slidedown
but if you are using slideup and slidedown together for the same trigger event you are basically just doing slidetoggle but making it harder on yourself

1508151
qimage	qwidget
1 i have a main qwidget object which contains the qimage on it works fine

1508151

to cover both google-chrome firefox and any browser that supports css 3

1508198
cvs	svn
svn claims to be cvs done right

1508284
children	parent
use weakref-ed parent if you store root in some variable and pass it around while children are accessed from it

1508293
versioning	upgrade
you don t have to deal with sql scripts even when existing database is being upgrade to next versioning

1508295
kerberos	ntlm
could the issue be related to how kerberos ntlm interact with iis

1508327
bmp	ppm	bmp	pbm	bmp	png	bmp	pgm	ppm	pbm	ppm	pgm	pbm	pgm

1508357
hex	binary
perhaps you are mixing hex representation with binary

1508391
jobs	cron
the cloud server has facility of running cron jobs using ruby php perl python and http

1508406
put	get
if i consciously create a syntax error i get the error output on the url for example when i put a space before def

1508435
width	height
first i figured out that also the rotation changes the vie too so the width becomes the height etc

1508435
width	height
and i don t need to alter the height but the width according the scale

1508466
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
is it true that version of subversion client is not nessessary corresponding to the version of subverions such as of rapidsvn as opposed to tortoisesvn

1508497
min	max
you should probably also make sure that you don t get integers as min max because integer division will damage the result

1508532
width	height
i want each result about 100px in height and full width to be a single link rather than have the image and title being seperate links

1508543
versioning	upgrade
most will automatically upgrade a working copy automatically to their own versioning

1508585
firefox	safari
accessibility no one knows that microsoft always made the best accessiility features on all of its products they always worked well with disabled people comparing the browsers only ie supports full accessibility and safari firefox etc are no where closer

1508635
put	get
perhaps have deck own the card objects initially and when they re removed they get put into the vector in solitairegame and don t exist in both at the same time

1508658
qtabwidget	qtabbar
how can i get access to the qtabbar of a qtabwidget

1508658

the only solution i ve found is to subclass qtabwidget and override the protected qtabwidget gettabbar as public

1508660
daemons	systemd
or you could run the daemons as root and put your key in the systemd keychain

1508704
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
in short standard sharepoint guidance is that com-backed objects like spsite and spweb should not be used by different threads

1508714
button	checkbox
the problem is that when button is pressed it does not recognize the latest checkbox action

1508725
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr log files should have been created in the logs directory of your tomcat installation

1508757
vbscript	jscript
its tempting to advise you to use jscript on the server side instead of vbscript

1508774
inline	inlining
if you use a variable or method only once you may inline it but inlining is always equivalent to declaring it explicitly

1508783
width	height
i don t want to hardcode the width height either as the image i change it to could be another size

1508840
width	height
you have to define your height and width in order for the picture to show up

1508840
width	height
otherwise it is limited to the height and width of whatever the browser defaults to for that element

1508840
width	height
for instance an empty span has no height or width so any background image will be covering the background of an area of 0x0

1508840
put	get
you ll notice that if you put in i hate static dimensions in that span you tested you ll get a small corner of your image

1508840
width	height
now you could set the height and width in the css and therefore not hard-code it into the html however you can only do this for elements with a display type of block

1508840
width	height
if you want the area to have height and width but still flow inline you can use display inline-block

1508842
width	height
i don t think you can using purely css unless you specify the width and height

1508842
width	height
so just set the width and height in your css along with your image as background-image and your fine

1508869
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy rather than strcpy

1508880
put	get
i know i could get 10 recods for each model put them in a dictionary and sort by date well once i know how to sort by date in python but this seems fairly inefficient

1508939
qvboxlayout	qwidget
it consists of the default central widget a qwidget which contains a qvboxlayout with all the other widgets in it

1508967
implements	extends
localvalidatorfactorybean does extends springvalidatoradapter though which implements org.springframework.validation.validator

1508968
icmp	tcp
since you need root permissions to send an icmp package and the implemetation of isreachable will use the slow tcp version of echo

1509004
post	get
what do i need to do to get the post values

1509014
vmware	virtualbox
i m aware that by running vmware or virtualbox could get things working however it doesn t seem to be a good solution since i want to use the processor i7 at its fullness

1509178
width	margin
also if you want the margin to have a constant width regardless then you will have to actually use pixels but this is going to be a bit more difficult

1509204
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can back this up with an onkeyup handler or onkeydown timeout to make that particular case update quicker

1509210
firefox	safari
you ve not mentioned which version of asp.net you re using - although i guess as you re having issues with firefox and safari it s 1.1 - if you re running on asp.net 2.0 the browsercaps element is now deprecated in favour of the .browser definition files

1509222
width	height
i also suspect that the document is rasterized when the content of the visualbrush isn t applied with the original 1 1 height width ratio the visual has

1509222
width	height
errors within a resizing calculation led to a 1 0.9948 height width ratio for the applied visualbrush and this led to a blurry output excluding the nested visualbrush problem

1509247
keydown	keyup
left -1000px and add all 3 events keydown keypress keyup to it

1509260

mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown event handler is used as it s for fat fingers on a windows touch screen and movement between mousedown and mouseup does not constitute a click

1509446
libxml2	libxslt
nonetheless you do have the same problem in that nokogiri can t find your libxml2 libxslt libxslt libraries

1509446
libxml2	libxslt
most likely you need windows binaries dlls of libxml2 and libxslt at a minimum

1509545
equals	gethashcode
implement the gethashcode method whenever you implement the equals

1509573
versioning	upgrade
i d really like to be able to just specify exactly which gav to use in my client pom and when it s time to upgrade assuming the bug gets properly fixed in v3.0 say just update my client pom to point to versioning 3.0.0 and my patched 2.2.1 jar just gets ignored and no hacking of nexus is required

1509601
fgets	strtok
as has been pointed out by other answers you re much better off parsing the string in the usual way fgets and strtok

1509610
width	height
are you giving the resize method both a width and a height

1509621
post	get
the live server has examplewebsite.com any thing goes wrong with that website should post the error where the django app get the errors and insert them into the database

1509637

1509942
aptana	radrails
note this can be used with the aptana radrails eclipse plugin as well as aptana

1509999
filtering	grouping
it also matches the mental model better you have list of data sources from then you filtering out the data you re interested in where then you sort this data orderby and lastly you either project it into a different representation select or partition the results grouping by

1510016
fadein	hide
#message hide .html you have selected + numberofitems + + smartplural language numberofitems + . fadein slow

1510062

i m leaving this question and answer in its original form for historical purposes for anyone who needs to maintain a legacy site that is unable to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery and jquery.validate

1510168
versioning	upgrade
i know that at least wptools has changed some of its component structures and interfaces since the versioning used in the original application and obviously i ll have some recoding to do there but will the failure of those parts of the program prevent my code base from being upgrade at all

1510213
width	height
at runtime my resize code calculates a resize ratio based on the new width and height vs

1510217

when i press my download button in my form-instance3 the other form instances 2 and 1 hangs on downloading the contents i get a timeout sometimes until the form-instance3 terminate all the downloads and so on for all the other forms

1510353
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade properly you must increment the file versioning

1510364
put	get
for the url you are redirecting to you should have a call back function which is where you put your logic the way you setup the hook_menu and the callback function will determine how you get your variables available

if you have code that is essentially getter setter why test them

1510407
getter	setter
for simple things like getter setter or simple math stuff i don t test

1510448
daemons	systemd
if the daemons function doesn t exist on the systemd you re using you need to use setsid and fork instead

1510699
equals	compareto
well sortedset doesn t use equals it uses compareto

1510699
equals	compareto
so if your compareto returns false your element will be added even if equals were to return true thus breaking set contract

1510793
jquery-ui-autocomplete	scriptaculous
i was having the same problem with jquery-ui-autocomplete a couple of days ago to the point that i considered using the scriptaculous auto-complete but it turned out to be a lot easier than i thought actually - kind of surprised at all the hair pulling i went through

1510802
filtering	grouping
i want to find all the users that are a member of a grouping in a certain ou so my filtering would look something like this

1510810
post	get
if you re worried about having too much data for a get request use a post request instead

1510821
cpu	processors
if not please make sure the cpu is consumed by sqlservr.exe by checking the process processors performance counters

1510922
children	parent
i want the parent process to resume execution the point after this while loop only after all children have terminated

1510922
waitpid	fork
in one approach i made parent pause after while loop and sent some condition from sigchld handler only when waitpid returned error echild no child remaining but the problem i am facing in this approach is even before parent has finished fork all processes retstat becomes -1

1510935
many-to-many	one-to-many
pat shaughnessy is developing modified auto_complete plugin which can allow to manage one-to-many and many-to-many association

1510935
many-to-many	one-to-many
also it would be better to remove from the list of suggested tasks one-to-many or products|categories many-to-many those which have been already added

1511034
daemon	cron
cron is a unix daemon that runs shell commands according to a configured schedule the crontab

1511034
jobs	cron
your cloud server provider must have something similar they call cron that runs ruby php perl python and http jobs

1511049
post	get
but i d also have to get the server to sequence its response to the xhr to follow the response to the post and figure out how to communicate the savedata outcome to the response to the xhr

1511061
printf	strlen
you should use strlen on ptr before the copy to make sure it fits or use printf if you have it

1511097
post	get
many mobile browsers have no js and implement the app as static get and post handlers

1511108
filtering	grouping
if you still want to check for membership in a grouping in addition to being part of the ou you can add this as a member-of part to the filtering

1511108
filtering	grouping
not totally sure about the wildcards - in general ldap search filtering do support wildcards but i m a bit hesitant about using a wildcard in a rdn like this grouping dn here

versioning	upgrade
one thing to note if you use any 3rd party packages make sure they have a delphi 2010 versioning available that you can upgrade to before you convert

1511314
vbscript	jscript
actually wscript cscript is the engine vbscript and jscript are the languages

1511314
vbscript	jscript
personal opinion only follows my personal recommendation is jscript because it reminds me more of a real programming language and makes me want to punch myself in the face less often than vbscript

1511320
vbscript	jscript
you could use vbscript but why when jscript is available

1511327
vbscript	jscript
however microsoft 1 hates javascript so you ll encounter some apis that are trivial to use with vbscript but painful to access using jscript

1511385
hash	md5
it seems to me that we should be able to add the the source code comments recompile the source code and use something like an md5 or sha1 hash using something like fciv to compare the before and after dlls to confirm that the source code comments did not impact the compiled version

1511387
vbscript	jscript
to expand on the other s answers a bit wscript and cscript are programs used to run scripts written in vbscript visual basic like syntax or jscript javascript-like syntax

1511387
vbscript	jscript
you can write wsh windows scripting host and wsc windows scripting component scripts that use both vbscript and jscript by combining them in an xml-based wrapper if you need to merge pre-existing code in the two languages

1511514
range	max
on average the system needs to handle 2000 messages daily from each client where the message size will range from 1k to msmq max size 4mb

1511550
skip-lists	tree
for larger lists you can achieve o log n updates by using a sorted o log n data structure avl rb-trees skip-lists segment tree etc.

1511550
treemap	treeset
many popular languages have some sort of sorted data structure in their library treemap treeset in java multiset multimap in c++ s stl or you can easily find a free implementation for your language

1511570
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket

1511710
inherited	properties
in the properties editor of the inherited control my columns collection exists

1511723
hash	md5
ok according to facebook your client library should perform all the necessary validation for you by using the application secret to md5 all the params and validate the hash

1511745
hide	show
i expected this to hide all elements and only show the printablearea however everything gets hidden

1511774
bids	ssas
likewise if you just created the cube you have to process and deploy to your ssas server to browse it through bids or sms

1511780
width	height
it seems that a won t be visible unless a height and width is specified

1511780
width	height
couldn t the bounds of the line imply the correct width and height

1511806
pascal	delphi
the most notable exceptions that spring to mind apart from the aforementioned windows are sql and delphi pascal

1511821
gridview	formview
first the answer seemed to be for a gridview and not a formview e.row.cells 0 gave it away

1511835
superclass	subclassing
you need to signify that the superclass method is being called because you need to have the ability to make that decision for each subclassing separately - otherwise you might have a subclassing that doesn t want to delegate anything to the superclass at all - so the default is that you just put in the code

1511864
equals	compareto
as chssply76 wrote in a comment you can use hashcode to decide the compareto call in the case where two collections have the same size but are not equals

1511865
curb	libcurl
gem install curb gives an error saying i need to specify where the libcurl library lives

1511877

1511899
daemons	launchd
but keep in mind this will launchd apache and mysql daemons in the background

1511944
jquery	scriptaculous
seems like people use jquery with either scriptaculous or yui for the interface elements.

1511964
public	protected
if you want to expose a field make it public or protected use a property which should be capitalized if it s protected or public

1512055
post	get
you don t send the vars directly to the function they are sent via get or post

1512087
ant	maven
the real recommendation i would make though is to drop ant and convert over to maven - like the apache software foundation did they maintain both ant and maven

1512092
punctuation	words
this would match either a words or a non-word spacing punctuation etc. sequence possibly an empty one

1512137
google-chrome	firefox
tested and works in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5.3 and google-chrome

1512183
clang	llvm
from gcc 4.x to clang llvm

1512183
clang	llvm
however currently xcode has no clang llvm compiler for the iphone device and so you can only use that setting when compiling for the simulator

1512183
clang	llvm
the best approach then is to create a copy of the debug configuration in the project settings configurations tab named debug clang and set that configuration to use the clang llvm compiler and run the static analyser

1512263
portrait	landscape
also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape

1512274
post	get
not get or post or load

1512276
put	get
those number get put into the string

1512302
uiview	calayer
i wonder what difference will it make if a assemble the complex view by creating a different uiview for each element and adding them as children of the complex view or if i should instead create a a different calayer for each element and add them as children of the complex view s layer property

1512336
initializer	class-method
so while you can access your methods and properties in your modules without initialization you would need to use the new method to initializer your class-method

1512344
int	double
it s using a double as the interval but in fact calls math.ceiling on it and casting the result as an int to use with an underlying system.threading.timer

1512376
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if you browse this page with google-chrome opera or firefox and the browser s window height is smaller than 800px some menus will overflow the window and the user must scroll down the page to display the options hidden

1512378
int	double
i have a test dll created in another language basic not c in fact that contains a cdecl function that adds an int to a double

1512381
comparator	comparable
once you do have said class you ll either need to write a comparator for your objects or make item comparable by itself

inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i have multiple objects in a hierarchy which have common properties and methods inherited from the superclass and object-specific properties and methods in the subclassing

1512438
udp	tcp
it s features so far are tcp udp ipv4 ipv6 async sync and multicasting

1512468
button	checkbox
maybe you are using the wrong control for this without knowing what you are trying to accomplish i still want to suggest that you look at the possibility of using a checkbox or radio button instead

1512476
g++	gcc
i ve been using the uva online judge to solve some programming challenges and when submitting my solutions i m told the judge will compile my code using the following parameters to gcc g++ that i don t know -lm -lcrypt -pipe -donline_judge

1512505
actionscript	mxml
don t think it is is possible to call the constructor with args from mxml but with actionscript you could have optional parameters that would set the values.

1512512
google-chrome	firefox
when you click on one of the meds at the top of the page the text loads fine in firefox but not at all in ie and google-chrome

1512531

haskell	scheme
maybe you d like haskell -- in which case you could try write yourself a scheme in 48 hours an interesting tutorial you get to write a scheme interpreter in haskell

1512728
cos	sin
any line on the xy plane can be described as p x cos theta + y sin theta

1512743
queue	fifo
by queue do you mean a fifo fifo queue or a priority queue

1512743
queue	fifo
for dealing with fifo queue and logging perhaps you could look into ring buffers and log rotation

1512743
disk	ram
for dealing with caching data in ram to minimize disk access you may or may not be better off leaving that to the operating system

1512747
google-chrome	firefox
this is one of those rare cases where things work as expected in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

1512753
ienumerable	ilist
can someone explain why i get an no translations to sql error in results statement if getaddresses returns ilist but not if it returns ienumerable

1512755

i m trying to setup an ivr or to be more specific an automated attendant using asterisk

1512776
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested the code in google-chrome firefox opera safari ie7 8 and every thing is working everywhere else.

1512781
yacc	bison
therefore you get to hack your grammar to change it from lr k to lalr 1 again forcing you to suffer the experiments that expose the strange cases and hacking the grammar reduction logic to try to handle k-lookaheads when the parser generators yacc bison .

1512790
hide	show
what is your objective - to hide the image show on the page

1512794
children	parent
is it possible with single hql to initialize all parent objects with its children

1512914
strlen	strtok
ok if strlen is the only function allowed you can first find the length of your source string then loop through it and replace all non-letter characters with null - basically that s what strtok does

1512923
inherited	subclassing
an abstract class is only to be subclassing inherited from

1512938
firefox	safari
on firefox and safari i can see the browse button

1512964
post	get
post the complete function code if you want to get a more precise answer

1512969
ilist	icollection
replace ilist with icollection if you don t need indexing and just want a count and be able to enumerate through the jobs

1512972
int	boolean
i have changed one of the functions with raw pointers int and boolean to std vector and std vector.

1512972
int	boolean
same algorithm one implementation is using 4 5 dynamic arrays of int and boolean

1512991
min	max
gcc detects common code such as hand-coded min and max and turns them into one sse instruction on x86 x86_64 and when -msse is set or using cmov when i686 is available sse has higher priority

1512991
memcpy	memset
gcc knows what built-in types are and how to exploit them in real world use and will gladly do so - just like it knows what memset and memcpy does and how to optimize accordingly when copy size is known

1513003
getter	setter
properties could be renamed or they could have a setter getter added or removed

1513003
getter	setter
adding a setter getter is not breaking but all other property changes are breaking

1513004
google-chrome	safari
after that users of google-chrome and safari cannot click at link foo

1513053
tinyint	boolean
i also recommend that a tinyint for the datatype of the read column more broadly compatable than boolean but still very small

1513143
superclass	subclassing
this means that superclass get the benefit of subclassing behaviors but it also means that overriding methods can theoretically get invoked before the constructor in that class

1513149
subclass	abstract-class
as long as there are not too many implementations of foo i would declare an abstract method in someinterface for each subclass of foo and have an abstract-class forward calls to a default method that is defined for the most general type

1513153
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine so far but when i want to insert something at the cursor position it gets slow in firefox when there is a lot of text in the textarea google-chrome works fine

1513161
google-chrome	firefox
as i m running into some other minor problems with firefox i m pondering switching to google-chrome for this but can anyone tell me how to load fixedsys in google-chrome

1513169
getter	setter
that s why i suggest the minimally evil hack - don t make everything private and if you can get away with a getter but no setter do that

1513184
free	memcpy
for example auto_ptr s can t be just memcopied if you memcpy the auto_ptr and then destructor is ran for both you ll attempt to free the same memory two times and the program will crash

1513219
redhat	fedora
redhat s fedora core is very secure because it uses selinux this is somthing that does not exist for windows

1513237
post	get
in your script you ll get broken url as post parameter _post broken_url

1513270
salt	dpapi
i have no idea if it will help but windows provides since 2000 a mechanism to retrieve and store encrypted information and you can also salt this storage on a per-application basis if needed data protection api dpapi

1513276
post	get
i am assuming that you are talking about the model that you pass to the view and the model that you get back once the form post

1513310
addclass	removeclass
and then use addclass and removeclass -

1513345
switching	screens
set the avaudiosession s category property to avaudiosessioncategoryplayback to indicate that the app s major purpose is to play back audio and it therefore should ignore the screens lock button and ring silent switching

1513352
getter	setter
therefore node_base can have pure virtual getter setter and other methods

1513374
multiplying	add
i am trying to get these valued passed to the fraction class because in the end i have to add these two fractions together and also multiplying them

1513413
mbunit	nunit
use nunit or mbunit etc for unit testing

1513444
nsinteger	double
you are receiving an error because you are declaring bvalue as a pointer to an nsinteger yet trying to initialize it with a double value

1513478
int	chars
the x pointer is a chars pointer which after dereferencing gets promoted to an int with sign extension which causes all your output values to be either 000000xx or ffffffxx depending on the value of bit 7

1513478
int	chars
instead what you probably want to do is use an int pointer to scan through the stack values instead of a chars pointer

1513484
int	chars
you re looking at individual chars then casting those to 32-bit int which is confusing you

1513499
erlang	scheme
so my question is if standard function definitions in oz are not lazy what does oz do that languages like scheme or erlang can t or won t

1513528
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the overflow hidden will clear the float for firefox safari and google-chrome

1513618
folder	directory
i have directory called mysourcedir it has sonme files and folder

1513641
icmp	tcp
using icmp ping can be useful at a low level but presumably what you need is a connection to an actual endpoint via tcp ip to do real work

1513651
width	height
this method doesn t even need the resize event s height and width because as dlh already comments you can ask most components for their dimensions when you get notified and do your calculations with that

1513679
icmp	tcp
a lot of companies have measures in place to prevent outgoing icmp requests tcp connections to ports other than 80 443 for example or even to prevent you from reaching the internet directly by transparently proxying your traffic

1513679
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
under an internet connection i would understand any way to contact the outside be it udp tcp or icmp

1513686
post	get
now i will post the code so that someone with a similar problem can get some help

1513726
udp	tcp
is there a reference which lists approximately how long it takes in relative or absolute terms to transfer information over network udp vs tcp ip disk memory sequential random access in-process vs inter-process etc

1513738
post	put
when the user picks fire fighter your sql would put 3 in the and here i m lost from your post

1513738
put	get
if the issue is that you re collecting new values you must put them in first get the id number of the newly inserted career you re using an auto_increment mysql sequence oracle or identity sql server for those idcareer values yes

1513775
hash	salt
you should use a salt hash to prevent dictionary attacks

1513782
stdout	fflush
you may want to fflush stdout to ensure that the buffers are in a consistent state before you do that

1513797
versioning	upgrade
register a myfullapp url with the full versioning and have the lite app present an upgrade option that calls that url with the various data you want to exchanged encoded in it

1513808
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i created a testpage which has been tested in ie 8 google-chrome 3 opera 10 and firefox 3.5

1513868
public	protected
have mytestableclass extend myclass and then provide public methods in mytestableclass that expose the protected methods of myclass that you need

1513897
hide	show
i want to show one and hide the other based on a condition

1513916
put	get
... if we just put the file in cvs and update the other machines from there the encrypted passwords on each machine would get overwritten

1513961
clang	llvm
an interactive c console which employs llvm and its new c frontend clang

1513990
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
however this one makes me worried because the adoption rate for current browsers is spotty even in cutting edge ones like firefox opera and safari

1514024
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
personally when firefox google-chrome and opera have good implementations that s when i ll start using html5

1514050
entity-relationship	diagram
for the same reasons that entity-relationship diagram make sense for database design

1514161
django	web2py	django	turbogears	turbogears	web2py
although django turbogears web2py are all good frameworks i found the latter quite simple and flexible

1514216
put	get
or just get it off the gcc source tar ball and put them where your eclipse could pick them up adjust the include path accordingly

1514222
subtract	add
for a tree view it would be more complex but i could see that you would want all your richtext controls to be indexed maybe use the tag property and then as you move them in your tree view use the index to add subtract from other indexes and then use the relocate method in a loop that many times to get it to it s new location

1514244
udp	tcp
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

1514244
udp	tcp
also tcp with nagle turned on batches packets which again wouldn t be a fair comparison to udp which doesn t do that

1514246
integer	unsigned
cert has developed a new approach to detecting and reporting signed integer overflow unsigned integer wrapping and integer truncation using the as-if infinitely ranged air integer model

1514278
public	protected
all examples i see tend to present entities with virtual automatic properties and an empty constructor protected or worst public and that s it

1514289
hide	show
i had mistakenly added my jscript along with that to hide and show controls

1514299
stdout	fflush
the call to fflush stdout will translate into a write call of whatever has been buffered but not sent to the underlying io port

1514340
put	get
if you put pointers to objects in the queue and any other stl container the pointers won t get deleted when you remove them

1514340
int	chars
but the destructor for plain pointer or any pod type - int chars etc is empty no-op

1514352
inherited	properties
you can t normally see the prototype chain although firefox and webkit make it available through the __proto__ properties but it is the way inherited is actually handled in js

1514352
inherited	subclassing
the only drawback i see is that you can t inherited the constructor function so every time you make a new subclassing you must write a constructor that calls the base constructor even if your subclassing s constructor does nothing at all

1514382
for-loop	loops
i know a while loops can do anything a for-loop can but can a for-loop do anything a while loops can

1514390
boost	stl
if you used a container of a proxy type as raw pointers smart pointers shared_ptr weak_ptr or adapters as boost reference_wrapper then the stl container will destroy the proxy but not the type

1514400
post	get
anyway i tried to do it from page load itself as skippyfire describes in an old post and get this error from visual studio ide

1514411
rss	feed
i m creating a table to hold items from rss feed and i need to create a column description

1514420
for-loop	loops
the while loops and the classical for-loop are interchangable

1514422
implements	extends
in generics extends means extends or implements

1514481
ilist	icollection
the preferencesdescriptions collection is mapped as an ilist so is an indexed collection when i require standard unindexed collections i use icollection

1514481
ilist	icollection
â how can i make it without having to override this very case - i mean how can i make fluent nhibernate s automap make always indexed collections for ilist but not for icollection

1514491
disk	ram
notably a desktop machine has lots more ram and will swap memory to disk as apps demand more

1514652
subtract	add
i wanted it to be more simple so i wrote this i realize it would do + for both add and subtract

1514679
children	parent
if someone owns parent 23 and its children but they don t own parent 24 you wouldn t want them modifying the url and changing parent 24 s children

1514695
yacc	bison
php uses yacc bison just like gcc

1514738
cos	sin
lat2 asin sin lat1 cos d r + cos lat1 sin d r cos î

1514738
cos	sin
sin lat1 cos d r - as sin and cos will never be larger than 1 the largest result can be 1

1514738
cos	sin
cos lat1 sin d r cos î - same as above

1514767
width	height
when a canvas element s dimensions are altered width or height the canvas itself is cleared and effectively reset origin policies are an exception

1514771
children	parent
use an event to dispatch property-changed notifications from the parent to the children

1514823
lisp	scheme
in lisp well scheme anyway the only fundamental data structure is a pair

1514845
next	except
i would say that if less than 20 say they can t move to 3.5 or can t in the near future then just go ahead with 3.5 and say that the next version of your library will require 3.5 and that there will be no further development on the 2.0 version except in cases where a severe security flaw or other critical bug might be found

1514846
png	tga
what i want to do is take a folder of png files combine them into a texture atlas and then export the atlas as a tga and the uv coords to xml

1514884
for-loop	loops
if you can provide an upper bound for the condition in a while loops to become true you can convert it to a for-loop

1514912
google-chrome	firefox
also when i load a javafx app in firefox or google-chrome it says it can t find java

1514966
jar	war
it has to be in the classpath of your war - either a package under web-inf or jar under web-inf lib

1514982
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
in either case a multiplication with a power of two is replaced with a bit shift but for multiplication with a power of two + - 1 3 5 7 9 15 17 ... hotspot will generate a bit shift and an addition or a subtraction for intel cpus while generating a multiplication for amd cpus since the amd cpu executes a multiplication much faster than the intel cpu

1515030
width	height
what i m ultimately trying to do is a design with fixed width and percentage-based height where child divs are also percentage-based positioned to their parents i believe this is the correct way to deal with different screen resolutions

1515032
3dsmax	blender
you can design you map in any .bsp editor 3dsmax blender and store the data you need in xml

1515076
for-loop	loops
then just copy+paste the for-loop of your original matrix and change matrix.rows in matrix2.rows in the yellowrows loops now u have 2 loops in your yellowrows loops

1515086
int	boolean
in order to save space i am using a single 32bit int field in a struct to represent several different sets of boolean properties

1515123
unification	inference
milners algorithm can also cope with unification of cyclic graphs and the dragon book presents it as a way to do type inference

1515143
width	height
i d like to write a function that takes a filename and produces a .pdf file on a nix platform and a .wmf on a windows platform with that filename and width of 6 inches height 4

1515155
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the recommended way to do this is to just use a uinavigationcontroller and push uiviewcontroller s onto the stack either modal or non-modal

1515187
post	get
i might be doing something completely wrong here but for some reason the values of this form i have in one of my pages get cached after the first post

1515216
memcpy	memmove
you can do that with memmove not memcpy since the src and dst are pointing to overlapping memory like so

1515297
fullscreen	minimized
where fullscreen is defined as 0 the three icons that are usually at the top of any window minimized maximize restore and close are not there

1515327
mouseup	mousedown
you don t need both a mousedown and mouseup event handler

1515332
explode	implode
i m not sure why you d serialize it in php either because implode and explode would be more appropriate

1515337
tiff	png
from two images one is a tiff and the other one is a png

1515347
min	max
i would do this in a loop 1000 times and take the max time min time and average time

1515354
tiff	png
in order to send binary data you will need to use a servlet but you can take advantage of the java advanced imaging api and read in both images then you can combine them and save them as a tiff or png

1515365
awt	swing
i m changing a program from awt to swing as proposed on the second chapter of swing s book and the panel just disappears when i do the change from panel to jpanel

1515370
pylons	turbogears
- for being too magical or too monolithic compared to alternatives such as pylons turbogears werkzeug c which are lighter-weight esp

1515377
portrait	landscape
i had to add a bit of extra code to accommodate both portrait and landscape images

1515409
stateless	stateful
ejbs - stateless and stateful session entity and message driven beans

1515411
jtree	jtable
this should have the added benefit of making your jtree behave the same way that your jtable behaves when you press a jbutton

1515422
portrait	landscape
i had to add a bit of extra code to accommodate both portrait and landscape images

1515426
portrait	landscape
i had to add a bit of extra code to accommodate both portrait and landscape images

1515464
move	drag
however the x in this case will not be persistent meaning that if you drag another form over your form and then move it away the x will not be there anymore

1515490
getter	setter
to do the same thing with objective-c on the iphone anyway requires that you declare a local variable to back the property write the property declaration and then use the synthesize directive to have the property generated for you depending on what property attributes you specify you might have a property that wraps getter and setter that take care of reference-counting for you - overall this is a time-saver but the c# way is the clear winner here

1515510
stdout	fflush
you could add fflush stdout

1515515
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

1515561
serializable	deserialization
there are various good serializable deserialization libraries that automatically convert javabean objects to from xml and json strings

1515561
serializable	deserialization
java s built-in support for serializable can do the same thing and you can write custom serializable deserialization methods for java to call

1515609
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
then for when you are adding or removing listeners you could loops through each element on the arrays with a simple for-loop

1515730
folder	dir
i have a script all written up in bash x.sh that will move some files and other stuff on input 1 i just need osx to give me the file name when new files folder are moved created into a dir

1515739
hide	show
the code below will show hide a div on click

1515748
nunit	mstest
most frameworks mstest nunit etc. allow you to define setup and teardown methods that are guaranteed to run before and after the test

1515753
post	get
however the one thing i simply cannot get working is to have a page spit out a list of post of a certain category

1515760
hide	show
basically just use the hide and .show to show hide the appropriate div at the right time

1515789
post	get
you may use or to get the post you are looking for

1515913
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the viewwillappear viewdidappear and viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear messages are the only messages you need to manually send to the child view controller

1515913
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in addition when you add the child view controller s view you should send the viewwillappear viewdidappear messages if the parent s view.window is non-nil

1515939
hide	show
as for now i hide every flash ad on show dialog

1515939
google-chrome	firefox
which works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1515963
scheme	prolog
also it gives a good introduction into scheme prolog and programming paradigms logic functional imperative object oriented

1515984
superclass	subclassing
i thought all objects were subclassing of nsobject and though the cast would be made implicit superclass substitution a superclass can always be replaced by any child class of it

1515999
erlang	ocaml
you can look to my existing configs based on the code from emacswiki with some extensions - function to handle conversion from text to chars and example of it use for erlang mode - you can change it for ocaml mode also

1516018
minimum	max
which number cast is a registry dword in vb based on its minimum and max values

1516070
chaiscript	c++
there is a new package chaiscript which is designed for c++

1516076
versioning	upgrade
new versioning upgrade or install alongside older versioning

1516140
versioning	upgrade
i m about to upgrade a svn server from versioning 1.5.5 to 1.6.5 - all is fine with the actual upgrade but i m a little confused about upgrading the actual repositories

1516165
int	double
implicit conversions other than inheritance such as int to double are not performed and will throw an exception

1516172
implements	extends
my problem question is this currently mythread is extends thread because i mark it as daemon and i read about how it s more prefferable to implements runnable and to use executors

1516172
implements	extends
so what i wanted to ask is if mythread will implements runnable instead of extends thread and of course will be renamed and i ll use newsinglethreadscheduledexecutor how what or maybe where do i mark something as daemon

1516238
pop-up	dialog
when my main form is displaying a modal dialog i want right-click to activate the main form not display a pop-up menu

1516250
accessor	properties
in cocoa on the mac or on the iphone the use of accessor properties is required to be kvo-conformant

1516250
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
it is also best to use accessor properties when you want to ensure properties memory management behaviour which is to say always when setting an ivar to use the setter or dot notation and depending on which memory management pattern you follow to always use accessor properties when getting an ivar

1516250
accessor	properties
what this means is that using accessor properties will give you confidence that your objects will be around as long as you need them to be without some other part of the code releasing them out from under you

1516250
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the last and best reason to always use accessor properties is that it makes one fewer assumption for each properties that there is an underlying ivar for that properties and that is has the same name i guess that s two assumptions

1516250
accessor	ivar
perhaps in future you will want to replace an ivar with a derived accessor

1516292
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

1516294
uiview	subviews
i have a parent uiview with a number of subviews

1516306
width	height
you might use the off-left technique if the plugin doesn t like the elements not having height width

1516318
int	chars
a concrete example might help on architectures with 8bit chars types - chars being by definition what c and c++ consider the architecture s byte size - and 32bit int types int has the size of 4 bytes

1516350
folder	directory
by default iis creates log files in the system32 logfiles directory of your windows folder

1516352
opensuse	linux
linux opensuse 11

1516412
ant	maven
i have heard of build files ant maven but i really am not sure if i am looking at the right thing

1516420
decoder	encoder
if you are using utf-8 there s a quick trick you can use to implement a utf-8 encoder decoder in js with minimal code

1516430
salt	md5
note use a random salt inside the md5 or sha1 if you prefer so it cant easily be reverse-engineered

1516435
maven	pom.xml
these files won t be checked in all information is in the maven pom.xml file

1516441

width	height
is not added to a box so will decrease any width or height

1516443
width	height
also some elements without certain css properties no specific width or height or auto do not trigger haslayout in ie

1516459
yacc	bison
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive

1516483
codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	cakephp	kohana
have you considered using a php mvc framework such as codeigniter cakephp kohana etc

1516486
int	boolean
i have also read that enums are stored as small int - which as i understand it is not a problem with the boolean tests as these would be peroformed starting at the right most bits

1516492
apache	nginx
nginx doesn t have loadable modules like apache

1516493
pascal	delphi
but i learn programming and after structured programming with pascal language i m beginning to learn about oop with delphi

1516493
public	protected
i understand what is public declaration interface approachable by the outside but i don t see what s the difference between private and protected declarations

1516528
hash	md5
password is stored as an md5 hash of their real text password

1516550
hash	salt
if your old system used unsalted hash and vbulletin uses salt ones then if you want users to keep their passwords you will have to modify vbulletin to use unsalted ones too

1516550
hash	salt
you can direct users to a page when their login fails and it would check their credentials against the old system and create a new salt and hash for the new system

1516551
public	protected
the difference between private protected and public is pretty straightforward

1516556
google-chrome	firefox
using clientx and clienty alone are not sufficient if the browser window is scrolled verified in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 3.0

1516572
int	chars
now from the above linked question we can infer what is going on here the compiler is using the implicit chars - int conversion then adding those values

1516584
int	chars
we are in agreement this this could have been more reasonably defined to mean concatenate given that strings and chars are much more distinct entities from int than they were in past lives the c programming language

1516584
int	chars
traditionally a chars constant at least in c was just another way to represent an int

1516600
int	chars
as has already been said chars is considered a form of int rather than a string so fundamentally an addition operation is adding two numbers rather than performing concatenation

1516609
g++	gcc
what are the difference between the 3 compilers cc gcc g++ when compiling

1516624
hide	show
i would just put toload and its children in index.html and set them display none in your stylesheet then attach the jquery show and hide functions to an onclick handler to make things appear or disappear

1516627
g++	gcc
g++ is a driver binary like gcc but with a few special options set for compiling c++

1516627
g++	gcc
notably in my experience g++ will link libstdc++ by default while gcc won t

1516639
int	chars
your deduction -- that chars is converted to int and therefore there is no addition operator defined on chars -- is spot on so good on you

1516639
int	double
briefly they are int + int uint + uint long + long ulong + ulong float + float double + double decimal + decimal enum-and-underlying type delegate combination string + string string + object and object + string

1516639
int	chars
their storage is that of short int but their semantics are those of the chars in a string

1516639
int	chars
so should a chars be treated as its int form or as a short string

1516639
int	chars
the language designers decided in this case to follow the lead of earlier languages like c and treat chars like int when doing mathematics on them that does not involve strings

1516639
int	chars
appending the empty string as another answer suggests unambiguously tells the compiler this operation is on strings not on the chars s int value

1516658
g++	gcc
the easy part because it is not platform-specific is the separation of gcc and g++

1516658
g++	gcc
g++ is the gnu c++ compiler from the gcc

1516698
hash	md5
it s used to store an md5 hash

1516698
hash	md5
they have a parameter that accepts a password in plaintext convert it to the md5 hash and store lookup the hash in the table

1516742
wxpython	listctrl
i have a wxpython listctrl with five columns

1516767
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the code you ve given then just has multiple nested loops so in the outermost for-loop is itself an associative arrays which is then looped through and the values stored in that associative arrays are also arrays

1516835
disk	ram
if you want to avoid chewing up a lot of disk space ram or cpu power doing window management you should check out matchbox

1516836
webkit	gecko
it simply states that the client says they re running internet explorer 8 using the trident layout engine similar to safari webkit or mozilla gecko

1516852
client-side	server-side
but i still have an important question even after asking some experienced developers when functionality can be implemented with both server-side code and client-side scripting javascript which one should be preferred

1516852
client-side	server-side
to render a dynamic html page i can format the page in server-side code php python and use ajax to fetch the formatted page and render it directly more logic on server-side less on client-side

1516858
post	get
so to get around this based on advice in another post i m planning on creating a key class which will be used as the hashmap key

1516863
mp3	wav
i d like to transcribe an english spoken wav or mp3 file to text

1516883
perl	tcl
it has code examples in tcl python ruby and perl

1516898
atoi	atof
i think you have to take the returned c-string then convert it into a number using atoi or atof depending on the type

1516904
hide	show
it hide and then show again

1516904
gentoo	linux
browser firefox 3.5.3 under linux gentoo

1516914
fadein	fadeout
you have wrote #content in the fadeout and #conent in the fadein

1516926
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord and datamapper have a find_by_sql method that helps you more but doesn t instantiate all models at least on activerecord if i m not mistaken that is

1516928
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
nearly all the uinavigationcontroller examples out there show the use of initwithnibname bundle to load a nib containing not an entire uiviewcontroller or subclass but just a uiview with the nib s file s owner class property set to uiviewcontroller or the appropriate subclass and its view outlet pointed at the uiview

1516929
solaris	aix
offering it on aix solaris tru64 and hpux

1516970
post	get
i can get all the post for a specific topic.all the post have an auto_increment identity column as well as a timestamp

1516970
post	get
get all the post for the topic and order by timestamp

1516970
post	get
get all the post for the topic and order by post_id

1516991
kde	gnome
the build system is widely varied and will probably be dictated by your preference between gnome kde or the ever-present command line

1517058
portrait	landscape
can anyone give an example of how to rotate the view of a monotouch application from portrait to landscape and vice versa

1517089
super	self
you must always call through to the super s initializer before messaging self

1517138
ubuntu	linux
i m using the netbeans ide for my project on ubuntu linux

1517178
portrait	landscape
it s a slight improvement on the reddit version as it handles either portrait or landscape images

1517179
width	height
update thanks to the two answers so far i have gotten it to actually call the onpaint by using setstyle controlstyles.userpaint true and i have gotten it to draw the text in the right place by sending in new rectangle 0 0 width height instead of bounds

1517199
getter	setter
you need a getter setter for your collection

1517250
jquery	jqmodal
i ve tried jqmodal and jquery ui but haven t managed to find any good samples or tutorials yet

1517290
apache	nginx
nginx - 0.7.62 same problem under apache 2.x

1517322
many-to-many	one-to-many
that would not be useful since foreign keys are per definition prone to be duplicates one-to-many many-to-many

1517335
getter	setter
in c# you won t see many performance issues around trivial property getter and setter like this

1517363
mergesort	timsort
if you prefer reading java code than c code you could look at joshua bloch s implementation of timsort in and for java joshua s also the guy who implemented in 1997 the modified mergesort that s still used in java and one can hope that java will eventually switch to his recent port of timsort

1517391
width	height
bounds contains the height and width of your control which is what you want but it also contains the top and left properties of your control relative to the parent form so your hello is being offset on the control by however much your control is offset on its parent form

1517412
width	height
the getclientrect function according to msdn is actually only good for determining the client width height since left top are always zero

1517430
implements	extends
but if i m extends a controller and i call for example listaction on the page controller but this action is implements in content_indexcontroller it still looks for the list view script in the page controllers scripts directory

1517450
post	get
to get the names and values of your fields then validate them and then post myfields to your controller with a

1517456
put	get
the numbers are written to the folder however there is no space between them so when i put it in the decoder it will not decode is there anyway for me to get a space between them

1517458
vim	emacs
you can also use either vim or emacs for python development

1517470
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
that being said i recommend learning python using a basic approach - use a text editor like notepad++ vim or emacs to learn the basics

1517473
expression-blend	silverlight
ran the project in blend dragged the dll files into c program files expression-blend 3 libraries silverlight v3.0 and

1517507
notepad++	textpad
visual studio and most other editors like notepad++ and textpad doesn t handle long lines well

1517532
textview	imageview
- consists of imageview textview

1517537
cos	sin
x r cos long sin lat

1517545
lisp	scheme
in a language such as lisp or scheme using s-expressions to represent the program text probably will reduce the amount of work for the parser

1517567
notepad++	scite
i find scite to be a good alternative to notepad++

1517584
vim	emacs
for dynamically typed languages power editors like vim and emacs make excellent ides

1517584
vim	emacs
you can use gui tools to make your layout and still use vim emacs for development

1517591
ant	maven
instead you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy ivy works if you use ant but maven is both a build tool and a dependency management system so i would recommend maven if you can

1517591
ant	maven
any ide worth its weight will have plugins to support ant ivy and maven so as long as the developers have the plugin they just point to the appropriate ant or maven build files

1517639
nsmenu	nsapplication
- nsmenu applicationdockmenu nsapplication sender

1517670
haskell	ocaml
other languages offer some form of type inference the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable ocaml haskell scala kotlin

1517694
integer	unsigned
subtraction between integer values where one is of type unsigned produces an unsigned

1517700
direct3d	direct2d
if you don t plan on using wpf which might be overkill if you only intend to do image processing starts using technologies like direct3d opengl or the recent direct2d to apply with ease pixel shaders on a rendering target

1517704
chunked	transfer-encoding
but that doesn t even cover the potential for a server to send back a response with the transfer-encoding chunked header set

1517727
versioning	upgrade
then it will be up to you if you want to upgrade project to .net 3.5 versioning but if no - fine vs 2008 has .net 2.0 support as well

1517752
comparator	comparable
you could define separate comparator 1 or make the class comparable with a comparator method and a switch to determine how the fields are compared

1517775
firefox	safari
my understanding was that this feature is support in firefox safari and ie8

1517776
prng	random
by using a pseudo random number generator prng to produce the messages we can save the message keys whatever we feed the prng to produce a given message rather than storing the whole message

1517776
prng	random
this would make the database inserts and searches more efficient at the risk of wrongly picking the prng or rather the message generator based pm random numbers one which would produce at first messages that are somehow less likely to crc32-collide.

1517824
quicksort	heapsort
and some sorting algorithms are not like heapsort quicksort etc

1517882
changeset	cherry-pick
good branching support includes ease of merging and conflict resolution when different changes are made to a file cherry-pick taking one patch or changeset from one branch or the head trunk and applying it to another branch and the like

1517888
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview control in asp.net provides updating capabilities when assigning a sqldatasource control to the gridview s datasourceid however when programmatically assigning a code level sqldatasource to datasource the built-in updating capabilities go away and you are forced to roll your own

1517888
gridview	sqldatasource
why can the gridview still not take advantage of the sqldatasource updatecommand

1517907
firefox	safari
my understanding was that this feature is support in firefox safari and ie8

1517907
google-chrome	safari
nope it s only in webkit safari google-chrome and also via gears

1517907
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is supported by firefox 3.5 ie8 and safari but not google-chrome

1517916
mvp	presenter
you could also consider the mvp model view presenter pattern it gives you the same separation of logic and presentation as mvc while it still allows you use the asp.net server controls

1517930
quicksort	heapsort
if you don t need stability you can use a fast memory-sipping algorithm from a library like heapsort or quicksort and forget about it

1517940
int	chars
then just sum everything togeter in right way and you got array of unsigned chars whit int

1518025
post	get
i chose _request because it handles both post and get but you could use _post as meder described

1518040
inherited	properties
so if class c inherited from class b and has one extra properties could i create a new object of class c by passing it an object that already exists of class b and it will either leave the extra properties null or run some linq to sql to see what the extra properties should be such as for a counter etc

1518057
width	height
toolbarbuttons don t have height width or size properties

1518059
getter	setter
however you could provide a way of constructing a c instance from a b -- either by having the c copy the properties from the b or by having the c store the b as a private member and delegate property getter and setter to the contained b

1518161
int	chars
if you want to go from chars to int and back no need to add anything - you can simply treat the unichar as an int

1518167
min	max
i did it with the following code which uses the built-in min max and square procedures

1518176
dictionary	map
more generally you use a map implementation when you need to efficiently retrieve items by lookup retrieving something based on the key - such as dictionary caches repositories etc

1518272
nsurl	nsdata
init the vc subclass with an nsurl and then download the contents of the nsurl into an nsdata object

1518297
disk	ram
resources can be - ram hard disk graphic processing power and similar other

1518322
opera	firefox
i found my page text displayed in opera and firefox with different font-size

1518322
opera	firefox
it looks fine it firefox but opera 9.64 displays it large size

1518338
implements	extends
i have implements a custom listview by extends linearlayout for every row

1518347
width	height
to extract width and height

1518386
int	chars
if the member is a int float chars etc it is undefined

1518488
post	get
if you dont know where to get the dependency dll post the name here and we can see what we can do about it

1518499
portrait	landscape
my application is in landscape mod.when i call mfmailcomposeviewcontroller through present model view it comes in landscape mod.i rotate device and mfmailcomposeviewcontroller view goes to portrait mod i want to restrict this rotation it should always be in landscape mod only.is there any way to do it

1518511
google-chrome	firefox
now in ie8 and google-chrome it finds the passed argument as htmldiv and works fine but in firefox it give an error cc223423432 is undefined

1518578
serializable	deserialization
reconstituting objects from their serializable form is generally called deserialization

1518613
post	get
i used dotfuscator to encrypet my dlls and on post build event i wrote command to get the encrypted dlls instad of old ones and finally i published my website

1518639
width	height
use this constructor to create the bitmap - bitmap int type int width int height

1518642
filtering	grouping
depending on how you mean filtering you could either use distinct or maybe grouping by both are used to remove or grouping duplicate entries

1518707
merb	ruby-on-rails
it has support for ruby-on-rails gae merb couchdb air webkit and i m sure it would be a snap to connect it to your java implementation

1518720
free	malloc
malloc and free are system compiler dependent so it s hard to give a specific answer

1518734
free	malloc
the malloc free implementation remembers the size of each block as it is allocated so it is not necessary to remind it of the size when freeing

1518778
next	except
or to make it much nicer for the user incorporate jquery to hide all of the fields except the first one and provide a button for them to click that unhides the next one

1518780
implements	extends
we can extends a class but we cannot implements a class

1518780
implements	extends
we can implements an interface but cannot extends an interface

1518784
int	chars
so if you put a string with 20 chars and three int in a session object that will use about 100 + 8 + 8 + 20 2 + 3 20 216 bytes

1518800
implements	extends
interfaces in contrast to ifoo for interfaces in the .net world and instead uses the difference between extends and implements to signify the difference to the programmer

1518802
implements	extends
i hope this small examples clears the differences between extends and implements

1518806
implements	extends
the implements java keyword is used to implements an interface where the extends is used to extends a class

1518806
implements	extends
remember in java you can only extends one class and implements zero to many interfaces for the implements class

1518811
superclass	subclassing
in fact if a superclass implements an interface then any subclassing will also be considered to implement that interface

1518811
inherited	subclassing
in java there is no multiple inherited so that a sub class can only have one parent class and subclassing should be considered carefully so as to choose an appropriate parent if any at all

1518811
inherited	subclassing
but having a fileutils parent class with some utility methods in and then subclassing that all over the place in order to inherited that functionality is a bad idea in this case you should likely declare the helper methods static or hold a reference to a fileutils instance instead

1518843
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you could generate a web service client proxy using one of the tools available in .net either through visual studio or one of the command-line programs wsdl.exe when using asmx or svcutil.exe when using wcf and make the resulting class and its containing assembly available to com

1518898
qmainwindow	qpushbutton
connect a signal from this widget to a slot from the qmainwindow for example if the widget is a qpushbutton connect the signal click to the qmainwindow custom slot you have created

1518904
ready	each
it will make your client code more complex since you ll have to handle the return of each async call and determine when they have all completed and you re ready to build your xml

1518915
disk	ram
since ram seems to be the new disk and since that statement also means that access to memory is now considered slow similarly to how disk access has always been i do want to maximize locality of reference in memory for high performance applications

1518922
post	get
if you get it to work post back and let me know i d be quite interested in how you did this

1518948
soappy	suds
there are a lot of things i m not sure about how to handle errors how to deal with 20-odd wsdl files a soappy suds instance for each

1518979
folder	directory
the directory i was in contains a cvs folder with a root file that looks exactly as i d expect it to

1518998
typedef	typename
it can t be a typename a typedef name or a template name

1519033
width	height
how can i fix the width and height for a retrieved image

1519045
hide	show
and then to hide show it

1519046
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the default behaviour when pushing a uiviewcontroller on a uinavigationcontroller is for the os to display a back button that pops the uiviewcontroller off again

1519062
width	height
check all images have width and height attributes

1519073
width	height
resizes image you specify max height width

1519142
soappy	suds
there are a lot of things i m not sure about how to handle errors how to deal with 20-odd wsdl files a soappy suds instance for each

1519161
multiplying	add
i assume you don t need me to tell you how to perform rounding if necessary multiplying it by 100 and add the extra passenger fees

1519258
folder	directory
if your host is a virtual directory then put your data files in the app_data folder of the host project and set copytooutputdirectory donotcopy

1519263
udp	tcp
i want to authenticate via ad from my webserver i even test the port 389 and it was open by telnet i even added port 389 udp and tcp to firewall of webserver to be sure it is open even i turned the firewall off but nothing changed

1519362
sproutcore	cappuccino
maybe you can use sproutcore or cappuccino accordingly

1519363
children	parent
nh return back the list of both parent elements and the derived children elements which is right b c that is what i ve asked but that is not what i need

1519363
children	parent
the children elements should be only inside the father object but since they are of type parent as well - since they derived from it.

1519371
x86	64bit
some old x86 instructions are undefined in 64bit mode

1519399
post	get
in your case i think you should use query string instead of long urls urls are flexible but to handle variable length of parameters it s better to use get or post

1519413
initializer	class-method
i have managed to add both instance and class-method to the model in question by including a module from within an initializer

1519418
hex	binary
hex -- decimal then decimal -- binary

1519419
rss	feed
i would like to get all links that match this description from a html page that has a list of rss feed

1519436
getter	setter
i had indeed forgotten the getter and the setter

1519498
pop-up	dialog
log or pop-up in a dialog box fontname just before you try to create the font and i m sure that ll show you what s going on

1519509
irrlicht	ogre3d
try ogre3d or irrlicht

1519509
irrlicht	ogre3d
with ogre3d and irrlicht you might uses .net as well though the ports are not always up to date and plugins are not as easyly included as in the c++ versions

1519617
pop-up	dialog
i need to pop-up a success confirmation dialog after a user clicks to add someone to his friends list

1519656
postgresql	mysql
our company is continuously improving the implementation of the linq to sql tecnology for oracle mysql postgresql and sqlite databases

1519715
cairngorm	flex
it worked fine and i felt that the approach could handle a fairly large group we used cairngorm on the flex side btw

1519719
getter	setter
add getter and setter in customclass.java

1519720
translation	globalization
using the built-in globalization methods is a lot of work because you have to manually create each globalized form and then manually replace all the text with the translation and this task pretty much requires the programmer to be fluent

1519745
uiview	subviews
another way to do this is to simply put a uiview atop your main view s subviews mark its userinteraction property and grey it out when needed

1519745
uiview	subviews
you could even add a uiactivityindicator as a subviews of this foreground uiview starting its animation when needed

1519778
hide	show
it would be better to only create it once and then just show hide it or have it created from the start and then just show hide it

1519799
scons	qmake
read about scons since you use qt - it support moc objects cmake or qt s qmake for that

1519848
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
plugins such as m2e provide libraries also know as classpath containers that can automatically generate content based on some configuration the maven pom.xml in m2e s case

1520017
profiler	yourkit
is anybody using the .net profiler made by yourkit

1520017
profiler	yourkit
i am looking for a good .net profiler and stumbled upon the yourkit one

1520017
profiler	yourkit
but i am not very experienced in profiling .net applications so i wonder if yourkit .net profiler gets the job done

1520061
width	height
now this isn t particularly difficult - the drag drop example is simply a matter of changing the x y coordinates of the svg object or a resize operation would be a simple matter of changing its width or height

1520069
for-loop	arrays
and temparray is being loaded with the archived arrays but when i go through the for-loop poollistdata addobject testtemp

1520092
touchesbegan	touchesended
you can do this very easily by comparing the touch at touchesbegan touch and the touchesended touch coordinates

1520104
folder	directory
i have added it file application directory and it s present when the files are extracted in the appdir programfiles folder

1520132
width	height
now i want to get the actual pixel width and height that the browser has rendered this div as

1520136
ienumerable	ienumerator
a custom implementation ienumerable ienumerator or

1520147
width	height
offsetwidth height cumulatively measures the element s borders horizontal padding vertical scrollbar if present if rendered and css width

1520147
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
if that is not what you meant and you d rather only the element s width and height excluding padding margin etc try getcomputedstyle

1520147
width	height
the values above will be the final computed pixel values for the width and height css style properties including values set by a element or an external stylesheet

1520197
point-in-polygon	convex
you must know convex hull and point-in-polygon

1520224
width	height
control_ops array width 400 height 350

1520237
ienumerable	ienumerator
in .net ienumerable just means the class provides a method getenumerator which returns an ienumerator which itself only contains current movenext and reset methods

1520237
tostring	string.format
2 by doing a string.format on your list you wouldn t have been passing the list as an object to your javascript but just the tostring result of your list

such that the first 4 locations of the chars array are the 4 bytes of the int

1523025
division	multiplication	atan2	sin
besides the fact that it s theoretically impossible to simply factor out earth s gravity the first step i would take would be to benchmark each of the operations that you re performing multiplication division sin atan2 etc and then engineer a way around the operations that take significantly longer to compute or avoid computing the problematic operations

1523037
int	chars
assuming a platform where chars are 8bits and int are 4 bytes

ok so i managed to get it working with ajax and post in a not so attractive way

1524489

see the post get redirect pattern for a general solution to this problem

that new runtime defined stringgrid created in a new page of a tpagecontrol should inherited get copy clone duplicate the properties and methods of the stringgrid parent already defined in the first page at design time and should be able to call the popup1 menu just like the stringgrid parent

1525441
inherited	properties
if you are creating a class that inherited another class all the properties of the parent method should still be relevant

1525463
public	protected
term will ouput protected or public variable sectionid defined in code-behind file in html markup

1525525
post	put
the restful gets are working as expected but put post are giving a 405 error method not supported

1525580
int	chars
i ve written several int chars s and the such to a data file with binarywriter in c#

1525593
gif	png
the following code will create a thumbnail file in a subdirectory called tmb for a jpeg png and gif file

1525644
nunit	mstest
at this point my collegue and i are looking at nunit along with possble silverlight options and mstest in conjunction with the silverlight testing framework that jeff wilcox wrote

1525644
nunit	mstest
i m not married to a particular framework but corporate seems to be most open to nunit or mstest

1525647
pop-up	dialog
want to know how to create modal dialog pop-up without title bar using javascript which will work on both ie and ff

1525657
unix	solaris
it is crossplatform runs on windows linux mac os x solaris and nearly any other unix platform out there

1525720
stdout	stderr
that s probably because the software you re running doesn t write to stdout or stderr

1525747
firefox	safari
the client website i am developing looks fine in firefox safari ie7 ie8

1525773
stdout	stderr
you should build the solution with msbuild.exe instead which is designed to give feedback to stdout and stderr

1525812
nunit	mstest
i m not going to recommend a unit testing framework but i can warn that the test attributes in mstest are sealed unable to be inherited in a new custom attribute which you create unlike nunit

1525846
children	parent
styles cascade on down from parent elements to their children

1525914
gridview	rowdatabound
i need the functionality to highlight the edited row in a gridview so on rowdatabound of the gridview i check which one s the one that has been edited and change the css style

1525976
x86	64bit
but if i build using x86 32 bit it is working fine without any issue on a 64bit processor + 64bit os

1526021
integer	fractions
beyond that any definition including fractions seems useless and the more common integer value whole months between dates also depends on non-standard business rules

1526024
i2c	spi
minimal requirements are ethernet port 2 uarts spi bus i2c bus min 16mb ram min 4mb rom io ports

1526072
width	height
i ve tried setting an explicit width and height to the calendar widget in the smartgwt library using calendar.setwidth 500 and calendar.setheight 400 to no avail

1526076
spweb	spsite
2 spweb and spsite objects need to be created in the context of rwep

1526104
google-chrome	firefox
when the user clicks the button that downloads a file internet explorer google-chrome firefox shows the save dialog but the name of the file is the name of the aspx page for example if the page is named download.aspx the download dialog shows the file download.zip

1526132
put	get
for example if you hire a c# or java developer and put him on a fortran system and tell him to get work accomplished he is going to copy and paste throughout that system due to lack of understanding

1526171
put	get
as you get more complex with your error detection you ll probably want to put the awk script in a file and invoke it with awk -f verify.awk data.txt

1526188
vim	textmate
is there a way to emulate this textmate feature while in insert mode in vim

1526191
getter	setter
i ve also defined a setter getter property for each column which encapsulates the logic for serializing and deserializing the json into python datastructures

1526201
postgresql	mysql
alternatively use asp.net mvc but with a free database such as postgresql or mysql

1526214
sequence	permutation
the nice thing about this code is that it returns a sequence of permutation instead of generating them all at once

1526237
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
since this is not a problem in any other browser firefox ie google-chrome safari the incompatibility seems to be with the deep-linking and the web-kit

1526243
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
this is very intrusive implies replacing all sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldataadapter and other components from system.data.sqlclient with the equivalent oledbconnection oledbcommand olddbdataadapter or odbcconnection odbccommand and odbcdataadapter

1526245
serializable	deserialization
you need to do the deserialization when the model is first loaded from the database and serializable on save only

1526282
dreamweaver	aptana
all the power of eclipse and all the usability of dreamweaver plus some nice aptana goodies

1526288
getdate	datepart
select cast datepart year getdate -1 as datetime

1526309
mouseover	mouseout
i know this has to do with event bubbling and mouseover mouseout but i can t figure out the logic of how to keep the menu open while the cursor is over the entire

1526353
solaris	aix	solaris	bsd	bsd	aix
sometimes you need it bash only because tr cut awk behave differently on linux solaris aix bsd etc

1526374
set	bag
for user-articles relationship you can use either set or list mapped as bag

1526390
implements	extends
use a partial class to extends your data class and implements the oncreated partial method and in this set the value to string.empty

1526394
extjs	mootools
you could also roll your own ui using the underlying cross-browser libraries yui extjs jquery mootools etc. or even just plain old javascript html css dom

1526443
subtraction	addition
since none of your operations are addition or subtraction you could do the whole thing in logarithm form and convert back at the end

1526468
ant	maven
i would recommend using a build system such as ant or maven

1526470
websphere	ibm
take a look at ibm help writing websphere mq base java applications

1526477
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
best link i could find google-chrome safari firefox with example

1526477
google-chrome	safari
sample source code safari google-chrome

1526557
ant	cruisecontrol
is this something i should configure in cruisecontrol or in ant

1526569
hex	binary
converting binary data to printable hex

1526601
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	cairo
it does however link against gtk gdk and cairo

1526601
xlib	cairo
it appears therefore that it is using either cairo or raw xlib calls to do its drawing on linux

1526645
profiler	yourkit
a great way to visualize this would be with a dynamic profiler such as yourkit which allows you to see all heap allocations

1526654
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the above code works perfectly in ie8 firefox and google-chrome haven t tested in opera but only registers the click function with the first matching element and not all that match it

1526700
button	checkbox
the textbox value is whatever i typed in before i hit the save button but the checkbox is always false regardless of whether i checked it or not

1526709
put	get
should get you where you want to go put your table name in for table

1526728
put	get
in the other hand hashmap provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put so although it may use more memory getting an element may be much faster using a hashmap than a arraylist

1526769
mouseover	mouseout
you could try mouseover mouseout instead of toggling

1526787
dropbox	skydrive
i ve tried dropbox and skydrive but they each have faults

1526789
width	height
when i use the zoom-in button i use a double animation for the image width height to 1.25 of its original size each time the button is clicked

1526790
tostring	padleft
instead i d use good old tostring characters and padleft like so

1526793
stateless	stateful
i m in the stateful client-stateless server camp due to scaleability but when facing the hurdles of explaining why this and that became harder to implement using a stateless server you get kind of resigned in the long run this is where stateful server shines

1526793
stateless	stateful
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

1526793
stateless	stateful
also going from stateless to stateful is easy just ignore state info that you are providing since you already know it

1526793
stateless	stateful
anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scaleability issues

1526793
stateless	stateful
maybe stateful server should be the exception to the stateless rule .

1526809
getter	setter
as a result fxcop correctly complains that the foo property or rather its implicit getter and setter methods doesn t have the same linkdemand

1526815
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
i m looking for a feature rich grid sorting grouping paging ideally filtering etc grid that will work well under ie6

1526815
extjs	gxt
the most obvious contender so far is extjs or gxt

1526823
windows	wow64
even 64bit versions of windows still include msscript.ocx with wow64 in c windows syswow64

1526844
versioning	upgrade
we have an extensive classic asp site and we re looking to upgrade to asp .net most probably the latest versioning

1526863
getter	setter
you should be able to apply the attribute to the getter and setter directly

1526865
width	height
width 1200 height 800 toolbar yes menubar yes resizable yes scrollbars yes +

1526887
children	parent
this snippet will determine if the element has children using the parent selector

1526913
udp	tcp
its worth noting the same 16-bit crc implementation applies to tcp as well as udp on a per packet basis

1526913
udp	tcp
when characterizing the properties of udp consider the majority of data transfers that take place on the internet today use tcp

1526954
put	get
the only reason why it might get pushed out of the cache is if some other data is deemed more urgent to put in the cache

1527041
public	protected
is there any way for me to access protected members of a class in packone from a class in packtwo but not allow public users to do so

1527043
ssl	https
i enabled ssl on the entire site and accessing the site in https i can get static files..i can access the aspx files directly...but the routes no longer work

1527055
rss	feed
the basic answer to this is to use a method of getting the feed entries in a manner other than using the actual rss like outputting json going through the api etc

1527068
folder	directory
is there any way to provide a logout function for a site which uses classic asp and which uses windows authentication the restricted folder have their permissions set via the server os and usernames passwords are stored in active directory

1527070
ssl	https
adding https ssl support to asp.net mvc routing

1527072
folder	directory
we have all of the com dll files located in sub folder in a com directory on the server and we want to copy that entire directory and register all the applications in component services just like they are

1527078
int	double
edit 2009-10-07 changing int arguments to double does not help

1527133
xrange	enumerate
use range xrange or enumerate

1527149
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

1527152
for-loop	loops
third you could use a while loops but even better would be a for-loop and the range and len functions

1527161
quicksort	mergesort
why is quicksort better than mergesort

1527163
clipper	basic
look for polygon clipper or polygon clipping since the same basic algorithms that handle polygon intersection also tend to be usable for the general clipping cases

1527178
mergesort	heapsort
is there something that causes you to shy away from algorithms like heapsort or mergesort

1527201
quicksort	heapsort
but if you want to be super-safe you may want to use something like introsort which starts out as quicksort but switches over to heapsort if it detects from the recursion depth that the algorithm is starting to go quadratic

1527222
nant	xmlpoke
for example we re using nant task xmlpoke to substitute config values during the build

1527260
folder	directory
currently i have a .htaccess file within the directory of the folder i want to restrict with the appropriate group that has access to it

1527274
xetex	xelatex
with xetex or xelatex the poitn is that you don t have to specify tex fonts you should use your system fonts

1527308
fast-forward	merge
this technique also falls down if an integration merge has been made with the parents reversed a temporary branch was used to perform a test merge into master and then fast-forward into the feature branch to build on further

1527325
post	get
rather when you have finished your post action redirect to the get action using redirecttoaction

1527358
inline	inlining
inline function calls won t show up as subroutine calls in the assembly code - the code to implement the function is emitted inline at the point where the function call would otherwise be that s what inlining is

1527396
stdout	stderr
for example level 1 always writes to stdout level 2 writes to stderr level 4 writes to syslog level 5 may create a new file and write messages to that etc

1527410
maven	pom.xml
you can pass an arbitrary property to a maven build using for example then configure the version in your pom.xml as 1.0.0- buildnumber

1527427
sharepoint	spsite
access to sharepoint assuming you create a new spsite in your codetorunelevated will be performed with the rights of the application pool sharepoint system

1527427
sharepoint	spsite
to summarize rwep to impersonate the app pool outside of sharepoint spsite impersonation to impersonate the app pool inside of sharepoint

1527451
acrobat	indesign
i checked this in indesign and acrobat

1527533
postgresql	mysql
installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up

1527548
lisp	scheme
i have a passing knowledge of other lisp particularly scheme from way back

1527562
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
if you are doing it on a mac why not have fun and write a monitoring program that runs on an iphone that will monitor the network traffic under macos does something similar to the top function on unix not certain if top is on bsd or just linux solaris

1527603
listview	gridview
i have a gridview inside of a listview predefined in the xaml

1527610
cvs	svn
as of now the workflow is something like i import an svn or a cvs repository and then compile a document locally on my machine to get either a ps or a pdf file

1527631
ienumerable	iqueryable
the easiest thing to do might be to write an implementation of idatareader that can wrapper an ienumerable iqueryable is an ienumerable

1527646
min	max
i am after a result set that has entries where the max maxcolumn - min mincolumn for that group such that when their difference is summed up it is less or equal to constant c

1527646
min	max
apart from the max maxcolumn and min mincolumn value i also need the first record column a and last record column b values before creating a new entry in this result set

1527687
stdout	stderr
each process actually gets its stdin stdout and stderr file identifiers 0 1 and 2 from the calling process

1527687
folder	directory
finder sets the current working directory to the folder where the .app bundle is located so the above emulates it all best

1527687
stdout	stderr
console is usually used for viewing stdout and stderr

1527687
stdout	stderr
i cannot test this since i m not on mac but i ve actually found some sources that say that stdout and stderr should be redirected there

1527687
stdout	stderr
you can use console.app to see the output of applications launched in the normal manner because the launch infrastructure specifically sends their stdout and stderr there

1527693
hide	show
have multiple sections divs and show hide different ones using javascript which may or may not involve ajax and need not be a tabbed interface

1527693
post	put
can t offer more detail on how to do that without knowing what you re using on the server side php java but the idea is to use javascript to put the selected rows into the post data by setting a hidden field for the selected rows

1527694
portrait	landscape
when user selects landscape printing from print setup it is printer in portrait again anyway

1527743
min	max
for example if my max number in my xml is 12 and my min is 11 the charts top is 12 and the charts bottom is 11 with 11.2 11.4 11.6 11.8 in between

1527820
min	max
now we d like a number between min inclusive and max exclusive

1527820
min	max
we can use the math.random to get the correspondent in the min max interval

1527820
min	max
don t forget to add min back so that we get a number in the min max interval

1527820
min	max
the second one returns an integer between min and max both inclusive

1527820
ceil	floor
now for getting integers you could use round ceil or floor

1527820
min	max
both min and max only have approximately half the chance to roll

1527820
min	max
with max excluded from the interval it has an even less chance to roll than min

1527832
min	max
the code will also record the edge cases so if the the function produces a value greater than the max or less than the min you.will.know.about.it

1527852
multiplying	add
manipulate add multiplying by an

1527856
int	chars
so i know about string#codepointat int but it s indexed by the chars offset not by the codepoint offset

1527856
int	chars
using string#charat int to get the chars at an index

1527863
versioning	upgrade
i would go with richardod s suggestion and either bite the bullet and upgrade or find a versioning of visual studio 2005

1527868
free	malloc
when you have arrays of arrays of arrays ... in the form of pointers you need to malloc and free every level individually

1527868
free	malloc
i put it all in the main function but it s the same idea if the malloc s and free s are in their own function

1527877
nginx	lighttpd
you can conceivably use a different lighter weight webserver like nginx lighttpd to serve the static content

1527881
firefox	safari
the error occurs in ie firefox and safari but not chrome...alas

1527907
nswindow	nsbutton
i was thinking of using a transparent nswindow with transparent nsbutton containing pngs with alpha for each button but i think the overlapping buttons will be a problem

1527907
mouseup	mousedown
1- subclass nscontrol and override drawrect mouseup mousedragged and mousedown

1527907
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
first it looks like the nsbitmapimagerep is flipped horizontally compared to my nsimage

1527916
versioning	upgrade
my versioning is a hybrid of features from the versioning 2.0 and 2.5- it has all of the reading functionality with some 2.5 upgrade but no writing

1527937
getschematable	executereader
call executereader then getschematable to figure out the order of the columns

1527941
mouseup	mousedown	nsbutton	nsresponder
what about overriding the nsresponder event methods mouseup mousedown etc in your custom buttons presumably you d be subclassing nscontrol or nsbutton to make these

1527987
rss	feed
i am setting up rss feed for searches and journal alerts from the ebsco

1527991
realloc	malloc
is reporting realloc events as malloc events so objectalloc tallies

1528013
sorting	filtering
in this case you are presumably storing the sorting filtering in

1528013
sorting	filtering
in short store the item number wherever you are storing the filtering sorting information

1528059
autocomplete	multi-select
because the number of bands possible to list for an event should not be sent along as a multi-select box i d like to use an autocomplete that handles multiples like the tags box here on stackoverflow

1528059
autocomplete	multi-select
ideally i want to autocomplete like the tags here on stackoverflow and send along the selected bands id s in some kind of delimited string - all while letting django validate that the bands passed exist etc as if i left the annoying multi-select list in place

1528101
uilabel	nsstring
i have been looking for any example code for drawing a uilabel or just an nsstring or something on a curved path but have come up empty handed

1528122
sorting	filtering
when the filtering sorting criteria change re-evaluate the list and set the current index to a suitable value 0 for the first photo in the new list

1528131
button	checkbox
obviously in your button postback handler you would need to ensure you have the original html from the database and then either modify the input elements to add a text attribute to them with the value or more likely replace them with the actual values - otherwise you ll have to do lots of additional parsing of the form if your users start saving forms with radio button checkbox select lists etc

1528142
margin	height
i know 4.2 doesn t support padding and margin but i thought it supported height or line-height

1528151
mbunit	nunit
in this tutorial i m showing how to do testing with mbunit but it s exactly the same for nunit

1528158
gif	png
use transparent png to gain the full alpha channel and then a fall-back css for internet explorer 6 that uses gif or one of the many workarounds to support transparent pngs in ie6 except the workarounds using alphaimageloader

1528215
move	drag
this event covers move as well as removal so it should work for re-arranging items with drag and drop inside a list

1528221
versioning	upgrade
using svn versioning 1.3.1 unable to upgrade due to a configuration controlled cm server on centos 4.2

1528232
post	get
this one just seems to pass get variables to php not post

1528299
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox i think got the paste event from version 3.0 and recent versions of webkit have it google-chrome and safari 4 have it at least don t know about opera

1528309
width	height
i wish to detect the width height of the uploaded html and store it in my db

1528309
width	height
how would you reliably determine what the rendered width height would be of the document in question

1528356
int	double
however it disregards issues of signedness and the question whether a floating-point type can represent the full range of an int type e.g float cannot store all 32-bit int precisely but double can

1528361
ant	maven
sbt is a build tool like ant maven or make

1528361
ant	maven
i mean it uses scala code instead of xml like maven and ant as the configuration source

1528367
width	height
edit note that ass other people have pointed out the height will also depend on the width because of text wrapping etc so you should set the width of the ie control to an appropiate value

1528386
width	height
as you ve discovered you won t be able to use a webbrowser control because the height and width reported are the height and width of the control itself not the document inside the control

1528399
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
you ll need to add the coredata framework to your target create a data model and instantiate the nsmanagedobjectmodel nspersistentstorecoordinator and nsmanagedobjectcontext objects

1528402
hide	show
no you can remove them from the designer as show but you cannot really hide them form code as that would violate the substitution principle

1528450
for-loop	loops
do you want the incrementor for finishing the for-loop to be in the body of loops

1528457
int	double
field length create your fields as large as you ll need them but don t go over - for instance if you have a number field and the value will never be over 1000 for the sake of argument then don t type it as a long int something smaller like int would be more appropriate or use a single instead of a double for decimal numbers etc

1528507
post	get
for some reason his simple form wasn t passing either post or get data through to his php script

1528580
getter	setter
use getter and setter to pass through references to your dependencies as mxml attributes and store them locally then inside this handler you will apply them

1528617
post	get
whatever you do make sure that it s submitted by post and not get

1528618
move	drag
i want the user to be able to hold the ctrl key down left-click anywhere on my form and drag it and have it move

1528648
maven	pom.xml
the problem is we use maven to do some filtering in one of the configuration xml files in the webapp faces-config.xml so it replaces properties within the xml file with properties from maven s pom.xml

1528649
gif	png
there are lots of jpg gif png etc

1528652
stdout	fflush
add a fflush stdout

1528657
stdout	fflush
call fflush stdout

1528676
filesystems	btrfs
unfortunately cutting out just parts of a file is not supported on windows although some experimental linux filesystems such as btrfs support it

1528678
postgresql	mysql
limit is very far from universal - out of major rdbms it s pretty much restricted to mysql and postgresql

1528689
width	height
adding and subtracting the half of width and height

1528725
nsurl	nsstring
you don t need to convert the nsurl into an nsstring before archiving

1528746

1529150
lisp	scheme
update i seem to recall that at least some lisp allow you to pretty-print a function as code eg scheme s pretty-print function

1529161
post	get
either provide a view where your win32 client can post to the django server and get a response that means good login or bad login

1529186
touchesbegan	touchesended
perhaps you could try either retaining the uitouch and uievent or forging copies using custom classes that have the same class signatures then re-send the touchesbegan and touchesended events after setting editable to yes

1529191
hide	show
the click function simply looks for all span tags in the paragraph toggles them visible the show function might be a better choice here actually and then hide the read more link

bash	tcsh
i m trying to set up directory completion in tcsh and or bash both are used at my site with a slight twist for a particular command foo i d like to have completion use a custom function to match the first -delimited term to an actual subtree node and then follow normal directory completion for any successive terms

1529251
bash	tcsh
i ve made several attempts of custom bash and tcsh completion to do this but the closest i ve gotten is a form of word completion where the user must treat the directory levels as separate words with spaces foo scene shot element workspace ...

1529251
bash	tcsh
fwiw here is what i ve got so far in tcsh first then bash

1529251
bash	tcsh
tcsh example note the function is actually a bash script

1529269
int	chars
execv accepts two parameters like so int execv const chars path chars const argv

1529273

1529281
activemq	rabbitmq
i saw apache activemq and rabbitmq but it seems a bit overkill for what i need to do

trace the retaincount of the settingobject object in settingsdetailviewcontroller debugger or nslog statements where you use it and after you release it in dealloc

1529352
expression-blend	silverlight
you can also use expression-blend to author silverlight applications but as long as you are comfortable writing xaml without a visual designer you might find visual studio a bit more mature from a developer standpoint

1529352
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you want to do post operations from within silverlight without using a web service framework like .net ria services or wcf you can use a webclient or httpwebrequest object

1529397
button	checkbox
if you check out the quirksmode event compatibility tables you ll see that ie has some issues with the change event in radio button and checkbox

1529397
extjs	mootools
to overcome this problem you should be using a javascript framework like jquery yui dojo mootools extjs or closure

1529397
onchange	onblur
also if you re unfamiliar with browser events entirely make sure you understand the difference between onchange and onblur

1529420
internationalization	localization

1529420
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the browsers they claim as supported at this very-high-bar level are as of dojo 1.3.2 ie 6 to 8 safari 3.1 to 4 firefox 2 to 3.5 google-chrome 1 to 2 core functionality including event handling also works on opera konqueror firefox 1.5 ...

1529496
getter	setter
in python you can define a object having __getattr__ self key method to handle all unknown attributes to be solvable in programmatic manner but in javascript you can only define getter and setter for pre-defined attributes

1529572
width	height
i have described the pane height and width in

1529588
subclass	abstract-class
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass

1529627
inline	inlining
the jit compiler does do inlining of code but the fact that the c# compiler generates lambdas as delegate instances means that it is unlikely that the jitter can reasonably inline this code

1529632
hide	show
i expect that i will show the red view and then immediately hide it with some animation

1529632
put	get
another point is if i put this code in applicationdidfinishlaunching the red view does not appear at all and all logs get null

1529643
fseek	ftell
i ve tried using ftell and fseek and i had the same issue

1529704

firstly make sure you have set the datakey property on your gridview a to be the id property of the underlying object or whatever you want to pass through to objectdatasource b s select method

1529738
gridview	objectdatasource
this will pass on the selected rows datakey from gridview a to the method linked to objectdatasource b

1529795
mockups	balsamiq
i have used balsamiq for website mockups but i am creating a spec that needs to be close to exact - balsamiq is great for rougher mockups is there anything you would recommend

but this code give portrait even if i select landscape from setup

1530002
pop-up	dialog
this installation pop-up with dialog boxes to choose the setup type as resintall or remove and proceeds on by clicking on next to finish the set up

1530048
move	drag
if you want the dialog box to move when they click and drag you have to set the position of that div based on the mouse position which can get pretty jerky quick

1530064
post	get
when i click on the next link i get value of the hash and then post it to the another backend php script using jquery .get api and also set the new hash value for that link

1530075
nunit	mstest
read this site if you are running your os x64 bit and are using mstest 32bit it will fail use nunit works

1530141
post	get
request.getparameter doesn t distinguish between get nor post variables so if you have a parameter from the url you can get it with the same method

1530198
uiview	subviews
i m new to iphone development and i m trying to do a flip animation between a uiview and another uiview containing a regular uiview and a uiscrollview the scroll view in turn has several uiview as subviews

1530198
uiview	subviews
it is animating fine but the problem is that it will sometimes every third time perhaps start the animation with one of the subviews of the scroll view instead of starting the animation with the original uiview overlayview in the code below

1530240
uitableview	uipickerview
i want to find the best way to fit both a uipickerview and a uitableview on the same screen view

1530297
hide	show
since you know you are going to reuse them create them only once and then show or hide them

1530299
width	height
we can create as small image as possible 1 pixel width and 400 pixels high or we can create a larger image with 400 pixels height

1530331
google-chrome	safari
however i ve got this featured news section on my site which on mouse hover slides more information into place and this section doesn t perform very well in any browser except safari and probably google-chrome too then.

1530331
mouseover	mouseout
the reason for this i believe is that it s doing quite some dom traversing and calculations on every mouseover mouseout event before animating

1530347
folder	directory
if you want to do something with a directory folder you use system.io.directory but if you want to display a dialog for browsing one you use folderbrowserdialog

1530347
folder	directory
why is one named directory and the other folder

1530364
g++	gcc
even if you are not linux guy as you said you can still use the gcc g++ compiler to compile your cpp code with a single line on windows

1530461
awt	swing
after googling out i found some links but all those are talking about gui events in awt and swing

1530486

if this option is turned on and anonymous access is denied iis will check the supplied credentials against the active directory and the ntfs filesystems privileges of the requested resources

1530581
free	malloc
i don t spread error prone code for handling memory allocations with malloc and free all over my codebase

1530581
free	malloc
i have exactly one single location in my code where malloc and free are called

1530581
free	malloc
additionally it enables anything with the need to modify only one location beginning with simple debugging checks like counting the successful calls to malloc and free and verify at program termination that both numbers are equal up to all kinds of extended security checkings

1530591
implements	extends
beans and gui events propagate an object which extends java.util.eventobject to listeners which implements a sub-interface of eventlistener

memcached	apc
it is currenty on vps with plesk 8 centos 5 apache 2 php 5.2.6 mysql 5.0.45 memcached apc

1530642
decltype	auto
i don t think type_of is going to help either if it is the same as auto and decltype in c++0x

1530670
keydown	keyup
i think this might be more related to the fact that in keydown you open your menu and keyup gets passed to the menu then instead

1530685
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
your solutions must be cross-browser ie 6+ firefox safari opera google-chrome

1530686
entity-relationship	diagram
it has 3 volumes and not only shows but also explains the usual use cases for entity-relationship diagram

1530722
post	get
how do i get both post and topic count in just one query

1530745
post	get
i also understand how you could write views that extracted just the comments from all your post documents to get them into comment models same with users and tags

1530772
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox safari but not ie

1530825
filtering	grouping
there is a filtering data button on the select field or grouping dialog

i m now trying to look for onclick onmouseover etc

1530879
put	get
also put the dropdown in a form method of get and action of the controller action url

1530949
salt	md5
i originally used md5 without salt then switched to md5salt+md5 then to sha1salt+sha1 and now i ve moved over to sha512salt+sha512

1530949
hash	md5
reason for md5 hash - obvious

1530965
stdout	stderr
plus you have full control over stdin stdout and stderr of executed program - including attaching callbacks to them

1530977
salt	md5
going from unsalted to salt md5 passwords

1530977
hash	salt
non-random salt for password hash

1530998
nsmutablestring	nsstring
as far as i can tell there are no nsstring or nsmutablestring methods to directly set an element of the string array

1530998
nsmutablestring	nsstring
until i find an answer and can do this with nsmutablestring i am going to use an unsigned char array and create an nsstring using the unsigned char araay

1531002
daemons	systemd
the way to write a mac os x daemons is very much like the way you would approach it on a regular unix systemd

1531002
daemons	launchd
there is some mac specific information on daemons to consider mainly regarding integrating with launchd

1531011
int	double
i did get a different error when i tried nullable int or double

1531018
dictionary	map
then use a string - delegate dictionary to map the instruction name to creation of a command

1531054
lisp	scheme
in clojure just like in lisp scheme etc everything is an expression and an expression is either an atom or a list

1531056
hide	show
in html-mode you can use m-x sgml-tags-invisible to hide show tags

the code you listed does an http get and a post with a whole ton of conversions going on in there

1531125
put	get
so could someone please explain to me if the event really exists in asp.net mvc where do i get it inherit or what from where and where do i put it

1531132
accessor	properties
first drop the semicolons next start using properties access instead of accessor methods next you will collapse properties into the shorthand constructor format

1531158
getter	setter
the __get function has a well-defined function header so you won t be able to create getter that return a reference for example which is really great when working with arrays - without the reference you would need to call the setter again.

1531178
accessor	properties
also i would use those accessor methods when setting properties from inside the class it means a bit more code yes -- but it also means going through the specific code like code to check some stuff they contain

1531180
accessor	properties
then set a breakpoint in the resource.culture properties accessor and the foo properties accessor and startup the debugger

1531254
int	boolean
if you require mxn boolean values to be uniquely encoded in an int you require 2 m n values

1531288
qpushbutton	qobject
2 another approach is to do void qpushbutton installeventfilter qobject filterobj on push button instance filterobj will implement custom focus events handling

1531401
caliburn	prism
there is also prism and the caliburn project

1531401
csla	prism
i ll update the thread once i ve had a good look at both prism and csla

1531458
client-side	server-side
in response to the page lifecycle page methods do not go through the server-side page lifecycle there is also a client-side page lifecycle too

1531559
postgresql	mysql
if you want to get an idea how some of the built-in functions are implemented you can look at the open-source databases source code such as mysql or postgresql

1531628
put	get
by making the field final you also get the added bonus that once the field has been set to a proper value subclasses can t put bogus stuff there except for using reflection etc but then all bets are off

1531628
implements	extends
edit also as pointed out by more attentive posters you don t implements classes you extends them

1531663
folder	directory
when the first windows 1.0 ui came along several years later said directory were represented by a folder icon in the ms-dos executive which is what the windows explorer was originally known as more or less

1531663
folder	directory
hence folder is a user-friendly metaphor for the more technical sounding directory

1531685
getter	setter
just use a interface with setter getter or the constructor variant from gustafc

1531687
wordpress	joomla
i have a website which i developed in joomla and a blog in wordpress

1531698
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended
i thought that by overriding touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent in this way should work but it doesn t

1531778
uitableview	uipickerview	uiview	subviews
if you just have a uiview with a uitableview and a uipickerview as two subviews resiszing the uitableview should be trivial and obvious

1531786
gridview	linqdatasource
when i used sql server profiler i noticed when i would get a list of all records using a linqdatasource to bind to a gridview i would see two queries being executed

1531797
mp3	wmv
the browser displays media files with wmp so i do not understand why wmv will not play but mp3 mpg work fine which are also played in wmp

1531817
getter	setter
though one of the lovely things about as3 is that because of how getter and setter are handled you can switch from public fields to accessor-controlled private fields without needing to make any changes to code that uses this object

1531819
min	max
select firsta min a lastb max b min_mincolumn min mincolumn max_maxcolumn max maxcolumn sum_n sum n

the problem i have now is that when you go over the show element it hide you cant move your mouse in to the dropdown that was created

1531978
yslow	pagespeed
if it s web it would be wise to note your page size and performance using firebug + yslow and or pagespeed

i read all the comments about the gui but anyway wxwidgets lets developers create applications for win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince and more using one codebase .

1532002
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
you can also use oct to translate binary octal or hex strings to numbers based on the prefix

1532010
jboss	weblogic
i know this can be done in jboss and later versions of weblogic but i wasn t sure if it s possible in 8.x

1532049
rss	feed
so the data can be coming from a db rss feed twitter api etc and can be presented in an rss feed normal xhtml an mobile version etc

1532165
pascal	delphi
if you confirm that the dll really uses the pascal calling convention then specifying it in delphi is as simple as changing the stdcall directive on your function declaration to pascal

1532264
hide	show
my requirement is to show the edit link when user place cursor over the entire master div divitemholder and hide it when he moves out

1532282

is there any javascript running on the button s client side onclick onmousedown onmouseup

1532404
free	strdup
use strdup to copy the returned by c_str into a remember to free it afterwards

1532404
free	strdup
note that strdup and free are c not c++ functions and you d be better off using methods of std string instead

1532436
hide	show
it works perfectly hide the and show it when i click on the

1532447
translation	localization
hi i am writing a small utility too using silverlight 3 and wcf for our localization team to check and correct the translation stored in .net resource files .resx

1532493
punctuation	words
you ll really have to write your own analyzer i should think since whether or not some sequence of words is a phrase is dependent on cues such as punctuation that are not available after tokenization

1532513
xlsx	xlsm
using the xlsx open xml file format will be safer than using xls or xlsm since xlsx workbooks cannot contain macros

1532518
disk	ram
if they want their stuff in memory again a weird customer put the csvs on to a ram disk

1532544
stdout	stderr
but this solution leaves stderr going only to the screen and i want stderr go to both the screen and also to the same log file that stdout is being logged to

1532597
margin	height
if it s not taking up the full height have you checked for excess margin or padding

1532633
verilog	vhdl
i d like to challenge you to write a cpu ram in vhdl verilog and see how stuff really works even when really simplified

1532675
stdout	stderr
so you want stderr to behave like stdout going to both the screen and the same log file

1532688
hide	show
it s easier just to hide and show as required

1532697
min	max
i first looked into doing this with gdi+ but it gives me errors telling me min max haven t been defined defining them just brings more problems i then looked into libpng s c++ bindings png++ and couldn t get the examples to compile

1532704
tcplistener	tcpclient
hey so i m trying to build a simple lan game using sockets not tcpclient or tcplistener and yes i know they are the same thing

1532704
post	get
i m going to be as straightforward as possible so i will post some code snippets so you can get the general idea

1532718
put	get	disk	ram
make note of the system requirements and i understand 8gb of ram is required for a production server - you may be able to get away with less if you can put up with disk thrashing.

1532764
hash	md5
you cannot possibly use more than one core to calculate md5 hash of a large file because of the very nature of md5 it expects a message to be broken up in chunks and fed into hashing function in strict sequence

1532777
min	max
defining min and max as follows

1532779
hash	md5
however you can md5 the file in sections in parallel and the take an md5 of the list of hash

1532779
hash	md5
also a hash such as sha256 should be selected rather than md5 for new projects

1532829
nhibernate	bltoolkit
check out nhibernate or bltoolkit

1532861
implements	extends
in your sample you are implements that list not extends it

1532864
ienumerable	ienumerator
along with the already suggested methods of using a foreach loop i thought i d also mention that any object that implements ienumerable also provides an ienumerator interface via the getenumerator method

1532871
minimum	max
you may want to impose a minimum length options like at least one number and one special character but no max limit

1532872
hide	show
you should be able to use the iteminserting event of the listview to hide or show the add to cart link button

1532885
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
while it s running smooth on firefox safari and google-chrome ie blocks the script execution

1532889
min	max
o n pass to find min max allocate

1532891
datediff	difference
because you end up with having to fix logic to add thresholds when datediff s start to come out with thousands of months difference etc

1532927
onfocus	onblur
you would have to use the javascript events onfocus and onblur and set a variable of some sort

1532940
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
edit in this example the catch block handles either argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception and places the exception instance in a variable of type argumentexception called e

1532950
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 does not display the border-bottom but firefox and google-chrome does

1532997

i think it doesn t support png but bmp jpeg and animated gif

1533023
min	max
it becomes more suitable for proper performance testing if you use the clear snapshot command after the code you re interested in has been jited and if you use the mechanism of producing files you can parse them yourself to gain a min max average output

1533042
interpreted-language	compiled-language
interpreted-language and it seems as though it would be in my interests to use a compiled-language to serve up the site instead of an interpreted-language

1533049
puts	gets
include gets the contents of a file and puts it in the place you inserted the include statement

1533083
joomla	concrete
i would never build a new website this way but i was looking for concrete points to convince my friend that using joomla and asp.net together isn t a good idea

1533084
interpreted-language	compiled-language
that doesn t necessarily mean that your site is going to 100 run faster on a compiled-language vs an interpreted-language

1533097
int	double	int	boolean
using the above one can test for individual optional parameters such as boolean double int ranges or any variant via the optionalboolean optionaldouble optionalinteger optionalrange and optionalvariant functions

1533097
int	double
none of the above failed in my testing unless passing in an obviously incompatible argument type such as passing in a string into an int or double parameter passing a numeric value into a range parameter or the like

1533097
int	double
they can hold int values such as 0 1 2 -1 etc. of course but these are actually typed as double when held by the cell

1533097
int	double
to prove this you can assign an int to the cell.value but it will be stored as a double -- if you check the data type held by the cell.value via typename or .gettype .tostring it will return double

1533114
xslt	xquery
saxon xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 3.0

1533114
xslt	xquery
xmlprime xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 2.0

1533142
width	height
the left one has a border left set to 4px solid red a width of 0p x and a height equal to the the height of the selected dom element

1533142
width	height
the top one has a border top set to 4px solid red a height of 0px and a width equal to the the width of the selected dom element

1533142
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so here is how it looks like in firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1533142
width	height
and anyway i used jquery to get the width and height which is supposed to prevent this kind of problem

1533163
google-chrome	firefox
what it seems like to me is that firefox waits for an entire page response before making any new requests to the resources required by the page while ie and google-chrome function by starting a new request the second it is encountered

1533177
mockups	prototyping
however if you do want to test out mockups of your application interface i recommend looking at briefs a new framework for prototyping iphone applications

1533193
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	width	height
i need cross-browser compatible javascript code that will return me the height and width of the current document area in all three browsers ie firefox webkit google-chrome safari

1533193
width	height
i don t need the entire window size as it is on the desktop but the height and width of the document as it pertains to css layout

1533244
firefox	safari
firefox works correctly to begin with same with safari

1533286
cassini	iis
problem was with hosting wcf services.i had hosted them on cassini web server which ships with vs2008 instead of iis.cassini does not allow streaming over http.so just using iis to host wcf services resolved this issue

1533316
width	height
as far as i ve seen you always have to set the height width of the container that you want to overflow so you need to set them

1533316
width	height
to deal with the resolution i would suggest you to add a jquery script at the onready event that dynamically would fix the height and width making the overflow work

1533330
namenode	hdfs
right now i have been copying the data onto the namenode and using hdfs s put command to ingest it into the cluster

1533408
mouse	keyboard
alternatively if the user selects a value from the autocomplete drop-down either via keyboard or mouse then the text field s value is set to the autocomplete selection and the form is submitted as if the search button was clicked

1533449
unicode	ucs
utf-8 8-bit ucs unicode transformation format is a variable-length character encoding for unicode

1533456
config	ini
external config static data ini style xml yaml database etc read by a config class of some sort

1533461
hex	binary
another tricky part is how the different dbms prefer to encode things like binary data blob values - base64 hex ...and probably some others.

1533487
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know why it is working in firefox but ie and google-chrome are certainly not doing anything illegal by requesting the resources early

1533501
rss	feed
skygrid for example gives live news feed and if the news is good or bad but it s all in flash and they don t seems to provide any rss other than their twitter

1533547
int	chars
then you affect your copy pointer to an int which has the value 0 the chars 0

1533586
ant	maven
if you are using maven or ant both offer the ability to do filtering of tokens in resource files

1533618
google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in firefox google-chrome internet explorer 8 but not in ie 6 or ie7

1533619
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
supported browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome

1533639
width	height
i am creating thumbnails of fixed height and width from my php script using the following function

1533643
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
supported browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome

1533701
min	max
constraints min 0 max 100000 places 0

1533723
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
my thinking right now is that most if not all of the major browsers firefox safari ie opera will cache a js file the first time it is used and then on subsequent script tags the browser will use the cached copy if available and if it hasn t expired

1533725
int	double	int	chars
the default assignment operator will behave well with plain old data int double chars short as well user defined classes per their assignment operators

1533730
versioning	upgrade
running each upgrade script in sequence is required to get up to the current versioning of the schema

1533730
versioning	upgrade
one alternative is to require upgrading to each intermediate versioning in sequence forcing the user in this example to upgrade to 1.2.3 before 1.3.0

1533732
variance	kurtosis
thus the first four moments are respectively 1 variance skewness kurtosis

1533739
x86	64bit
if the servers are going to be 64bit then at the very least your staging testing servers should be even if your devs stick to x86

1533744
hash	md5
we found that the passwords are hash using the md5 algorithm

1533754
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5x google-chrome 4x include it only once

1533758
queue	fifo
a non-database solution could be to have the client make the request async and then push the request on a fifo queue to control the requests so that only one request at a time is getting evaluated

1533771
hash	md5
you could store either in the hash field itself md5 d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e or in another column which algorithm was used to create that hash

1533771
hash	md5
hopefully passwords eventually expire and over time all of the md5 hash will be phased out

1533799
ubuntu	linux
when i try to use luainterface on mono on linux using mono 2.0 on ubuntu 9.04 i get the following exception

1533806
hash	md5
-- in the login process where you verify a user s entered password temporarily store the user s submitted password in memory no security issue here as it is already in memory somewhere and do the usual md5 hash compare with the stored hash

1533824
width	height
i got the width and height of the iframes document and then resized the iframe to fit the document without scroll bars then i resized the yui panel to contain the iframe correctly

1533905
strdup	malloc
but to do what you want copy a string and allocate necessary space it will be more simple and more efficient to use strdup that does exactly that a malloc and a strcopy

1533905
free	strdup	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc	strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc
you should also not forget to free space you allocated yourself using malloc calloc strdup or any other allocation function

1533908
directx	gdi
also wpf uses directx to draw it s graphics now gdi or gdi+ which also gives it a lot more flexibility to draw advanced 2d graphics or even 3d graphics

1533908
directx	gdi
also since it sits on top of directx the gpu is used to draw all the graphics instead of the cpu like gdi so in a way you re using less processing power from the cpu

1533933
pop-up	dialog
if allowed then execute the button as normal if not then pop-up a modal dialog saying he is not allowed to create a new project

1533955
jobs	cron
it s quite ordinary to use php for administrative tasks cron jobs etc. which have no ui at all

1534088
post	get
the first step to understanding the request response idiom is to think of the request as a specifically-formatted defined by cgi - that is it s a get or post html action set of command line parameters and the response as specifically-formatted output html that gets sent not to stdout but across the wire to some browser

1534098
google-chrome	firefox
actual behaviour in firefox google-chrome the lastindex property seems to persist through multiple regexp creations

1534098
google-chrome	firefox
note this weirdness appears to happen in firefox 3 and google-chrome 2 but curiously not ie

1534130
teamcity	ncover
ultimately i m aiming for having a new ncover coverage report the summary one at least in my teamcity build project

1534141
opera	firefox
in firefox opera it only fires the mouseout-function when leaving the div

1534186
nunit	mstest
afaik the test class attributes for mstest are identical to that of nunit

1534189
hash	salt
a random salt string chosen by the server when it first computes and stores the password hash

1534189
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if your database indicates they are using the old algorithm with no salt first verify the password the old way by checking that the md5 hash of the password matches

1534189
hash	salt
if the password was verified have the server choose a random salt string compute the sha256 hash of the salt+password and replace the password table entry with a new one specifiy the new algorithm salt and hash

1534195
width	height
if you compare a 1680 x 1050 monitor to a 1600 x 1200 monitor you get 80 extra pixels of width but 150 fewer pixels of height

1534199
min	max
for things like sum avg min max as well as non-numeric functions like concat there are simple o n algorithms and i suspect those are used

1534205
put	get
i don t see the problem really - i get a full size keyboard on my laptops and enough space to put two editors side by side on my desktops

1534221
profiler	visualvm
i ve used the net beans profiler which uses the same underpinnings as visualvm

1534234
ftp	telnet
telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin

1534284
ant	maven
to answer your question you can either solve this with maven apparently or ant + ivy

1534286
inherited	properties
however when you do a write the interpreter doesn t actually care about the inherited properties

1534290
int	double
it works for double int and whatever other numbers you want to use

1534338
int	double
this is often used to declare a 2d array in which case each int pointer is an array and the double pointer is an array of arrays

1534370
children	parent
i have a ul li a that are children of parent ul navigation and li

1534377
prepare	execute
i d like to use prepare statements because it will be execute in a loop

1534407
super	self
using super ext self .__init__ resources also does the same thing

1534424
altera	xilinx
this is for the same reason that even the best fpga-based cpus xilinx s microblaze altera s nios are toys compared even to low-end embedded arm cores

1534436
powerpc	i386
i would like to build an app with a universal binary containing powerpc i386 and x86-64

1534445
put	get
well if you put your engine on the web for free for a few days and advertise a little you will probably get at least a couple dozen tries

1534455
pull	push
i realize i should probably push the vars into an array hash but i am really a beginner here and i would need further instruction on how to do that and how to pull them back out

1534514
post	get
is it expecting a post request with variables or is it expecting a get request to a url that includes the article id

1534525
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox and google-chrome this is no problem however ie throws an object not found error and does not work

1534592
versioning	upgrade
the scripts to create the current database are stored in tfs along with the source code and then dbghost is used to generate a delta script to upgrade an environment to the current versioning

1534602
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade tool looks for the latest entry then applies each upgrade script one-by-one and finally the db is at the latest versioning

1534626
std	ostream
to reproduce this bug write 1234 to std ostream with imbued ru_ru.utf-8 locale

1534626
put	get
edit3 according to the latest notes about c++0x i can see that std time_get get -- similar to strptime and opposite of std time_put put

1534675
pinax	django-notification
an example would be pinax s django-notification emit_notices script

1534743
csv	tsv
it accepts every format that the roo library supports including .xls .xlsx .ods and text-based formats like csv and tsv

1534743
csv	tsv
csv tsv is easy and fast

1534743
xlsx	ods	xls	ods
masses how might i try to estimate the number of rows an xls xlsx or ods file contains using only ruby and or standard unix programs

1534752
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to pass back mouse keyboard events

1534757
children	parent
so we have 1 root 2 parent and 3 children

1534769
uitableview	uisearchbar
actually if you removed the uisearchbar from the uitableview everything would have fit and it wouldn t need to scroll

1534793
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove
it is best to use jquery as it also offers mouseover mouseout and mousemove function which you can easily attach to your image s

1534821
gradle	ivy
on top of these dependency programming features gradle adds project and jar dependency features by intergration with ivy

1534834
erd	diagram
specifically i need to draw erd and dependency diagram

1534849
awt	swing	swt	swing
since swt is built to be a fairly thin wrapper around native widgets it may be easier to work with than swing awt for your particular task

1534856
gtk	clutter	gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	clutter	gdk	clutter	cairo	gdk	cairo
some of the components i work on that are that way include x windows glib gobject gdk gtk cairo pango and clutter

1534887
direct3d	directx
as kevin suggested opengl and direct3d directx are the industry standard libraries - directx if you re target platform is windows-only opengl otherwise

1534950
floating-point	integer
there s no such thing as a floating-point integer

1534952
stdout	stderr
you can even map stdout or stderr to a scalar

1535037
apache	lighttpd
one final note - maybe you re just better off installing cygwin plus the apache or lighttpd package

1535050
hide	show
the main thing is i want to create a window once and then show and hide it as necessary

1535077
visualvm	btrace
using jstack useful in case of deadlocks or the btrace visualvm plugin could also do the trick

1535080
implements	extends
if things need to be done differently you should make a couple of different data access classes which implements the same interface and maybe share common code in an abstract class they both extends

1535084
int	chars
here s a starting point the a chars as an int has the value 65

1535088
qsqlquery	qsqldatabase
we can t see what you createtable does the code that you have never calls db.open most of the qt database and sql calls return bool for success and there is a lasterror function for both the qsqldatabase and the qsqlquery calls

1535102
gif	png
imagescience resizes gif to png as it can t handle gif very well

1535110
int	double
first off if your function is to take a grade as an int and return a letter grade why does it have a return type of double

1535137
sequence	permutation
having identified the permutation a precalculated swap rotation sequence can be applied

1535137
sequence	permutation
the second problem is designing the swap rotation sequence for each of the 120 possible permutation and that s probably a dynamic programming thing

1535177
put	get
but where would i put this command and how do i get the version number for the destination

1535219
testcase	fixture
in your tests.py file you can load the fixture on the django testcase class as so

1535236
folder	directory
i check out trunk into e dev projects mywebsite workspace and that directory is also my eclipse workspace but i excluded the .metadata folder from subversion and only check in the projects

1535237
nunit	mstest
doing a bit more digging i came across this comparison of mstest and nunit

1535237
nunit	mstest
i have never used nunit only mstest for c# and junit for java so i am kind of biased in that respect

1535237
nunit	mstest
unless you have a particular reason to take the nunit testdriven.net approach like you need a certain feature or you just prefer that way of setting up tests and trying to integrate it back into vs then i don t see any reason not to just use mstest which works right out of the box

1535245
post	get
in my web site i query my blogger account and get blog post to display on my web site

1535252
int	chars
i know in c you can use do-while for single int and chars but i was wondering if it is possible to use the same do-while feature for whole groups of numbers

1535281
nunit	mstest
if and when you outgrow mstest then you should look at nunit or the more modern xunit

1535294
for-loop	loops
in your second loops you re printing out the same char for every record in your map note there is only 1 b c map does not allow dups which has been set to empty string either within the 1st loops or between that and your for-loop

1535318
int	chars
bufferedreader.read chars int int

1535318
int	chars
string.string chars int int

1535381
nunit	moq
nunit has something bundled for mocks but i d definitely point you to moq

1535381
nunit	mstest
on the nunit v mstest line i m not fit to comment

1535415
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
draw one 256x256 image of a circle and scale it down with a batch tool like imagemagick graphicsmagick irfan-view or some-such to all the sizes you need

1535538
mouseup	mousedown
i tried binding the blur to mousedown and mouseup but the flash persists

1535572
hide	show
show on click but hide it after a couple of seconds

1535582
hide	fadeout
if i change fadeout to hide it works

1535585
implements	extends
you will need to extends the actionfilterattribute class and implements the onactionexecuting method in your case

1535601
floating-point	integer
in python 3 they made the operator do a floating-point division and added the operator to do integer division quotient without remainder

1535619
firefox	safari
firefox and iphone safari use the service as well and they have their own implementations

1535625
firefox	safari
i have tested on safari and firefox on the mac and firefox internet explorer on pc

1535672
ubuntu	linux
when run on linux ubuntu hardy i get the following output

1535681
pop-up	dialog
i have an iframe that can appear in a jquery modal dialog a pop-up window or just as part of a page

1535681
pop-up	dialog
the height of the content of this iframe can change as elements appear and disappear and i need the containing iframe along with the modal dialog or pop-up window where applicable to change height as necessary to be just right for the size of the content

1535692
folder	directory
when i compile the project there is another directory in the war folder called wait for it... anothergwtapp

1535699
draggable	droppable
i have a page with draggable droppable elements that once dropped need to calculate their left position and width in regards to other draggable that they may be touching

1535713
emacs	aquamacs
you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build

1535718
luabind	tolua++
you may want to look at tolua++ or luabind for c++ integration

1535718
luabind	tolua++
we don t actually use luabind or tolua++ yet mostly just a lack of time to test and integrate them but a few things we ve learned

1535718
boost	allocator
if you re on a memory budget consider using lua_setallocf to change allocator behavior -- constrain it to its own area of memory to prevent fragmentation and take advantage of a more efficient small object allocator perhaps boost pool to reduce overhead other ideas in an earlier answer

1535726
mouse	keyboard
this is handy when you want to catch events that could occur in a component s children such as mouse clicks or keyboard clicks

1535726
addeventlistener	preventdefault
if you want to do your own default processing call addeventlistener with priority eventpriority.default_handler...then other listeners can be created that if they call preventdefault can enable you to not do the functionality you want by checking isdefaultprevented

1535729
maven	pom.xml
however once i do mvn compile maven complains that there is no pom.xml file in the repository and attempts to download it but can t cause it is not published at any remote repository

1535729
maven	pom.xml	put	get
so how do i get maven to generate a pom.xml file for that jar and put it in my local repository

1535751
prng	random
use a random number generator wikipedia prng page with constraints

1535752
google-chrome	firefox
is there any firefox jslib equivalent in google-chrome or how we can use other languages in google-chrome extension

1535830
maven	pom.xml	maven-install-plugin	pom.xml
however using maven 2.0.9 with the maven-install-plugin version 2.2 both versions are slightly out of date it does not generate a pom.xml

1535848
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
the solution to this error is to use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout

1535850
mp4	h.264
short answer h.264 mpeg mp4

1535861
mousemove	mousedown
put a panel or some other control in the corner using the mousedown and mousemove events of the panel adjust the forms size appropriately

1535861
mousemove	mousedown
in mousedown i would record the coordinates then in the mousemove you can calculate the difference from the original position to adjust the forms size

1535864
post	put
to do this in the formbackingobject method which gets called again after a post submit put a copy of the value in the request object

1535869
stringstream	fstream
the attempted approach was to parse in the first few lines to a string perform a search-and-replace create stringstream and concatenate the rest of the fstream to the stringstream using a sequenceinputstream

1535890
for-loop	while-loop
replace the for-loop with a while-loop

1535921
width	height
the easy way would be to do as benpearce said and put a panel in the corner and adjust the form size using width height

1535944
imperative	declarative
replacing scriptlets with custom tags eliminates the awkward confusion of imperative java and declarative markup that used to be common in jsps

1535953
int	chars
chars and int primitive data types

1535957
post	put
put the binding event of grid in to not post back

1536018
memcpy	memset
memset sets all of the bytes in the specified buffer to the same value memcpy copies a sequence of bytes from another place to the buffer

1536023
memcpy	memmove
perhaps you d be interested in the difference between memcpy and memmove

1536038
keydown	mousedown
change keydown to mousedown

1536067
put	get
to put it differently i need to get rid of edges in such a way that after removing them the graph will still be strongly connected and of least cost for the sum of edges

1536071
google-chrome	firefox
your guess about an iframe was correct there s no better way to do it as of firefox 3.5 parsing html from google-chrome on mdc

1536102
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
if you know about the threads class by instanceof... you can obtain the runnable from it and create a new thread in the terminating threads group and start it from the uncaughtexceptionhandler

1536115
move	drag
you ll have to implement the logic yourself to figure out where to move the icons based on the geometry of your grid and the progress of the drag operation

1536139
children	parent
for example rather than have the children as being contained inside the parent you could flatten things out

1536195
width	height
in your code you zoom the image by increasing the width and the height of the image

1536259
post	get
i believe that many people get the impression that you are talking about http post after a form submission as opposed to http gets

1536292
folder	directory
i can of course manually distribute them in my application folder directory but is there a better strategy

1536304
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
also in the code you ve got you have touchesbegan withevent but then you are forwarding to super touchesmoved withevent instead of touchesbegan withevent

1536362
post	get
hi i have a php srcript that receives get data and i want to redirect the data from get to another page in wordpress using post

1536379
post	get
also you should use the prg post redirect get pattern to make sure that the credit card numbers aren t submitted twice

1536379
post	get
after the post don t just render a different view send a redirect so their browser does a get against another url - probably your confirmation page

1536384
switching	screens
i have added a second virtual device to test a different screens resolution qvga but now i wanna switching back to the first avd hvga again

1536400
gdal	proj
i ve an open source proj gdal that i want to compile and run as part of an ios app

1536403
emacs	textmate
of course if someone is a wiz with emacs or textmate etc. and doesn t generate warnings i have no problem with them continuing with their chosen platform

1536445
maven	m2e
using the launch with m2e has the drawback of not properly including all sources for debugging even though they are downloaded by maven see source lookup does not seem to work

1536472
put	get
it just comes down to a matter of syntax - basically where you put the to actually invoke this function and get your closure and whether you use the new keyword

1536479
children	parent
but later i saw the advantage that it makes linking parent and children fool proof

inherited	properties
as arsenmkrt said every control that inherited from windows.forms.control has the tag properties

1537243
ilist	iqueryable
as for what to return i would suggest starting by returning an ilist first instead of an iqueryable

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
sure use a uinavigationcontroller to push and pop your uitabbarcontroller instances

1538408
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when the user selects an item from a uitabbarcontroller push the next one into your uinavigationcontroller and when the back button is pressed it will pop it back out and reveal your previous uitabbarcontroller

1538420
calloc	malloc
when is it a good idea to use calloc over malloc or vice versa

1538427

1538972
countif	named
then refer to the named range in your countif formula

1539011
getter	setter
if the current value of the property as returned by the getter is same as the value to be set the setter is not called

1539011
getter	setter
note that the getter was called twice but the setter was called only once

1539051
int	chars
it can hold any of the scalar types such as int float and chars as well as pointers structures and object ids

1539116
put	get
the compiler will substitute the reference to the constant with the literal value so you get the same performance as if you put the value directly in the code

1539128
versioning	upgrade
did you install deploy the new versioning of y upgrade x s dependencies for the new y versioning and re-build x

1539170

basically i am looking for c# type of functionality where i can write my own custom getter setter and yet provide an additional code which i need to execute when the property is set

1539318
minimum	max
chds is a data scaling optional in which i m saying that the minimum value is 0 and the max value is 1000

1539335
getter	setter
you can still use dot-notation even if you write custom getter or setter provided of course that your getter and setter maintain the correct method naming for the property

1539336
trie	tree
good index data structures would include a trie aka digital tree or a ternary tree

1539336
trie	tree
i m going to assume a trie or a ternary tree

1539336
trie	tree
a ternary tree version follows similar principles to a trie but instead of multiple children per node you basically have next-letter binary tree logic built into the structure

1539346

tapestry 5 has a lot of out-of-the-box components and easy and clean integration with hibernate orm and struts middleware

1539567
mouseover	mouseout
so i m doing mouseover and mouseout

1539568
versioning	upgrade
so far i m reading this guide and it says the first thing you should do is upgrade cpan to the latest versioning

websphere	ibm
otherwise i would suggest looking into bea s aqualogic possibly rebranded under oracle ibm s websphere portal or one of the other portal vendors

1539592
min	max
with min max

1539595
inherited	properties
i have built-in a registry object properties container that i pass to appropriate objects that no longer need to inherited from an application base class

1539644
inherited	properties
you could dynamically composite another class even multiple classes - this is often used as a work around to multiple inherited to inject the methods properties of your parent class into the child class

1539678
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter
the mouseover and mouseout events are also fired when the mouseenter and leaves any child elements

1539678
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

1539699
ubuntu	debian
generally install build-essential it s in ubuntu so it should be also in debian and then do o conf init in cpan shell

1539725
boost	stl
if you re using a lot of files and a lot of templated code stl boost etc. then bulk or unity builds should cut down on build and link times

one possible solution is to hide all select boxes on the page when you show your tool-tip

1539805
cvs	svn
of course when svn got popular its architecture was miles ahead of cvs

put	get
update since you have all your data in a json object from the get go just do your looping through and put it all in a variable then just append that once you re finished

1539902
min	max
if you are using c# 3 or later you could use the linq extension methods there are min max and average methods and on list there is also a findindex method amongst others but i get the impression that you are learning programming and then it is sometimes a good idea to implement stuff that may be built into the framework just for the learning value

1539919
serializable	deserialization
what is the correct way to write unittests for things like serializable deserialization or writing and reading objects to from a repository

1539924

wicket is a very simple bare metal framework where all logic is in java rather than being split between java and jsp as in struts jsf or other such frameworks

1539990
addition	multiplication
quote ... we construct an equation involving only whole numbers and addition multiplication and exponentiation with the property that if one varies a parameter and asks whether the number of solutions is finite or infinite the answer to this question is indistinguishable from the result of independent tosses of a fair coin. in other words no algorithm can guess that result with probability 1 2

1540003
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
expected output ie8 ff3+ google-chrome 2+ safari 4 opera 9+

1540056
post	get
i m doing a simple ajax post request in jquery to another page on my site to get an xml document response

1540080
post	get
the standard - and cleanest - approach is to have the same url display the form when fetched with get and accept the data when fetched with post

1540111
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this is very smooth in firefox safari and opera

1540144
client-side	server-side
previously submitted datasets can be edited at which time i will need to repopulate the client-side javascript object which server-side data

1540268
firefox	safari
in case you are addressing modern browsers ie8+ firefox 2+ safari 3+ etc. i would also maybe recommend to consider the dom storage

1540271
irc	xmpp
more specifically is provides code and strategies to implement many protocols xmpp irc stomp amqp etc on top of what is known as a web socket - an object that abstracts away the many peculiarities of actually implementing comet

1540297
versioning	upgrade
last upgrade for old versioning

1540297
versioning	upgrade
with old versioning of delphi before delphi 2005 you have only before january 1 2010 to upgrade

1540323
getter	setter
unfortunately java does not support the uniform access principle other languages like c# scala and ruby do and therefore we are stuck with the ugly and cumbersome getter setter syntax

1540335
keydown	keyup
also binding it to keydown keyup doesn t prevent them from pasting large amount of text in the text area

1540368
domxpath	domdocument
you may have to go outside of domdocument - maybe convert to simplexml or domxpath

1540371
decltype	auto
c++ 0x doesn t call it typeof but has both auto and decltype that provide the same kinds of functionality

1540376
public	protected
something else either public package or protected calls them and you should be able to get full test coverage testing those things

when i try to export the report to excel im expecting that if the text length would exceed the width of the cell then the height of the cell would grow and the whole text would be shown

1544039
width	height
unfortunately the ssrs excel generator keeps the height as is and so only the part of the text which fits the width of the cell would be shown

1544094

i ve done this with the min or max aggregate functions which seems to work pretty well and is far simpler to write than most other methods i ve seen

1544401
put	get
you can get the list of arguments passed to your function regardless of what you put in your function signature by looking at the arguments local variable

1544408

1544547

if you have a multiple-producer single-consumer queue fifo you can easily make one lockfree using slist or a trivial lock free lifo stack

1544684
vim	emacs
however i personally recommend you to get familiar with vim emacs whatever editor you feel comfortable

1544684
vim	emacs
the best thing about emacs vim is that the flexibility to extend the functionality through plugin whatever you call it

1544990
pop-up	dialog
this is working so far for upgrades but for downgrades an extra unintuitive step is needed which is to relaunch the app manually and then see a windows installer dialog pop-up before it launches

1544990
versioning	upgrade
the end result is that regardless of upgrade or downgrade the current versioning needs to be fully uninstalled and the downloaded versioning fully installed so if there s another way to accomplish that that ll also be a good answer

1544992
public	protected
specify bindingflags.flattenhierarchy to include public and protected static members up the hierarchy

when the user successfully submit a form with the token delete the token from the session so any replay of that submission will fail

1545148
content-length	content-type
if the client indicates they can handle gzip encoding via the accept-encoding header or or similar then compress the file cache the compressed result somewhere write the correct headers for the response content-encoding gzip content-length n content-type text plain etc and then use sendfile 2 however that may or may not have been made available in your environment to copy the content from the open file descriptor into your response stream

1545148
apache	lighttpd
alternatively if you have apache lighttpd or similar acting as a transparent proxy in front of your server you could use the x-sendfile header which is exceedingly fast

1545150
erlang	lisp
my damage from java and lisp makes me reach for optimizing down excess consing but in erlang you dont risk that global full gc that kills every dream of real time properties

1545163
ant	maven
i would like to use doxia to generate some documentation but invoke it with ant and no maven is not an option

1545193
post	get
ensure that gets don t cause updates for instance don t post a new status update to a user s profile using query params on a get

1545235
std	ostream
std ostream has a member operator void

1545235
std	ostream
std ostream has a member operator int

1545235
std	ostream
for char the operator is not a member it is operator std ostream const char

1545235
int	chars
in the first example everything works ok because the member operator int is first called and then the reference returned can be passed to operator ostream const chars

1545278
width	height
just set windowstartuplocation height width left and top in xaml

1545309
folder	directory
i have the following sample test configuration that has hudson create a directory of empty folder

1545317
ogre	irrlicht
i think that c++ is the best choice i made some small games using free engines like ogre or irrlicht especially irrlicht because it s very easy to learn

1545326
post	get
the docs imply that it will always use get or post

1545336
post	get
get and post aren t the only allowed requests

1545344
min	max
back in my vb6 days i used libraries that let you find windows by thier title then from there you could pass messages to min max close activate etc but i havent done anything like that since moving to .net though i m sure the same types of libraries exist for .net

1545353
ggplot2	lattice
i m not an expert on this but it s my understanding that this is possible with lattice but not with ggplot2

1545354
children	parent
as far as i know there is no way to send back two completely different json objects that aren t children of a single parent json object and have jquery decode it for you using the .ajax method

1545395
bazaar	svn
bazaar and svn

1545396
linqdatasource	detailsview
try to bind your detailsview to linqdatasource and it will automatically update linq object

1545401
ant	maven
i don t know of any ant doxia task it really would be simpler to use maven or the invoke mvn ant task from within your ant build to invoke doxia.

1545438
queue	fifo
yes you would need to implement your own queueing mechanism if you want a fifo queue

1545463
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works great in firefox google-chrome safari but does not work in ie6

1545466
folder	directory
i ve fixed similar issues by copying missing files from the flex builder folder into the parallel eclipse plug-in directory

1545510
clang	llvm
i am developing opencl code on snow leopard and understand that the opencl just-in-time compilation is done by clang llvm

1545514
innodb	myisam
i had table locking issues so i am considering changing the table engines from myisam to innodb

1545515
centos	linux
i ve checked out the project onto a centos linux 5 workstation for another developer to work on

1545515
centos	linux
the app is running on centos linux 5 in production and it s working fine there.

1545520
ready	each
at work i m ready to setup each system individually but for my private development at home i d like to have something like devware - a development environment virtual appliance unfortunately i didn t find a download link where everything is already installed and functional

1545533
stdout	stderr
this all started when after code in question was directing its stdout stderr to a file

1545548

1545585
postgresql	mysql
for later either mysql or postgresql i don t do either one professionally so can t recommend one

1545598
postgresql	mysql
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

1545608
maven	m2e
maven integration m2e also has some mylyn connectors

1545608
cobertura	eclemma
code coverage eclemma i find the cobertura plugin doesn t work too well myself

1545619
stdout	stderr
in order to accomplish this i create a separate pipe for stdout and stderr and use them in the startupinfo structure when calling createprocess

1545619
stdout	stderr
i then launch a separate thread for each stdout stderr handle that reads from the pipe and logs the output to a window

1545619
stdout	stderr
the problem i am having is that if the child process logs to stderr and stdout in quick succession my app will sometimes display the output in the incorrect order

1545619
stdout	stderr
is it possible to capture stdout and stderr in the original order they were written to while being able to distinguish between the two

1545730
submit	submission
i m building an asp.net website and i m puzzled with the behavior of one page i ve got a long form and a submit button i ve got the piece of javascript below in the page to handle scrolling the page back up upon submission the form the first time i click the submit button it works all the sequent clicks don t work at all any idea why

1545757
public	protected
the get and set can have different access restrictions public get protected set

1545793
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
i m using the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse objects in the system.net namespace to issue a list command

1545831
firefox	safari
well then something that acts though a web browser firefox or safari i m on mac

1545845
inherited	properties
but i don t want to copy paste the main controltemplate and change the color there instead i want to inherited from that like with the basedon properties in style and change the color in the inherited controltemplate

1545907
crossover	mutation
you should check genetic algorithm solution of the tsp avoiding special crossover and mutation by gokturk ucoluk

1545907
sequence	permutation
the key insight is to represent the permutation as its inversion sequence for each element i store in how many elements larger than i are to the left of i in the permutation

1545941
post	get
to me this just sounds like a post or get request to the url of the login page could do the job.with the proper parameters username and password depending on the form input names used on the page set in the request the result will be the html of the page that you can then parse as you please

1545981
lxml	beautifulsoup
python has several modules you might choose from including lxml beautifulsoup and htmlparser

1546015
stdout	stderr
if you re looking for a permanent solution your best bet is probably to redirect stdout and stderr to a file when launching the program

1546019
union	distinct
union will give you all distinct results as where union all will give you results combined from the sets

1546023
helpers	actioncontroller
link_to calls the url_for helpers which calls actioncontroller url_for

1546035
disk	ram
1 build a ram disk

1546037
crypto++	botan	botan	ntl
ones in c++ i know of include the number theory packages lidia and ntl and the bigint packages used for cryptographic code in crypto++ and botan

1546037
division	modulo
of course doing this by hand is easier if you don t actually need all the arithmetic operations division and modulo in particular are rather tricky

1546044
post	get
i ll come up with a slimmed down example to post but i m running out the door now and will have to get to this later this evening

1546089
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have no trouble displaying the pages although i can t see the parts i want when i view page source

1546092
post	get
as sab pointed out get has a very small maximum size you must post the file and to do this you must use -d rather than -f

1546104
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are only working because you have javascript enabled - try disabling it and you ll get a mostly empty page

1546107
g++	gcc
gnu gcc recognises all of the following as c++ files and will use c++ compilation regardless of whether you invoke it through gcc or g++ .c .cc .cpp .cpp .c++ .cp or .cxx

1546110
width	height
if at a given height there only needed to be one column to fit all of the items the width of the listbox should be the size of the width of the items

1546110
width	height
or at a given height there needs to be four column s it would need to be size to four times the width of the items

1546110
width	height
finally say at a given height there needs to be more column s than the maximum allowed width of the listbox it would need to calculate how wide it should be so that the items in the column s that would not be able to fit were not truncated but just not shown until the user scrolled to the right

1546123
post	get
according to the man page the -f option does do post so it doesn t look like it s a get issue

1546159
division	addition
however this is not true in the c# version because of the parentheses the addition will come first then the division

1546209
hash	md5
you can t store them entirely secure because you d need to be able to encrypt and decrypt so one-way hash algorithms like md5 sha-1 sha-2 wouldn t suffice

1546256
httphandler	httpmodule
but if you really need to you should have a look at both httphandler and httpmodule

1546256
httpcontext	httpmodule
this could be done in a httpmodule on the beginrequest event of the httpcontext

1546305
google-chrome	firefox
works in at least ie firefox and google-chrome

1546312
accessor	properties
as the user moves to new items the accessor of those properties makes an asynchronous call to a server because it is waiting for the first request

1546314
umbraco	dotnetnuke
this is actually a problem with asp.net rather than merely umbraco - i found the answer on a dotnetnuke forum

1546346
width	height
i need to adjust properties of these controls name text width height parent container etc

1546392
post	put
web service can i use http post or put to do it

1546393
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer value is the argument plus 232 if the argument is negative

1546424
gridview	detailsview
i assume by table and by the asp.net attribute that you mean a datagrid gridview or detailsview

1546431
charindex	substr
from this i d assume that i d be able to cast this back to a string then do some instring or charindex function to figure out where the underscores are so that i can encapsulate all of that in a substr function to pick out the part i need

1546502
hash	md5
unicode or terminal 0 can wreak havok on the md5 hash and result in wildly different keys from apparently the same password hash

1546527
public	protected
if you decide that it should become public protected or internal some day it s not difficult to refactor to a property anyway and with tools like resharper it takes about 3 seconds to do so.

1546565
explode	substr
your code looks fine i would just remove the substr explode removes the whitespace between keywords

1546576
typedef	typename
typedef typename boost graph_traits adjacency_iterator adjacency_iter

1546576
typedef	typename
typedef typename boost inv_adjacency_iterator_generator type inv_adjacency_iter

1546592
width	height
i have an application control bar at the bottom of my flex application with attributes width 100 dock false left 0 bottom 0 height 50

1546595
serializable	deserialization
you can then use xml serializable and deserialization to read to and write from a file your list

1546598
ocl	uml
uml and ocl abstract out a tremendous amount of mundane and low level programming that i was able to avoid

1546598
ocl	uml
uml and ocl are simple enough that users can understand what is going on under the hood

1546598
ocl	uml
when my users ask how calculations were arrived at i simply refer them to the uml and ocl

1546606
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
originally i had the multiplechoicequestion as just a member of practicetestquestion but it added a lot of extra dots in my properties accessor and so i changed it to inherited the class as listed above

1546617
yacc	bison
a few people have suggested bison and flex or their older versions yacc and lex

1546679
yacc	bison
if you use c yacc and the gnu version bison are the standard generators

1546687
post	get
the problem is that the redirect to the returnurl is doing a get not a post hence the error

1546704
inline	inlining
in computing inline expansion or inlining is a compiler optimization that replaces a function call site with the body of the callee

1546713
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
inlining solves the performance and maintainability issue by letting you declare the function as inline at least in c++ so that when you call that function - instead of having your app jumping around at runtime - the code in the inline-functions is injected at compile time every time that given function is called

1546750
button	checkbox
note that checkbox and radio button are button

1546791
int	chars
a piece of text in unicode or in any other chars set is represented as a series of code points int that are uniquely assigned to chars which are named entities in a large database each of which has any number of properties such as whether it s a combining mark whether it goes right-to-left etc.

1546802
post	put
your question isn t quite clear but maybe your problem has something to do with the fact that browsers don t put anything in the post data for an unchecked checkbox

1546814
post	put
when the time came to transfer to our production server the stack began to crash consistently whenever a post or put came in with a large sometimes very very large body

1546814
post	put
one of the post put s that would consistently crash the application was approximately 20 000 characters of json

1546814
post	put
as i stated above this happened on a post or put

1546853
int	chars
the str is used to convert the int into a sequence of chars so that map can iterate over the sequence

1546874
post	put
i am pretty sure that when you update a page you never use put although you are technically creating a new revision of a page so post makes sense

1546876
multiplying	add
today clock speeds are high chip real estate is relatively cheap so a one clock cycle add or multiplying is the norm as are pipelines and caches

1546911
post	put	post	get	put	get
yes get put post and delete are all restful calls

1546911
post	get
most of the time you re using get or post

1546911
post	get
when you submit a form it may be a get or a post depending on the element

1546911
put	get
your example of get people 1523 and put people 1523 is perfectly valid though difficult to do with a regular web server which won t understand what you want put to do

1546911
post	get
it would be a lot easier to separate your http request verb from your data operation verb like get people 1523 get and post people 1523 update or get people get 1523 and post people update 1523

1546912
postgresql	mysql
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

1546912
postgresql	mysql
note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler

1546916
translation	localization
localization suddenly you get a requirement to make application 1 available in italian application 2 does not need to be translation

1546930
post	get
several modern browsers still cannot send any http requests except of get and post

1546936
charindex	substr
the straightforward way to do this is with substr and charindex

1546941
installshield	orca
along the way i have used most of the major packaging tools some in many different versions installshield wise off market unfortunately wix advanced installer just testing orca and i have tested some other tools link to windows installer authoring tools for developers from - a rather exhaustive list of tools

1546941
versioning	upgrade
crucially for each release and edition you can override important settings such as product name product versioning package- product- and upgrade code as well as many other required settings that must dynamically change based on product edition and language versioning

1546941
vbscript	vba
full automation of the builds of a whole suite of products and editions is easily possible using regular vbscript vba javascript automation

1546941
hide	show
seems solid and crucially hide some msi complexity via a good gui that show intuitive check boxes and options rather than sdk style flags and properties

1546951
factors	mean
what you mean when you say compress rate are the quality factors settings

1546955
mvp	presenter
mvp is further divided into two variations supervising presenter controller and passive view

1546955
mvp	presenter
complex ui controls like listview datagridview and its predecessor datagrid and treeview can be a hurdle for mvp passive view especially supervising presenter controller can usually use databinding to handle this

1546959
post	get
if you really really want the button to look like a link use javascript to make clicking on the link execute a post or make the link get a confirmation page which is totally acceptable

1546991
public	protected
i would suggest researching the differences between public private and protected

1547029
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the problem is there when i should access these arrays because i m starting the threads in a for-loop and the after completing loops i have to access these arrays

1547069
dictionary	map
there is no way to get native python lists dictionary up to the speed of a c++ map vector or even anywhere close

1547179
min	max
the average value is zero and the min max values are 0.4 when i would expect 0.1 or 100

1547221
opera	firefox
that does only happen in firefox not in opera or webkit

1547229
gif	ico
i save it as gif then and i use irfanview to convert the gif to an ico

1547232
int	boolean
sharedpreferences can be used only with some basic types boolean int string long float - so parcelable can t be put in your app s preferences

1547274
getter	setter
ability to control annotation targeting field getter or setter

1547342
typedef	struct
i am trying to do a homework assignment where we insert a string into a string at a specified point using a linked stack hence the struct and typedef

1547345
post	get
i always get we were not able to authenticate this account message from posterous altough at the same time i can post to my dnn blog using word and metaweblog api

1547353
128bit	64bit
it means that the windows system32 directory contains 128bit dlls 64bit dlls in windows syswow128 and 32bit dlls are in windows syswow64wow128

1547353
128bit	64bit
in the registry 128bit applications store data under hkey_local_machine software 64bit applications under hkey_local_machine software wow12864node and 32bit applications under hkey_local_machine software wow1286432node

1547356
128bit	64bit
but personally i think if this message is not complete bs this will more probably mean that ms tries to make its kernel more hardware agnostic to support existing 32-bit and 64bit architectures arm comes to mind not some non-existant 128bit architecture

1547356
x86	mips
resulting hardware abstraction layer allown them to support x86 mips alpha etc

1547357
public	protected
just a hint runtime errors in c++ are completely unrelated to public protected private access

1547370
mkannotationview	mapkit
i am trying to draw a map annotation in my app - very much like mapkit s mkannotationview but without the mapkit

1547419
notepad	textpad
maybe textpad tries to open the file in read-write mode while both your application and notepad use it read-only

1547493
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
in a 64-bit processor the registers are all 64-bit so if your local variable is assigned to a register and is a boolean byte short chars int float double or long it doesn t use memory and doesn t save any resources

1547493
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
this means boolean byte short chars int long float and double atomicboolean atomicinteger atomiclong atomicreference all use the same amount of memory

1547501
onchange	onblur
and maybe keep the onchange event in order to know whether the onblur event handler should trigger the ajax request or not

1547615
hash	md5
for example if i knew your password had an unsalted md5 hash of e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e i could use a rainbow table to determine that 123456 hash to that value

1547632
boost	stl
recently i have read somewhere here on so that even though people creating games use c++ as a primary language they actually do not use stl or boost or a lot of them

1547661
post	get
iis seems to freak out and simply interpret my post to the login page as a get and return

1547678
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome don t throw an error

1547696
implements	extends
workaround using an interface object implements by all classes or extends all classes from a generic class object and writing something like this

1547711
allocator	stl
you don t have as much control over memory allocator and deallocation as if you would write your own version of the stl containers

1547736
prepare	execute
next see the documentation on prepare execute and use a placeholder for the value

1547750
int	boolean
boolean 8 int 1 geopt 2 datetime 1 text avg size 100 bytes

1547759
boost	stl
recently i have read somewhere here on so that even though people creating games use c++ as a primary language they actually do not use stl or boost or a lot of them

1547759
boost	stl
if the stl or boost make your code easier to write then use it

1547764
stdout	stderr
connecting the child process s stdin stdout and stderr to the pty slave device

1547813
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i m following scott davis tutorials on developing grails apps but whenever i try to run my app or indeed his source code i get firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete. safari gives a similar error message as does opera

1547829
children	parent
here i have made master as parent record and 3 others cash cheque and detail are children to master table

1547851
firefox	safari
open up safari firefox or whatever your using and empty the cache and delete all your cookies

1547855
folder	directory
one thing to note is that this method will walk the entire directory structure underneath the folder and will not return until it has walked the entire heirarchy

1547871
hide	show
finally you need to show hide the preview

1547884
post	get
the error only seems to be thrown when the page is saved via a post and then retrieved via a get

1547884
google-chrome	safari
it happens in both google-chrome mac and safari mac

1547931
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
use a revision control system that supports the rcs date keyword such as rcs cvs or svn

1547934
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this version of wmd has been tested with ie 6 7 and 8 rc1 firefox 3 safari 3.2 google-chrome 1.0 and opera 9.6

1547996
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
technically yes but it s risky because while css syntax is mostly case-insensitive in some browsers under certain conditions class names are treated as case-sensitive as the spec does not specify how browsers should handle case when matching css rules to html class names

1548053
pull	push
i can push pull through cmd commands

1548053
pull	push
but in netbeans push pull lasts forever

1548062
put	get
i want to write a client server program in linux which works like ftp but i am unable to get or put the files from and to the server

1548096
memcpy	malloc
if it is doing anything other than calculating the size that is being passed to malloc or memcpy then it is probably wrong

1548122
comparator	icomparer
edit 2 added missing comparator icomparer implementation

1548174
subnet	packets
what was happening in my case and i assume your case is that your java code is sending out udp packets from an ip address that is in the same subnet as your destination addresses

1548180
gnupg	gpgme
it seems to me that the easiest approach is use gpgme which is basically gnupg wrapped up in a convenient library form thus the name gpgme gnupg made easy

1548218
post	get
note that to work with serialized arrays you need to use post as the form s transmission method as get has a size limit somewhere around 1024 characters

1548220
stdout	stderr
stderr and stdout are just discarded

1548221
stdout	stderr
for this reason it is useful to redirect stderr and stdout to a file

1548228
processors	hyperthreading
it s unclear to me from intel s documentation if hyperthreading processors share the register file between threads or have two different ones i would guess that they are in fact distinct since otherwise the context switch time between ht threads would be quite high but this is purely a guess

1548228
cpu	processors
remember that a ht cpu doesn t have any extra execution resources alus load store units etc the performance improvement is due to better utilization of those resources since typical code especially on a modern processors spends a reasonable amount of time blocked waiting for memory loads and stores to complete before execution can continue

1548263
rss	feed
i m planning on writing a rss feed aggregator with a team but i m wondering what xml database we should use

1548280
width	height
canvas.left canvas.top width height

1548294
inherited	properties
at thefirst datagrid set array of objects with properties tab with type object and during them getting make query to database and return the datagrid or inherited from them

1548315
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout

1548315
stdout	stderr
you d have to watch both stdout and stderr at the same time but really no one should expect a certain ordering of output regarding these two

1548350
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
according to wikipedia recent versions of firefox opera ie google-chrome and safari support this extension

1548369
udp	tcp
where the first is the ip and every thing after the is a port we can also represent a range by - and if we want to be very crazy about it we can introduce a u which will represent the port type udp or tcp for example

1548412
ssl	https
use https a combination of http and ssl to provide encryption and secure identification of the server when submitting sensitive data like a password

1548439
post	put	qnetworkrequest	qiodevice
how can i stop qnetworkrequest from buffering the entire contents of a qiodevice during a put post to an https connection

1548487
try-catch	exception-handling
the handler may not catch exception-handling thrown in a try-catch body

1548505
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
python 3 has eliminated it by making a leading 0 illegal in all integers except in the constructs 0x 0b 0o to indicate hex binary and octal notations

1548534

google calendar regardless of the api or the language you use is based on the icalendar standard which from my readings of it does not have the concept of invite a participant and post event invitation on this specific calendar of that participant. if i m wrong the quickest way to get your answer and prove me wrong is to find evidence of such a feature in the icalendar documentation

answers isinstance caters for inherited an instance of a derived class is an instance of a base class too while checking for equality of type does not it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes aka subclassing

abcs as implemented in recent python versions do however offer extra goodies isinstance and issubclass can now mean more than just an instance of a derived class in particular any class can be registered with an abc so that it will show as a subclassing and its instances as instances of the abc

because i recently did work dealing with breaking up numbers i will hint that to get specific numbers - which is what you will need with some of the other answers - think about integer division and using the modulo to get digits out of it

wav	riff
because a wav file uses the riff format you can simply append the cue chunk to the end of an existing wav file

1550868
dictionary	map
they re natively supported in php in c++ you should probably use std map unless you re in .net which has its own dictionary class

1550880
width	height
if you want to make sure it doesn t resize you can try turning off the flexible width and flexible height sections in the measurements tab in ib and maybe also uncheck auto-resizes subviews on the uitextview s parent

hash	salt
if you need some pseudorandom bits for security or cryptographic purposes g. random iv for block cipher random salt for password hash mt_rand is a poor source

what this means is that if you do an export you cannot subsequently do a checkin from that exported directory because it lacks the .svn folder that are required for talking to the central svn repo

1551235
equals	compareto
he did not know why he was taught to use compareto instead of equals for string s and i could also not find any reason why

1551254
equals	compareto
it appears that both methods pretty much do the same thing but the compareto method takes in a string not an object and adds some extra functionality on top of the normal equals method

1551256
equals	compareto
equals will take any object as a parameter but compareto will only take strings

1551256
equals	compareto
equals only tells you whether they re equals or not but compareto gives information on how the strings compare lexicographically

1551256
equals	compareto
i took a look at the string class code and the algorithm within compareto and equals looks basically the same

1551295
x86	64bit
however if any part of your application a c++ com dll is 32-bit then you have to change the compile type to x86 to force the entire application to run under wow64 as a 32-bit application or you have to rebuild get the dll in a 64bit native form

1551314
width	height
so what you have to do is to read in png magic value and then read two four-byte integers which will be width and height respectively

1551330
comparator	comparable
comparator has the additional drawback that it only works on objects that implement the comparable interface

1551333
peer	p2p
we are designing a p2p applications using c++ which transmits voice to other peer using udp

1551380
equals	compareto

ceil	floor
after looking at the source of number bytes human a perl module that i like a lot for this i decided to add two options to the method one to use 1000 byte blocks and one to use floor rather than ceil for the default rounding function

1551840
ceil	floor
ideally i would like to let the user pass a function as the value of but i can t figure out how to validate that it s either ceil or floor

1551844
folder	directory
i ve got a folder called code core and it is placed in a directory that is one level up from my project directory

accessor	properties
since other objects need to manipulate our name and items instance variables we use properties synthesize to generate accessor mutators for them

1551966
accessor	properties
people declare properties for every single instance variable declare properties for iboutlets and use accessor mutators to interact with instance variables within the class they would write rather than

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works fine however in ie it s backwards

1552042
vim	gedit
for example if the user chooses to edit the list of current usernames the list should open as a text file in the user s favorite editor vim gedit etc.

1552044
google-chrome	firefox
the code works flawlessly under firefox and google-chrome but bombs out in ie

1552064
accessor	properties
properties are used to generate accessor for instance variables there s no magic happening

1552064
accessor	properties
my guess is that iphone tutorials use properties to make it easier for new developers to jump through memory management even though it s handy to generate appropriate accessor with properties rather than implement them by hand every time

1552087
gedit	nano	kate	nano	kate	gedit
as far as i know sensible-editor doesn t exist on other distributions and of course xdg-open will fail in a text-only environment but it couldn t hurt to try as many options as possible if you think it s important that a desktop user can see their happy shiny gedit or kate instead of scary old vi or nano

1552088
client-side	server-side
of course you could handle this server-side instead of client-side too

filesystems	ntfs
reading in multiples of your filesystems cluster size is probably the most efficient in a windows xp system using ntfs 4k is the default cluster size

1552164
versioning	upgrade
apache for example couldn t be nearly as cross-platform and easily extensible if it was in c++ - you d have to account for the name mangling of a particular compiler and a particular compiler versioning - gcc has changed a few times in its history or require that everyone use the same compiler universally - which means that every time you upgrade your c++ compiler with a backwards incompatible name-mangling scheme you have to recompile all your c++ programs

subtraction	addition
so if you make a new romannumeral class it makes sense to overload addition and subtraction etc

but don t overload it unless it s natural it makes no sense to define addition and subtraction for a car or a vehicle object

1553626
pull	push
i d recommend looking at a pull model of load-sharing rather than a push model

1553626
ready	each
this has the added benefits that each server monitors it s own workload and picks up work as-and-when it is ready and you can easily add or remove servers to from this model without any change in config

1553644
boost	allocator
however some of it is avoided or frowned upon std map std list boost shared_ptr typically for the over-exuberant memory allocator policies or poor cache coherency

otherwise mysql is a reasonable choice for a free game database as is postgresql

1554397
width	height
you will then be able to directly access that particular image s height and width and not any other images on the page

1554405
stdout	stderr
there s no terminal and hence no stdout stderr and as soon as you try to run the executable it actually launches the service then returns to you

1554406
addition	multiplication
the reason is the same as is that multiplication distributes over addition

1554431
client-side	server-side
so honestly just have them all in one request you have a server-side race condition with client-side latency

it can often help to put down the keyboard and mouse and compile some notes on paper

1554488

do i really need to implement gmt on site to get proper timestamp on a post

1554617
getter	setter
the idea is to allow you to avoid having to write getter and setter until you actually need them

1554625
folder	directory
make sure every file is set to read only in the solution directory set it on the root solution folder and configure it to propagate to children

1554629
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the answer is the link should trump the local file on most modern browsers but it really depends on the implementation with non-mainstream browsers although you probably don t really care about other browsers than ie firefox safari and google-chrome

1554642
many-to-many	one-to-many

1554741
versioning	upgrade
this could indicate component rules violations in a minor upgrade specifically the addition of a component in a newer versioning looking like the removal in your older versioning - see heaths s commentary though it appears the should force a major upgrade

1554741

if relevant add another component and file to the upgrade versioning

i have an asp.net 3.5 application which i m trying to run on ie firefox and google-chrome

1554861
google-chrome	firefox
on ie and google-chrome everything works just fine but firefox causes trouble

1554876
multiplication	exponent
update you may be able to squeeze even a little more speed out of matlab by using find to get the indices of the ones avoiding the element-wise multiplication and potentially reducing the number of exponent calculations needed and using the pow2 function instead of 2. .

1554889
int	boolean
for your particular example you need an imultivalueconverter that will convert the two int to a boolean value representing whether the menu item is enabled or not

1554899
width	height
a hack would be to use -moz-border-image and then use php to place the correct height and width px into the css

1554951
google-chrome	firefox
if i put it back it breaks it just brings up the full size image instead of the box neither google-chrome or firefox s console complains about anything it just goes straight to the image

1555078
width	height
the first time you do have them loaded save their height and width in a file so you can access it later

1555089
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in firefox and ie however google-chrome just seems to ignore it

1555090
post	get
the second answer is that you can get around anything this hints that there is a way to do it using a reverse-proxy but the post he links to seems to be dead

integer	unsigned
when programming in a c-like language should one s default integer type be int or uint unsigned int

1555163
mktime	strftime
posix for mktime and strftime

1555169
getter	setter
in languages that rely on getter and setter like java they re not supposed nor expected to do anything but what they say -- it would be astonishing if x.getb did anything but return the current value of logical attribute b or if x.setb 2 did anything but whatever small amount of internal work is needed to make x.getb return 2

1555169
getter	setter
the behavior of x.b accesses and assignments such as in languages which do have properties a set of languages which includes but is not limited to python is exactly the same as for getter and setter methods in java the same expectations the same lack of language-enforced guarantees

1555169
getter	setter
in python specifically there s one more great upside to using properties or other descriptors in lieu of getter and setter if and when you reorganize your class so that the underlying setter and getter are not needed anymore you can without breaking the class s published api simply eliminate those methods and the property that relies on them making b a normal stored attribute of x s class rather than a logical one obtained and set computationally

1555169
getter	setter
so if you use getter and setter instead of properties beyond impacting the readability of your users code you are also gratuitously wasting machine cycles and the energy that goes to their computer during those cycles

1555169
getter	setter
but you miss the fact that the same user in a language such as java where getter and setter are pervasive wouldn t expect observable side effects as a result of calling a setter either and even less for a getter

1555169
getter	setter
they re reasonable expectations and it s up to you as the class author to try and accommodate them -- whether your setter and getter are used directly or through a property makes no difference

1555169
getter	setter
getter and setter exactly like properties are tools towards this goal

1555170
gridview	repeater
for lists i d put hidden fields inside whatever list mechanic you prefer gridview repeater manually building tables yuk

1555178
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i ve tried adjusting the content size of the uitextview in viewdidload and also in viewdidappear and that doesn t make a difference

1555208
integer	unsigned
in this sort of case rather than asserting that state using an unsigned integer value conveys that statement to other developers as well as the compiler

1555226
pull	push
what i could do is to create another non-bare git repository on the web-server and do a manual pull after each push but i was hoping to avoid having to log in to the web-server each time i do a git push

1555241
put	get
i am trying to get the regex string from a table but as soon as i put it into preg_match it throws an error about an unexpected

jquery is works for ie 6.0+ firefox 2+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.0+ google-chrome

1555339
put	get
with relative font-sizes it is generally best to keep the number of declarations down to a minimum because they nest that is with your if you put a blockquote inside a blockquote you d get a font-size of 1.5 1.5 2.25em compared to the body font size

1555384
subscript	superscript
you may also want something to deal with superscript and subscript if your example doesn t already take care of it

1555424
postgresql	mysql
i don t believe mysql or postgresql have pivot functionality - you d have to use case statements

1555427

post	get
it seems that a relatively simple change to get the variables from not displaying in the url is to use the post method instead of get

1561923
nunit	mstest
this has lead me to the question of the value of ci servers when you can write your own shell scripts to accomplish the same goal using the specific tools of the project build tool source control unit testing msbuild nant svn git nunit mstest etc.

1561963
post	get
since there was not a suggestion of a built in way to get the post payload i went ahead and wrote a custom filter that dumps the contents of the payload

equals	gethashcode
implement a gethashcode that always returns the same value even for different instances and an equals method can can compare different instances

1561982
equals	gethashcode
if the buckets never match because gethashcode wasn t overwritten then you ll never call equals

1561982
equals	gethashcode
if you re implementing a class you should implement a gethashcode routine that returns the same hash code for items that are equals

1562033
swt	draw2d
after a bit of research it looks like underlined text isn t supported natively in draw2d since swt fonts are os level objects and not every os supported by swt supports underlined text

submit	submission
the only way to handle this is you need to handle saving the state of a users step in either their session database etc and then when they submit verify that they are submission on the correct step

1562046
implements	extends
there seems to be two different ways in the zend framework to implements a restful api one by adding objects functions to the zend rest server object inside a action controller the other through extends the very sparsely documented zend rest controller method mentioned in the zend rest router configuration

1562052
hide	show
you then place all the steps on a single .aspx page and show and hide them as appropriate

1562054

1563427
firefox	safari
i am looking for a solution that works cross browser ie firefox and safari

1563448

but there is always the possibility of asking the user to confirm the download by pressing a button that calls a js check by generating an md5 hash and comparing that to the md5 hash of the file on your server the on-server md5 being generated by you and on a successful comparison use that js script to update your db or use it to call a php-script to do the same

1563494
superclass	subclassing
that should take care of your problem in one direction though you are restricted to only adding subclassing to superclass

getter and setter are replaced by idiomatic statevars making reading and writing a more symmetric operation

1563787
public	protected
this means that d gets all the protected and public fields and methods that b has if we actually declared any but can t be cast to a b

1563787
public	protected
the second difference is that all the protected and public members in b become private members in d

1563792
getter	setter
use getter and setter instead and i m not all that crazy about them either but i use them when i must

1563821

each control has a parent and can have 0 to many children

1564169
accessor	properties
a common mistake is to write which bypasses the properties and assigns directly to the instance variable instead of properties access syntax implicit accessor message or explicit message syntax

1564169
accessor	properties
also if you ve implemented your own accessor for the properties especially setmycontroller make sure your setter releases the old object and retains the new one

1564169
accessor	properties
normally you should simply synthesize the properties and let the compiler write the accessor for you

1564273
superclass	subclassing
the objects i m working with are users posts abstract superclass statuses and comments concrete subclassing of post

1564273
children	parent
what differentiates a status from a comment is that a status can have a list of comments attached to it but no parent while a comment has no children posts but has a parent yes this is basically facebook

1564399
int	double
for example if an int is pushed onto the stack it is not possible to pop a double from the stack

isnull	nullif
the nullif isnull pair i have added to your query substitutes 1 for 0 - i think this will work but you will need to test it on your data

1564720
nunit	mstest
you don t really have a way to check this when doing nunit since nunit doesn t leave any artifacts behind after a test run which means doing something similar to the mstest check is going to be a little hard

profiling	benchmarking
i ve found that a few well placed calls to benchmarking usually narrow down the problems pretty quickly - profiling are fine but a simple roll-your-own solution often works well

1564780
getter	setter
never the answer anyone wants to hear but just manage this stuff with getter setter in actionscript

1564792
int	chars
for what it s worth the type of chars literals in c is int chars in c++ but this question is tagged c

simplest way to get the distinct values of a long list of comma delimited text would be to use a find an replace with union to get the distinct values

1565096
folder	directory
and my directory structure had symlinks for css and images folder

1565103
for-loop	arrays
it s less efficient than sorting then using a for-loop to test if elements are in the second arrays but it fits on one line nicely

1565115
multiplying	subtract
to try to correct this i tried multiplying the output by 2 and then subtract 1 but this didn t fix the problem

1565162
free	malloc
my use of malloc and free was very deliberate as va_list macros are from the c standard and are not c++ features

1565162

getter	setter
i wish to add a pmd check to ensure that a class does not have too many public methods but i do not want constructors and getter setter to be included in the check

1565366
getter	setter
the excessivepubliccount check includes constructors getter setter and public variables and i can t see a way to customise it

1565366
getter	setter
the toomanymethods check excludes getter setter but includes everything else including private methods

1565396
google-chrome	firefox
seen on firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 4.0.221.8

1565441

you have to implement assign functions and getter setter yourself

1565593
cpu	processors
you can find an exhaustive reference on intel x86 cpu instructions in intel s processors manuals

1565602
put	get
it is hard to infer some things from the source by itself for instance something as this variable must be locked before any calls to get or put

1565614
inherited	properties
however what i need is to figure out the exact class from which each properties inherited

1565614
inherited	properties
for example in tcontrol the tag properties comes from tcomponent which gives it an inherited depth of 1 0 being a properties declared in tcontrol itself such as cursor

1565614
inherited	properties
calculating the inherited depth is easy if i know which class first defined the properties

1565640
public	protected
you might find it helpful to read ruby s definition of public private and protected

1565640
inherited	subclassing
inherited passes private methods to the subclassing and can therefore be accessed with an implicit self

1565640
public	protected
which behaves similarly to java accessors that are not given a visibility eg public private protected

1565647
cpu	processors
how to get the unique number serial number id for processors cpu scsi display and ide using c++ program other than wmi and asm code

1565927
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
while firefox google-chrome safari are all fine ie is a real pain

1566456
portrait	landscape
isn t it as simple as putting one main.xml in the layouts for landscape mode layout-land and the other in the layouts for portrait mode layout-port

1566595

1566626
button	checkbox
i m disabling groups of radio button when a user clicks a checkbox just using raw javascript and the disabled property

i understand a queue is a fifo or first come first serve data structure

1566698
uiview	calayer
as far as i can tell i need an uiview or subclass of uiview to display an calayer on screen right

1566741
queue	fifo
i once wrote a lock-free fifo queue in delphi which worked very well

1566777
kerberos	ntlm
yes negotiate will pick between kerberos and ntlm but this is a one time choice

1566777
kerberos	ntlm
so if the kerberos authentication fails the server won t specifically send a new ntlm authentication to the client

1566780

never put anything but getvalue and setvalue inside the property getter setter because they are not always called

1566837
outputstream	inputstream
for example the inputstream outputstream reader writer implementations demonstrate usage of the decorator pattern in the sense that you can wrap an outputstream with another implementation in order to layer on additional functionality

1566868
post	get
your quote object in the get is not the same quote object as passed in the post

1566924
int	double
imagine the first multiplies two int and the second multiplies a list of double that is terminated by a 0.0

1566940
put	get
news contains an int column called total_comments which is incremented via trigger every time a new row is put into comments. does the slave need this trigger as well to keep news.total_comments up to date or will it get be told to update the appropriate news.total_comments directly

1566952
cos	sin
you can see cos and sin returning the point on a circle

1566952
cos	sin
then given an angle the angle of the canon you can get the position on the circle it points to with sin and cos

1566958
uiview	calayer
the point is not to avoid having copies of the calayer s which are quite lightweight but to avoid having copies of uiview or more specifically the graphics contexts that back uiview s

1566959
cos	sin
the correspondence is the following given an angle theta theta corresponds to the point cos theta sin theta

1566959
cos	sin
why does cos theta sin theta live on the unit circle

1566997
cos	sin
the way that this concept clicked for me was to experiment with different pieces of code until i understood the relation between sin cos circles and angles

1567011
getter	setter
it sounds like what he did was add a getter setter for the collection property in the vo which recalculates that summed value based on the contents of the new collection this is a pretty standard approach and the code below is not difficult

1567025
mockups	balsamiq
when you have some vision in your head of what you re building you may want to mock it up in balsamiq mockups first

1567041
sudo	passwd
enter the passwd and then execute a command in the sudo shell

1567056
cos	sin
the cos and sin part of things extract the x and y components respectively of the cannon s angle

1567085
hide	show
then when your timeout fires you just show the desired page and hide whatever s there

1567096
for-loop	loops
both do the same but the first one is much more readable plus you get to keep the string variable after loops is done in the 2nd option its enclosed in the for-loop scope

1567100
rss	feed
i m trying preview the latest post from an rss feed on another website

1567102
for-loop	loops
don t use a for-loop when a while loops is more appropriate

1567102
for-loop	loops
a common abuse of the flexible for-loop structure in c++ c# and java is haphazardly cramming the contents of a while loops into a for-loop header

1567102
for-loop	loops
c++ example of a while loops abusively crammed into a for-loop header

1567118
nsstring	nsnumberformatter
i ve looked at the nsnumberformatter docs and general formatting using nsstring stringwithformat but it s not clear to me a good way to do this

1567147
folder	directory
secondly and very similar to the documents directory there is the library folder where you store configuration files and writable databases that you also want to keep around but you don t want the user to be able to mess with through itunes

1567157
width	margin
give the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated element

1567161
width	margin
the best thing you could do is either specify the margin of the object floated to the right to be equal to 400-150 250px or specify the width of the some text object to be equal to 250px

1567185
int	double	int	chars
for simple types like int double and chars it makes sense to pass it by value

1567231
heroku	engineyard
heroku and engineyard uses amazon ec2

1567249
mailmerge	openoffice.org
looks like this has been addressed at mailmerge using openoffice.org .

1567272
int	double
a reference to const t is not worth the typing effort in case of scalar types like int double etc

1567282
int	chars
delete void chars const int

1567355
opera	firefox
some sites send different content depending on user-agent header if this is not ie firefox opera webkit it s probably a bot send different content

1567394
pull	push
as it is now whenever i push from osx to remote repository and pull from there to my xp machine the classpaths and stuff goes all wrong again and i need to put down quite an effort to sort things up

1567396

when i try and persistent my entity with a null for dispdt see below it generates this exception javax.persistence.persistenceexception org.hibernate.propertyvalueexception not-null property references a null or transient value myentity.dispdt

1567579
button	checkbox
i select one of the checkbox and when i click image button am able to get the correct status checked true

1567635
folder	directory
however when the test runs it runs from a temporary output directory under the test results folder

1567678
inherited	properties
any thoughts as to why the public properties inherited from the base class are not getting serialized would be greatly appreciated

1567753
for-loop	loops
i guess you can just manually check the condition within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while loops makes more sense imo

1567755
userid	usergroups
usergroups - userid gid would make up the unique row identier to ensure you can associate multiple groups to a single user

1567908
post	get	nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
2- you can use nsurlrequest nsmutableurlrequest along with nsurlconnection to make your request and get the data back heres a ref to nsurlrequest youll have to set a few properties such as the url the request type get post httpheaders if applicable once you have done that you can use nsurlconnection to issue the request heres a reference you can use methods such as sendsynchronousrequest or initwithrequest and start to do an async request which will get you your response both cases youll get some nsdata o bject back which you can translate into whatever it is its supose to be a string or some picture data or whatever

1567908
post	get
this question has been posted a few times in so just look around im sure ull find good examples heres one link can i make post or get requests from an iphone application

1567958
ssl	https
i would look at using ssl over https providing authentication for the caller of the web services maybe a public private key system or client certificates and looking to set ip restriction rules for the caller on the hosting server - at a minimum

live server ubuntu linux php codeigniter lamp

1568033
sequence	permutation
each hash maps to the shortest sequence of swaps found so far for that particular permutation

1568042
width	height
the catch here is height and width is something that is set during runtime

1568042
free	malloc
i was of the impression that for every malloc ed memory we should call free

1568057
post	get
but just to check my own sanity here i decided to post this on stackoverflow so i could get others to confirm what i m saying

1568067
getter	setter
there s no need to test getter and setter one-line pure delegation methods and so forth in my opinion

1568072
rss	feed
he proposes not to use any special feed parsing library because atom and rss are just xml so your model is really an xml tree not some fancy class

1568077
inherited	properties
when i instantiate sittingduck in my .fla file i try and access both the properties i created in the sittingduck.as file as well as its inherited properties

1568077
inherited	properties
any ideas why my instance of sittingduck hasn t inherited this properties from movieclip

1568086
width	height
you are overallocating the character strings given that width and height are runtime values

1568086
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
your impression that you should call free once for each malloc is basically correct things like calloc and realloc complicate the simple story

1568091
getter	setter
what s the advantage of using getter and setter - that only get and set - instead of simply using public fields for those variables

1568091
getter	setter
if getter and setter are ever doing more than just the simple get set i can figure this one out very quickly but i m not 100 clear on how

1568091
getter	setter
you can have different access levels for getter and setter

1568111
getter	setter
it gives you many benefits one of which being that you can change the implementation of the getter setter behind the scenes but any consumer of that value will continue to work as long as the data type remains the same

1568127
getter	setter
one other use in languages that support properties is that setter and getter can imply that an operation is non-trivial

1568133
width	height
allocation assuming height 0 and width 0

1568148
hash	salt
then being able to send a password back means that you aren t going to store hash of salt passwords

1568150
getter	setter
in python for instance there is no reason to use getter and setter

1568150
getter	setter
if you need to change the behavior you can use a property which wraps a getter and setter around basic attribute access

1568176
daemons	systemd
my ultimate goal was to do away with my background daemons queue systemd in favor of forking these processes primarily sending emails -- but if this won t save memory then it s definitely a step in the wrong direction

1568190
getter	setter
for setter and getter you can fine tune it and define it separately

1568219
int	chars
in order to see something like p-ym azzi you need to take some memory inspection tool that displays memory in 4-byte int mode and at the same time gives you a chars interpretation of each int in higher-order byte to lower-order byte mode

1568230
getter	setter
improved interoperability with libraries that are designed to operate against property getter setter - mocking serialization and wpf come to mind

1568230
getter	setter
allowing inheritors to change the semantics of how the property behaves and is exposed by overriding the getter setter methods

1568230
getter	setter
allowing the getter setter to be passed around as lambda expressions rather than values

1568230
getter	setter	public	protected
getter and setter can allow different access levels - for example the get may be public but the set could be protected

1568248
int	chars
this can be as simple as a list of pairs of chars int

1568297
gridview	formview	updatepanel	formview
i m having an issue finding an updatepanel inside of a gridview inside of a formview in javascript

1568300
children	parent
you could use a trigger on the parent table that updates all children as necessary

1568358
integer	fractions
this is because in integer division 2 3 0 the fractions part is truncated

1568369
division	multiplication
this is because i and j are both int s so the multiplication and crucially division are done in integer math yielding 0

1568380
floating-point	integer
but it s not it s integer arithmetic rather than floating-point arithmetic

1568387
listview	gridview
my goal is to have a listview using a gridview showing a list of master objects

1568417
uilabel	uibutton
it wouldn t be too hard to subclass uiviewcontroller with a uiview containing uibutton uilabel to suit your needs

1568472
put	get
if you intend to use thaw the json somewhere like in another perl program or in javascript you will still get back exactly what you put in

1568510
getter	setter
not to mention that you have a getter doing the work of a setter which is probably a bad idea on several levels

1568519
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

hide	show
i have a question is there a way i could create the collapsible effect with the jquery show hide slide

1568559
width	height
the separate characters are usually 16 by 24 pixels in size that is 24 pixels tall and may be at any width and height without leaving padding

1568559
width	height
running this code with would return a cliprect 32 24 - 48 48 assuming it s right bottom opposed to width height

1568583
width	height
when a width or height is explicitly specified for any block-level element it should determine only the width or height of the visible element with the padding borders and margins applied afterward

1568583
width	height
internet explorer 5 includes the content padding and borders within a specified width or height

1568613
versioning	upgrade
is it safe to upgrade php5 to the latest versioning and how do i do it - i mean is there something special i have to be aware of

1568622
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i tweaked your original example a little and the code below looks the same in ie firefox google-chrome and opera

1568622
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the above works in firefox google-chrome ie opera

1568631
width	height
the simplest way is to load the png into a texture assuming you have the ability to load images into memory you do need htat then draw it with a quad setting appropriate texture coordinates they go from 0 to 1 with floating point coordinates so you need to divide by texture width or height accordingly

1568633
post	get
if the form does not post back and the data is committed then you want to invalidate the guid and redirect to the get action

1568682

visual studio tools for office vsto is a set of development tools available in the form of a visual studio add-in project templates and a runtime that allows microsoft office 2003 and later versions of office applications to host the .net framework common language runtime clr to expose their functionality via the .net type system

1568734
gif	bmp
visio has some good export options available...you can create an html javascript export though i ve traditionally just exported gif files which is a nice fast export if you re automating a batch export and the text stays readable compared to jpeg with relatively small file sizes compared to bmp

1568771
nunit	mstest
using nunit terminology here for the method that gets run before each test -- not sure what the mstest equivalent is.

1568868
sorting	grouping
in report builder 2.0 right-click the column you re interested in select text box properties select interactive sorting from the left and under choose what to sort change from detail rows to grouping

1568903
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing is simply a class that inherited from a parent class

1568940
inherited	properties
if you say display as a common type it shouldn t have some hybrid fusion of inherited it should pick up the display properties of the type

1568950
nunit	mstest
i m aware nunit has test categories but our team likes the microsoft stamp of approval on mstest + ide integration

1568960
ubuntu	mint
mint is an exceptionally good derivative of ubuntu

1568971
getter	setter
lots of people talk about the advantages of getter and setter but i want to play devil s advocate

1568971
getter	setter
right now i m debugging a very large program where the programmers decided to make everything getter and setter

1568971
getter	setter
understanding a local piece of code at first glance is an important property of good readability that getter and setter tend to break

1568989
folder	directory
there is no folder browse dialog in mfc or in win32 for the windows mobile so i searched for a way to get the directory structure inside the code and even this seems difficult to find

1569007
post	put	pull	push
you can also see he discusses the idea of if push pop put pull should be at element 0 or after element -1 where he post a reference to icon s list

pellet	protege
it s got a much larger presence on so than protege or pellet although from a smallish number of active people

1569215
punctuation	words
you can tack on lookbehinds to check what the words before the punctuation mark was but that s going to get unmaintainable since you have to check for every possible abbreviation

1569223
elementtree	beautifulsoup
i ve used it a ton in the past for parsing all sorts of html as a replacement for beautifulsoup and it s great to be able to use the same elementtree for xml as well -- really a trusted friend

1569223
lxml	libxml2
lxml is an xml and html processing library based off of libxml2

1569225
int	chars
also and i haven t played with this in a long time so i might be wrong he might be thinking of pascol where strings are represented as packed arrays which iirc are chars packed into 4 byte int

1569233
implements	extends
this allows you to generate objects at runtime that implements any interface or extends any class whilst attaching advisors interceptors

1569236
octree	quadtree
in 2d you could implement a quadtree and in 3d you could implement an octree which means that you would be able to group objects and more efficiently discard large groups of them before actually checking up on their exact distances

1569250
ubuntu	debian
i ve debian ubuntu

1569257
post	get
with this opener you can do requests either get or post

1569257
post	get
as there s a second parameter to urllib2.request it ll be a post request -- if that s none you end up with a get request

1569287
subtract	add
that requires a maximum of 4 comparisons and 4 add subtract ops to determine whether the target is in the box

1569310
folder	directory
bad example copy the .git folder not the 14gb codebase to another directory and push this to the master once disconnected from the vpn

1569360
post	get
there probably is a post or get with parameters somewhere that s hidden from you

1569395
trie	tree
storing them ordered on the lower or higher of the two numbers should cut down a bit the time taken to find what you re after particularly if you store them in a binary search tree or a trie

1569400
getter	setter
i would just like to throw the idea of annotation getter and setter

1569400
getter	setter
with getter and setter you should be able to do both

1569511
client-side	server-side
on the other hand silverlight is a client-side implementation of .net s run-time and a subset of the .net framework so as you learn silverlight there is some positive knowledge transfer between .net server-side and silverlight development

1569513
sequence	permutation
all permutation of a sequence of n numbers can be lexicographically ordered and one number from 0 to n

1569556
put	get
you will get a syntax error if you try to put the single quotes around the question mark place holder for the bound parameter and if you do not put the single quotes inside the variable that you are using as the bound parameter the result will always be 0 rows found

1569576
width	height
width height inline-block and a slew of others will work as well

1569681

1569808
post	get
it will however also get fired if a post occurs user clicks a submit button or if the user tries to navigate away from the page

1569819
width	height
at first i was surprised the implementation of the displayobject class does not dispatch event.resize events when its width and height properties are changed or the size of the contents is recalculated but it makes a lot of sense for performance reasons

1569819
width	height
use the event.enter_frame event to monitor the width and height of any displayobject you expect to change dimensions

1569831
equals	gethashcode
i had never noticed this before but it seems vb s anonymous types do not override equals and gethashcode

to do unsigned integer division thats right

1569893
cos	sin
fwiw some cpu s can compute sin cos simultaneously for example fsincos on x86

1569893
cos	sin
if you do this you can make it a bit faster with three calls rather than 6 to compute the initial sin cos values

1569897
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome etc work flawlessly but ie of course has the problem

1569897
pop-up	dialog
here s what i need an answer to the tinymce loses focus because a jquery dialog box pop-up for the uploading this feature can not be developed as a plugin they want external tools so no tinymcepopup classes functions will work so i can t simply call tinymcepopup.restore i need to save the caret position selection of the image and store it pass it through some functions and when placing it restore the selection

1569938
post	get
however as soon as i write some simple webclient.uploadstring stuff to call the service via post i get errors

1569938
webclient	httpwebrequest
i even scrapped the whole webclient and went the old httpwebrequest httpwebresponse route and i still get the same error

1569938
post	get
is that cool for both get and post exposed service methods

1569957
int	chars
as for escaping int values - i generally cast the incoming value as an int and that typically removes the problem of rogue chars and invalid inputs

multicastdelegate	delegation
usually under the hood of event multicastdelegate is used - it s a class inherited from delegation and containing list of delegation

1570037
nscoding	nscopying
there is no easy way to copy an objective-c object that does not implement nscopying unless you use nsresponder s suggestion of using nscoding in which case there is. there is nscopyobject but this is perhaps the most dangerous function in all of foundation see nscopyobject considered harmful for my thoughts on this insane function

1570061
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i m not sure if that is the goal from the way you wrote the question but depending on your it environment i d expect people who use firefox or safari or opera or ... to be less than enthusiastic

post	get
to test your wcf rest service you should definitely get some help in the form of fiddler which allows you to easily create and send off post requests to your url

1570710
post	get
well to get the correct html from the server you have to send a post request containing the form data

1570729
x86	64bit
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access

1570798
serializable	deserialization
taking the examples from the question above of fooexception deriving from barexception deriving from runtimeexception and then removing barexception from the inheritance chain i put together a sample application to try serializable and deserialization in various combinations

1570915
folder	directory
since in svn the branch is a cheap copy we try to always branch at the root of the project directory if its the folder trunk itself then the branch will be off trunk -- this avoids confusion later about who branched off where and avoids having to run commands to find it out

using macros you get nothing like that so macros are liable to create strange errors if you put things of the wrong type in them

1571524
union	distinct
if you rarely do a union of all distinct event subtypes and you have little overlapping functionality then separate tables may work out well

1571531
cos	sin
one simple way to calculate sin cos functions is with taylor series as shown under trigonometric functions here

1571531
cos	sin
fourier series calculations require some sin cos values to be known

1571549
cos	sin
as a side point it doesn t make any sense to represent these functions using fourier series since you re just creating a circular problem of how you then evaluate the sin cos terms of series

1571560

1572940
range	max	range	min	min	max
32 and 127 are min and max range of chars you want to be generated

1572956
integer	fractions
difference in hours is clearly 1 3600 of the difference in seconds -- you ll have to decide how to display a typically-fractionary number of hours ago of course hour and fractions with some digits or round to closest integer number of hours or what else

1572993
put	get
the only way i managed to get it working was to remove the whole invokelater new runnable ... mantra and put the new mainwindow setvisible init sequence directly in main which i guess is very ugly and breaks the concept of the gui running in a threaded manner

1573002
mouse	keyboard
also don t forget when using the self referential form you don t have to name your element so you have to include that extra naming requirement for the elementname form when comparing how much typing and context switching between the mouse and keyboard

by strong convention properties accessor are written as methods named after the instance variable for the getter and the capitalised instance variable name prefixed with set for the setter so for instance variable foo you d have foo and setfoo

1573430
getter	setter
a separate but related addition to objective-c 2.0 are the property synthesize dynamic keywords for generating the getter and setter

google-chrome	safari
edit when i say major browsers specifically i meant safari 4.0.3 google-chrome 3.0.195.27 and ie 8.0.6

1575582
tostring	gethashcode
the problem is that you need a single class for it to compare and it uses both tostring and gethashcode in the comparison which is why your dictionary idea didn t work it isn t comparing the elements of the dictionary it s comparing the tostring and gethashcode of it

1575584
hash	md5
- i create a md5 hash

1575631
width	height
the total number of pixels will be its width multiplied by its height

1575648
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome safari the dialog is not opened in center of the screen but a long way down the page

1575648
google-chrome	safari
- works in safari google-chrome

1575648
google-chrome	safari
- do not work in safari google-chrome

1575653
post	get
the only difference between the two sets is that the delete routes use get and are supposed to return json while the othere ones use post and redirect

1575675
dictionary	map
now that is simple enough it just builds a dictionary map for the objects during the clone and populates it with any object that should not be cloned

1575716
button	checkbox
i am making a program which dynamically adds objects such as a button or a checkbox to a form

1575806
awt	swing
however the relationship between swing and awt is seriously messed up

1575812
accessor	properties
while properties are new accessor have always been a key part of objc

1575812
accessor	properties
properties just made it easier to write accessor

1575812
getter	setter
or we just typed a lot of getter and setter by hand

1575937
post	get
so i thought i would post them here to get some clarification

1575964
post	get
i ve used thirster42 s solution before but that only works for me when it s a get not a post

1575964
firefox	safari
it also seems to be browser-specific -- firefox won t submit the form when the user hits enter in a textbox but safari will

1575964
firefox	safari
firefox 3.5.3 safari 4.0.3 macosx

1575964
opera	firefox
a basically you don t. i believe this is because the behavior is inconsistent across platforms and web browsers and what works for firefox might not work for ie or opera

1575964
firefox	safari
tested in firefox safari and ie 8

1575965
versioning	upgrade
is there a way to roll my existing users into this new free versioning that allows a paid upgrade so the existing users are treated as if they ve already paid for this upgrade

1576015
ia-32	x86
the canonical reference to x86 is probably the intelâ 64 and ia-32 architectures software developer s manual

1576040
post	get
i have researched getjson which works great except that i need to post not get

1576047
folder	directory
you would need to apply this permission on the folder that the virtual directory points to

1576058
versioning	upgrade
then make your paid versioning the free paid upgrade versioning and remove your existing lite versioning from the store

1576058
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
a problem with this is how to get all of your existing customers to upgrade to the intermediate versioning that flips the paid switch in time to migrate the application to the free paid upgrade model

1576105
post	get
you can do a post but what you want is a jsonp request to get around the cross domain issues

1576106
post	get
when i just run the php or throw the url in the browser with the post info concatenated i don t get that extra space and 1 at the end.

1576115
cpython	ironpython
i don t really see a style argument to be made here either way -- both multiprocessing in cpython 2.6 and threading in the current versions of jython and ironpython let you code in extremely similar ways and styles

1576134
post	get
a rest-based webservice is the cgi-based application that is similar to using an html form element generally using get but if you are doing anything that can be destructive or change databases you will want to use post

1576134
client-side	server-side
you can write applications using these apis in any language which is the advantage as you can then choose which language is best for the server-side and that has no impact on what you do on the client-side

1576167

if you do decide to use a template engine an alternative to smarty is the recently released twig engine

1576231
pop-up	dialog
in an asp.net mvc application which is not to have client side objects like activexes flash or java applets javascript is ok is it feasible to imagine it being possible that when an upload file dialog box pop-up it will only show the files i specify

1576237
jboss	glassfish
how can i make this project portable between jboss 4.2.3 or 5 and glassfish 3

1576249
move	drag
how would one go about either using the 3d components of wpf or using a pseudo 3d effect to create a bowl effect where the user is looking down on a bowl and can drag around rectangles and have the rectangles perspective change so that it looks like they move up down and around the bowl

1576316
awt	swing
while basically all of the core java libraries are there swing and awt libraries are not

1576340
rss	feed
especially for blogs there needs to be a way to automatically list posts chronologically and generate a rss feed

1576374
integer	unsigned
but it returns a signed number where i want an unsigned number because i want to send that number to the server as an integer during encryption and have to decrypt it at server

1576467
google-chrome	firefox
i have version 3.0.195.27 and want to debug some javascript that is working in ie firefox but not in google-chrome

1576472
hide	show
the menu show four default options settings about flash... i would like to hide them

1576518
versioning	upgrade
if you don t want your website to be taken over upgrade to drupal 5 or better 6 and use the maintained and secure openid modules of these versioning

1576531
filepath	unc
when i access file whith unc filepath from asp.net i found the following problem

1576536
subtraction	multiplication
this also works for subtraction and multiplication

1576536
integer	unsigned
update - it looks java 8 will have support in the form of library methods for treating int and long as unsigned types - see unsigned integer arithmetic api now in jdk 8 by joseph darcy oracle

1576544
rss	feed
if you do not use summaries but instead let the module create summaries automatically then if you change these settings in module options then all of your content will be served by the rss feed

1576594
google-chrome	firefox
but i changed a few code in the plugin to add links to thumbnails it works perfectly on firefox google-chrome

1576595
.htaccess	httpd.conf
is there an inbuilt way to read the active directoryindex in .htaccess or httpd.conf etc with php

1576613
put	get
..but i m getting errors on that mentioning that only get put and delete requests are allowed.

1576644
emacs	textmate
this short screencast looks at the latter comparing textmate and emacs

1576650
typedef	struct
i believe that typedef remains a pure c keyword and really only happens to work with objective-c types usually because they happen to be implemented as struct

1576655
post	put	post	get	put	get
the reason you re getting an error about only get put and delete requests being allowed is that you re using a post request

1576655
post	put
you can do it by changing post to put in your link_to call

1576689
free	malloc
and one of my concern is why the same solution for malloc free works perfect

1576689
free	malloc
when hacking malloc free functions itâ s okay

1576695
inherited	subclassing
if the object model is an inherited hierarchy then the relationship should not need to be bi-directional and the solution is to obtain the subclassing instance from the subclassing dao

1576695
set	bag
if the object model is a bi-directional relationship then you need to set inverse true on the set or bag at the one end of the relationship - in this case basicentity

1576695
set	bag
hibernate 3 allows the use of indexed collections at the one end of the relationship but the hibernate 2 functionality with set or bag should be enough to test the theory

1576814
quicksort	mergesort
you should check other sorting algorithms as well at least if you re not taught a few more quicksort mergesort etc. in class

1576838
post	get
since in a dilbertesque way everything get changed every second i was wondering if there is any simple way of grouping _post data i mean sending post like this

1576894
inherited	properties
since qtextbrowser inherited from qtextedit you should use it and set the readonly properties to false

1576900
post	get
which allows to send sms via email http get post rest xml etc

1576948
webrat	cucumber
you can see this by the innovative testing framework like cucumber webrat shoulda coulda rspec test spec

1576966
sorting	filtering
regarding collectionview you can define collectionviewsource in the view xaml and then bind its sorting and filtering properties to viewmodel

1577026
srp	principles
well while you can do this as described in other answers i believe there is more important thing to be answered regarding your example and that is that you are probably violating srp principles with class having many dependencies

1577032
width	height
using var dst new bitmap width height pixelformat.format32bppargb

1577065
implements	extends
it s very useful if you want to make sure a class implements an interface or extends abstract class ie for plugins adapters ...

1577069
profiling	instrumentation
the closest thing i can find to instrumentation program flow and generate test coverage files in my build settings is generate profiling code which doesn t appear to do what i want it to do

1577096
switching	screens
it can do the basic switching to full screens and back to normal size stunts however with one exception

1577096
switching	screens
on the first fresh load of the app if i switching to full screens mode first and then click to play the movie the player would be in full screens yet the movie itself would remain in it s original size

1577096
width	height
the videodisplay object even returns the expected width height but the movie just plays in it s original size

1577096
switching	screens
if i switching screens sizes during movie playback then the movie size will shrink or stretch as it should

1577097
boost	stl
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly

1577142
s-function	simulink
for instance if you want to synchronise 2 tools or your s-function simulink requires additional information

1577142
matlab	simulink
but then such a file is propably called by matlab simulink in the first place

1577153
ssl	https	xml-rpc	json-rpc
if you use https ssl on the server side it shouldn t matter if you use xml-rpc or json-rpc

1577188
vxworks	ecos
ecos vxworks linux good posix support so you can use this

1577205
super	self
you are not checking if self super init

1577205
super	self
in your second code sample was successful if self super init ... return self

1577264
folder	directory
it is only the inc folder in the root directory and not the inc folder higher up de hiarchie

1577264
folder	directory
i donâ t have this problem with the images folder wich is also in the root directory

1577273
mockups	balsamiq
i prefer to do mockups using something like balsamiq - that way the customer doesn t think it s further along than it actually is

1577283
gridview	objectdatasource
at the time of gridview data binding your dropdown does not bound so dropdown does not contain value at that time and 0 value passed to objectdatasource

1577329
folder	directory
while the file is added it also copies the directory structure instead of placing the file at the root of the folder

1577411
gif	png
to check if a picture is a picture you would need to retrieve the content-type as it will usually be image png or image gif

1577413
width	height
is there some way to validate the image size height and width before upload it to server

1577414
range	minimum
the plain old c data types do have such minimum sizes range

1577417
post	get
if it isn t your full code then you need to post more as it s a little hard to get beyond the fact that the library isn t included

1577426
button	checkbox
i have a component that is made up of various components such as a checkbox a slider and some button

1577469
post	get
i ve written a small web application which is basically a jquery powered chat client within the browser to get the post i m polling the server with an ajax request and then appending any new replies i m worried about making this as efficient as possible while not losing the realtime feel

1577517
put	get
get your text and put it in a loop

1577549
post	put
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

1577564
addclass	removeclass
secondly as ken says it s generally better to switch a class on and off and then use addclass and removeclass functions in jquery

1577611
vpn	lan
if it s a machine on your lan or vpn you can use a unc path but you ll have to know each machine s username and password

1577611
vpn	lan
if the machine is across the network and not on your lan nor vpn wcf sounds like what you re looking for

1577646
g++	gcc
change gcc to g++ if you really care - it may handle better.

1577696
int	double
i need to store a collection of int and double representing nominal and real valued data in c++

1577696
int	double
the efficiency i am talking about is primarily the efficiency of retrieving the int double value of a certain column although fast setting of values is important too

1577696
int	double
after some more thought and reading the suggestions so far it seems that just storing int columns and double columns in two separate vectors is a solid solution

1577696
int	double
just storing as a is okay too i guess but it depends on how fast the conversion between double and int is which is probably pretty impressive

1577705
int	double
but in that case you d have to have some way to know which elements of the vector should be treated as int and which ones should be treated as double

1577705
int	double
to keep track of which ones are int and which ones are double you could use a bitset or something like that

1577705
int	double
if not and exact int precision isn t important then you might as well just store them all as double

1577719
bufferedreader	printwriter
the teacher requires that we use socket bufferedreader printwriter and various other things including bufferedreader s readline method

1577724
children	parent
the restored resources know how to get their own children and parent via the tree s content provider so not all elements of the tree need to be persisted

1577769
put	get
so to reference images that are stored in your app bundle you just need to get the right path to put in your img tag

1577770
for-loop	loops
- sometimes you need to loops through the rows like using a regular for-loop

1577798
int	double
since int can be converted to double without loss of precision.

1577827
config	ini
so what i need is a simple solution with few code and ini config

1577890
width	height
then you can get access to the svg element s width height by

1577893
opera	firefox
in firefox opera and ie this problem doesn t occur

1577903
folder	directory
the folder has to be named forms unless you specified different directory for form classes and make sure sectorsearch is not sectorsearch.php or something

1577943
stdout	fflush
but fflush stdout

1577974
int	double
if you re just dealing with numeric values the standard wrapper classes int double etc will be automatically unboxed to their primitive types when used in expressions

1578002
swt	swing
i m looking to unit test some swt and swing code for a project i m working on and the tests run fine as long as i m running them from eclipse

1578032
swt	swing
i don t know about swt but with swing you can t

1578034
getter	setter
as a minor sub-question i got the impression somehow that getter setter methods are discouraged in javascript is it okay if i use them

1578036
post	get
if neither offers a headless mode then this blog post might give you some ideas how to get rid of the ui for testing

1578038
swt	swing
one advantage this has over the xvfb method is that if you have multiple swing swt projects building simultaneously each build has its own x session

1578055
rss	feed
have a polling service that checks an rss feed

1578055
rss	feed
there s a php rss feed reader and publisher i use called feedforall but you ll have to do the polling bit yourself

1578088

you can configure your nodes to be persistent or transient

1578165
persistent	transient
whether the node is persistent or transient is determined by the pubsub#persist_items configuration field

1578169
exif	xmp
php has built in support for reading exif and iptc metadata but i can t find any way to read xmp

1578190
qlistwidget	qstandarditemmodel
i have looked over the documentation for qlistview qlistwidget qstandarditemmodel etc

i m getting the html out of third-party rss feed

1578398
client-side	server-side
i tried encoding the query string on client-side and decoding it on server-side using something like this

1578512
cvs	svn
i suspect the continued prevalence of cvs svn is much more to do with inertia than anything else

1578512
cvs	svn
however this is clearly not the reason people are using cvs svn

1578529
rss	feed
i m using an xmldatasource to fetch an rss feed on the same domain

1578544
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
you should have a look at qabstractitemmodel and qstandarditemmodel or create a customized teamitemmodel class for your teams that inherits from qabstractitemmodel

1578548
put	get
put together in 15 min and far from perfect but you get the idea

1578653
post	get
after reading a forum post on my isp s forums it seems i have to ask them for my data source url to get whitelisted

1578721
sharepoint	spsite
do we need to install sharepoint on webserver in order to use sharepoint.dll spsite object or just adding the reference to sharepoint.dll in asp.net is sufficient

1578730
bids	ssis
do i use ssis with bids vs2008 can i read data in a package and create tables on the fly

1578793
entities	entitymanager
so somehow i need to be able to scope entities to a particular entitymanager factory

1578801
cpython	ironpython
or if you need to add this to an already existing client then you could still bind in either ironpython or cpython as an embedded scripting engine

1578814
children	parent
inamingcontainer is just a marker interface that tells asp.net a control contains children that may need to be accessed independently of their parent control so child controls get those extra pretty ids we asp.net developers have come to know and love

1578819
tunnel	vpn
just use regular sql connections over a secure vpn or an ssh tunnel

1578819
tunnel	vpn
since the linked server talks to your server over a vpn or ssh tunnel all data is send encrypted over the internet

1578828
profiling	instrumentation
but dynamic analysis tools profiling tools that either rely on transparent instrumentation of the code or use sampling can tell you after one or several typical executions you provide the entries that you judge typical how often this or that function was executed

1578836
tabs	tabpanel
height - sets the height of the body of the tabs does not include the tabpanel headers

1578875
superclass	subclassing
add a method _validate_b self b single leading underscore to indicate protected callable from derived classes but not by general client code that validates the value of b which only subclassing know vs the value of a which the abstract superclass does know

1578875
superclass	subclassing
since the responsibility of that change lies entirely with the subclassing then the responsibility for triggering validation must also be with them the superclass can perform validation given the proposed new value of b but it cannot know when validity must be checked

1578875
inherited	subclassing
if most subclassing fall into broad categories in terms of the strategies they use to affect their b s values you can factor that out into either intermediate abstract classes inheriting from the general one and specializing the general approach to determining b including the validation call or better if feasible some form of strategy design pattern typically implemented via either composition or mix-in inherited

1578908
nfa	dfa
optional convert the nfa to a dfa

1578960
range	min
if all you need for your purpose is a rough approximation of time or your users are only estimating anyway then consider option buttons or a dropdown list with range of duration 0 to 5 minutes 5 to 15 minutes 15 min to 1 hour over an hour.

1578978
webclient	webrequest
there may be a way to add cookies to the underlying webrequest created by the webclient if so you could use it instead

1579013
hash	md5
let s say i want to calculate a hash of a data structure using a hash algorithm like md5 which accepts a serial stream for the purposes of equivalence checking

1579014
mouseup	mousedown
if you track the mouse position by capturing any mousedown events you will know where the last click mouseup happened and that should allow you to reconstruct things

1579022
affinity	processors
scheduling is still determined by thread priority but it can be influenced by setting thread affinity and thread ideal processors as discussed in this topic

1579042
superclass	subclassing
if this is what you want then your design must assign responsibility by decomposing things into the part the superclass is responsible for and the part the subclassing is responsible for

1579047

then i put ssms in sqlcmd mode query - cmdmode and it still didn t give the error

1579407
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout
you could use show hide or fadein fadeout combinations with three separate div containers for the different form sections

1579427
put	get
if i ve understood you correctly you need to put the code to get the value inside an event handler for the input textarea for example in an event handler foe the keypress event

1579457
getter	setter
it may be that the setter has logic that should run or perhaps the implementation used an ivar with name different from the getter setter or perhaps two ivars that need to be released and or have their value set to nil

1579512
post	get
does anyone have any ideas why the server is receiving http 1.0 using a post but using a get shows http 1.1

the reason for which i avoid sorting is that it may take some more time and because after i make the first set of grouping some of them will be locked and the unlocked grouping will be dissolved and regrouped using a different time offset

1579771
sorting	grouping
and when dissolving grouping the files order may be changed and they will require sorting again

1579788
udp	tcp
i would suggest using udp rather than tcp with manual ack commands this way you don t get the constant connected sockets as per your boss

1579799

put	get
if you have two columns as varchar and put in the values 10 and 20 and add them you ll get 1020 instead of 30 which you d likely expect

1579979
pull	push
so create a separate say gitrepos directory and then each local copy should push and pull from there

1580034
cvs	rcs
this capability similar to the keyword expansion in cvs rcs and others only really works with a linear history

1580034
cvs	svn
part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs

1580063
unsigned	short
the problem is that the function we found that does this operation named from the images and video processing lib supports only the types unsigned char ipp8u signed unsigned short ipp16s ipp16u and float ipp32f

1580099
post	get
for example if you are storing if the http type of the request get post etc this can only ever be a couple of types and better to store as an int and get improved i o + query performance

1580108
accessor	properties
in fact if you look at il you ll see the properties accessor replaced by get and or set methods

1580121
profiler	yourkit
yourkit is an excellent commercial profiler that has good eclipse integration

1580126
post	get
redirect with a 303 after post to avoid webpage has expired will it work if there are more bytes than a get request can handle

1580160
post	get
if you wanted to use post and _files i think the closest you could get would be to point upload_tmp_dir at a ramdisk

1580204
int	double
unforunately both of these methods require you transform your byte into one of int float or double depending on the image format

1580216
put	get
but i don t know what to put in routes.rb to get it to hook up correctly.

1580292
width	height
i have a project with a lot of frames and when i reload my project they are resized to a width and height of 443x270 or thereabout

personally i would attach a componentlistener to the window and in the componentresized method check the new window size and set the width equal to the height or vice versa

1580412
kde	gnome
freedesktop.org which provides some standards that gnome and kde conform to says that shortcuts should appear in .desktop files

1580424
int	double
when it is forced to assign that int result to a double variable it converts the int 0 to a double 0.0

1580507
x86	64bit
i assume when i target x64 the program will use the 64bit .net framework 3.5 and similarly 32-bit framework for x86

1580545
put	get
for some of our users we do activation of node-locked licenses for others they get their activation by a web page or email and for others we put a license server on their premises

1580613
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is a stand-alone subset of the netbeans profiler

1580623
x86	64bit
in that case the correct solution was to explicitly compile to x86 this is a small tool that would not gain from running in 64bit

1580630
width	height
when the user hovers over the ad the flash movie expands by increasing the height and width of the flash object

1580883
ssl	https
all urls served via apache use the http protocol or its ssl variant https

1580907
post	get
edit fyi if i manually change the columns in my database to match what hibernate is generating i get another error cannot instantiate abstract class or interface post

1580926
post	get
thus for post superclass of status you get owner_uid and parent_pid as column names because uid and pid are respective pk column names

1580928
jobs	cron
schedule cron jobs on remote machines

1580930
qgroupbox	qvboxlayout
i am using qt designer and i know how to use a qvboxlayout and qgroupbox but it seems there is no such thing as a qgroupvboxlayout

qgroupbox	qvboxlayout
so i have to put a qvboxlayout inside of a qgroupbox but if i modify the dimensions of one i have to do the same to the other

1580936
integer	unsigned
depending on whether you re using an unsigned integer or not and which version of mysql you re running you run the rink of getting nasty negative values for the primary key or worse the row simply won t be inserted and will throw an error

1581018
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this works in all browsers i ve had to support including ie6+ firefox opera safari

1581018
pop-up	dialog
as an alternative to a pop-up window i d suggest the dialog plugin for jquery

1581031
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the nice thing is that you ll get versioning and the ability to upgrade and uninstall from inside eclipse

1581034
udp	tcp
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

1581060
integer	fractions
truncate the fractions digits truncate the result into an integer

1581060
integer	fractions
truncate the fractions digits truncate the result into an integer

1581153
move	drag
you didn t specify if the axes always remain where they originally started or if they change depending on where the draggable item is on drag start like if you move it a little bit then let go and try to drag it some more

1581172
hide	show
in some cases conditional formatting will do the job but only for appearance -- it can t do things like show hide controls or alter the rowsource of dropdown lists or requery them

1581202
width	height
edit the problem isn t the width its the height of the container being overlapped by the new height of the now populated grid

1581204
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in firefox safari opera and google-chrome but ie 6 7 simply do not show the alert

1581248
int	double
when you write 200 is an int literal which is then converted into double via widening primitive conversion

1581259
min	max
as long as it s well documented and you provide methods to allow the user of the library to control the threadpool such as min max threads and maybe the option to not use a threadpool at all

1581400
children	parent
this function takes rows that don t have children and recursively generate fullid for each row up to their parent

1581466
subtraction	addition
the preferance is brackets first then divide multioply and last subtraction and then addition

1581481
ant	maven
for example in java it is common to use ant or maven scripts that can be used in both the ides and as separate build processes

1581493
public	protected
it s important to remember that that access modifiers private protected public are controlling class access not instance access

1581495
children	parent
once all the classes are built up into a tree like structure - one top level class containing a whole lot of other classes the isvalid method is called on the parent which in turn calls isvalid on all of its children

1581495
children	parent
if isvalid returns false the errors property on the parent is set with the errors properties of all of its children that failed the isvalid call

1581504
postgresql	mysql
actually i don t have a postgresql on hand to test if this actually works and mysql doesn t support sql-99 s with recursive and i don t seriously recommend it either

1581569
rfcomm	l2cap
i m having trouble understanding the api to set up a l2cap or rfcomm client server running on osx like i can with bluez on linux

1581607
dwoo	smarty
however if you are trying to make html templates i would highly recommend you to get a real templating engine like smarty dwoo or savant

1581611
hash	salt
and the salt should be unique for each user and should be stored along with the password hash

1581614
salt	md5
mr atwood wrote about the strength of md5 against rainbow tables and basically with a long salt like that you re sitting pretty though some random punctuation numbers it could improve it

1581639
button	checkbox
button checkbox combobox and radiobutton controls

1581647
implements	extends
sudo noob was wrong with the statement extends should be implements

1581663
salt	md5
the benefit of having a salt is that it makes it harder for an attacker to pre-generate the md5 signature of every dictionary word

1581663
salt	md5
but if an attacker learns that you have a fixed salt they could then pre-generate the md5 signature of every dictionary word prefixed by your fixed salt

1581663
salt	md5
it makes it a bit more expensive to check the password since you need to look up the salt before you can generate the md5 signature but it makes it much more difficult for an attacker to pre-generate md5 s

1581668
firefox	safari
moreover the sun test your jvm page crashes every browser firefox 3.0 safari i tried under osx 10.6

1581687
portrait	landscape
physically rotate the device from portrait to landscape

1581687
portrait	landscape
animate the portrait view highguicontroller to landscape

1581687
portrait	landscape
this will take care of step 2 it will rotate the portrait view to landscape in either direction

1581687
portrait	landscape
that should present the landscape view after the rotation animation is complete and then dismiss it after the device is rotated back to portrait

1581702
accessor	properties
i m currently building a node editor as in blender and am having trouble getting delegates to properties accessor from a generic type

1581702
accessor	properties
does anyone have any experience with creating delegates for properties accessor

1581741
accessor	properties
to create a delegate to the properties accessor you just use getgetmethod and getsetmethod

1581754
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
however i d conjecture that every solution that uses addition subtraction multiplication or division which cannot be done by shifting would also have that problem

1581755
post	get
hi am trying to make an application that post data to a joomla login page but the only thing i get back is cookies is not enabled

1581772
sorting	grouping
in this approach you are using the db for sorting and a simple comparison for grouping

1581798
width	height
you will need to adjust the thumbnail and full-sized image width and height accordingly

1581820
ienumerable	ienumerator
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach

1581851
dlsym	dlopen
on posix it works pretty much the same but the functions are slightly different use dlopen to load the dynamic library and dlsym to retrieve the symbol

1581851
dlsym	dlopen
the programming library howto describes this in more detail or see the man pages for dlopen and dlsym

1581852
int	chars
in a 32-bit architecture sizeof int would return 4 while sizeof chars would return 1

1581877
ant	maven
i d like to benefit from the maven dependency management and from the available plugins right now i m using huge custom ant files

1581892
udp	tcp	tunnel	packets
this is how for example openvpn works - it receives the raw ip packets over udp or tcp and tunnel them back into the kernel over a tun tap interface

1581895
put	get
i m using an array for the pages i ve already visited to filter the links i add to the queue but if there are more than one threads and they get the same links on different pages they put duplicate links to the queue

1581919
hash	salt
improving upon salt hash add pepper

1581919
hash	salt
if you want extra security the security folks now 2017 recommend adding a pepper to the automatically salt password hash

1581938
min	max
inspired by javascripts variable arguments in max min and list comprehension in functional languages i tried to get the same in vb.net using generic extension methods given ienumerable of t as resulttype

1581981
switching	screens
but when i switching the canvas to full screens mode the custom cursor only appears only for a moment or so

1581985
strlen	strcpy
i m considering refactoring my code not to directly store the tokens on the the char but instead store a copy of them by mallocing space to strlen token +1 then using strcpy

1582007
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
file uploads using the xmlhttprequest object is not possible in all browsers only firefox and safari google-chrome support it so for a cross-browser implementation use the trick

1582014
children	parent
the parent that acts as your background should be changed to a sibling before the container that wraps your children

1582016
unicode	ucs
package ucs error unknown unicode character 79297 u+135c1

1582022
unicode	ucs

1582035
ftp	telnet
pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh ftp passwd telnet etc

1582063
portrait	landscape
i can get the demo code to run in landscape mode but the contents always render as if they were in portrait mode so while the simulator displays he device in landscape mode the pagecontrol is always on the side of the screen

1582083
rss	feed
please check this jfeed javascript jquery rss atom feed parser plugin

1582098
post	get
this is certainly good enough for my needs however i will test another library when i get a monent and post the results here

1582101
hash	salt
if you are storing any user passwords that will be used for authentication that your own application will perform the best way of storing this is with a salt one-way hash function

1582101
hash	salt
any attacker even one with access to the raw database would have to brute-force reverse engineer all of your salt hash

1582113
jtable	jtextpane
i created jtable with jtextpane as cell editor.i want to stop cell editing and want to do some processing if i pressed enter key in jtextpane .and i also want to use single line in jtextpane

1582134
width	height
i used a simple screen representation where div#wrapper is just a box with specified width and height overflow set to hidden so the animated elements don t get shown when they are out of boundaries and two divs with ids of #left and #right each has absolute position width 50 #left is moved -50 to the left and #right is moved -50 to the right

1582181
inotifycollectionchanged	ilist
the only solution that i ve thought of is inhereting form a base class which will use reflection to iterate through all the ilist fields try to cast them to inotifycollectionchanged and will add an event handler which will call notify

1582198
put	get
so in my method i go off and get these values from the database and put them into my application

1582219
google-chrome	firefox
with the following code my site only works in google-chrome on ie7 8 and firefox show me only the background

1582219
google-chrome	firefox

1582243
post	get
i m not sure where to get started so if anyone has any ideas please post them

1582250
post	get
you ll need to supply these as get or post data with the asynchronous request

1582297
children	parent
parent 1 children

1582297
post	put	post	get	put	get
i want to use the methoddispatcher so that each of the above can have get post put delete functions

1582309
post	get
i would not like to get a thread-stall while a chunk of slow post data comes in

1582316
interpreted-language	compiled-language
ruby is an interpreted-language so it can be up to 50 times slower executing code than just-in-time compiled-language like java and c# based on tests i ve seen

1582350
cos	sin
i am trying to for example locate sin cos and tan in a string like 1+sin 28 +cos 72

1582381
disk	ram
if your index is small enough to fit comfortably into ram and you don t update it frequently you can maintain an index on the disk and then create a ramdirectory from it using the ramdirectory directory dir constructor

1582386
width	height
so the whole region from 10 0 - width - height to 0 0

1582440
post	get
based on this post it looks like using dbcc log database_name in sql 2000 will get the transaction log information

1582512
getter	setter
and the references to objects by getter and setter

1582515
stdout	stderr
yes your observation is confirmed - the order of the last three args is indeed stdin stdout stderr so the outpipe in the docs is erroneously getting passed as the input instead

1582523
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol object with some tabitem objects inside

1582523
tabcontrol	tabitem
for the second design i tried to adjust horizontalalignment property to center in tabitem objects and horizontalcontentaglinment property to center in tabcontrol object but neither works

1582549
int	boolean
0 string int and float undef and the empty string evaluate as false in boolean tests

1582581
super	implements
suppose i have a mysuperclass with a category containing all its private methods and i want to implements a mysubclass overriding or calling super to one of the mysuperclass private methods

int	chars
i use an int 100 instead of a chars 10 10 to make some looping and comparisons simpler

1582604
accessor	properties
... constructs a propertydescriptor for a properties that follows the standard java convention by having getfoo and setfoo accessor methods

1582610
udp	tcp
one is that the web relies on tcp not udp

1582745
put	get
you would have to put some work in to get a unit test application based on an xunit framework to target multiple cores ie uses multiple threads or write your own framework that does it

1582787
processors	hyperthreading
note here doesn t mean hyperthreading just normal multi-core processors functionalities

1582794
fpdf	fpdi
check out fpdf with fpdi

1582846
button	checkbox
one approach here is to associate a label control with the checkbox and then using a combination of css and jquery to make the actual checkbox itself invisible render the label as a button and modify the label s border property as the checkbox is checked or unchecked

1582846
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this code works in google-chrome safari opera firefox and ie thanks to a conditional-comment hack since ie treats hidden form elements differently to other browsers

1582846
submit	submission
if you submit the enclosing form you get ordinary html checkbox behaviour in the resulting form submission

1582854
ssl	https
what auger said plus get yourself an ssl certificate and server everything over https

1582856
innodb	myisam
innodb does it also supports foreign keys for instance -- it s far more advanced that myisam

1582945
min	max
i d use min and max for conciseness but three nested if thens would be just as good i think

1582972
int	chars
especially for this domain where there s a tiny vocabulary of possible chars it would be better to use something like an array of int where the array is indexed by thechar - a or something like that

1582975
put	get
in the constructor and add a static variable initializer for numbertomonthmap but that doesn t work - you d get a nullreferenceexception immediately because you d be trying to put the value into a map which didn t exist yet

1583029
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
basically it boils down to long-addition multiplication division subtraction

1583030
google-chrome	safari
safari is similar to google-chrome in that there isn t an easy way to run multiple versions on the same machine

1583065
opera	firefox
it works fine in firefox ie and opera basically it expands a content block originally filling half of the page to the full page

1583082
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
second you must have as many calls to free as you do to malloc and calloc but realloc can mess with the counting

1583082
strtok	getline
note that the pointers returned by strtok are all pointers into the single chunk of space allocated by getline

1583082
free	malloc
all the subsequent frees on the parts of dest are trying to free an address not returned by malloc and valgrind is trying to tell you that

1583082
free	strdup
note that you will need to free each of the separately allocated strdup d strings as well as the array of character pointers that are accessed via dest

1583088
websphere	ibm
as for ivr s you could have a look at ibm s websphere voice response or genesys voice portal

nemerle	boo
maybe boo and nemerle macros are false by his standards

1583108
mp3	flv
i need to extract the audio data from a flv and inject it into a mp3 with c#

1583126
implements	extends

1583146
lisp	scheme
for something truly different try lisp or scheme

1583152
pascal	delphi	lisp	scheme
i ve programmed in pascal delphi assembly c c++ scheme lisp java c# and cuda

you define validation once mostly declaratively and it works both server-side and client-side

1583174
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
i ll second lisp scheme and also suggest haskell as a language that will challenge the way you think about programming

1583188
lisp	scheme
in my case this came through my studies in tcl tk which is multi-paradigm but i imagine you can get the same effect from any of the strongly functional languages such as lisp or scheme

1583218
subscript	superscript
is it possible to display subscript or superscript text in a uitableviewcell without making custom cells

1583237

i would try both scheme or lisp and python in that order

1583276
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
i m importing audiotoolbox avfoundation and coreaudio

1583289
firefox	safari
the xmlhttprequest object was implemented as an activex object in internet explorer and has later become a native javascript object in most modern browsers firefox safari

1583352
hash	md5
use a cookie and store a unique value maybe a guid md5 hash or something

1583370
udp	tcp
if it receives it as udp is not as reliable as tcp of course

1583448
google-chrome	firefox
if you swap the padding for margin it works the same in both firefox and google-chrome on my pc anyway

1583479
public	protected
you can expose the base protected method with a public method on the derived class for example

1583489
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
then there are some common members that are implemented by every type like equals tostring gethashcode

1583492
children	parent
you can do it by filtering the children of a parent to return only text nodes but if your question is about performing some manipulation on the text then get the parent element and manipulate the text contents

1583503
equals	gethashcode
to provide common members such as equals finalize gethashcode tostring..

1583521
lisp	scheme
i can incrementally build and run my programs later i saw this in lisp scheme and forth

1583521
lisp	scheme
c++ templates - writing code at compile-time is extremely powerful see scheme and lisp

1583521
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme

google-chrome	firefox
especially why would this work in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

1584201
networkstream	sslstream
you would pass a normal unencrypted networkstream which is the encapsulation of the tcp socket connection as the parameter to an sslstream object

1584201
networkstream	sslstream
once you ve finished with the initial ssl transmissions you can simply close the sslstream and use the underlying networkstream for subsequent plaintext transmissions

1584598
hide	show
the appropriate message is injected into the #screen div and show hide is then applied

1584604
equals	gethashcode
you could overload equals and gethashcode but that is not recommended for mutable types

1584608
width	height
another a bit clumsier way might be to make the function accept a pointer to a single-dimensional array and both width and height given as arguments and calculate the indexes into a two-dimensional representation yourself

1584682
min	max
maybe you could use the defaultview.rowfilter to launch a query that group by unique columns and select the min or max rowid as the row to keep

1585110
width	height
when i assigned the div height and width in the map will not render properly instead it either shrinks to top or left depending on the attribute assigned

1585110
width	height
but when i explicitly assign height and width in px say 400px the map will render perfectly

1585115
getter	setter
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter

1585130
width	height
the problem is observing document.documentelement for change of height and width of viewport or document.body depending on quirks standard mode

1585154

fink	macports
by the way you might want to check out macports and fink two independent projects that tailor and package for os x hundreds of popular open source packages

1585548
uiview	uiwindow
the interesting bit here is that uiwindow is itself a subclass of uiview so you can add all four views to your window directly

1585565
width	height
you can get that from the width of the rectangle and the difference between the x coordinates of a and b or height and y coordinates

1585565
width	height
based on the width and height you can check which case applies and the other case will be on the extension of a side of the rectangle

1585599
accessor	properties
if you want fast access you could look at hyperdescriptor or there are ways of compiling a delegate to the properties accessor or you can build an expression from the string and compile it including a cast to object if you want a known signature rather than calling the much slower dynamicinvoke

1585643
mouseover	mouseout
i had to revert back to mouseover mouseout like this

1585643

1585666
mouseleave	mouseenter
the hover method is a convenience method that binds event handler to the mouseenter and mouseleave events

1585666
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should bind to the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

1585666
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
edit the difference between mouseenter and mouseover is that mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble

1585666
mouseover	mouseenter
this means that you ll get a mouseover event if the mouse moves into any element inside the one you bound to which is probably not what you want whereas you ll only get a mouseenter event if the mouse entered that element itself

1585669
public	protected
you could store them as protected variables in your asp.net page s code-behind and then use databinding expressions to store them as public variables in your javascript .

1585688
portrait	landscape
load up the app and then change the simulator s orientation a few times from landscape to portrait and it should occur

1585772
width	height
so instead of creating a move and resize effect for each item in the layout which would actually set the width and height explicitly set the matrix

1586067
qobject	qmetaobject	qobject	qwidget
i m afraid you can t use connectslotsbyname for the parent-child issues with qwidget but if you really want it you have all the metadata available in qmetaobject so you can write a function that works like connectslotsbyname on any pair set of qobject s

1586069
getter	setter
following the suggestions from brian agnew and nicky de maeyer use both setter and getter and an array or an object in the constructor

1586069
getter	setter
if you were to use setter and getter solely then you would have to set each individual property in your code after the object is instantiated

1586069
getter	setter
using getter and setter you get encapsulation of the logic that will drive each property that you need to manage within these objects

1586069
getter	setter

1586474
submit	submission
i thought about folder submission where the user selects the paths of the one folder or many folders he wants to submit and the system would then internally analyze the content and break them into either multiple entries or 1 entry and then populate as many entries as needed just as if it were done through a web form

1586480

1586655
innodb	myisam
i just found this article which provides an example of a converting a large table from myisam to innodb while this isn t what you are doing he uses an intermediate memory table and describes going from memory to innodb in an efficient way - ordering the table in memory the way that innodb expects it to be ordered in the end

1586658
accelerometer	gyroscope

this is important because new folder are being created every day and if i always copy them all from source dir to month stamped directory i will eventually copy last month s file to this months folder

1586715
punctuation	words
you could read one words at a time with fscanf then eliminate any punctuation so t other appears as words t and other and doesn t appears as doesn and t - if you like

1587452
disk	ram
the reason i want to use apc cache as general cache is that i m not happy with pear cache_lite from pear in terms of using it for variable caching as it stores it on the disk and disk i o is a bottleneck whereas ram is not and apc stores variables in ram not in files on the disk

1587452
opcache	apc
so anyone have any experience or knows if it is possible to setup apc to only run as general cache being called via it s api in my php code similarly to that of pear cache_lite while i maintain another opcache in my case xcache

i need some advice on what i should test and how to make my classes more behavioral and not simple data containers with a bunch of getter setter

1587550
organization	naming
for your colleague to bring his naming convention from a previous organization into a new one without checking local standards is bad practice

1587551
organization	naming
however in an organization one person or a group defines the database naming conventions standardizes it and others will follow it whether they like it or not

1587625
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 9.04 with tpm emulator 0.60 from mario strasser

1587720
ubuntu	linux	kde	gnome
do they work similarly in mac os x and linux gnome kde ubuntu or wherever the difference is or is it completely different

1587774
ienumerable	iqueryable
the actor class doesn t implement ienumerable or iqueryable so you can t run a query on it and anyway actor is a type not an instance of a type .

1587783
kde	gnome
the xscreensaver faq seems to suggest that gnome and kde each have their own screensaver frameworks

1587786
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can t do a select directly over the actor class since it does not implement ienumerable nor iqueryable

1587810

i have a parent class with several children

1587843
webclient	httpwebrequest
do you already have the relevant code to use webclient or httpwebrequest

1587855
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended
i ve subclassed uitableview as krtableview and implemented the four touch-based methods touchesbegan touchesended touchesmoved and touchescancelled so that i can detect when a touch-based event is being handled on a uitableview

1587857
post	get
my current workaround is to allow users to set a compatability flag to say that it s safe to send the parameters as a post request instead in the case where the uri would be too long but this is not ideal since the protocol i m using is restful and get should be used for queries

1587902
rss	feed
i can t rely on something like an rss feed and i need to ignore minor noise like date text

1587954
innodb	myisam
should i use myisam or innodb table format

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i only want to works on all latest browser which is ff2 3 ie7 ie8 safari google-chrome opera latest

1588003
int	double
this double value multiplied to 100 as int is send to a device cash register and this values must be correct

1588020
post	get
i can call it from raw javascript or jquery to post get data

1588046
post	get
i just noticed a strange thing in midp 2.0 api the httpconnection class apidocs make explicit references to methods get post and head but no other methods

1588057
innodb	myisam
should i use myisam or innodb table format

1588128

1588162
google-chrome	firefox
when i use firefox or google-chrome this code does a get over this thispage.aspx

1588164
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i recommend using a version control system bazaar hg svn git

1588179
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that we are trying to upgrade our versioning with the one use with tfs2010 but we cannot find the dll that we were using microsoft.teamfoundation.webaccess

1588190
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
probably because firefox google-chrome handles the click on the tag and opera does it on the tag

1588216
loops	if-statement
it would still involve a loops to find the right constructor but one loops with a simple if-statement to find the right one is far preferrable to looking at arguments and attempting to match this way

1588283
pop-up	dialog
once an hour i want to pop-up a dialog and lock the screen for two minutes in order to take a break

1588283

1588292
migrate	upgrade
so if i where in your position i d add an intermediate step and upgrade migrate to a drupal 5 install first then do another upgrade to drupal 6

1588292
versioning	upgrade
since the most error reports came in from users doing 1 versioning upgrade only going the same route should minimize the probability of encountering unexpected errors conditions

1588292
postgresql	mysql
note auto_increment is the mysql way of handling this if using postgresql take a look at the documentation for the serial pseudo type and the accompanying sequence generation mechanism

1588294
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
i then use md5 to hash salt password and email in that order together as password and rehash when they log-in

1588302
inherited	properties
but changes in other properties reflects but not height and there is no duplicate css entry and inherited value from other div

1588309
google-chrome	firefox
how do firefox google-chrome submit the get

1588309
post	get
a form can be get or post but not both

1588317
hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is that if you hash the same value twice but with different salt the result will be different.if attacker aquires you databases of hash salt will renders ineffective attack with pre-calculated database of hash of known passwords

1588373
min	max
there is a dup here somewhere on so it had max instead of min but i can distinctly remember it

1588384
feof	fread
the correct way is to check the return value of fread or whatever function you re using to read or alternatively to call feof after the function that does the reading

1588416
maven	m2e
i mean i know there is a clover plugin for eclipse there is also a clover plugin for maven2 and of course there is maven plugin for eclipse m2e - which i am already using

1588472
google-chrome	safari
in addition to ie not supporting it it seems like the webkit based browsers safari google-chrome despite claiming to have js 1.7 support actually executing script tags declared as being in js 1.7 do not actually support any of these features which means that for now js 1.7 with its very nice features is limited to geko browsers alone

1588505
maven	m2e
calling starting the maven process is done via the m2e plugin and that s it

1588505
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is not really needed for neither clover-maven nor clover-eclipse but it s nice when working with eclipse and maven

1588515
freemarker	velocity
i would perhaps look at velocity initially and if you have to do more of this sort of work take a further look at freemarker

1588532
filtering	grouping
in this instance you are filtering on the grouping column which could just be filtering using a where clause instead

1588552
opml	rss
can that be done by using opml rss atom ..etc

1588589
google-chrome	firefox
this bug only happens in firefox it works fine in google-chrome for example

1588639
awt	swing
java has been playing catchup for a long time with guis and missed the boat with the early releases of awt swing and poor ide designer support

1588720
folder	directory
a script iterates through that folder structure creating index.txt files in every directory listing the sub-items

1588720
rss	feed
and an weblog atom.xml in hardcoded the output directory for the rss feed

1588727
uicontrol	uibutton
edit i suggest subclassing uicontrol in the example below but if you don t need any special behavior on your button apart from the non-rectangleness of it then just subclassing a borderless uibutton set up with your png will do the job and require less work

1588742
organization	naming
i m also with akf on the idea that the real problem is taking naming conventions from some other organization and ignoring the naming conventions of the current organization

1588772
switching	screens
as with the screens grab approach this on it s own does not prevent an user from by passing it by using the windows key alt - tab or ctrl - esc to bring up the start menu or to switching to other tasks

1588794
implements	extends
even if you were to implements a bin field you could just extends the models.charfield and cast it to hex in the to_python method

1588821
3des	aes
using an algorithm like 3des or aes with 16-byte blocks in cbc mode with pkcs #5 padding most email addresses will be encrypted in two blocks

1588858
addition	multiplication
by then combining the beads percentage and the simple rating by say addition certainly not by multiplication we are able to effectively use minmax in a fashion that is more akin to the way it is used in cases when it is not possible to evaluate the game tree to its end

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
i would like to draw some graphics to the gtk drawingarea widget but i want that widget to be resizable so when i draw let s say a line from 0 0 to 50 50 pixel - the drawing area should be resized to a square of size 50 50

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
and to do this - i put the gtk drawingarea widget into the gtk scrolledwindow container

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
so when i put a picture with size 100 100 to the drawing area - i will call the appropriate member function gtk drawingarea set___size_request 100 100 which will set the size of the drawing area to 100 100 pixels

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
so if the gtk scrolledwindow is smaller than the gtk drawingarea inside it the scrolled window should change to scrollable - but the problem is that it does not work

1588900
put	get
my question is how do i get it to report periodically and why does it fail when i try to put the reporting in a for-loop

1588918
profiling	debugging
you can t get a collection of live objects implementing the interface though - at least not without using the debugging profiling api or something similar

1588929
filtering	grouping
there are two selects on the page which filtering a list by type and age grouping

1588939
put	get
so if you put your css at the bottom of the page you get an unstyled page until the css is loaded and then the whole page will be rendered again with the new style rules

1588966
lwjgl	jogl
if you want to learn about the underlying mechanics of 3d graphics go straight to opengl using jogl or lwjgl

1588999
try-catch	exception-handling
a caller that suspects that they might say be causing a path not found exception-handling by calling your code cannot wrap their call in a try-catch which catches ioexception

1589081
strace	systemtap
linux strace oprofile systemtap

1589097
put	get	mouse	keyboard
what s happening when you put your polling in a loop is that you re never letting control get back to the dispatcher which does all of the windows message handling messages for drawing move minimize maximize keyboard mouse input etc... for the application

1589102
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousemove	mouseup	onmousemove	mousedown	mouseover	onmouseup	mouseover	onmousemove	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	onmouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
and you see they use normal js events onmousemove onmouseup mousedown mouseup mouseover ...

1589105
.nettiers	codesmith
.nettiers with codesmith for dal + dao

1589181
ready	each
in other words each client would register its intention to issue requests to the server and the said server would callback the next-up client when it is ready

1589215
cvs	svn
svn in much better than cvs and have lot of mature tools for every platform

1589299
ubuntu	linux
i was using ubuntu linux 9.04 with netbeans 6.5 and 6.7.1

1589314
mktime	strtotime
use strtotime or mktime and then check if your date is between that value and todays timestamp

1589335
int	chars
edges is an array of 500 pointers to int and you are assigning a pointer to two chars to its first element

1589339
post	get
get rid of the counter_cache and implement after_create and after_destroy callbacks in your comment model that increment and decrement the count field in your post model

1589344
int	chars
since an int and a chars have different sizes you should try

1589372
range	minimum
the minimum statistics you should count in my opinion are the number of allocations of common block sizes range

1589381
ssl	https
note that this is not bullet-proof code as it assumes your for example running ssl https on the default port of 443

1589389
int	chars
the expression yields a pointer to int not pointer to chars

1589389
int	chars
sizeof chars is defined to be 1 and sizeof int is typically 4 meaning that your code will dereference a value 4 bytes into the chars array not 1 byte into the chars array

1589447
int	chars
ignoring the type compatibility edges 0 point to the int at the address where the c and d and possibly two more unspecified chars are

1589447
int	chars
edges 0 0 is the first int in edges 0 that s the mix of c d and possible two more unspecified chars

1589447
int	chars
edges 0 1 points to the int right after the mix of c d and possibly two more unspecified chars

1589447
int	chars
if you print an int instead of 2 chars

1589457
button	checkbox
another issues is that in my save button function while it can retreive the value of textboxes and the checkbox in code it cannot get the text from labels that have changed.

1589462
listview	gridview
the catch is that if you have any controls that create other controls like listview repeaters gridview etc

1589527
installation	upgrade
is it any way in wix to detect that a third-party application with a specified upgrade code is installed and what is it s installation folder

when i debug it bluetooth or usb cradle connected some of the web service calls will break causing a the remote connection to the device has been lost... error and instantly closes the app without any further debug information

1589727
maven	pom.xml
this pom.xml also uses the copy-dependencies goal of maven to make sure everything is in place

1589803
opera	firefox
it s not very hard to make the code work across firefox and opera -- you don t have to worry about ie

1589820
firefox	safari
ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari

1589820
opera	google-chrome
but google-chrome up-to-date as i type this at version 3.0.195.27 and opera up-to-date as i type this version 10.0 build 1750 don t

1589823
pull	push
from here you can setup subscriptions or publications with push or pull syncs

1589918
hash	md5
md5 returns 32-digit string hash sha256 ... return 64-digit string

1589919
getter	setter
scala turns var into a private field one getter and one setter

1589919
getter	setter
so in order to get set a var by identifying it using a string you need to use java reflection to find the getter setter methods

1589950
int	double
obviously reordering things like int and double in the declaration is not too big a deal but bigger objects and things requiring dynamic allocation sometimes can be

1589980
onmousedown	onmouseup
the way i was able to get around this is by using the li elements onmousedown and onmouseup events

1589986
for-loop	arrays
right now i m using 1 for-loop that goes copies arraycolor then filters the copied arrays using an nspredicate

1589996
hash	md5
how would one calculate an sha1 or md5 hash within ireport at report execution

1590029
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it will only work on firefox safari and google-chrome though so it s a only a progressive enhancement

1590029
width	height
width height are optional but if the images are all the same size then it s better to use css instead of the width height attributes on the images themselves

1590087
ant	maven
some important things to note you cannot use the maven dependency as a refid in setting the ant property

1590087
ant	maven
i would highly recommend anyone considering maven use ant with maven plugins or even better use ant with ivy instead

1590087
ant	maven
maven does address some things that aren t addressed implicitly by ant but with some up front planning ant is the much more flexible better documented and the less buggy tool

1590099
apache	nginx
the reason why i m asking this question is that the site was running on nginx and i need to rebuild the same configuration on apache

1590126

from this i would like to extract wtn min date max date the twist is i would like to also break whenever there is a gap in the dates so from the above data my results should look like

1590233
versioning	upgrade
if you have earlier versioning of ids then the facility is missing and you should upgrade to get it if it is important to you to have it

1590249
google-chrome	safari
if you re looking for general webkit issues safari 4 and google-chrome use fairly similar builds of webkit

1590268
queue	fifo
the regular array structure in javascript is a stack first in last out and can also be used as a queue fifo depending on the calls you make

1590280
width	height
the only problem with this since i have auto width and height it doesn t seem to know the height width of the div before i show the dialog

1590304
vb6	vba
in vb6 vba you need to use the set statement when working with objects

ingres	postgresql	ingres	mysql	ingres	firebird	ingres	oracle	postgresql	mysql
it currently supports by order of appearance mysql oracle postgresql sqlite ingres firebird

1590430
keydown	keyup
i thought about subclassing an nstextfield and override keydown and keyup but it seems these overrides do nothing.

1590446
x86	64bit
so even better choose the any cpu option and your app will automatically jit compile as 64bit on a 64bit machine with the 64bit version of the framework installed and 32-bit x86 everywhere else

1590467
16-bit	64bit
windows 64bit can run 32-bit applications without problems it s 16-bit applications they can t run

1590491
gtk	cairo
i ve done something like that before for a different purpose with gtk on x which indirectly uses cairo

1590636
google-chrome	firefox
of course this works as expected in modern browsers such as google-chrome and firefox

1590783
rss	feed
i want to create feed so first should i use rss 1 2 or atom whatever is best standard

1590834
post	get

1590855
pop-up	dialog
when the download link is clicked the browser pop-up the standard open save cancel dialog

1590855
hide	show
i m pretty sure i can show a gif easily using jquery but i m not sure how to stop hide the busy indicator when the new document excel doc has finished loading

1590860
charindex	substr
the pattern could be as simple as word space number and you can split it based on space using patindex or charindex in conjunction with substr

1590874
charindex	substr
substr name 1 charindex name 1 - text before space

1590874
charindex	substr
cast substr name charindex name 1 +1 100 as int - text after space with cast to int for correct ordering

1590893
typedef	struct
typedef struct uint1024_tag

1590893

and then use that user-controls in your tabcontrol like this

1590957
hide	show
the site needs to show hide questions dynamically based on answers to other questions on the same page

1590957
client-side	server-side
when i do that the des suite will actually handle both the client-side and server-side portions of this visibility and validation functionality

1590962
firefox	safari
all these work perfectly in safari and firefox

1590980
rss	feed
if you are looking to programatically read rss feed into your php applications i recommend using magpie which is an open-source library built just for that purpose

1590985
bash	tcsh
if doing the latter then this can be managed globally by editing etc profile and etc cshrc for ksh sh bash csh and tcsh shells

1591006
opera	firefox
you can get the image data in the form of a data url this only works in firefox and opera so far though

1591010
post	get
you don t need a file input just get the data with ctx.getimagedata and post it to the server with ajax

1591051
int	boolean
clojure doesn t consider the int 0 to be boolean false

1591092
children	parent
parent only in its own children

1591138
children	parent
you ll notice that your parent table copolicypointer is joined twice even though your criteria only joins the children table

1591142
put	get
you will also need another column to get the final entry in the route so put the to column in the grid also and set the totals row for that column to last

1591159
ostringstream	std
your code works though ostringstream is in the std namespace

1591165
ostringstream	std
since you didn t put down a using for it you need to use the type std ostringstream

1591177
hash	salt
so the overall size is considering aes 16 bytes salt + clear text size + 20 hash + 16 - clear text size + 20 16

1591210
xml-rpc	json-rpc
using xml-rpc or json-rpc are only means to encapsulate your data into a form that is easy to transport

1591210
ssl	https
creating an https ssl connection encrypts all communication between the client iphone and the server django

1591229
width	height
however if you have a bunch of fields x y width and height it s a common convention to name the constructor parameters that initialize them with the field name plus a leading underscore

1591308
firefox	safari
but when i look at the site in os x either safari or firefox the font size is too big

1591315
hash	salt
in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret

1591315
hash	salt
which is linked from the wikipedia salt entry you ll see that is talking about this kind of salt the password hash

1591368
typeerror	attributeerror
obviously you can have an attributeerror if duck has no quack a typeerror if duck has a quack but it is not callable

1591376
subtraction	addition
instead of calculating actual euclidian distance which requires a square-root calculation do your select on the linear distance that requires only subtraction and addition

1591378
put	get
if it helps this is a snippet of prototype js i put together that detects if an element is within the viewport or not which might get you started if you re not happy with the other solution

1591381
post	get
i recently did some optimizing for mysql outlined here www.mooreds.com wordpress archives 000547 sorry i only get 1 hyperlink per post but am not sure how many of the steps i went through are applicable to oracle

1591391
pascal	delphi
packed array of char is assignment compatible with delphi string this goes back to very early forms of pascal - packed array of char was the string type

1591411
gridview	formview
controls inside of templates such as in your formview or in a gridview are not directly accessible in the code behind

1591421
mouse	keyboard
global keyboard and mouse hooks need to be implemented in a separate .dll

1591438
children	parent
then you iterate over the menu items and if they have a non-null parentid you add them to their parent s list of children

1591453
post	get
this might be cookie based or a session id might be transmitted as a post or get parameter along with each request

1591464
bash	zsh
ksh93 bash and zsh all understand c-like for-loop syntax

1591464
bash	zsh
unfortunately while ksh and zsh understand the curly brace range syntax with constants and variables bash only handles constants including bash 4

1591471
width	height
if what you want is a frame around your image i would create a div or span with a set width and height and an img slightly smaller inside it

1591492
int	double
you would have no problem interpreting this as a function that takes an int and a double as arguments and returns a double value would you

1591524
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
in school you memorized single-digit addition multiplication subtraction and division

1591591
unsigned	short
unfortunately many of these methods accept string lengths of varying size max unsigned char max short etc... and i m stuck writing code to make sure that my string instances do not exceed the maximum length prescribed by the low-level api

1591595
curb	libcurl
net http if you don t want an external dependency curb libcurl multi if you need raw performance patron if you want a good middle-of-the-road solution and open-uri if you need something quick and dirty that will never see production usage

1591634
google-chrome	firefox
the image of the card on my site bottom right displays differently in google-chrome and firefox

1591634
google-chrome	firefox

1591664
mouseleave	mouseenter
i attach mouseenter and mouseleave events to the overlaying div element

1591670
getter	setter
i m guessing this is already in place but your model must have a getter and setter on the routename property in order to be properly bound

1591683
photoshop	paint.net
different browsers achieve varying levels of quality which never compare to what you can achieve with a dedicated digital image editor photoshop paint.net etc

1591683
width	height
best to resize it to the desired dimensions before publishing then explicitly set the actual height and width in pixels

1591693
777	tmp
i checked the permissions on the tmp directory they re set to 777 though i can t see the graph_8xynso.svg file in there

i usually implement it by wrapping an stl queue and protecting it using boost mutex

1591746
gtk	drawingarea
add a gtk viewport in between your scrolledwindow and drawingarea

1591750
onfocus	onblur
you could use the onfocus event in various ways to ensure that the onblur has completed

1591750
onmousedown	onfocus
i m imagining something along the lines of throwing out onmousedown and just putting a check in onfocus to see if the mouse button is currently down

1591779
boost	stl
what benefits do i get from apache c++ standard library that i don t get from stl implementations that come with the compiler and from boost libraries

mouseleave	mouseenter
from what i understand mouseenter and mouseleave do not bubble down to child elements

1591796
mouseleave	mouseenter
src mouseenter and mouseleave events for firefox

1591796
mouseover	mouseout
try mouseover and mouseout instead and it should work as expected

1591819
french	polish	french	turkish	turkish	polish
the php docs are available in english bulgarian portuguese german french japanese korean polish romanian and turkish plus they have archives of other languages which aren t listed as active any more so they re probably well out-of-date but might still be helpful

opera	safari
opera 7+ konqueror 3 safari and ie5 mac

1592002
realloc	malloc
read up on malloc and realloc

1592045
cpu	hyperthreading
i am going to assume you have more than 1 core cpu in your system as that would be too obvious -- and no hyperthreading on a pentium 4 doesn t count as having two cores regardless of what intel s marketing would have you believe. there are two problems that i see

1592066
powerpc	i386
the default os x perl is a universal binary and thus has ccflags like -arch i386 -arch powerpc etc

1592087
realloc	malloc
you may also want to check for failure after calling malloc and realloc

1592102
translation	localization
on a side note if anyone is looking for a tool to help out with translation david deraedt wrote some nice air apps called lupo localization studio that are reasonably inexpensive

1592152
firefox	safari
firefox safari etc all work great

1592171
realloc	malloc
the closest to a dynamic array is by using malloc and it s associated commands delete realloc etc

1592185
wicket	smartgwt
i have been using smartgwt but have run into trouble mixing smartgwt with other frameworks such as wicket

1592191
boost	stl
if you find that it provides everything that you need then there is not much of a difference using that or using another stl implementation alongside boost

1592214
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
from your question it s not exactly clear if you re only having a problem in ie but when i hit the supplied page in firefox google-chrome and opera it loads as expected

1592240
jython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
__subclasses__ is part of the python language and implemented by ironpython and jython as well as cpython no pypy at hand to test right now but i d be astonished if they have broken that

1592254
dictionary	map
i have a situation where i want to map a pair of objects to a dictionary of information

1592305
int	chars
however if you had chars from some other source in a and needed to convert them to an int you could create an with the â initwithcstring encoding and then use its intvalue method but in this particular problem that simply isn t needed

1592321
apache	nginx
i would try to run the app in production on apache passenger see if the problem is specific to nginx passenger

1592332
wicket	gxt
i have used gxt and i have done some simple integrations with wicket components with it

1592368
ienumerable	iqueryable
ideally i want the expression to be evaluated directly inside the iqueryable data source and not in memory as an ienumerable

1592389
post	get
the js queries another file with parameters set in get or post

1592395
rss	feed
i am trying to view the wordpress rss feed but when i view it in firefox it asks me to subscribe so i can t actually view it and see what i need to do to view the full article

1592404
jython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
some of the most important areas of python development these days are moving python to other virtual machines such as jython jvm ironpython .net pypy and the unladen swallow project moving cpython to an llvm -based representation

1592418
post	get
is it a bad practice to mix get and post

1592430
yslow	pagespeed
i am doing a web performance optimization using yslow and pagespeed recomendations but when it comes to file sizes neither says anything about it

1592440
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
i also see equals gethashcode gettype and tostring which are fairly undesirable to expose to the excel user

1592440
vb6	vba
how add a com-exposed .net project to the vb6 or vba references dialog

1592446
post	get
there are simple rules you use get possibly with url parameters for constant things that do not change the server and post for thing that modify the server

1592446
post	put
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested

1592446
post	get
there you go get should not change anything post is for thing that change the server unsafe operation

1592446
post	get
so yeah you have a form want to know if you use get or post

1592446
post	get
then change server post don t change server get

1592446
post	put	post	get	put	get
and since a url can be accessed with any verbs get or post don t put the data that change the server in the url because someone may copy that url do a get and change your server without you knowing

1592452
post	get
then to delete a user i post to this same page except i post a variable instead of doing a get since deleting is a stateful action and should be done with a post

1592457
restrict	shared
as its a general question its not restrict to any specific language.so please shared your thoughts on how you would have done it

1592481
domxpath	domdocument
if it s really complex then you may want to use domdocument with domxpath but here s a simple example using simplexml

1592521
jobs	cron
all i d like to see are emails for cron jobs where i ve echo d something

1592541
inherited	properties
even though they both inherited from page i can only access the profile properties if i m at the actual page level

1592559
onkeyup	onkeydown
when the activity starts the only keys that onkeydown or onkeyup get called for are the dpad up down left right keys

1592596
mbunit	nunit
you may have a look on pex - it allows to generate tests for nunit mbunit and others

1592610
sudoers	visudo
fixed editing etc sudoers with visudo to add

1592611
salt	md5
md5 md5 password + salt

1592615
spaces	delimiter
since command-line arguments are delimiter by spaces unless the file path is quoted the application perl.exe in this case will see three arguments

1592620
pbkdf2	hash
going forward the only secure password hashing schemes are iterative hash such as bcrypt and pbkdf2

1592623
hash	md5
they do an excellent job of using a long hash unique to each password and running the password through md5 thousands of times

1592635
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
program library self-awareness to solve very specific crash events i often have implemented wrappers on system libraries such as malloc free realloc which extensions that can do things like walk memory detect double frees attempts to free non-allocated pointers check for obvious buffer over-runs etc

1592683
jobs	cron
it is better to schedule php scripts to run as cron jobs that exit within hours or minutes so that memory can be freed

1592696
button	checkbox
i have a big fat search button along with some checkbox for the user to choose what region they want to search in

1592699

1592749
ant	maven
on the build tools side there are ant and maven as the major players

1592749
ant	maven
i prefer ant over maven personally

1592767
public	protected
why does fxcop treat protected members as if they are public throwing donotdeclarevisibleinstancefields error

1592792
tabitem	contentcontrol
since tabitem is a contentcontrol you can present a usercontrol as its content

1592808
firefox	safari
it works to my liking in firefox safari

1592815
pascal	delphi
or you could take a look at fastmm4 - which is open source but in pascal delphi

1592816
public	protected
the recommended practice here is to make this field private and expose it through an externally visible property with a public or protected access modifier

1592847
switching	screens
as the default behavior of ie is to switching to the full screens mode on alt - enter command

1592855
webrat	cucumber
is there anything i missed in cucumber webrat

1592885
post	get
does the post data still get sent received regardless or is it negotiated before the data is finally sent

1592888
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
specifically you ll want to look at mousedown mouseup and mousemove

1592960
pop-up	dialog
import the icon your want in the pop-up dialog and make sure the id of the icon is the smallest one

1592976
getter	setter
in that case use a private field with a public getter and a private setter

1592983
opera	safari
but for opera and safari it s critical that the css load in the right order because sifr gets wind of the styling as it happens

1592983
opera	safari
so this fixed the weirdness described above in safari and opera but i m still having some mysterious styling issues in opera â but that s another story

1592994
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
use mousedown mousemove and mouseup

1593034
post	get
also to get to grips with the output of profile have a look at this post

1593052
rss	feed
i use django feed framework to organize rss feed for my website

1593061
width	height
so you have to round up your width and height to 512

1593066
libcurl	libssh
looking at the libcurl section on phpinfo i notice that the php installs without scp sftp support do not have a libssh version listed whereas the one with the support says libssh version- libssh2 1.1

1593069
width	margin
retrieves the width of the object including padding but not including margin border or scroll bar

1593131
folder	directory
you might need to make your newfiles folder the current directory so the java vm can find your files

1593164
folder	directory
to list files and folder in a given directory in .net

1593185
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
note however this won t work in opera and i haven t tested in safari google-chrome anything else

1593260
children	parent
the expression uses a regular expression currentpage and tests it against the class of the parent node so the direct children of the element li.currentpage will be set to #eff the other descendants will be set to #ef0

1593306
children	parent
now i d like to gain access to the subset of all parent call it the 2nd set that said children from the 1st set relate to

1593324
inherited	properties
i think that if you set some of your cell s properties to inherited they will inherited those properties from the table row

1593342
coalesce	isnull
isnull and coalesce though equivalent can behave differently

1593342
coalesce	isnull
an expression involving isnull with non-null parameters is considered to be not null while expressions involving coalesce with non-null parameters is considered to be null

1593344
pop-up	dialog
is it possible to allow cross domain scripting somehow so that the pop-up dialog can all be controlled from javascript within the sharepoint portal and ssrs and my custom forms can just invoke javascript methods on the parent

1593345
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade patch cannot be installed by the windows installer service because the program to be upgrade is missing or the upgrade patch may update a different versioning of the program.

1593362
serializable	deserialization
this is obviously not required as long as aggregate1 is a struct...this may prove to be useful when you are creating a class struct heirarchy for the express purpose of serializable deserialization with the xmlserializer many seemingly mysterious exceptions will disappear just by using structs in this case

1593393
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie8 firefox 3 recent opera and safari google-chrome support postmessage which allows cooperating pages on different domains to talk to each other

1593457
superclass	subclassing
the object on the first line is the superclass this says that myclass is a subclassing of object

1593480
getter	setter
you just specify that there is a property with a getter and a setter whatever they will do

1593480
getter	setter
the compiler will create a field and generate the getter and setter implementation for it

1593497
getter	setter
this could be achieved via __get and __set but the most common implementation is for getting and setting runtime generated properties and it d be a hassle to code pseudo getter and setter for each added property as well as using __set is a no-no in my opinion

1593504
width	height
i know i can use height and width attribute of img tag but i don t know the image size

1593516
width	height
just use height or width

1593538
inherited	properties
i d probably override the class and inherited the properties with a concrete type then serialize that

1593549
width	height
remember also that you can give a percentage of the original width height as value as well for instance

1593683
width	height
you can see the 320 x 240 fillrect doesn t fill the jpanel entirely a border of 10 px width and 30 px height remains

1593684
treemap	treeset
use a treeset or treemap

1593733
pseudo-class	visited
i m not really sure but as far as i remember you have to explicitely declare the link and visited pseudo-class

1593762
opencart	oscommerce	cart	oscommerce
in my opinion if you re looking for lightweight which is hard to define for e-comemrce zen cart oscommerce or opencart would be a good bet

1593763
width	height
before an application can use a memory device context for drawing operations it must select a bitmap of the correct width and height into the device context

1593763
width	height
this may be done by using createcompatiblebitmap to specify the height width and color organization required in the function call

1593823
getter	setter
check that it s a property and that you have protected getter and setter privates will not work since nhibernate will want to proxy the collection for lazyloading

1593827
consistency	acid
well in-memory databases generally lack the d durability in acid atomicity consistency isolation durability by their very nature

1593832
actionscript	mxml
the flex compiler generates a lot of intermediate code to convert mxml files into actionscript you can view those files if you compile with -keep compiler option

1593846
superclass	subclassing
the member variables in your subclassing hide the variables in the superclass

1593953
libjpeg	libtiff
to manipulate jpeg files use libjpeg the tiff files use libtiff etc

1593953
gif	png
another easy option is gd which allows manipulation of many image formats png jpeg gif ...

1593971
width	height
which makes sense as the rectangle has 10px less width and 30px less height

1593971
width	height
if you set the same width height

1593979
width	height
frame.setsize width height

1594004
keydown	keyup
the technical answer is that the keydown and keyup event is intercepted before it reaches the js layer by the application

1594004
keydown	keyup
just as you can return true or false in an event to prevent propagation the application stops propagation of the keydown and keyup events to scripting interfaces outside of its trusted domain eg

1594013
writetofile	nsdata
the modern way is to create nsdata from the root object|dictionary then write that data to the desired path using writetofile options error or writetourl options error

1594041
filesystems	ntfs
well a problem with uppercase letters would be that some filesystems like ntfs ignore them and treat filename.txt and filename.txt as the same file whereas other filesystems ext for example i think thinks of these as 2 different files

1594041
filesystems	ntfs
so if you have some reference to a file that you called file.txt and the reference points to the file file.txt then on ntfs this would be no problem but if you copy the files to a filesystems like ext the reference would fail because the filesystems thinks there is no such file as file.txt

1594052
lxml	elementtree
i have to write an xml file using python standard modules not using elementtree lxml etc the metadata is a saml identity provider metadata and is of the form -

1594081
cassini	iis
although this may be running on the same machine the server here is the iis cassini process that serves up your webpage to the client your browser

1594081
cassini	iis
in order to stop this you ll need to stop shutdown the iis or cassini cassini small web server used by visual studio when running a web app on your local development machine or stop shutdown the sql server process

1594240
maven	cargo
to me cargo shouldn t fail and this is likely a bug in cargo s maven 2 plugin or in the core api that should handle this case gracefully

1594323
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
no problems in any version of firefox opera google-chrome safari or ie8

1594325
hide	show
provide an id to the select element and find the selected element and check its value to 1 and show hide the appropriate div

1594357
hide	show
i have a control that i want to show hide depending on the value of a boolean

1594387
int	double
in fact this lambda expression will even fit a delegate that takes an int and returns a double because the result of the lambda a is implicitly convertible to double

1594481
post	get
check the kind of data http headers you are sending with your get post request and try to make it similar to a web browser s my web browser can view the page

1594540
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
as a fast alternative to multiplication division or on architectures that cannot multiplying divide look at example below

1594540
division	multiplication
in fact software multiplication division implementations are often based upon shifts

1594541
boost	blitz++
but have a look at blitz++ newmat and boost solutions that eliminate temporary objects thanks to expression templates -- c++0x s rvalue references will simplify et solution

1594570
spweb	spsite
do it within a rwep and make sure you dispose of your spsite spweb objects correctly

i tried a workaround with getter and setter

1594612
octal	decimal
decimal d and i unsigned octal o unsigned decimal u or

1594659
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have tested the following in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

1594687
int	boolean
- this allows you to use one int variable to store a number of boolean values in a compact and efficient manner

1594687
int	boolean
this can often be used to make code much more efficient pass one 32-bit int instead of an array of 32 boolean as a parameter

1594692
width	height
for example if the original image has a height of 300px and a width of 200px and the img.height property is set to 75

1594692
width	height
but the resized image is shown in the upper left corner of the img container that is still set to a height of 300px and a width of 200px

1594703
public	protected
and public and protected are in the same folder

1594703
public	protected
how do i use the public resource in the protected projects

1594709
jar	war
ear enterprise archive files contain the war files along with the jar files containing code

1594716
division	multiplication
one as an alternate way to do integer multiplication and division

1594723
jar	war
in j2ee application modules are packaged as ear jar and war based on their functionality

1594723
jar	.war
web modules which contain servlet class files jsp files supporting files gif and html files are packaged as jar file with .war web archive extension

1594723
jar	.war
all above files .jar and .war are packaged as jar file with .ear enterprise archive extension and deployed into application server

1594724
jar	war
it is also a jar file it has a special directory called app-inf that contains the application.xml file and it contains jar and war files

1594757
width	height
width and height are the known dimensions of the supposedly 2-dimensional array

1594758
updatepanel	scriptmanager
problem started showing up after i moved the scriptmanager to a master page - and only when i was using pages with no updatepanel

1594803
g++	gcc
i m developing a multithreaded program running on linux compiled with g++ 4.3 and if you search around for a bit you find a lot of scary stories about std string not being thread-safe with gcc

1594818
jar	war
a web container requires the web module to be packaged as a war file - that is a special jar file with a web.xml file in the web-inf folder

1594818
jar	war
enterprise applications may consist of one or more modules that can either be web modules packaged as a war file or ejb modules packaged as a jar file or both of them

1594818
jar	war
basically ear files are a superset containing war files and jar files

1594820
postgresql	mysql
postgresql postgis and mysql

i am using above and it works fine with ie but not with google-chrome safari

1594936
submit	submission
i use a separate internal tool at vmware for submission to our perforce servers so i haven t used git p4 submit though.

1594979
inherited	subclassing
i have a base class that declares a virtual function and a large set of subclassing that inherited from the class some of which may override the function

1595016
boxlayout	miglayout
if you re able you may want to check out the miglayout but boxlayout is also easy to use and in the java toolkit already

1595023
width	height
you can set the height or width to the size you want

1595023
width	height
if you use 2 you can set both the height and width

1595030
for-loop	arrays
but the for-loop is too slow as it takes 2 seconds to convert a 76800 x 1 arrays

1595044
int	double
754 double contain 53 bits of precision so on input the computer strives to convert 0.1 to the closest fractions it can of the form where j is an int containing exactly 53 bits

1595058
versioning	upgrade
now i upgrade the os versioning and tried to compile the code in xcode 3.2 but the app crashes with an error

1595103
wordpress	joomla
try joomla drupal or wordpress

1595104
profiling	benchmarking
this is close to what we d hoped for based on the benchmarking and the profiling referred to in the question

1595123
public	protected
i generally think everything that s either public or protected should be documented as that s the api your class is providing protected is part of the api you give to anyone who s going to extend your class

1595123
getter	setter
for some methods it can be overkill when the method is simple enough like simple getter and setter

1595125
domxpath	domdocument
read the page with domdocument loadhtmlfile then create a domxpath object and query all span elements within the document having the class page-numbers attribute

1595201

it works fine on firefox opera and google-chrome but not of course on internet explorer 8

1595217
post	get
i have searched many blog post but could not get any solution

1595230
onkeydown	onblur
i suppose if you really wanted to use tabs you could do an onblur event handler which just gave focus back to the window and an onkeydown event handler that inserted 4 spaces whenever the tab key was pressed

1595242
public	protected
the solution i normally choose is that i create a specialized class inside my unit test that exposes these protected methods as public

1595251
typedef	struct
typedef struct no

1595279
gridview	repeater
if you use a repeater instead of a gridview you will have much more control over the rendered output.

1595299
int	chars
voiceremoval chars buf int bytes int bps int nch

1595309
free	malloc
which implementation of malloc free is used in a specific linux distribution in my case suse 9 and suse 10

1595321
public	protected
later tests for code that uses the refactored methods via the public methods of specializations also test the code -- in this case that the public methods of the specialization work properly when using the common protected methods

1595326
superclass	subclassing
your case is a bit different in that your class is intended to be used as a superclass so testing it via a subclassing makes a lot of sense since the class isn t intended to stand on its own

1595328
bluetooth	usb
a little more expensive are the omap3530 eval board from logicpd which i believe has wifi bluetooth and usb hw on the board

1595329
updatepanel	scriptmanager
none of our web.configs are leet they are just normal although we do use scriptmanager and updatepanel

1595329
updatepanel	scriptmanager
is there a standard web.config that will work on all of the servers and do the updatepanel and scriptmanager

1595337
subtract	add
if you want to rotate about a point other than the origin you ll have to first subtract the center of rotation from your point rotate it using the above and then add back in the center of rotation this is called conjugation in matrix theory

1595339
vb6	vba
you could either use one of the .net excel systems such as exceldna or addin express or try to adapt one of the vba vb6 solutions look at laurent longre s funcustomise

rel	attr
i am trying to get and pass a rel attr to tell which tab to select in a nyro pop up function

1595389
put	get
i have a view set up with an image in it but when i add it to the scroll view i only get a black rectangle no matter what i put in the view i add

1595410
charindex	substr
you can do this with fewer cascading ctes but i find the substr charindex len syntax can quickly become very difficult to read and debug

1595425
public	protected
for instance if you are inside folder protected code and you need to access folder public content main.css you would use the path .. .. public content main.css

1595442
free	malloc
malloc and free are implemented in the c library rather than the operating system itself

1595460
cpu	processors
i made the observation that my java application is running much faster when executed on an amd processors in contrast to an intel cpu

1595492
ubuntu	linux
my system is linux ubuntu 9.04 with default python 2.6

1595494
udp	tcp
tcp ethernet udp and i ll get around to things like ftp but i m pretty sure ftp is built on top of tcp as is http

1595536
mef	prism
mef and prism serve two very distinct goals

1595536
mef	prism
in this respect it s filling the same goal as unity does within prism and in fact you could pretty easily rework prism to use mef instead of unity

1595739
subtract	add
just add or subtract the amount of time to from your number of seconds representation

1595743
inherited	subclassing
this can be achieved using inherited along with the template method pattern calling abstract or virtual methods in a base class which are overridden in subclassing to achieve the desired new behavior but it s more often demonstrated using composition using the strategy pattern encapsulating the variant behavior in class and passing it to the closed type to be used in determining the overall behavior achieved

1595744
invokelater	invokeandwait
i would expect therefore that it would be thread-safe and that you wouldn t need to wrap the call in an invokelater or an invokeandwait

comparator	icomparer
the error i was getting was icomparer or the comparator methods it relies upon did not return zero when array.sort called x

1596743
forth	smalltalk

1598131
getc	fflush
i was wondering being as i ought to fflush stdin i d want to use a while loop using getc vis-a-vis

1598148
hide	show
to ensure you execute something after an effect like hide or show use a callback

1598149
hide	show
show and hide are actually animation effects but when no arguments are passed they use an instant duration

1598149
hide	show
thus what you really should be using is a callback off of the hide call to trigger a callback function which calls append and then show

1598180
listview	gridview
in contrast to the listview gridview the wpf datagrid control does not follow this convention by default

1598236
hex	binary
looking at the file in a hex editor they obviously have different regions which are delimited somehow looks like typical binary saved structs

double double int int bool boolean etc

1598368
int	double
for instance double is an alias for system.double and int is an alias for system.int32

1598381
hide	show
you have to use callback if you want to queue the other methods run after the show hide thing like sixten otto has said

1598381

1598429
strncmp	strcmp
be cautious about using strncmp instead of strcmp which was suggested in one answer

1598434
strncmp	memcmp	strncmp	strcmp	memcmp	strcmp
note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer

1598447
post	get
one caveat is that paras only sniffs http get post requests using the method above so to sniff all network traffic try the following

1598475
pop-up	dialog
the best you can do is to capture the user leaving the page and pop-up a dialog asking them if they re sure they want to

1598496
elementtree	beautifulsoup
you can also use abiword wvware to convert word document to xhtml and then parse it with beautifulsoup elementtree etc

1598513
width	height
i think that it is called twice because the height and width changes

1598558

i m more interested in testing the behaviour of the architecture instead of the getter setter

1598587
spyware	antivirus
whenever the your website loading funny external script like adware spyware your antivirus will alert you

1598627
prepare	execute
prepare queries are more efficient when you execute a query multiple times and also obviate the need to sanitize user input

1598643
setinterval	settimeout
evaluating code by using eval and its relatives function settimeout and setinterval is considered dangerous because they will execute the code you pass with the privileges of the caller and almost all the times there is a workaround to avoid them

1598720
children	parent
you can t use the condition in the threaded call since it would only find results that match that condition parent and children

1598764
client-side	server-side
while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt

1598847
pull	push
they basic command sets are very similar init clone add status commit push pull etc.

1598863
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
this is a good strategy - it has low overhead and it actually generates some efficient code compare to strcpy which has to check for the end of the string and has no way of knowing how many iterations it must make and poor confused strncpy which has to check both - both can be slower and either could be sped up by using memcpy if you happen to have already calculated the string s length for some reason

1598884
post	put
using traditional post you could put all the html content in the value attribute of an input type hidden in your page named html_content or something like that and when the user clicks in the button save you send your user to another page with a link do the file

1598884
post	put
using ajax you just need to do an ajax post passing this variable and then your script returns a download link and you dynamically put it in your html - without reloading your page like it was only cliente side

1598918
width	height
you can find out the actual pixel height and width from the imagesource

1598941

1598945
ubuntu	linux
actually i m trying to upload the image file and i m using ubuntu linux machine

1598994
cout	cin
as cin and cout are usually tied calling an input function for std cin will cause std cout to be flushed in any case so you may as well put a n into your prompt string and save on the verbose extra operators

1599014
jquery	jqmodal
a lightweight alternative to jquery ui s dialogs is jqmodal

1599030
int	double	int	chars
the function below would only stream chars or strings into the stringstream but not anything else int double float etc. in fact the fail flag is set if i attempt to convert for example an int into a string

1599030
int	double	int	chars
tested for int double float not working chars and strings working

1599077
innodb	myisam
it would work on tables which use table-level locking myisam but on innodb etc it could deadlock or produce duplicate keys i think depending on the isolation level in use

1599093
filehandle	freopen
freopen returns a filehandle but it s the previous value before we put it in binary mode so don t use it for anything

1599142
int	double	int	chars
variables like int chars double .

1599156
accessor	ivar
if you do need an ivar i cannot stress enough how important it is to always use accessor for them and never access them directly

1599176
int	double
when i started oo programming many years ago i gained the impression that variables if that is the right word were either primitives int double etc. or first-class objects string jpane etc.

1599216
onchange	onblur
for a text input i can add an event handler for onblur and onchange

1599223
int	double

1599223
int	double
for instance int is the short name for system.int32 and double is the short form of system.double

1599226
inherited	properties
instead you have structs vs classes but structs share many of the features of classes such as the ability to have properties and methods and inherited from the object class as well

1599309
itext	jpedal
you could also look at icesoft itext jpedal and multivalent who offer open source pdf tools

folder	directory
i can t find any way to do this apart from make the et folder a virtual directory which i don t really want to do

1599446
qdockwidget	qwidget
subclassing qwidget and then having a private qdockwidget attribute of course does make sense but it will probably not help you for implementing your own dock widget as long as i understand it correctly

1599461
elf	coff

1599466
equals	gethashcode
but it calls only gethashcode and doesn t call equals

1599495
vb.net	vb6
there s no need to do obsessive cleaning in vb.net or in vb6

1599495
vb.net	vb6
api calls in vb6 are the equivalent of unmanaged code in vb.net - both need extreme care especially in releasing resources

1599502
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
the reason is that you most probably want your class to be a variation of a qdockwidget is-a relationship meaning that it should have all its public methods and its instances should be able to passed to methods asking qdockwidget instances for example you want to be able to add one to a qmainwindow

1599519
win64	windows
a win64 binary on the other hand is in pe format too but windows 2000 will reject it

in c# int double etc. keywords are basically aliases for those struct s

1599622
mp3	wav
now i m asking myself where can i find free icons wav and small mp3 files which can be used in my applications

filtering	grouping
also join predicates and filtering predicates are physically grouping together in the where clause which can cause them to be confused for one another

1599658
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
