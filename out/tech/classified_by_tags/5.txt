we use nunitlite although i think we did have had to add some code to it in order for it to work

it seems wcf could ve been an option but i prefer not to upgrade from .net 2.0

46053

i like the sound of combinatorial tests in mbunit i ve tried the abstract base class interface test technique with nunit and although it does work you d need to have a seperate test fixture for every interface a class implements since in c# there is no multiple inheritance - although inner classes can be used which is pretty cool

122571

edit sorry i should ve specified jndi to lookup the db connection and jdbc to perform the operations

123002

now before i started using an inversion of control container i would have created a factory and maybe even a simple objectsettings object for each of the objects that requires more than 1 setting to keep the size of the constructor to the recommended less than 4 parameter size

asynchronous testing cairngorm events can also be done with flexunit but is not as elegant as with dpuint

156009

because of the more tedious way of adding hosts to be monitored in nagios it requires defining a host object as opposed to the previous program which only required the ip and hostname i figured it d be best to automate this and it d be a great time to learn perl because all i know at the moment is c c++ and java

that is rather than dealing with time and frames in flash one is dealing with describing where components should be placed with mxml and how those components work with actionscript

might have been the rowcount count property for which i read this. the difference is one of them disregards datarow.rowstate and the other respects uses it

166190

using datatable.clear will fail if there are any constraints applied that would be violated but using datatable.reset will get rid of anything and everything that has been put in place since the datatable was created

mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems

170669

apache itself can be configured to function this way although if you are on linux or unix squid is the better option as it is specifically designed to do this very job

171213

if it cannot be done platform-independently linux unix is a priority for me

172672

you either need to wrap it in an enclosing document element whose markup will still be escaped or use a properly-initialized xmlreader to process the value once you ve retrieved it from the configuration

173276

for example if i have a single-bit field isready it may make perfect sense for this field to have a default value of false and null not be allowed but this implicitly asserts that we know that the whatever is not ready when in fact we may have no such knowledge

visualstudio offers or at least offered a wizard to do a conversion from vb6 to vb.net which could then be converted to c# with a bit of work possibly helped by #develop s vb.net - c# converter but when last i used it for anything non-trivial there was a lot of manual work needing to be done so i suspect you re probably better rewriting or porting by hand if this is a large and or important application

jeffrey richter documents an almost identical case in clr via c#. when a hash does need to be stored i d prefer it to be calculated in a way which is always guaranteed to be stable - md5 or a custom interface implemented by your types with a guarantee of stability
