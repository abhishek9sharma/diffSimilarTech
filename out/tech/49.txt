setup concurrency in your nhibernate mappings this post should help you get started

6100490
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you have a method that returns an ienumerable but inside returns an iqueryable will returning an ienumerable force an execution even though iqueryable defers the execution

6100505
ienumerable	iqueryable
since iqueryable implements ienumerable when returning your object you won t be forcing anything

6100543
ienumerable	iqueryable
you won t be forcing execution since both iqueryable and ienumerable are lazily evaluated and iqueryable implements ienumerable so no conversion whatsovever is neccessary

6100544

post	get
one downside of jsonp however is you cannot make post requests only get requests which doesn t entirely jive with a restful approach but i still believe a restful architecture offers many benefits

6100774
onresume	onpause
so the idea is to start up the alarm service when our app goes in into onpause and cancel the service when our app goes into onresume

6100795

6101029
installation	upgrade
if that doesn t work i suggest to upgrade your installation to the newest one available

6101054
hide	show
this is mainly as the css above is a hack in the first place to get the browser to hide the native scrollbar and show the webkit styled version within the body

6101070

ant	maven
this has an ant ant task that will generate your build.xml from the maven project

6101097
free	malloc
i think i understand why it would leak memory if plain malloc was used - while the caller of execvp can execute code in the parent the inner call to execve never returns so the function cannot free the memp pointer and there s no way to get the pointer back to the caller

6101106

int	chars
why is chars being converted into a ushort instead of an int in this decompilation

6101136
int	chars
you can cast an int to a chars but they re not the same thing

6101136
int	chars
consequently chars 65 .tostring is not the same as int 65 .tostring

6101200
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
the calling code will make just as much sense of an nullpointerexception as it would an illegalargumentexception but it ll be easier for the developer to debug and understand what went wrong if an nullpointerexception is thrown rather than your code attempting to execute some other unexpected contingency logic - which ultimately results in the application failing anyway

6101217
mouseover	mouseout
i m trying to do a similar thing but update the colour of mouseover mouseout

6101993
listview	gridview	gridview	formview
gridview listview formview need something different

6102049

however i m having trouble writing the for-loop to loops through the directory grab the table from each file and append them to a single csv file

6102293

maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e	m2e	pom.xml
i installed maven management for a java project through m2e downloaded the indexes installed some dependencies manually editing the pom.xml and.

6103293

however our vendor supports http post and http get using application x-www-form-encoded - query strings

6103293
post	get
similarly the .asmx describes the availability of using http get or http post as follows

6103300
inherited	subclassing
using mappedby master in all subclassing might seem like an abuse of hibernate inherited but all other solutions would include one row per subclassing which would be null in every other which seems to me like a very bad table design

6103317
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way

6103330
width	margin
in most apps you use a non-inset full width list alone with only toolbars and with no margins between them so we use the 15px margin to circumvent the body padding

6103331
ubuntu	debian
debian or ubuntu install the libxml2-dev package

6103355
innodb	myisam
# can be 1000 for myisam 767 for innodb

let s say if i have min and max value of 0-1000 and i want to increase the value by 25 and not like 1-2-3-4

6103445
mdpi	hdpi
i ve made use of the ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi folder naming convention for my resources which works nicely for layouts and graphics but not so much for text size scaling

6103624
versioning	upgrade
however i want the user to be able to upgrade to the new versioning if the old versioning exists

6103624
versioning	upgrade
the way the program should work is that if the file is detected installed versioning is not or less than the same as the installer and the user says yes to upgrade the upgrade commands should run

6103633
client-side	server-side
they all have varying degrees of assumptions about where this work is taking place server-side client-side what framework you re using jquery mootools etc and how your changes are being distributed rest socket.io etc

6103702
public	protected
according to the documentation the class doesn t have any public or protected constructors

6103739
public	protected
as svick has pointed out the documentation states that there are no public or protected constructors which means you won t be able to inherit from this class

6103815
hash	md5
1 md5 image_id then if the hash was 49f68a5c8493ec2c0bf489821c21fc3b the structure would be 49 f6 8a 5c 84 93 ec 2c 0b f4 89 82 1c 21 fc 3b.jpg or .....3b filename.jpg

6103846
move	drag
use javascript to detect clicks drag in the thumbnail and move the rectangle over it

6103848

as just the same words ways because the stream will ignore punctuation like . and

6104182

this works in google-chrome safari and ff..

6104251
uilabel	uibutton
in the second section it s header has a uibutton in it as well as a uilabel -- the view for the section header is loaded from a xib -- again it views fine and the button reacts to tapping and calls my ibaction

6104267
alloca	malloc
you can replace the call to alloca with a call to malloc made before the call to vfork

6104267
free	malloc
this is safe because vfork will not return until exec has been called and the new program started. the caller can then free the memory it allocated with malloc

6104291
post	get
i would suggest using post instead of get for destructive manipulative operations though

6104295
feof	fread
it is unclear to me that feof after fread will reliably detect eof without discarding the last record

6104431
portrait	landscape
i have found that the uiwebview does the wrong thing if it starts out with the page rendered as landscape and switches to portrait

6104431
portrait	landscape
if you start out portrait and then go to landscape and then back to portrait it works

6104431
portrait	landscape
but by adding the following inside the tag the page switch correctly from landscape to portrait

6104431
min	max
you can also set the initial scale or min max but setting the width should be enough

6104480
uitableview	reloaddata
uitableview has a method reloaddata which will call the tableviews delegate methods again thus repopulating the table

as i say in the code however you will have to consider how to handle situations like int + double

6110661
inherited	subclassing
since nsmutablearray is a nsarray subclassing all the methods are also inherited

6110732
google-chrome	firefox
when you set a fixed width on a html element then msie will also apply this on the opened list while the normal webbrowsers like firefox google-chrome and others will expand the list to the content width

min	max
find the nearest min max record from stage 4

6111087
subtract	add
and some more operations like add or subtract two scores etc

6111087
min	max
is this a better way for such kind of data data of scores here to keep all the data for all the 6 users in memory in nsarray or nsdictionary and find min and max in that array by a min-max algorithm

6111087
min	max
it should be taken from database by a query like where score 200 and where score 200 in short 2 database queries which return nearest min and max record each and not keeping all the data in memory

6111087
min	max
the point is would a db call be fast and efficient to find min and max or a search for min max in an array of all the records from db

6111087
min	max
frequency of finding min max for certain values are high

6111125

6111479
packets	pcap
i m using libpcap in c++ for reading packets from pcap files

6111523
google-chrome	firefox
if you can t find any current release browsers that support it you might want to check the dev release versions of google-chrome and firefox to see if it s supported in there -- if nothing else that would give you some clue as to how long it will be before it s likely to become available in a full release

6111532
qobject	qwidget
i ve noticed that a lot of the code uses references to objects like qobject qwidget or qframe.

jobs	cron
with cron i know you can write jobs as files out to etc cron.d without the need to fork to crontab

6111652
jobs	cron
of course i could use cron but it doesn t sensibly cater for one-time-only jobs so this doesn t strike me as a good solution either

6111652
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
so my question is - if i want to schedule execution of future jobs at a given time and date for a single run can anyone suggest a programatically nice way of either interfacing at or the cron daemon directly without having to fork to the os in c++..

6111675
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
you can look here in the jqxhr object section it explains that the function .getjson returns an jqxhr object that implements xmlhttprequest so you will have available .error .success and .complete

if you are overriding the accessor on the subclass solely for the purpose of applying a mapping you may want to consider using moxy s external mapping file instead

6111900
int	double
i ve figured out that the track bar only does int values so rather than have the range go from -5 to 5 using a double i need to have the track bar go from -50 to +50 with tick marks every 10 steps to get 0.1v resolution

6111972
calloc	malloc
no matter what i try to allocate it always throws the glibc detected error and always points to malloc method even if it s calloc

6111974

likewise if you are just storing integers as dictionary keys then using the built in gethashcode and equals implementations on the keys which is what the dictionary will do by default will be faster than using structural comparison

6111977
coalesce	isnull
you can also use isnull or coalesce to shorten your code a bit

6111988
unsigned	short
i think i can just use the constructor for the ascii data types but i still need to get unsigned short 2 byte and unsigned long 4 byte values

6111991
profiling	debugging
if you built the mex function in visual studio you should be able to do attach to the matlab process and then run the function for either debugging or profiling

6112029
coalesce	isnull
you can more simply express your query using isnull or coalesce and left

6112041
getter	setter
don t use public fields use getter and setter accessors

6112063
rss	feed
an example of this could be an application that retrieves data from a 3rd party source such as an rss feed with the following user interfaces

6112087
free	malloc
you malloc pevent but only free it if you find the key

6112106
unsigned	short
you should mask them with the appropriate bit mask 0xffff for short 0xffffffff for 32 bit in order to account for the difference between signed unsigned types

6112109
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed that standard input fields and select-elements adds 1 or 2px padding around it in google-chrome + safari but not firefox

6112384
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i don t know exactly if you have asked this but if you only want to compare the date component of a nsdate you have to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents to remove the time component

6112393
google-chrome	firefox
take its recommendations with a grain of salt though since a trick that makes code run faster in ie 6 7 8 or even 9 might very well make the code run slower in google-chrome or firefox 4

6112409
for-loop	arrays
this can also apply to modifying the contents length of an arrays inside a for-loop which stops at the upper bound of the arrays

6112425

if your instance variable is named window however some people use a naming convention of prefixing all instance variables with underscore but still prefer to have their getter and setter without the underscore prefix thats what the window _window means

6112438
uiview	subviews
now add your subviews on the uiview

6112453
width	height
the easiest way would be to add to 2-3 labels using a combination of height width top left of the trackbar and labels you should be able to position them relatively without too much hassle

6112475

6112700
rss	feed
in my app i am trying to parse an rss feed url

6112700
rss	feed
but now i am worried about the other rss feed types such as rdf and autumn

6112700
rss	feed
now the problem is in my app when the user parses an rss feed url it will work fine but if the user is parsing an rdf feed or autumn feed i am sure that it will not get any content from those feed because the opening tags are different for all those feed

6112700
rss	feed
i have a logical idea of using switch case for each tag that they related to rss feed rdf feed and so but i dont know to implement it.

6112701
folder	dir
things like cmd c dir don t know why - and yes i do cmd c dir in cases i am in some kind of shared network folder with thousands of files and ls is significantly slower than dir

6112720
range	median
you could do it by computing the median mode and ignoring values outside of this range when computing your mean

6112722
free	malloc
when malloc crashes it s usually because you have previously stepped on the data it uses to manage itself and free

6112748
junit	testng
you can use rest assured which makes it very easy to test and validate rest services in java from junit or testng

6112758

6112860
onresume	onpause
there are some small bugs regarding if the bt is not opened before entering the mobile app it get stuck too much in a while and for those who want to use this client server you should take a look at onpause onresume ondestroy functions

6112893
implements	extends
eg if i have an object that extends sprite and implements mungable i would like to do something like -

6112919
int	double
it is easily possible for a string int float or double etc because they all have a string representation

6112923
children	parent
i m trying to scale a container parent movie clip up so that i effectively zoom in to a point referenced by one of its children

6112925
avaudioplayer	mpmediaitem
i m trying to convert an mpmediaitem to nsdata object so i can play it with avaudioplayer

6112977
lseek	posix
the position or pointer is set in posix by the lseek function and is read by the tell function

6112981

6112983
put	get
3 that spawned thread then get put

6112998
hide	show
i would like to give the user the option like in active directory users and computers where you can show hide certain advanced objects

6113002
rss	feed
that way if one changes -- eg suppose the format of the rdf feed changes -- you don t have to worry about breaking the rss autumn etc feed reading when updating it

6113017
hide	show
i want to use jquery to show and hide the sub-nav-conatiner div

6113017
hide	show
the only trouble is my jquery show and hide all submenus - i want to display just one

a spinner location populated from the sqlite table location which pops an edittext dialog on a long touch and which saves the edittext valie to the location table on dismissing the pop-up dialog

6113041
post	get
to get an idea here s a quote by jamie zawinski which appears in the post linked to above

6113063
mouseover	mouseleave
you can simplify the code however - no need for separate mouseover and mouseleave handlers

6113103
free	malloc
if i get rid of the free functions the malloc no longer fails

6113124
implements	extends
as others suggested you can create a type say mungablesprite that extends sprite and implements mungable and then refer to that type

6113173
free	malloc
if your struct had pointer fields that you allocated with malloc you d need to free them separately before freeing the struct itself

6113185
free	malloc
what you describe sounds like typical behavior if you free something that was not not created using malloc

6113185
free	malloc
you are basically trashing the memory allocation lists - when malloc tries to find some free memory it crashes

6113242
put	get
but the only place you can sensibly put this without analysing the code behaviour in some details - in which case you would know what resources you have open is at the end of the script - which is where the connections get closed anyway

6113293
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i know that in firefox and opera perhaps safari

6113345
children	parent
another possibility would be to add a column to the parent table oldestchild_fk and then join in that row from the children table

6113374
public	protected
inheritance flows down from the parent to the child so the child can access public protected or package private methods on the parent depending on the declared packages of classa and classb

for-loop	loops
loops through an implicit cursor a for-loop implicitly defines opens closes the cursor

6113508
getter	setter
analysing your includes all the time and eliminating the ones that are not needed anymore for example i ve defined a private float variable of a class made a constructor and all the setter and getter automatically just by pressing an option in a menu when i ve executed the constructor with a number of precision too high for a float type it automatically suggested changing the private type to double and done all the changes including return types etc

6113513
getter	setter
however the .net team noticed that a lot of getter setter are basically just that

6113554
textblock	itemscontrol
the user control has a scrollviewer with an itemscontrol and a textblock

6113554
textblock	itemscontrol
the visibility of the itemscontrol and textblock is toggled by the mousedown eventhandler so at a time only one of them is visible

6113554
textblock	itemscontrol
the eventhandler is invoked correctly when i click the textblock but not in the itemscontrol

6113557
accessor	properties
changing a field which is what your first declaration is to a properties is a breaking change so specifying accessor in advance is a small investment in the future

6113617
for-loop	loops
reading a bit more in pil i see that there are more components used in the for-loop the invariant loops state and the current value of the control variable which are passed to the iterator function in each call

6113621
int	double
also why is count double and not int

6113634
width	height
you ll have to do things with the or iframe width height to get it to work

6113650
multiplying	add
also if you think that you can t use class because li already have any class you are wrong because yo can add multiplying classes to any element

mouseleave	mouseenter
implementing the mouseenter mouseleave improves it somewhat but it does still not feel perfect

6114182
hide	show
looks good to me you could also use the built in show and hide functions which might make your code more readable

6114201
hide	show
the only thing i would change is to use show and hide instead of the css call

6114276
addclass	removeclass
you can make use of jquery s addclass and removeclass to add and remove classes

6114291

in objective-c cocoa i was under the impression that every touchesbegan call must have a corresponding touchesended or touchescancelled call but this is not the case when a uinavigationcontroller pushes a new view controller

6114682
min	max
you could use two columns min and max

6114711
calloc	malloc
all i had to do was use calloc instead of malloc to allocate memory for the openal buffer

6114769
getter	setter
it only tells the compiler to generate the getter and setter methods according to the options used in your property declaration

6114792

my thoughts where i need to make min max sigma all members and just hide them from the grid if they aren t used

6114916
button	checkbox
but what about in the case of radio button or checkbox where multiple form fields have the same name

in this case if you do merge external branch it would be best to avoid squash their commits

6114951

6114997
width	height
turns out that when in landscape on the ipad it switches up the origin x is now y and width is now height

6115028
pbkdf2	salt
that is why salt and a number of iterations is used on most protocols like pbkdf2

6115050
postgresql	greenplum
1 greenplum is not vanilla postgresql but it is similar

6115064
profiler	yourkit
you might be able to gain some insight into what actually happens by running your program under a memory profiler such as yourkit

6115069
capitalization	uppercase
according to your code it should be user.id uppercase not lower case - capitalization matters

6115080
getter	setter
unless you are doing validation on the input there s no point using getter setter here in my opinion

6115080
getter	setter
make the properties public and override the getter setter for invalid properties using magic methods

6115087
jquery	simplemodal
i m using jquery simplemodal to open a popup form which include ajax autocomplete inputs the first time access to the modal this autocompletes works fine but when i close it and reopen the modal the autocomplete are not longer binded to the functions of ajax any clue

6115093
int	chars
moreover in this trivial case direct assignment even if a1 was explicitly declared as an int constant most compilers would not issue a warning if they could see that the constant is in range of the target type unsigned chars

6115096
post	get
here s my problem for some reason the server interprets the post request as a get and for this reason the php input is always empty

6115126
subclipse	egit
if you are using the subclipse svn or egit git plugins you may try to create a new project and checkout your code via the git subclipse wizard

6115137
put	get
in the youtube case all you have to do is get the video id of the url and put this in the follow url

6115162
salt	md5
for example if a user s pass is 123456 only a retard would use this but it s an example if you add a salt of salt to it so it becomes 123456salt the md5 of this would be 207acd61a3c1bd506d7e9a4535359f8a

6115168
hide	show
i took a copy of the latest release of an mvc2 project i have been working on and started playing around with how to make a wizard with jquery by using hide and show

6115271
cos	sin
r cos beta cos alpha l + r cos beta sin alpha m + r sin beta n

6115279
versioning	upgrade
it appears as if the database will always grow on the thunderbolt when i upgrade the database versioning

6115304
ienumerable	icollection
unless you can change the method so that it takes icollection ienumerable or their generic variants you have to pass an instance of microsoft.visualbasic.collection to that method

6115320
folder	directory
first check the allow output folder for source folder box then modify the individual output folder elements under each source directory

6115325

6115350
hash	md5
i have a column of type char 32 where i want to store an md5 hash key

6115355
addclass	removeclass
yes you should use addclass and removeclass to change the styling

6115391
post	get
check that your phone is actually sending a post then check if your server is somehow rewriting redirecting the request into a get instead

6115407
hex	binary
two common options are to encode the raw binary data as hex - which it looks like you re doing in the second case - or to use base64

6115408
hash	md5
i d guess that your hashkey sql function is not hex encoding the md5 hash rather it s just returning the ascii characters representing the hash

6115416
mouseleave	mouseenter
the typical way to do this is to set up a timer to close the submenu on the parent s mouseleave event but cancel the timer if you mouseenter on the submenu

6115419
hide	show
then move all of the positioning css and jquery stuff to show hide position the div instead

6115437
hex	binary
storing the binary data is twice as space efficient than storing it as hex

6115439
hash	salt
always hash your passwords with a salt key

6115439
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt password is that the hacker who gained access to your database cannot simply compare the hash with a known list of hash that correspond to common passwords

6115439
hash	salt
by using a unique salt per password you guarantee that each hash in the database is different even if they use the same password

6115439
hash	salt
here s a sample hash with a 48-bit salt and sha-256

6115538
addclass	removeclass
instead you should use addclass and removeclass and control the styles in your static css

6115567
textview	imageview
i have the following imageview and textview

6115718
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code which works nice in google-chrome and firefox but on ie only the second background image appears.

i would recommend not removing adding classes for show hide just use jquery s and

6115728
ant	maven
for now even if sonar 2.6 may use ant or a simple command line to trigger the analysis on a java project maven is mandatory for a .net project

6115799
serializable	deserialization
also this assumes completely out-of-the-box serializable deserialization

6115833
put	get
if i take this code and put it in a method i can t get it visible

6115842
min	max
then you can easily calculate the bounding box by computing the min and max x and y for all of these points

6115849
client-side	server-side
the fix is simply to make sure it is enabled server-side the default then disable it see blow or enable it see above using client-side code

6115857
actualheight	actualwidth
in each iteration of the loop get the item s canvas position upper left and add actualwidth actualheight to get lower right point

6115857
min	max
keep track of min and max upper left and lower right to get your bounding box

6115863
profiling	instrumentation
the visual studio profiling has two modes of operation sampling and instrumentation

6115882
accessor	properties	getter	setter
properties are atomic by default so that synthesized accessor provide robust access to properties in a multithreaded environmentâ that is the value returned from the getter or set via the setter is always fully retrieved or set regardless of what other threads are executing concurrently

6115882
accessor	properties
if you specify retain or copy and do not specify nonatomic then in a reference-counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned valueâ the implementation will be similar to the following

6115882
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

6115896
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
is runtimeexception an unchecked-exception

6115908
for-loop	loops
after the for-loop this means loops does nothing

6115973
rss	feed
as you can see from the code it goes off and does a pull from an rss feed in an asynctask

6116020
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
so you can always throw a subclass of runtimeexception unchecked-exception

i m trying to scrape uk food ratings agency data aspx seach results pages e. g using mechanize python on scraperwiki but coming up with a problem when trying to follow next page links which have the form

6116030
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
is runtimeexception an unchecked-exception

6116030
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
so nullpointerexception and numberformatexception are both runtimeexception catching a nullpointerexception should replaced with a graceful null-check while i recommend catching a numberformatexception explicitly to avoid possible introduction of error prone code

6116049
getter	setter
besides that the property must have a getter and setter to get the attribute working

6116053
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if they re using google-chrome safari use websql if they re using firefox or internet explorer use indexeddb

6116055
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are subclasses of runtimeexception

6116104
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
this is because it is a subclass of illegalargumentexception which is a subclass of runtimeexception

6116104
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
2 runtimeexception is the root of all unchecked-exception

6116121
nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue

but if i launch in landscape i get an error and my interface orientation seems still to be portrait while the simulator is in landscape mode

6116248
portrait	landscape
the log says it is in landscape mode if i launch in landscape but if i change tab to another it looks terrible because the view is displayed in portrait mode instead

6116248
portrait	landscape
on change back to the start-view where i asked for orientationâ the log displays portrait â but the simulator is still landscape

6116310

rendering 500 rows on one page is a bad idea no matter what browser you are using even though it might work better in safari firefox and google-chrome compared to ie

6116488
putty	winscp
you could also embed the putty source code i believe winscp does this

6116496
children	parent
all i would like to do is dim the children of the parent div except for the child being hovered

6116496
children	parent
i feel as though i need to be fading out all the children of the parent div by selecting #four with my hover statement but i m not quite sure how to do that

in general i would avoid server-side html generation and opt for client-side templates

6116526

int main int argc chars argv chars arge

6116557
stdout	fflush
also add n to your printf to make sure it is fflush to stdout

6116614

6116616
versioning	upgrade
my host upgrade my versioning of freebsd and now one of my scripts is broken

6116622
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest

6116728
filtering	grouping
i ve done some research and learned that for joomla 1.5.9 to work with iframe tags you must set permissions in article manager parameters filtering grouping to whitelist the super administrator and then set user manager select user user editor to editor - no editor

6116729
interpreted-language	compiled-language
in higher level languages say javascript it s usually a win to delegate string processing down to a regular expression because there s so much overhead even doing a simple loop in an interpreted-language but the same reasoning doesn t apply to compiled-language like c++

6116740
children	parent
nodes have references to both parent if they exist and references to all children if they exist so traversal up the tree and down the tree is fair game

6116742
folder	directory
you could use linq-to-filesystem to query a directory listing all the folder files and sub-folders

6116757
mouse	keyboard

folder	directory
gone are the vb6 days where we could create a folder data in the application directory and stick our database in there c program files myapplication data myappdata.s3db

6116971
for-loop	arrays
the above method for using an nsmutablearray addresses this problem also as now you ve created the btn s and added them to an arrays which is an ivar so you don t lose scope outside the for-loop

6116990
spaces	delimiter
as you can see when the loop reads in the string john coltrane it is treating the spaces as a delimiter and treating everything after john as a different filename

6116992
midi	osc
therefore i need to have the os recognize it as a generic hid device of some kind or a midi device or something that sends osc messages

6117024

gitolite	gitosis
for read-only access use git-daemon a web server or gitosis or gitolite

6117280
hide	show
the duplication of hide text show text is because in some areas these are present within html as well as being added by the javascript

6117296
division	modulo
if you want timers separately you could use the division and modulo operators to convert the integers to bcd

6117306

6130037
subtraction	addition
if one of the numbers is a constant your compiler might optimize by doing some combination of bit shifts and subtractions mostly for powers of two since hardware div mod is slower than addition or subtraction but on modern processors the latency already only a few nanoseconds is hidden by tons of other performance tricks so you needn t worry about it

6130037
subtraction	modulo	division	modulo	division	subtraction
no hardware computes modulo by repeated division some old processors did division by repeated bit shifts and subtraction but they still used specialized hardware for this so it s still faster to have the hardware do it than to try to emulate it in software

6130049
ant	maven
its often better to build and validate the .war independently with ant or maven then deploy manually or with a script

6130109

6130397
width	height
you dont have to create a customview to get its height and width

6130397
width	height
you can add an onlayoutchangedlistener description here to the view whose width height you want and then essentially get the values in the onlayoutchanged method like so

6130397
width	height
the system then walks down the view heirarchy tree to measure the width height of each view before drawing them

6130402

viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i ve been stumbling over the same problem and with some diagnostic work i discovered that the view s bounds and frame do not accurately reflect the landscape orientation in viewdidload when the device is held in landscape when the view controller is pushed onto the stack but do so correctly in viewwillappear and viewdidappear

6130654
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i just moved my code that needed the dimensions of the frame bounds from viewdidload to viewwillappear and it worked properly

maven	pom.xml
you can run the fsc as part of the compile phase of maven by adding the following to the plugins section of your pom.xml

6130682
client-side	server-side
since javascript is client-side code you can t simply call php server-side code with it

6130687
directcast	out
it turned out to be a huge pain because you can t use a type variable as a parameter in ctype or directcast in vb and you can t do linq comparisons on a an object and a nullable object of the same type

6130693
filtering	grouping
it fill first filtering out all non-contractors and then grouping the remainder

6130710
spaces	delimiter
however using spaces in the entered name changes the format of the outputted text quite a bit making all characters delimiter by a spaces and therefore incredibly easy to change

6130737
mouseleave	mouseenter
what would be the best way to implement a mouseenter mouseleave like event in javascript without jquery

6130737

this function will save a ggplot in a variety of formats and you can specify the height and width

6130838
easymock	jmockit
the only available options seem to involve low-level jvm techniques like jmockit or easymock 3 class mocking which are a pain from grails

6130839

6130904
google-chrome	firefox
this problem occurs in google-chrome and firefox

6130915
width	margin
if you know the ratios you can just derive the width of the margin that will be placed to the side of the image

6130915
width	height
similarly you can figure out the height if the width are equal except that you have to use the inverse of the ratio between the ratios as the width is inversely proportional the the ratio

6130915
width	height
once you have the width or height of the bitmap getting the space to the side is simple it is just half the difference between the bitmap and imageview width or height

6130937
rtp	rtsp
i understand you can feed the html5 video element rtp rtsp video streams

6130937
rtp	rtsp

6131052
mouseleave	mouseenter
whenever you implement mouseenter mouseleave you just attach events to the

6131052
mouseover	mouseout
normal mouseover mouseout events but then check for two important particulars

6131052
mouseleave	mouseenter
important part was the if clause mouseenter mouseleave is just

6131052
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover mouseout but checking if you re targeting the right element and if

6131081
put	get
the time complexity should be o n because the hashmap operations put get and keyset are o 1

6131084

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my aim is to have this work on ie firefox google-chrome safari

6131492
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
so upon near completion of my website i tested it as i do in google-chrome firefox opera and ie8

6131492
google-chrome	safari
ive not got around to safari yet but im guessing its mostly similar to how google-chrome would display it

6131533
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mspec	nunit	mspec
i would advise against driving mspec with data use nunit or mbunit if you need row tests or combinatorial tests and mspec when you describe behavior

6131533
nunit	mspec
instead of starting with a blank sheet of paper think nunit s test methods mspec gives you a template establish because it that you can build your specifications around

6131575
folder	directory
which creates a new folder with name project in the current directory

6131580
implements	extends
the above code will return all matched bad words you can further extends it to implements your own logic like replacing the bad words etc

6131595
nsstring	nsdata
since nobody was able to answer i continued my research and discovered a simple but fatal detail in the documentation of nsdata the description method which is called when trying to print the nsdate as a nsstring by default uses a default nslocale to determine the format and timezone

6131661
width	height
i want to stack divs with different height but same width within a div container

6131674
uiscrollviewdelegate	uiwebviewdelegate
i add code snippets that contain delegate methods for many of the delegate protocols for example uiscrollviewdelegate or uiwebviewdelegate

6131688
put	get
i need to get some previous values with some conditions with second cursor c2 and put these values on listview

6131693
width	height
you can always use height and width on a jquery element

6131720
width	height
the first row of the table will contain the headings for example height and width but i need these to be buttons

6131720
width	height
the next rows in the table will just contain text values underneath their height and width headings and these are populated using a class that extends baseadapter

6131720
width	height
then my baseadapter inflates the following xml in order to assign the height and width to fill in all the row values inside the overridden getview method

6131768
postgresql	mysql
difference between postgresql and mysql

6131794

its memory is byte-addressible so i m using a chars array but i need to read write unaligned 32-bit int

6131854
pop-up	dialog
the next step would be to explain what a page map does what is it for and what problems it solves back buttons and pop-up dialog for example

6131878
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if you have a sorteddictionary or sortedlist you can use .first or for sortedlist otherwise you could do

6131878
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
.first will probably have o 1 time for a sortedlist and o log n for sorteddictionary

6131878
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
insertion and removal will be o log n time for sorteddictionary and may be up to o n for sortedlist

6131885
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist and sorteddictionary are implemented internally as binary search trees and could ideally give you o log n performance for a min requires walking the tree but not enumerating the whole list

6131922
subscript	superscript
if my understanding is right apart from aligning text vertically to say an image or using subscript or superscript what other purpose does it serve

6131947
onclick	onfocus

google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

6131971
profiling	instrumentation
re instrumentation memory leak profiling do other tools give any more info re finding root cause of a leak

6131971
profiling	instrumentation
so my question is beyond instrumentation and the profiling using memory leaks which tells you the location of creation of the leaky object but not the root cause are there any other tools i could run that could give me any more info than instrumentation re tracking down the root cause point

6131981
listview	gridview
from what you describe i would recommend using a listview instead of a gridview

6132022
put	get
if i put or or were the stars are i get this error

6132058
post	get
no matter which connection string i use i have checked the other post on this topic i continue to get table is not in the correct format error

cpu	affinity
process schedulers make processes have an affinity towards a specific cpu

6132094
pull	push
it was a pain but now i can push and pull code from my repositories and keep my sdcard sl4a scripts folders in sync with my latest changes

6132099
google-chrome	firefox
i can t see how that would work in any browser yet you say it works in google-chrome and firefox

6132238
children	parent
instead of getting each child in a seperate call i do one call to the database to get all children for a given parent cache the result and do stuff on the result

6132241

is the only way to achieve this to write a wpf control and then embed it in a winforms user-controls using elementhost and then expose that winforms user-controls as an activex control

6132254
fflush	gets
i do have a memcached instance running as well but gets fflush rather often and not sure i want to have memcachedb etc

6132337

post	get
also you can get number of post in stackoverflow for each of your tasks like zip files

6132481
google-chrome	firefox
the way that the popup blockers in ie firefox and google-chrome work from a high level is by the browser upon encountering a call to window.open walking up the javascript call stack to determine if the current function is mdash

6132481
keydown	keyup
such as keydown keyup keypress in your case ndash

6132542
post	get
i think you will have to post parts of your web.xml file to get this solved but if you are getting two instances of the same bean in the same application then it by definition is not application scoped

6132545
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of using the .hover method try using separate event handlers for mouseenter and mouseleave

6132545
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter would only be attached to the mnav buttons while the mouseleave would be attached to both the mnav button and the snav div

6132620

6133456
inherited	properties
functions are objects they have their own properties plus inherited properties from their prototype chain

or you can implement a locationlistener in a separate class and use it in every activity turning it on onresume and shutting down onpause

6138256
put	get
on my local machine it works but when i put it on the server i get server error in application.runtime error

6138259
portrait	landscape
the application desgin is quite ok on landscape mode but its break on portrait mode

6138286
integer	unsigned
the difference you are seeing is simply that the first format specifier is u which prints the pointer value as an unsigned integer and the second time you are using d which prints it as a signed integer

6138291
cas	shibboleth
two possible sso technologies are shibboleth and jasig cas

6138294
filtering	grouping
you could use a directorysearcher using filtering like objectclass user and objectclass grouping

6138387
persistent	transient
in order to be sure that persistent fields will be the ones i want and not the users of that base class i want to declare this jpa entity as setting all fields as transient by default

hash	md5
i m using the below function to generate an md5 sh1 hash for sql backup files

6138403
width	height
i am trying to resize the screen elements mainly div tags left top width height by giving all the values in age

6138403
width	height
i compute width from actual px screen width 100 and height by px screen height 100

6138403
width	height
now since both height and width are constraint against screen widht and height if the aspect ratio remains same with any resolution it works

6138403
width	height
but problem comes when say the width remains the same and height changes like by decreasing height it changes the height and elements width remains the same

i m trying to get the picture to load in the same php session in which the post request will be sent

6138526
width	height
i m not sure what you mean by control the size - you could set an explicit height and width or use percentages to achieve a fluid layout

6138538
width	height
in interface builder if you are using it just drag-drop a uitableview to your uiview and adjust its width height and y position in the inspector

6138552
unix	bsd
the hosts file format is the same as the format for host tables in the version 4.3 berkeley software distribution bsd unix etc hosts file

6138553
exponent	modulo
found the solution but not sure yet if its the right solution coz i still have to get the privatekey and decrypt the file but for now i was able to encrypt it using the supplied publickey as the modulo but i donâ t have the exponent and i just used some common number â œ65537â as the exponent

6138553
exponent	modulo
now this logic needs the modulo and exponent

6138570
width	height
and you can control the page size by using width and height

6138570

its better you write the gps start on the oncreate onstart and the gps remove on the ondestroy of a service and use that service

6138623
nhibernate	queryover
but here is a very nice list of examples that demonstate the feautures of queryover and other methods of querying in nhibernate

6138624
caanimation	calayer
as far as i understand about caanimation the key argument identifies the calayer property you are animating

6138628
equals	icomparable
because icomparable allows to determine if an object is smaller or bigger than another object whereas iequatable helps finding out whether two objects are equals

notice that some classes are implicitly persistable boolean byte chars int long object short string vector hashtable

6138691
jar	war
nevertheless you should consider to make a separate pom project which specified dependencies and plugins you might want to use on your jar war projects like this

6138691
jar	war
and then inherit that pom project by your jar war projects like this

6138713
children	parent
but beware that when you later want to get parent objects from the database using a query the resulting collection will contain several copies of each parent depending on the number of children think about how many rows an sql join returns... so in most cases it s not very useful

6138732
hide	show
i make an easy div hover show and hide introduce words with jquery in the default code

6138737

i am more concerned about the height though not the width

6138787
getter	setter
i have an object which comes and has a bunch of public attributes and no getter and setter

6138787
getter	setter
so i created a class with the attributes and created getter and setter for them

6138787
getter	setter
how exactly could i wrap the class with my safe class with getter and setter and gain access to the attributes via my getter and setter

6138798
nsurlcache	uiwebview
after setting up a small test project without a uiwebview the nsurlcache sharedurlcache memorycapacity returns the expected 10000000 instead of 0

6138856
getter	setter
now instead of passing around an instance of car you can either pass around mycar instance which has getter and setter or a reference to icar which will let you control exactly what you would like to expose for example you could just expose the getter

6138863
public	protected
there are varying levels of access from private to protected to public

6138878
getter	setter
in that case you cannot hide the public variables although you can easily add getter and setter

6138878
getter	setter
they won t see those getter and setter

6138901
viewdidload	viewwillappear
basically my problem is this the viewdidload method executes fine however the next method that should run viewwillappear simply doesn t run at all...and a blank table view appears

those header files are available on unixy operating systems like freebsd mac osx and linux

6139007
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works fine in firefox but with google-chrome and chromium the ajax is not fired while the page is loading and will only be run when i stop the request so half way through the upload

6139077
queue	fifo
if you want to access elements directly with an o 1 operation use an array instead of a queue because a queue has a different function fifo

6139122
int	boolean
in the baseexpandablelistadapter is one function public boolean ischildselectable int groupposition int childposition

6139127

that means if you put in any children directory another .htaccess file it can modify any previously defined policy same as its parent .htaccess

6139139
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome no problem at all but struggles to work in firefox and ie safari this is a problem with my code as your demos provided work with no problem at all

what is and is there a fast way to check where in the plane my line will intersect if i know the plane is always in the same z-axis so it cannot be rotated and its width height is infinite

6139199
google-chrome	firefox
so how come any time i stop a small sample gwt app in development mode edit it and restart it it takes 30 sec to become responsive in the browser both in latest firefox and latest google-chrome

6139220
portrait	landscape
there are related questions but mostly about tables and portrait landscape ui orientations so the counter-rotation implementation is quite a bit different

6139307
robocopy	xcopy
another option if you don t rely on psdrives would be to simply use xcopy or robocopy

if your images are larger than 50x50 pixels just reset the width and height css properties on the with the column class

6139398
width	height
i tried changing the screen resolution in a virtual machine orientation change is really just a screen resolution change that results in width being larger than height or vice versa and could not trigger any layout events

6139398

6139576
for-loop	arrays
i am not sure what you mean by how to access the direc folder direc is a struct arrays and you are already accessing it by direc index .fieldname as intended but i think the main problem is that in the for-loop every iteration overwrites the previous content of x so what you get in the end is the content of the last read file

6139683
dictionary	map
and std map shouldn t be compared to dictionary

6139683
dictionary	map
std map maintains keys in sorted order because it is a balanced tree dictionary solves a different problem

selecteditem	selectedindex
well i m assuming your datarow object contains the selectedindex or selecteditem of whatever is selected in column1 so you can base your column2 datasource off that value

6139792
accessor	properties
there are few changes in existing behavior but mainly es5 adds new native objects object.create array.prototype.map string.prototype.trim etc. and standardizes some of the existing de-facto features from ubiquitous line terminators in string literals properties access on strings and indirect eval behavior to less popular accessor and array string extensions

x86	64bit
one way you can test for a 64bit system without getting too technical is to check for the c program files x86 directory

6140390
x86	64bit
this directory does also exist on 64bit systems so the absence of the c program files x86 tells you it s 32-bit

6140475
opera	google-chrome
msie and opera interpret these sizes the same but note that gecko browsers and google-chrome interpret heading 6 as 11 pixels instead of 10 pixels font size 1 and heading 3 as 19 pixels instead of 18 pixels font size 4 though it s difficult to tell the difference even in a direct comparison and impossible in use

now you don t have a list of brand s but instead a list of nameidentitypair s and nhibernate will have only issued a sql statement like select b.identity b.name from dbo.brand b to obtain this projection as opposed to a massive sql statement that grabs everything necessary to hydrate a brand object select b.identity b.name b.description from dbo.brand b left join dbo.vendor v ..

getter	setter
and access them directly without getter setter is recommended on android read the performance guide

6140931
arraylist	linkedhashmap
linkedhashmap keys are similar to arraylist or arrays in the way they are stored in the order that they are inserted

6140951
freebsd	linux
by the way i have no problems running rails3 with jruby 1.6.2 in 1.9 compatibility mode on freebsd and i reckon it might be ok on linux as well

6140955
division	modulo
it is a hybrid of two data structures a linkedlist where insertion order is preserved by adding elements to the end of a list of nodes which have access to their immediate neighbours and a hashmap or a map that uses an array of bucket lists where a modulo division remainder of the key s hashcode determines the starting bucket to query for the equals method of the keys that lie in that bucket s list of contents

6140982
entities	entitymanager
i guess if you configure your persistence.xml file with that single entity exclude all other unlisted entities and then start your entitymanager factory with the ddl auto generation enabled you might get just that

neither overflow or column width is working in firefox or safari

the texture is now drawn in portrait which means that if i keep my iphone in landscape which i desire and let the views rotate along everything i see on the screen is a camera with a 90 degree angle

the subscription table really doesn t need to be myisam i could change it to innodb because i don t have a need to fulltext it

i have initially tried to loop over the columns masking the array except the column to be recalculated and the replacing the values with the new ones with numpy.putmask but this does not retain the order as it attempts to place a value in each element and failing that tries with the next calculated value on the next element ã la

6141671
width	height
should i keep width and height of divs fixed fixed with pixels or

6141671
width	height
should i keep width and height of divs variable using instead of pixels

6141671
width	height
i personally like the first approach where you fix everything and there is very little chance of anything getting disturbed at different screen resolution but the drawback is if screen resolution goes below my expected screen resolution then the scroll bars makes the site look bad there may be more drawbacks but at present i am not remembering it so in that case 2nd approach comes into the picture but the thing is once you start using for your width and height its very difficult to design the page though once its designed its more stable

6141688
inherited	subclassing
you could do this by subclassing uicontrol which inherited from uiview but provides some additional methods for handling targets and actions

6141778
versioning	upgrade
i m guessing if you upgrade to a recent versioning of boost 1.46.1 you d be good to go

6141831
pull	push
if you need to monitor every change then have your php page push data to your bot rather than your irc bot pull data from the page through polling

margin	height
then it can have whatever height you like and the non-floated content when applied right margin won t stretch under floated element

6141956
width	margin
if i get what you want to do the same with buttons you ll have to enclose each button in a layout so that the enclosing layouts will share evenly the space and the buttons can stay gravity-centered into those layouts each with its own width having a sort of flexible margin at their sides

6141988
many-to-many	one-to-many
so what we have is a many-to-many relationship between students and courses as well as a one-to-many relationship between student and presentations

apache	nginx

6145991
apache	nginx
what you want to do instead is use another web server for example nginx but apache would work too and run php as a fastcgi daemon

6145991
apache	nginx
a web server which uses limited forking few processes is probably better - such as nginx or apache with a different thread model

6145992
int	boolean	int	double
you can now have other types than strings only string int double boolean

6146000
post	get
it should be get index get new post create get show get index

6146034

the easiest way to do this would be to have the last action of the showtree function hide the show button and unhide a hide button

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
postmessage is a relatively new development so it s oly available in the following browsers internet explorer 8+ firefox 3+ safari 4+ google-chrome and opera 9+

and the results of running it in nvidia and ati are pretty much the same

6146246
int	boolean
and is only necessary if you want to fail say a string 1 or boolean true but pass an int 1

6146250
puts	gets
first method puts records into queue and second one gets them

6146259
floating-point	integer
if you perform floating-point operations on the number before using modulus even if the logical result will always be an integer you should use

6146300
inherited	subclassing
it s fairly common to create a custom base class right below nsmanagedobject and the have all the subsequent managed object subclassing inherited from that regardless of their entities

6146317
put	get
but in rails it s hard to get subclasses to work with rest conventions it punishes you when you forget to include or it punishes you when you put a subclassed object in links such as edit_user_path user - bad idea

6146354
getter	setter
you can simply define those values as properties of whatever form they are in with appropriate getter and setter and refer to them as someformoranother.thisproperty

6146369
x86	64bit
x86 32-bit x86 64bit etc

6146438
abstract-class	superclass
my problem is that usually i start creating interfaces and then move to abstract-class because there s always some functionality that i want implements on a superclass so that i don t have to replicate it in every child classes

6146480
kde	gnome
this means that the desktop manager gnome kde doesn t matter

6146480
kde	gnome
gnome and kde both have clipboards for copying and pasting

6146489
thin	unicorn
i prefer to use nginx as proxy only and let do the webserver job by unicorn thin whatever-else

6146517
hash	md5
or alternatively if you just need a hash with some relation to the original filename you can use md5 with the source filename

6146559
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that in safari and google-chrome it doesn t return to the beginning

6146569
urwid	ncurses
you could also do something similar via ncurses or urwid if you like

6146569
stdout	stderr
to handle process output you d need to capture the stdout stderr of and display it nicely to the screen using ansi escape sequences if you are manipulating the terminal manually or using an urwid widget to display the output in a scrolling window etc

6146603
versioning	upgrade
the current versioning is 2.13.0 and i recommend you to upgrade to the latest versioning

6146618
hide	show
you want to show or hide based on an expression

6146637
width	height
i try to get this example to work with scala and the scala swing library and i finally managed to get an internal frame but my mainframe distorts all internal frames and stretches them until they have exactly the same width and height as the space inside the mainframe

6146764
hide	show
you can use activities to show hide elements in the user interface including menus

6146764
hide	show
then when you enable disable your activity the platform will automatically show hide the element bind to it

6146768
mouse	keyboard
therefore even though the div receives keyboard and mouse events it s not reported in document.activeelement or a domactivate event handler

6146792
onchange	keyup	keydown	keyup
or is there a simple javascript way of doing it the onchange method doesn t update as they re typing and keydown keyup would have troubles with mouse changes

6146792
keydown	keyup
at the moment it seems like the best way is to have a function to do what i want check the length and update the message call it with keydown keyup change and also poll it a few times per second

6146859
hide	show
now i need to show the second select if the first select have the first option selected and hide the second dropdown if the second option of the first dropdown is selected

6146865
int	double
derived1 value_type is int derived2 value_type is double - allows algorithms for each to be efficient and use appropriate rounding etc

6146869
nowjs	node.js
i m coming back to web ui after a hiatus and looking to create a modern single-page javascript application using backbone.js or batman.js if it ever desublimates node.js communication via nowjs etc - but my question is how do i lay the thing out

6146890
webclient	webrequest
i removed the webclient implementation as it seems like you re using the webrequest one

6146954
uppercase	ord	ord	unpack
edited to pass c to unpack in uppercase because unpack c gives me -1 where ord gives me 255 despite running on a platform where c s char is signed

6146956
width	height
the problem is that when you set the div to position absolute the rendering engine removes it from the relative positioning system so your div doesn t reserve it s own height and width relative to adjacent elements.

6146960
udp	tcp
if you want a fully functional environment based on javascript that has access to things like the filesystem network udp tcp http and the like i d recommend looking at node.js --

6146978
16-bit	64bit
after reading through msdn s alphabetical list of core win32 functions i realised how simple win32 s api design actually is and it s unfortunate that it s shrouded with all the cruft from the past 25 years including many references to 16-bit programming that are completely irrelevant in today s 64bit world

6146999
kerberos	ldap
which is why active directory is as popular as it is -- combining ldap with kerberos into one mechanism for site-wide authentication and authorization

6147003
google-chrome	firefox
open up a debug console either firebug in firefox or developer tools javascript console in google-chrome

6147031
google-chrome	firefox
the applet runs fine in the appletviewer but has these rendering artifacts in google-chrome firefox and ie 8

6147031
google-chrome	firefox
the problem seems to always occur in google-chrome and be intermittent in firefox

6147041
concave	convex
if the polygon is concave it becomes nearly impossible in the general case without lots of extra assumptions proof consider a point which lies within the convex hull but whose neighbors do not

6147041
centroid	convex
if the polygon is convex all you need to do is sort by the angle from some arbitrary point inside the polygon centroid of three arbitrary points

6147045
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome etc

6147045
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome

6147075
wicket	stripes
if you change it to deployment wicket will stripes them from the output see

6147088
google-chrome	firefox
similar to disabling javascript in browsers is there a way to disable support for various css3 properties in firefox or google-chrome to quickly confirm a page is rendering ok if support for certain properties isn t there

6147112
hide	show
alternatively you can hide suppress sections based on similar logic or even show a section if the password is wrong and hide it if it s right

6147139
hide	show
in one word a mvc without the model and the controller i just need to show and hide some views this is the reason why the question does not apply here

6147203
putty	winscp
the file is copied to a predefined folder in the linux machine through winscp and then the command is run from putty

6147205

since you expressed interest in the units i assume you mean width and height since the units here are pixels

6147225
daemons	systemd
i have the need to create a systemd to store python data structures on a linux systemd but have concurrent read and write access to the data from multiple programs daemons scripts

width	height
where is it getting the width and height

6147284

6147284
portrait	landscape
this is after rotating back to portrait mode from landscape mode

6147290
stdout	stderr
the output you are seeing is not from python but from the process s stdout and stderr being redirected to your terminal as spam that is not even going through the python process

6147290
stdout	stderr
it s like you ran a program without redirecting its stdout and stderr to dev null and then tried to run another command but you d occasionally see spam from the program

6147334
spaces	delimiter
you can roll your own by using a spaces character as a row delimiter

6147374

the way i have the views laid out looks fine in portrait mode however when it is tilted in to landscape mode the bottom parts of the subviews gets cut off

6147513
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
try having the js console open in google-chrome or firefox or safari - you will get a much better idea of what the error is

6147529
hash	salt
i have ran this multiple time with different salt but the same password and keep getting the same hash

6147537
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

6147604
keydown	keyup
secondly you should know there is a difference between keydown or keyup and keypress

6147636
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if so you already will have pushed your uiviewcontroller on to the uinavigationcontroller which is not much more than a stack of uiviewcontroller instances

6147679
min	max
select expressions that are not included in a group function such as avg count max min sum stddev or variance must be listed in the group by clause

6147720
bmp	png
by calling supportedformats function i got the information that only png and bmp are supported by the device

6147743
pull	push
2 use a dispatchtimer on the ui side to pull the data rather than having the processing push it to the ui...in my experience begininvoke never performs very well

6147787
salt	md5
going from unsalted to salt md5 passwords

6147789
subtract	add
if you embed your textview in something other than the contentview this won t work you ll just have to add or subtract superview calls in an nslog statement until you find the cell

6147812
nsurl	nsstring
instead of loading with an nsurlrequest read the html file into an nsstring and create an nsurl to the directory with image files

6147829
nexus	artifactory
worked-arounds included locally installing .m2 repo or running a repo like nexus artifactory et al

6147829
maven	pom.xml
it s also a problem for my end-users who use the commercial software i write as distributed by my owner er my company my corp won t publish pom.xml s or jars to a public maven repository due to the absence of any click-through license agreement

6147829
versioning	upgrade
building should be as simple as running mvn install once agree to a license and then all builds work locally just fine until you delete your local .m2 repository or upgrade your dependency versioning

6147868
put	get
other than cross-referencing and type hierarchy you will also be able to get calling graphs references and if you put the annotations in your code - documentation

6147892
folder	directory
submodules so that if you just have them as directory of unrelated git repos within your repo and adding them to the .gitignore you may lose the folder without knowing about it

curious to know why because it s usually firefox or ie that don t play nice on their own and safari is webkit based like google-chrome

6148332
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
update #2 does actually work in all four major browsers google-chrome safari firefox 3.6 ie8 -- not tested for less than ie8 or ff3.6 turns out i needed to update plugins for both safari and firefox to support flash so the non-flash message was in fact displaying when it should have

6148343
put	get
while its true that you cant just send a vector outright keep in mind that the stl guarantees that a vector implementation will occupy a contentious span of memory meaning simply put if you get the address of the reference stored in the index of 0 of the vector you have the pointer to the first element in that contentious span of memory easily achieved with

6148379
post	get
eventually if you still get this error can you post a sample page of your application so i can check it in my environment

inherited	subclassing
one of the most common reasons delegation is used is to avoid subclassing that would be like sending the manager to school to become a mechanic - an analogy which looks a lot like multiple inherited

6148853
width	height
remove the width and height attributes on the svg element if they are specified

6148853
width	height

cas	openam	cas	shibboleth	shibboleth	openam
cas can be realized by different protocols either by the central authentication service cas protocol for example by using the ruby cas server and the ruby cas client or by using the saml protocol with a suitable server for instance the shibboleth server or the openam server

6150555
cas	shibboleth
both are quite difficult to implement and to understand and there is no support in authlogic for shibboleth but there seems to be an authlogic plugin for cas

6150564
qmainwindow	qdialog
in qdialog you have owner which is probably qmainwindow

6150636
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception s are what we call unchecked-exception

6150647
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
seriously runtimeexception all all exceptions inheriting from it are called unchecked-exception and the whole point is that they are not checked by the compiler

6150650
rtp	rtsp
rtsp is a protocol that can be used to start control an rtp media session

6150664
cas	shibboleth
the first shibboleth is a server and the second cas a protocol

6150725
google-chrome	safari
but it loads perfectly fine in google-chrome and safari

6150747
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unlike checked exceptions runtimeexception or unchecked-exception do not define a contract between the caller and the called method for they usually indicate an erroneous condition that is often resolved by the caller if it were to obey the contract

6150784

this code makes no sense because you mix server-side logic spring tags with client-side logic jquery

so i know you can get parameters using params but the thing is that it merges all parameters whether they were sent via get or post

6151409

6151457

6151647
archetypes	dexterity
i m thinking of using dexterity in a new site alongside standard archetypes objects like pages files and so on

6151647
archetypes	dexterity
i know there have been issues with dexterity archetypes playing well together on a site for example referencing between the two styles of content types

6151647
archetypes	dexterity
initially my thought is to use dexterity 1.0 and the version of archetypes that ships with plone 4.1 but i m open to suggestions versions 1.0-next for dexterity

6151652
stdout	fflush
stdout is line-buffered by default which means that it is not fflush until a newline is printed

6151660

i d then also implement and override equals and gethashcode

6151667
put	get
i m using this code to get a partial view from the server ot put it in a div

6151723
rtmfp	rtmp
anyway if you only want to stream video and don t need any of the advantages of the rtmfp protocol you could use rtmp with red5 but maybe you already thought of it

gridview	datalist
i m not exactly sure how your dataset is structured but do you need that datalist in there or can you just put the controls in their own itemtemplate in the gridview

6151797
apache	nginx
apache can also handle lots of passive connections if you run php as fastcgi and choose the mpm_worker which will create a more lightweight thread per connection but it s still not as good as nginx

6151896
folder	directory
create an empty folder named locale in your projects directory

6151899
button	checkbox
it should be a single string value so those brackets are not right there usually you have them when building groups in radio button or multiselect checkbox

6151920
children	parent
you could do but even then you would select all elements in your example as parent selects also nodes that have text nodes as children

6151920
children	parent
but even with that the whole statement will work as follows if there are any .wrap elements that are parent wrap their children in a new element

6151922
firefox	safari
ps if you use jfiddle.net general error in javascript will also be printed out in the error console of firefox and safari

6152209
archetypes	dexterity
i wouldn t use both archetypes and dexterity based content at the same time in a site

6152209
archetypes	dexterity
for example if any of your content contains non-ascii characters dexterity will index those as unicode in the catalog but archetypes will put utf-8 there

6152209
archetypes	dexterity
using either only archetypes or only dexterity is fine

width	height
i usually set the width of images to 100 and let the browser calculate the height modern browsers scale pictures with the original aspect ratio

6153242
width	height
the height should be width 4 3 or width 16 9 but as far as i know there s no way to calculate it

6153370
tabcontrol	tabitem
i thought perhaps it would be possible by creating a custom tabcontrol and tabitem that this could be done in the codebehind

6153370
tabcontrol	tabitem
the idea would be to somehow alert the tabcontrol from the tabitem that the close button has been pressed perhaps with a bubbling event or something please suggest and then remove that particular items wrapped in that tabitem from the itemssource

portrait	landscape
same happens when switching from landscape back to portrait on the homescreen with the double high status bar already on

6154453
switching	screens
but again i have a problem when switching to that screens from a different screens or from the landscape orientation because instead of autoresizing appropriately the map view and nav bar get pushed down behind the tab bar partially obscuring the google trademark which is grounds for app rejection

you can put the options in a map and do get option instead of switch option

post	get
if i try any post urls i get the same result page not found

6154906
nsobject	ivar
as far as avoiding the framework and creating your own base object goes all you need to do is make sure that the first ivar is declared class is_a and you could probably have a reasonable stab at replicating nsobject is by passing through to the runtime functions

6154949
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome support cors via xmlhttprequest

6154989
rss	feed

this means that the functions you re using dlopen dlclose dlsym etc are not defined

6155029
mouse	keyboard
accessibility doesn t seem to be a problem for both keyboard and mouse control act as whished

6155063
integer	unsigned
however the maximum length of an array according to the ecma-262 5th edition specification is bound by an unsigned 32-bit integer due to the touint32 abstract operation so the longest possible array could have 2 32 -1 4 294 967 295 4.29 billion elements

6155114
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i have an action-filter with an override on the onactionexecuting method

6155115
profiling	benchmarking
profiling and benchmarking with different mock resultsets will be your best bet to evaluate performance

6155120
post	get
then if that doesn t get you where you need to go edit your question to post what you have at that point and someone can try to fix it

freeglut gltools glew winmm gdi32 and opengl32

6155325
children	parent
the first-child pseudo class selects the first element under a particular parent but returns as many elements as there are first children

6155379

but when they submit the form i also need to have a check to see which value is currently selected then show hide the appropriate section again since the .change function won t be called on post

6155413
packets	multicast
i used completely different machine to send the multicast packets and the listener works from interface eth3 not from interface eth4

6155430

you can easily do this by creating a bucket on amazon s3 that has the same folder structure as your public directory on your rails app

6155480
apache	nginx
apache and nginx the two supported web server platforms cannot run ruby like they can php perl or python because there s no built-in ruby module that works as well as those do

6155493
visualvm	yourkit
profilers like visualvm and yourkit can do this for you

6155512
multiplying	transpose
though if you plan on post-multiplying with the transpose it may be easier not to do the transpose at all in the first place because multiplying with the transpose of a matrix directly more closely matches the memory layout so one can do parallel multiplies if you ever want to go so far as to use simd

6155533
for-loop	loops
it might just be lack of sleep but how would i use php to look in a given directory and loops through each file using some sort of for-loop

6155543
jar	war
deploying the web tier as a war and the business logic as an ejb jar is the right thing to do

6155543
jar	war
make sure you define a sub-project for each war and jar archive plus a sub-project for assembling the ear-file

6155543
jar	war
the latter project will pull in the war and jar files produced by the other sub-projects

6155554
gridview	rowdatabound
i m guessing you are getting the exception even before the gridview renders on screen as its in the rowdatabound event handler which fires when the gridview is loading

6155558
getter	setter
since properties are functions you can get a delegate from getter and setter

6155558
getter	setter
delegate like putting this delegate to the list with other delegates create a delegate from a property getter or setter method

6155558
getter	setter
setter and getter is a current situation in c++ java and many languages

6155558
getter	setter
but c# creators went further and decorated such getter and setter functions as properties

6155559
gradle	ivy
for a middle ground solution i d look at ivy instead and maybe gradle too

6155560

hex	binary
i m then attempting to convert the string above into ascii and then write it out to a binary file the issue i m having is when converting this string and saving the file using streamwriter and opening the file in a hex editor i m seeing more bytes that i originally wanted to write so for example 16342d1f4a61bc

6155767
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your git versioning if it s not the latest

6155783
min	rank
when used alone min and source have the same function putting all those nodes on the minimum rank the top row of a tb graph

6155783
min	rank
the difference between them is that min will allow other subgraphs in the minimum rank

6155783
min	rank
source only allows other subgraphs of min or source to be on the minimum rank

6155783
min	rank
a - b will be to left of c - d all in the min rank

6155816
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to the most recent versioning of magento and are still running into the problem i d

6155843
range	minimum
the standard defines minimum range

6155848
yacc	bison
the traditional approaches are either lex + yacc such as flex + bison or just a c program implementing a scanner and a recursive-descent parser

6155849
int	chars
maybe a way to count the chars after the final space allowing me to use ansirightstr string int for this

6155849
spaces	delimiter
additional thought would replacing the spaces with a delimiter say and then parsing that data into a stringlist followed by allowing me to pull the last index of the string list be possible

6155851
hash	salt
to do the match i send the list of hash and the salt securely separately to company b and they simply search their database using

6155851
hash	salt
a sufficiently long random salt prevents against use of a precomputed rainbow table to crack the hash

6155851
hash	salt
it would be pretty easy for company b to obtain one of these lists compute the hash using the salt i ve provided and recover some significant portion of emails on the list i ve sent certainly not all but a significant portion

6155855
unsigned	short
unsigned short will have maximal value 2 16 - 1 65 535

6155885
width	height
i could use the dimension.setsize double width double height this way

6155885
width	height
well the newheight and newwidth are not exactly 80 or 90 of the width height values

6155910
implements	extends
anyway any scripting language python lua applescript etc. is built on top of some native programming language usually c or c++ and if you want to extends your program with new features you still need to implements them first using native language

6155979
cos	sin
first cos and sin both have bounds between -1 and 1

6155989
gridview	formview
i have a gridview and a formview

6155989
gridview	formview
my edit button switches to the formview because there are more fields that i want to edit than will fit in a horizontal line on the gridview without horizontal scrolling

6155989
gridview	formview	gridview	onclientclick	formview	onclientclick
if i cancel from the edit mode of the formview and return to the gridview i use an onclientclick event to do this the next time a postback happens i get a viewstate error

6155989
gridview	formview
if i cancel from edit mode of the formview and simply switch to readonly mode and then cancel going back to the gridview everything works fine

6156002
width	height
actually you calculate 90 of width and 80 of height instead of 80 of width and 90 of height

6156075
google-chrome	firefox
edit it appears this is only happening in google-chrome and the default browser on the droid 2 global or at least it does work in firefox

6156090
httphandler	httpcontext
set the site host header to blank so it accepts all domains then either use iis rewriter isapi filter to do the redirect or build a httphandler to do it checking the incoming host via httpcontext then redirect as needed

6156097
mouse	keyboard
i guess is always 0 because when the drop method is called the mouse button is already released you ve just made the drop - so naturally the keyboard mouse state flags would indicate that it is indeed released

6156100
client-side	server-side
if you want to be extremely competitive and marketable you might pick your languages based on diversity for example one that s good for web on the client-side one that s good for server-side and one that s good for platform device development

6156102
tomahawk	trinidad
i m only hesitating because we are using the myfaces tomahawk and trinidad add-ons in the application that i m migrating

6156102
tomahawk	trinidad
tomahawk trinidad doesn t explicitly require myfaces as jsf impl

6156103
ubuntu	linux
in this development scenario my remote server is running on ubuntu linux with sun-java6-jdk 1.6.0_24-b07 while my development machine is running os x with java 1.6.0_24-b07-334-10m3326

6156112
touchesmoved	touchesended
your touchesended withevent will have to be the same as your touchesmoved withevent except it must invoke the method which is probably tied to the control event touch up inside event

6156137
sorting	grouping
in this way carry on the sorting for every grouping of 1 million integers and store it in the hard drive

6156163

i want a uibutton to pulse and i plan to do this by fading slowly between two color arrays on a cagradientlayer

6156609
width	height
i replaced my frameset with a table that takes up 100 height and 100 width and has two rows

6156609
width	height
then in each of the table cells i put an iframe that takes up 100 height and width for each cell

6156621
width	height
you can make a clickable imageview set the width height accordingly and the color to be transparent on top of your map view which when clicked triggers the easter egg

6156749
archetypes	dexterity
regarding references...zc.relation-style relations from dexterity items to archetypes have worked for quite some time

6156749
archetypes	dexterity
in plone 4.1 it is now also possible to use archetypes-style references from archetypes items to dexterity items if you enable the behavior from plone.app.referenceablebehavior for your dexterity content type

the general rule of c binary ops including division is that the operands will both be converted to the same type which is one of int unsigned int long unsigned long intmax_t uintmax_t float double long double

6157688
division	subtract
if inccount is unsigned int then your cast has no effect -- the subtract will be converted to signed int and then right back to unisgned int and an unsigned division will be done

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you have implemented the wrong method instead of - void viewwillappear bool animated it should have been - void viewdidappear bool animated

6162747
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
would getelementbyid or getelementsbytagname work just as well but also be supported in all browsers

6162805
stdout	stderr
however if you run your tests using a harness what you see in the output will be determined by the harness especially its verbosity level and by whether you print to stdout or stderr

6162925
put	get
what i m trying to do is get updates for where to put draw the ovals

6162929
width	height
fastest way to fix your problem is to adjust the root view in detailscrollview.xib to autoresize width and height

6162980
floating-point	integer
additionally have you looked at whether or not explicit quantization of the depth values is actually necessary or can you get away with just using the hardwareâ s conversion from floating-point to integer for the framebuffer potentially with an additional bias to make sure your quasi-depth tests come out right later

6163009
rss	feed
for example you could start the downloads just after you download and parse the rss feed

6163025
serializable	deserialization
this faq at parashift.com discusses serializable deserialization in detail

6163154
keydown	keyup
i want to be able to capture keyboard events but i have no idea how to implement it.after some research i learned i needed to implement acceptsfirstresponder and the keyup event and keydown event methods in the nsviewcontroller but after that i still don t have the thing working

6163171
typedef	struct
argumenttype is a typedef type of pointer to a struct

6163174

6163174
firefox	safari
it works on current firefox and ie but not on safari

6163188
post	get
sometimes you can t just send the post but have to request the blank page initially in order to get hidden form values that need to be returned in the post

6163188
post	get
additionally you probably have to handle cookies as well since they usually are an integral part of the web site s authentication and session management though you might get lucky that the session doesn t matter between the initial post and the first response

6163188
ssl	https
there are other potential barriers such as the site checking to see that the referrer is their own site possible use of ssl https and so on

6163239
nginx	lighttpd
the scenario is app - web service - server lighttpd or nginx - our program - sql database

6163295
inherited	properties
the most important difference is that when you add a properties to the prototype of a function and instantiate a new object from it that properties is accessed in the new object by stepping up the inherited chain rather than it being directly on the object

6163311
hide	show
i admit something weird is happening while using show hide with or without parameter

macports	homebrew
i would rather not use homebrew unless its the only way and its known to work as i use macports for most of my installs at the momemnt

6163428
hash	md5
therefore brute force attacks to crack the sha1 md5 or whatever you use hash are pretty hard

6163496
svg	vml
it s worth pointing out that while ie doesn t support svg it does support vml which is a competing vector graphics format

6163496
svg	vml
svg is now standardised so vml will fade away but older ies will continue to support it

6163496
svg	vml
therefore the solution i d go with would be to use svg by default and vml instead on ie7 8

6163496
svg	vml
one is raphael which allows you to draw svg vml images using javascript

6163496
svg	vml
there are also a number of solutions which simply convert svg to vml

6163513
post	put
update to put the sort of work i m doing into context i m making a rather large social-media style site that ll have a very large amount of small regular post updates

6163606
awt	swing
it seems that whenever the monitor is off swing awt cancels all painting operations leading to a number of display issues in the gui that are visible as soon as the monitor turns back on

6163627
memcmp	strcmp
when the files are binary use memcmp not strcmp as 0 might appear as data

6163633
calloc	malloc
to get around this issue you should really first measure the length of the file by first iterating through the file and seeing how long the file is in bytes and then using malloc or calloc to allocate the buffers you re going to compare and re-fill those buffers with the actual file s contents

6163650
stdout	stderr
so the shell moves the existing stdout to an available file descriptor above 10 namely 11 then moves the existing stderr onto its own stdout due to the redirect then restores 11 to its own stdout when the ls command is finished

6164006
nunit	mstest
the commandline version of mstest does not produce correctly formatted output and as far as i can tell neither does nunit or xunit so when i add mstest to my project s post build i still have to scroll around looking for the one that failed

6164011
yacc	bison
if you want to validate the structure of something and semantics is not an issue you could use lex yacc read flex bison

with firefox 4 or safari 5 or ie 8

6164059
kohana	yii
i mainly use kohana and yii but my question is addressed to the mvc pattern in general

6164078
getter	setter
jsf need private boolean and its getter and setter but if i want to resolve some internal logic in application server it must be defined static

6164078
getter	setter
and in the beans there are getter and setter pointing to the settings.variable

6164148
children	parent
as far as i know parent and its children share the same file descriptor so i expected to see the child s output which actually didn t happen

6164194
next	except
the author seems to be doing the same thing as you did except he has a return after the next

6164231
google-chrome	firefox
firefox allows you to copy and paste these images out of a browser but google-chrome doesn t

6164244
firefox	safari
it works fine with firefox 3.6x i would expect fine as well with firefox 4.0 and safari 5

6164246
portrait	landscape
the problem is that the added view draws itself in portrait mode not in landscape

6164301
width	height
notice that there must be an integer number of squares which fill the width and height

6164301
width	height
input width float or int height float or int

6164301
width	height
if the width height is a rational number your answer is merely any multiple of the aspect ratio

6164301
width	height
if your aspect ratio was 4 3 you could fill it with 4x3 squares of length width 4 height 3 or 8x6 squares of half that size or 12x9 squares of a third that size... if it is not a rational number your task is impossible

6164307
spaces	delimiter
if your input was spaces delimiter not delimiter

6164314
stdout	stderr
of data allowed on stdout or stderr -

6164341
portrait	landscape

children	parent
if a parent is found add the current node new unit to its children

6164415
mouse	keyboard
how to activate menu from keyboard so keyboard can used without need for mouse click

6164463
rowdatabound	onclientclick
on rowdatabound event you need to read the client id of your txtname and set the onclientclick of your linkbutton

6164472
prototypejs	mootools
possibly mootools or prototypejs i m not sure what either return if there is no matching element but i m pretty sure that both have a function that takes an id and not a css selector as the argument

6164485
implements	extends
you have to extends japplet and implements init

6164499
findwindow	postmessage
you ll use the findwindow api to get an hwnd for the target program then the postmessage api to send key events

6164505
nstextfield	nstableview
the four nstextfield under the nstableview are to moved to a sheet someday but for now this is fine

6164507
hide	show
is there a simple way using javascript to dynamically show hide content in a based on the users selection from a drop down menu

6164522
post	get
this little function helps to fight common security issue with sql injections it can sanitize any global variable like post get _server etc and escape unsafe characters

6164574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in ie 7-9 firefox safari and google-chrome

6164618
hash	salt
once a user is logged in you can set a session that someone is logged in and then on each visit check if session exists and it is valid using private salt and hash

6164625
try-catch	exception-handling
1 if i need to take some action depending on the specific line that has thrown the exception-handling the only thing is surrond each statement with his-own try-catch

6164625
try-catch	exception-handling
2 if i not need to take a specific action based on the line that throws the exception-handling then the stack trace will give enough information to know line has gone wrong without a try-catch block for each instruction that makes the code less readable

6164638
subtraction	addition
the type of subtraction is also the same as that of addition

6164638
int	double
note the type of 100 is int so it first converts to double type which is then stored as local variable x which in turn is passed to the function f as first argument

6164638
int	double
again a conversion from int to double occurs in both cases

6164670
gxt	smartgwt
gxt and smartgwt both of them i d highly advise against for many reasons have form validation

6164680
subtraction	addition
in your example it is used both for assignment of subtraction to minus and for conversion of addition to the parameter type accepted by operation

6164687
gif	png
presuming by urls you mean elements then the following code would remove all jpg gif png links which end with those extensions

6164723
hash	md5
this pertains to a view log that contains all records viewed by a user - the key for the user is either their id when logged in or a random md5 hash while not logged in

6164723
hash	md5
by either he md5 hash as user did not log in or id if present and either of the two

6164738
implements	extends
i m trying to implements the geocoder in a class that doesn t extends activity and i have problems in passing the context for the geocoder constructor

6164747

i want a css attribute or sort of thing that puts the bar of a scroll bar on the bottom euh a div with fix height and width shows a text but the text is too big and wrapped into this div so a scroll bar appears but the bar is in the top i want it to appears on the bottom did you understand me

6164749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this all works really great in firefox google-chrome safari even ie7

6164835
innodb	myisam
do yourself a favor and alter each and every one of your tables so they use the innodb engine instead of myisam

6164843
folder	directory
once it s booted up you can use the ddms tool located in the tools directory under your android sdk install folder

6164861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can disable the scrolling in google-chrome safari but putting overflow hidden on the body tag but on firefox this only hides the scrollbars and i can still scroll with the arrow keys

6164861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
with firefox i have to animate the html tag but with google-chrome safari it is just the body i need to animate

6164861
google-chrome	firefox
so how come i can disable scrolling of the body on google-chrome but not firefox

6164876
fread	memcmp
better to use fread and memcmp to avoid 0 character issues

6164957
width	height
i m trying to get the links to look like round circles with a width of 25px and a height of 25px so i applied the following css

6164963
google-chrome	firefox
later... seems i can do this in firefox but not google-chrome

6165018
pop-up	dialog
another approach to this problem which i find more useful for pop-up situations like this is to just open the other form as a dialog and require it be closed before returning to the calling context

6165025
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest relies on an underlying servicepoint

6165025
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
much in the same way your browser keeps a connection to a url open between requests and reuses that connection to eliminate the overhead of opening and closing the connection with each request servicepoint performs the same function for httpwebrequest

6165025
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
i think that the bindipendpointdelegate that you are setting for the servicepoint is not being called on each use of httpwebrequest because the servicepoint is reusing the connection

6165029
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
i left out the bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream since their buffer s size is only 8192 bytes which less than the buffer i use in the code

6165035
width	height
for part of a private project i am working on i want to get the height width bite rate fps of an mpeg in java

6165074
android-listfragment	fragmenttransaction	android-listfragment	fragmentpageradapter	fragmentpageradapter	fragmenttransaction
android android-fragmentmanager android-fragmentactivity android-listfragment android-dialogfragment fragmentpageradapter fragment-tab-host fragmenttransaction fragmentstatepageradapter android-nested-fragment dialogfragment fragment-backstack

6165089
multiplying	add
the standard approach assuming you have a 16x16- 32 multiplying available would be to split both numbers into 16-bit high and low parts compute four partial products and add the results

6165092
children	parent
i want to know if it s possible to make a specific query to obtain only the keys of the parent given some attribute restrictions on the children entities

6165092
children	parent
notice that i m not interested in the children just the keys of the parent

6165097
draggable	droppable
jquery ui has draggable and droppable functions for objects

6165164
post	get
i have found suggestions for things such as json google gson http post and get - do these sound like the right track

6165183
int	boolean
my db table includes 5 fields gameid the primary key int gamename varchar islocked ishidden and isfavorite all boolean

6165189
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

6165260
division	multiplication
64-bit multiplication implemented with 32-bit operations is quite slow and you may have the additional overhead of 64-bit division to convert back to seconds and milliseconds which is even slower

6165293
int	double
i want to access a c function that returns a struct containing double arrays where the lengths of these arrays is given by other int members of the struct from python

6165334
getter	setter
if you need to modify as well as read you will want separate getter and setter of course

6165339
switching	screens
aesthetics aside splash screens are a single instance activity that does not require a lot of complexity and allows you do do the exact thing you want switching activities based on some condition in your case if the user is logged in or not

6165350
nunit	mstest
we provide build tasks for mstest msbuild visual studio and nant including test parsing and reporting support for nunit

6165360
vmware	virtualbox
i have a slight preference for virtualbox but vmware is just fine

6165376
floating-point	integer
for example i wonder what the legality would be of a machine in which every memory location was physically stored as 66 bits with the top two bits indicating whether the value was a 64-bit integer a 32-bit memory handle plus a 32-bit offset or a 64-bit double-precision floating-point number

6165383
multiplying	add
since you are only multiplying by 1000 seconds - millis you can do it with two 16 bit mutliplies and one add and a bit of bit fiddling i have used your putative data type to store the result below

6165451
children	parent
i will almost always write a public destroy method for any object to handle inner object hierarchies parent calls destroy on child which in turn calls destroy on any children etc etc

6165470
int	chars
so setting minems to an int value say 3 on an edittext or textview should ensure it s at least 3 chars wide

6165472
google-chrome	safari
i use this webkit css code which works well for safari and google-chrome

6165481
hide	show
what it does is to show hide a subview in the cell

6165481
hide	show
if the subview already show then it hide otherwise it show

6165515
background-color	transparency
if an element has transparency but existing borders you can see that the background-color shows through the transparency borders here s proof

6165521
linefeed	delimiter
you never send a linefeed n to the java side bufferedreader uses these as delimiter for readline

6165528
google-chrome	firefox
if you have google-chrome or firefox with firebug you can inspect the dom to see how it works

6165600
mdpi	hdpi
because of dpi scaling you may be running what you think is an hdpi emulator but the emulator is loading mdpi resources or vice versa

6165638
keyup	onblur
to solve this i m trying to bind a function to the onblur and keyup events of the element to loop through other form elements and work out whether they ve been autocompleted

6165659
folder	directory
the key with windows directory and folder security is the owner of a folder

6165701
children	parent
i think you might need to do a mutiquery and bring together the dto parent and children yourself

6165745
converter	multibinding
i tried to use the value converter method and multibinding

6165746
subtract	add
so for any pair of variables x and y we know that the difference is between -m and m could add subtract ones there but not essential

6165752
httpconnection	downloading
i m using httpconnection to do downloading of pages in java

6165795
boost	stl
at some stage you might need to know about it but your better off learning other important things like stl and boost

6165798
ready	each
each distro has many many many python modules already packaged and ready to go

6165870
fgetc	strcmp	fgetc	isspace
and so now i have a non-utf-8 supporting code that works with fgetc isspace strcmp etc

6165877
hide	show
your intention is to show #loading then slideup and once that is complete hide #loading

6165877
hide	show
another thing that many people overlook is that show and hide when called with a duration are animations and are therefore queue however when no duration is passed these calls are not animations and will not be queued

6165877
hide	show
so calling show with a duration and then immediately calling hide with no duration will never show the element

6165877
hide	show
also the durations passed to show and hide are in milliseconds so hide 1 gives a duration of 1 millisecond you may be aware of this

6165891
pdcurses	conio
much of the functionality of conio can probably be found in pdcurses

6165896
post	get
this can be done in 2 ways depending on whether your form has a method of post or get

6165952
width	height
is there a way to get the width height of a div that has been set to 100

6165952
width	height
when i click on the blue box the width height of the parent returns an empty string.

6165956
ocp	principles
the conditional statements are an indicator that we are violating the ocp open-closed principles we can use the replace conditional with polymorphism refactoring to remove the conditional logic

6165966
overwrite	preserve
i have to not only preserve their existing handling but make it flexible afterwards too since someone could just overwrite what i ve done

6165994
int	boolean
mysql boolean are actually just int 0 or 1

6165994
tinyint	boolean
one caveat because mysql has no real boolean type your positive column is actually tinyint 1 and could contain any number that fits in a byte which will throw off sum positive

6166060
ant	maven
such as ant and maven

6166060
maven	pom.xml
using maven is the easiest approach all you do is create your pom.xml file and create your executions

6166060
ant	maven
it integrates really well with maven and ant

6166064
translation	pluralize
i know that i can use pluralize helper method but i want to embed this in i18n translation so that i don t have to mess up with my views at any point in the future

6166109
np-hard	subset-sum
the problem is np-hard since solving it efficiently would solve the subset-sum decision problem efficiently

6166131
crossover	mutation
entirely depends on what is your requirement in ga implementation what level and type of mutation crossover selection representation strategies need to be available etc

6166137
haskell	ocaml
i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term

6166161
rss	feed
if you view the savetostring source on the phone you get a minimal link to the rss feed and few other tags

6166170
folder	directory
using what sameera stated by configuring your app to load directory i would probably put it in a new folder in the lib directory

6166198
rss	feed
i tired all my php skills to extract domain name strings from a rss feed and put each domain name as an array element but all in vain

6166202
getter	setter
a global dictionary of shaders accessed by handle or name with getter and setter for their parameters

6166228
post	get
but when i delete the item by clicking the delete link i have an issue a get request not post

6166273
rss	feed
i would also like to know how to make that code modular so that i can reuse it for a new incarnation of this website that is going to pull in content from rss feed from two websites that friends of mine are developing

6166276
salt	md5
i also realise that for safety reasons i need to encrypt it possibly with md5 and salt

6166303
int	double
additionally i have a price field which should be validated as either an int or a double

6166312
int	double
as for validating an int or a double

6166329
min	max
what i did was to combine all applicable settings and then assumed that we applied the most restrictive settings so take the max minprice specified and min maxprice

6166329

to make things interesting i also defined a protocol named classcprotocol that inherited from the protocol as well as a classc object that is a subclassing of classa and conforms to the protocol all that really means is that any object that conforms to the protocol is guaranteed to implement the -protocolmethodc method

6170639
inherited	subclassing
the first thing to note is that in objective-c there isn t really a such thing as a derived class in the same sense as there is in c++ there s only single inherited so we generally talk about classb being a subclassing of classa or classc being a subclassing of classa

you were binding the mouseup event inside the mousedown event handler

6171987

also i think the hip thing to do nowadays is to use mouseenter and mouseleave with jquery event handlers

6172008

sorting	filtering
50 000 rows is nothing with automatic sorting filtering find-by-typing and loads of other goodness

6172200
puts	gets
absent an actual working file encoding decoding layer i think what you want is to change the gets separator from n x0a to x0a x00 abandon all use of strip since it s not encoding-clean and use print instead of puts so that you don t add extra line-ends since you ll be converting the ones you ve already got

6172270
fold	combinators
the recursive g is replaced with the foldr combinators and the accumulator becomes a function built via a chain of compositions of f at each element of the list in reverse order so we fold left instead of right

starttls	smtps
the problem you re having seems to do the usage of starttls which is an smtps command so you might need to read more about it in the smtps specification

6172456
starttls	smtps
there are two ways of enabling ssl tls in smtps connections as described here although they re often badly labelled some call tls what really is using starttls

6172456
starttls	smtps
the other is a switch to tls although it actually works with sslv3 too sometimes during an smtps exchange using the starttls command

6172456
starttls	smtps
here the client starts talking to the server in plain text using smtps commands but then sends a starttls command and initiates a tls handshake to turn the plain socket into an ssl tls one

6172456
starttls	smtps
you don t need to use starttls as part of the smtps protocol after that since you ll already be using ssl tls

6172460
int	double
use android.location.geocoder.getfromlocation double latitude double longitude int maxresults

super	extends
there s no need to call super in the constructor of an extends class unless there are arguments that you want to parse

my application has a setting activity extending preferenceactivity which loads the settings from a preference.xml file where a preferencescreen is configured

6187021
nsstring	nsobject
the format specifier works by expecting an nsobject subclass and calling descriptionwithlocale or description if descriptionwithlocale is absent to obtain an nsstring describing the object

6187064
super	self
in python 3.x you could use super .__init__ instead of a.__init__ self but you re still explicitly invoking the superclass s __init__

6187074
google-chrome	firefox
on ie 9 google-chrome and firefox you can use the domattrmodified

6187076
int	boolean
jsonarray.getboolean int index returns a boolean

6187076
int	double
jsonarray.getdouble int index returns a double

6187129
width	height
i have made the width and height 2 n + 2 as per the guidelines on the opengl official webpage though i am not sure that this is correct given how i am trying to build my array of floats

6187129
width	height
i have also tried a call to glgeterror with no success that is no errors are thrown and i have ensured that i can throw errors by setting width and height to -1

6187132
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in both firefox and google-chrome

6187187
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
gui pick one of gtk2hs or wxhaskell

the time profiling instrumentation tells me that i m spending most of my time here

6187430
portrait	landscape
in my app i have an image view in one view controller and a movie player in other view controller.now i want to display the image or movie in both mode i.e in portrait mode and in landscape mode .how can i define frame for each and how do i notify it when the view changes its position from one to other

6187456
udp	tcp
i just came home from my exam in network-programming and one of the question they asked us was if you are going to stream video would you use tcp or udp

6187456
udp	tcp
to this question they simply expected a short answer of tcp for stored video and udp for live video but i thought about this on my way home and is it necessarily better to use udp for streaming live video

6187496
hide	show
is it possible to show it only on the main page and hide it when a visitor reads a sub-page or blog entry

6187506
hash	md5
md5 is a hash function with cryptographic applications but saying you re doing md5 encryption and simple xor is just meaningless

6187506
ssl	https
use https http over ssl

6187510
udp	tcp
in this case tcp is a good match this could still be implemented in udp of course but tcp doesn t have as much drawbacks as for the live stream case

6187534
packets	multicast
with udp you can easily multicast your packets to all connected terminals

6187535
udp	tcp
tcp prevents the use of ip multicast but udp is well-suited for ip multicast

6187548
fadein	hide
hide the element first then only fadein effect will be visible

6187550
rss	feed
this is item element of rss feed

6187554
post	get
the reason its not is because when you first hit wall.php you get redirected to facebook to authenticate it then redirects back to your application script wall.php with a get - so you lose your post variables on the redirect

6187566
int	double
but if i have a double instead of an int

6187566
int	double
an int and a double can be transformed into string this won t cause problem

6187566
int	double
anyway i would like to understand why a generic object like my empty_row can be accepted as value of a declared int field while this don t work with double fields

6187568
fadein	fadeout
i want to make fadein and fadeout effects as jquery but by using javascript itself vanilla javascript

6187572
post	get	post	put	put	get
we ll use roo s json support to implement the get put post and delete operations on the word resource.

6187590
implements	extends
i guess json is easier to implements and extends

6187604
integer	fractions
first it will be cast to integer so you lose the fractions part

6187610
coalesce	isnull
index seek with coalesce or isnull

6187688
onclick	onfocus
i suggest you to dig into datetextfield to bind a onfocus or onclick javascript event on the generated input field which triggers the opening

6187699
integer	unsigned
i need to send a message of bytes in python and i need to convert an unsigned integer number to a byte array

6187719
getter	setter
never ever allow xstream or any other serialization framework to marshal anything but clean pure javabeans getter and setter

6187730
profiling	debugging
for profiling and debugging you can use general gpu profiling and debuggers as gdebugger and the like i think

6187741
integer	unsigned
the format string i denotes an unsigned 32-bit integer

6187744
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i think you intuition is correct when you dismiss the modal view controller the underlying view is displayed again and it controller receives the viewwillappear viewdidappear messages

6187798
pthreads	fork
couldn t you solve this using just fork just pthreads

6187808
children	parent
this returns me an array of all my parent categories alphabetically-ordered with a children key containing another array all the children of that category in alphabetical order too

6187813
public	protected
it would be better if you make a public or protected getter method for a

6187818
rss	feed
i m getting an rss feed from a site but if there is no internet connection the user can t read the rss information that the phone has already downloaded

6187894
oncreate	ondestroy
correct me if i m wrong but i understood that the config option android configchanges orientation should only be used when you want to handle the config changes yourself and not go through the typical ondestroy oncreate cycle

6187962
ia-32	x86
that is the data on the wire will probably include multi-byte 2 4 8 integers and either the msb or the lsb will be sent first but if one machine is little-endian ia-32 ia-64 x86 64 and the other is big-endian sparc ppc almost anything not from intel then the data will need to be transformed

6187962
udp	tcp
some are specific ip tcp udp

6187972
width	height
ya its time consuming to set height and width for every image

6187986
metaclass	subclassing
so to override __getitem__ for a class you can redefine its metaclass to make it a subclassing of type

6188038
getter	setter
i mean in objective c if i have a variable which i have declared in the interface of a class why can t i directly without making its getter and setter access with

6188038
getter	setter
getter and setter have their own advantages but when you are doing simple things would it not be better if you access variables in the way i have mentioned above

6188048
playsound	waveout
i m aware what winmm have specific error functions for waveout mixer etc is there a function which reflects last playsound status

6188178
viewdidload	dealloc
the retain count should be increased twice due to the retain in the property as well as the alloc in the viewdidload but only decreased once in the dealloc method

6188214
google-chrome	firefox
i have made a demo which seems to work for me in google-chrome firefox and ie7

6188236
division	modulo
explanation modulo will return the remainder of a division

6188274
width	height
draw a blue circle of width 300 and height 300

6188464
notepad++	jedit
i am new to pydev written scripts using mainly notepad++ and jedit where i never had these issues

6188464
notepad++	jedit
in jedit and notepad++ i am able to execute same code with no issues

6188547
svg	vml
ie supports vml instead and there are any number of javascript tools available for converting svg to vml so that apps using svg can work in all browsers

6188548
hide	show
another idea i had was to create a method or event that the presenter calls telling the form to show hide the controls but that kind of means replicating the logic in the presenter

6188556
aggregate-functions	sum
it is usually safe to assume that typical aggregate-functions sum count avg ... exist in all database implementations

6188581
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
after a couple of test firefox ie safari and opera working fine the only browser who erase the content of the editor is chrome.

6188613
hide	show
you will need to put the css selector inside the parentheses for the items you want to show or hide

6188653
folder	dir
and played about with this but closest i can get without ant throwing an error is to copy the contents of the temp dir not the base folder within temp

6188655
squash	merge	squash	branch
i am now done with the branch an want to merge it back into master however while i don t want to squash all commits into just one commit when merging back which i know can be done with

6188655
squash	merge	squash	branch
generally i will only need to squash when the branch is done and i am ready to merge back into master so i was wondering if there is a way to get the number of commits since a branch was created

6188694
width	height
don t use an use a and make sure it expands to the width and height of the object

6188698
post	get	post	put	put	get
in short jax-rs lets you declare a plain method as a web service by adding one of the get post put or delete annotations

6188712
int	chars
int x is fit with 3 means it accepts up to 3 chars only

6188754
hide	show
the button in the bottom-left corner should show hide the menu panel on top of the location info goes here bar however it works in a strange way

6188756
ubuntu	debian
to get to this option on ubuntu debian you d simply do sudo dpkg-reconfigure viewvc right now i m not sure about other platforms

6188766
width	height
i tried you layout with and all the views have the same height and width in the emulator

6188783
fast-forward	merge
or whatever you branched from so the resulting history will appear i started from later version and the merge back will probably be fast-forward it s easier to work with especially since you are rewriting the actual history to logical changesets anyway

6188785
client-side	server-side
no server-side action can manipulate client-side dom

6188805
bash	zsh
this requires bash or zsh for the syntax

6188847
postgresql	mysql
looks like someone ported the mysql providers to work with postgresql

6188862
ubuntu	debian
i need solution that will work in ubuntu and debian

6188897
entitydatasource	detailsview
i am using an entitydatasource with a detailsview

6188917
ant	maven
the maven ant plugin can then be used to call the ant task as part of your maven build

6188974
tabcontrol	expander
anyway the behavior you re describing seems more to fit with a tabcontrol than an expander

6189001
int	boolean
with axis2 command-line tool you can pass switch -euwc to wrap int into int boolean into boolean and so on in generated soruces

6189001
int	boolean
this is the one way to tell axis2 that its ok for certain int or boolean values to be nillable in schema

6189001
maven	pom.xml
my question is how do you set this parameter via pom.xml or other means with maven to achieve same behaviour with genrated sources

6189003
width	height
i know you can specifically set content width and height via corona and scale the content but this seems to be for scaling upwards method detailed here

6189024
portrait	landscape
i want to lock my own camera overlay uiview into landscape mode only so that allow user can record video in landscape mode only and not in portrait mode this is also my project requirement

6189024
portrait	landscape
it it locks to landscape mode when i launch this camera own overlay uiview but when i rotate the device uiview also rotates to portrait

6189033
put	get
i put in the formula bar and hit enter to get the colour effects that don t seem to appear otherwise for some reason then dragged down

6189064
hide	show
i discovered the element for html5 and that made me want to determine whether it was possible to implement a simple and reusable show hide via css alone

6189064
hide	show
i have created a show hide mechanism in the past for showing and hiding content by giving two elements relative positioning and one a negative z-index and then decreasing the z-index of the front element on hover and increasing the z-index of the back element on hover

6189064
hide	show
are there other techniques for simulating show hide on non-overlapping elements

6189064
hide	show
trivial example code that i would like to be able to apply a show hide to

6189076
post	get
as an example if your form post the following both get or post query

6189077
accessor	properties
i d favour your approach though with properties it s a good habit to stick to the accessor methods in case you ever want to customise them

6189095
pull	push
you can then push pull from either computer to your dropbox to stay up to date on all ends

6189125
udp	tcp
cocoaasyncsocket supports tcp and udp

6189125
udp	tcp
the asyncsocket class is for tcp and the asyncudpsocket class is for udp

6189125
udp	tcp
it works almost exactly like the tcp version but is designed specifically for udp

6189179
mp3	ogg
i want to ask for resources on how to load ogg mp3 files and play them using the openal facilities in lwjgl

6189248
tunnel	packets
you might want to implement this kind of restart streaming after break functionality anyway since phones tend to go under bridges tunnel just as the last kb of a 360mb video file is being streamed i know that tcp should take care of dropped packets but if the phone wireless layer decides to close the socket for whatever reason.

6189249
client-side	server-side
connect client-side to server-side via rest this will de-couple the two and provide a wider choice for future upgrade enhancement

6189304
int	double
int and float values will be converted to lua s number type by default double

6189332
udp	tcp
what you should be doing is either consider replacing tcp with something else udp

6189336
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i d suggest looking at the object before you serialize to make sure its not null and i d also suggest serializing to a file on the sd card to make sure you actually had data output so use new fileoutputstream mnt sdcard serializationtest as the output stream and new fileinputstream mnt sdcard serializationtest as the input stream while you are debugging

6189354
portrait	landscape
but once i change the orientation from landscape to portrait or vice versa the view gets very messy

6189378
versioning	upgrade
my application is always developing so occasionally - when the versioning upgrade - some tables need to be created altered deleted some data modified etc

6189385
nhibernate	queryover
use nhibernate and drop linq for anything too complex into criteria queryover hql

6189440
chunked	transfer-encoding
what i actually see is the raw http -- including chunk lengths when transfer-encoding is chunked

6189471
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should have a uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller

6189471
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you shouldn t override shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation in uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

6189475
int	boolean
unfortunately in testing this functionality i found that it does not serialize all extras just the primitive types boolean int long float string

6189478
pascal	delphi
large numbers in pascal delphi

6189485
put	get
i was wondering if there is anyway i could put a facebook link into a webpage and if a facebook app is installed to get the link to facebook open in the fb app instead of the broswer

6189522
post	put
the last post won t work backbone concatenate the id and try to put it but i don t know why

6189529
put	get
when i put the page in an updatepanel i get an parsing error

6189552
post	get
if you will be doing this like is in your post you will get an error because you want to send empty data of department object

6189593
pull	push
if you want to have branches that are read only to everyone but the pusher why not just let alice and bob have their own public repositories that only they can push to - if you want to see what is on their branch then pull from their repo

6189593
pull	push
the difference here is that rather than have one repo with lots of private branches - everyone has their own repo to push to but you can all pull from each other

6189610
pascal	delphi
see also this question large numbers in pascal delphi

6189618
mp3	wav
there is a pure java solution to play mp3 files or convert them to wav

6189640
width	height
you really can t combine jcrop with a rotated image since a css-based method would lie about the width and height

6189648
imageview	imageswitcher
i ask if somebody have a code of a gallery implementing a imageview extension with scroll enabled or a imageswitcher with the gallery scroll no animations

6189685
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the newsletter appears correctly in all major internet browsers ie 5.55 to 9 google-chrome firefox opera but when anyone opens it in outlook 2007 or 2010 all the fonts look blown up

6189707
pop-up	dialog
if it isn t a modal dialog you can always create one or several public events in the pop-up form that are triggered when the buttons are clicked

6189720
folder	directory
however if i copy the bin folder which has the dll files from the root directory and put it into the â œroot reportsâ directory everything works fine

6189751
mouseup	mousedown
eventhandler can be used to catch various mouse events mouseup mousedown mouse clicked mouse dragged

6189803
post	get
when i do a get or post at the url then both methods work fine

6189831
udp	tcp
i can grasp the concept of tcp vs udp but still i don t why there are 2 ways to send udp packets and with that i still don t understand if this is absolutely necessary to bind and accept .

6189878
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on google-chrome and firefox windows and linux and on different computers

6189923
width	height
then the element with a width of 1000px height of 100px and a background color red

6189935
centos	linux
i have a custom extension that works beautifully locally on mac leopard however after pushing live to the host centos linux i get a magento 404 error when i try to call the frontend router

6189937
libs	buildpath
so after thath right click on your project under eclipse than select buildpath add libs then select junit next select junit version tehn continue

6189997
put	get
since you will inevitably go back through your server to get to the data at most you should put some form of key like dsource db3 as an attribute or in a hidden field.. and then do some manner of look-up in the server process

6190004
ant	maven
it is known to integrate with both ant and maven

6190019
ceil	floor
i saw similar questions but none of the algorithms i saw the ones involving ceil and floor worked

6190098
versioning	upgrade
we don t always automatically want it included in our projects as sometimes we need to stay on a particular versioning for one project until that project is ready to upgrade to the latest

6190100
accessor	properties
one possible remedy if you re going to use a properties repeatedly is to call the properties accessor once and keep the result in a local variable

6190110
pull	push
if you let only this person be able to push the changes to the central repository or that persons repository is the central repository he she could pull in changes from the test branch of the test repository or the test branch of tester b use your imagination

6190126
cos	sin
for y use the same but replace cos by sin and x by y of course

6190147
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried doing this using both google-chrome and firefox

6190160
ceil	sqrt
if so you can use ceil sqrt n to compute the number of columns since this is as you apparently have guessed the smallest amount of columns you need in order to not have more rows than columns

6190160
ceil	sqrt	ceil	floor	floor	sqrt
the calculation i propose is a safer way to indirectly discover whether the number of rows should be ceil sqrt n or floor sqrt n

6190185
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
window.open method works correctly in firefox opera google-chrome

6190326
width	height
change width and height in pixels set res in dpi default is 72 for larger plots i generally use something around 120

6190363
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome doesn t support this at least not with that api and i bet safari doesn t either

6190363
google-chrome	safari
thanks to tim down for noting that webkit google-chrome safari do indeed support this which means my jsfiddle had a typo or something

6190406
stdout	stderr
note redirects both stdout and stderr to output.txt

6190451
textview	imageview
within my listveiw item i have 4-8 imageview some of them are invisible depended of some value and 4 textview

6190468
getter	setter
nb i had to edit the question since the first version seemed to suggest i needed getter and setter methods

6190521
pop-up	dialog
what you can do is to change the facebook android library if you use pop-up display mode instead of touch and www.facebook.com instead of m.facebook.com while opening the dialog a proper window will appear in the facebook librarys standard webview

6190523
cout	cin
prefix every cin cout std cin std cout with std or declare using namespace std

6190524
equals	gethashcode
the following assumes that an iequatable will have a suitable gethashcode and it certainly has a suitable equals method

6190528
post	get
in summary debugging your code should provide you better idea and you may post the debuged values if you still don t get an answer to this

6190537
put	get
i have large files that i put in git by mistake and i think its going to be a mess to get those out

6190586
git-rebase	amend
i would checkout the commit where the large files where commited amend it and git-rebase master on the amended commit

6190598
cout	cin
either prefix every use of cin cout and endl with std or add these lines to your program after your includes

6190716
google-chrome	firefox
normally i just profile the site in firefox or google-chrome but this issue is specific to ie

6190722
uiview	subviews
i have an uiview with 8 to 10 large images each loaded into an uiimageview as subviews

6190722
hide	show
when the operation is finished i hide the rotating image and show the view which contains the large images

6190727
maven	m2e
m2e eclipse plugin - much nicer imho as it integrates your maven and eclipse workspace

6190727
maven	pom.xml
thus your pom.xml is used to manage your dependencies and eclipse .project and .classpath is kept in sync with maven

6190745
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing will implement a method called something like generate that will be responsible for creating the thumbnail if applicable and making the call to their superclass to create the new symbolic link

6190768
bridj	jnaerator
since i have never done anything with native libs i looked at jnaerator and the bridj and jna stuff

6190832
int	double
you should not use d format identifier here because it means that printf should output an int while your maximum variable is double

6190890
cvs	rcs
# header readme rcs cvs v t

6190894
post	get
i am facing problem to get data from post array in php

6190899
int	double
d makes from your double - int - use f

6190937
width	height
you could adjust the height of the iframe if the scrollbars are present just check the iframes scrollwidth against it s offsetwidth and if the scroll width is higher increase the height of the iframe by the height of the scrollbar prolly 5-10px i d have to check to be sure

6190975
width	height
i tried setting width and height in the viewport meta tag to a hasty portrait shape

6190988
subclass	accessor
you can subclass this undefined class from jinja2 to include __getattr__ and other attribute accessor that you want to be able to use even on undefined entities and have them return a blank unicode string for example

6191001
stateless	stateful
google api is stateless http request response adsi ldap is stateful session-based

6191036
int	boolean
activetype boolean or int

6191055
pop-up	dialog
i am able to manipulate the shellexecute function to make a uac dialog pop-up and ask whether the user wants to run cmd as an administrator however i would not like to give the user any control over the installation

6191071
put	get
i have an array of length 2 in which i put time instances....but i get

6191072
superclass	subclassing
this superclass does not have the required protocol methods implemented subclassing one does

6191072
superclass	subclassing
instead of implementing empty nil methods in superclass can the required warnings validation be made against subclassing

6191078
google-chrome	firefox
probably easier to see the test bed i m running in the latest google-chrome firefox

6191193
superclass	subclassing
you might not declare protocol adoption in the superclass but demand compliance in all subclassing

6191193
superclass	subclassing
that way whenever a subclassing of superclass is initialized it will throw an exception if it doesn t conform to

6191295
inherited	properties
you should just be able to inherited from displaynameattribute and override the displayname properties

6191323
fadein	fadeout
what im trying to accomplish is a fadein effect on page load then a nice fadeout and in effect on mouse over for each individual item you can see what i have working here

6191360
firefox	safari
works fine in current version of firefox and safari and the new records or edited versions show when i reload the page

6191366
tolower	toupper
using toupper or tolower method during compare of your entity or you can use string.compare stringa strngb stringcomparison.ordinalignorecase

6191367
width	height
never used galleria but just peeked at their docs and it sounds like by default both those values are auto and will take the width and height of the containing element so if your containing element is liquid you can just leave width and height out of your init options and it should conform to the container

6191380
width	height
you can do this binding a function that updates the width and height of the element to window .resize

6191380
width	height
you should find out where is the galleria function applying width and height and use your new function to do the calculations you need with the window dimensions and apply them to that element

6191386
int	double
value types in .net like int double and bool cannot by definition be null - they always have an actual value assigned

6191387
puts	gets
i ve implemented the map as a concurrenthashmap to ensure gets and puts are thread safe

6191387
puts	gets
so given that gets and puts to the map are thread safe my concern is with the lists that are stored in the map

6191540
integer	unsigned
not quite sure if this is implementation defined but casting -1 which is obviously signed to an unsigned integer causes an underflow which usually leads to extremely large values int_max

6191545
addition	multiplication
as well as normal matrix ops like multiplication addition transposition etc

6191555
post	get
i had recently downloaded net-bean 7.0 which is latest so far i have tried to install springs plunging for net-bean but in vain although the post on the plug-in page says no additional plug-in will be required but while installing will get some error like in image attached

6191566
folder	directory
i find it weird to use context.server.mappath every time just to determine physical location of some known directory file under app_data folder

6191569

i understand that something like pyunicode_asstring and its related methods can be used to encode the data in utf-8 store it in a basic char string and decode later but doing it that way would require wrapping the generic getattr and setattr methods functions with ones that account for the encoded text and it s not very useful when you want character arrays of fixed element size within a struct and don t want the effective number of characters that can be stored in it to vary

6194466

my first assumption is that it has to do with the way firefox s js engine would handle string objects and that for firefox this operation is simple pointer manipulation while for google-chrome it s actually doing hard copies

6194466
google-chrome	firefox
but i m not sure why google-chrome wouldn t do pointer manipulation or why firefox would

6194472
int	double
and unfortunately it has to work with only 32-bit int and single-float math no double and not even 32x32 64bit multiply though i could emulate that if needed -- basically it needs to work on older cuda hardware

6194472
int	double
i ve been through park-miller which requires 64-bit int math and the cuda version of park-miller which requires double mersenne twisters which have lots of internal state and a few other things which didn t work.

children	parent
the parent waits for all the children to complete procesing

6200225

uiview	subviews
i m using the touchesbegan method in my main uiview to create a second uiview and add it as a subviews

6203388
uiview	subviews	touchesbegan	touchesended
edit the reason i have to find some way to transfer the touchesended is that the initial touchesbegan is received by a uiview that is removed as a subviews at the same time the new uiview is added so the touchesended actually fires immediately as the subviews is removed

6203393
post	put
the main difference between put and post is about their idempotent property

google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine for ie and firefox but not in google-chrome

6203737
wsdl2java	cxf-codegen-plugin

6203763
capistrano	bundler
are you using the bundler capistrano recipes

6203768
getter	setter
the methods that are defined for current_user are the setter getter methods

6203768
getter	setter
usually you need setter getter in order to be able to set and get stuff from outside of the class

6203792
width	height
you can make the width and height of these graphics relative based on screen size font size etc

6203802
put	get
however if you are targeting api level 11 honeycomb you can put in your manifest file and then call to get the max heap per app which may be larger than normal heap size

6203880
width	height
you can have an iframe of width and height 0 so it won t be visible

6203893
width	height
here is the example height 600 width 700

6203917
put	get
note the use of the analogous pure immutable data structures within the context of a state monad in addition to put and get monadic functions which facilitate access to the state contained within the state monad

6203936
width	height
i am also taking into account the width height of the scaled change but for some reason it s always just a bit off

6203941
put	get
my question is should the initial request issued from chickenshack to burgershack be a get or a put request

6203961
ethernet	wireless
i have a code which receives packets from the ethernet and sends it via wireless network

6203975
serializable	deserialization
if you do not circumvent the encapsulation it may not be possible to end up with an object that has the exact same state after deserialization as it had prior to serializable

6203975
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
how should serializable deserialization act if you are working through the getter and setter

6203997
pull	push
you could setup a nightly cron job on either your machine push or on the network machine pull so that they remain in sync

6204046
children	parent
the canonical way to do this is to pass a reference of the parent object down into the children

6204068
tinyint	boolean
the implementation will transform byte to boolean because a tinyint is mapped in byte in java

6204140
uilabel	uibutton
in doing this i explored how apple created their own classes but struggled to work out exactly how things such as uilabel or uibutton worked

6204191
onchange	onblur	onchange	onsubmit	onsubmit	onblur
you could evaluate onblur onchange and onsubmit for the form

6204191
client-side	server-side
i do agree that validating the move on the client-side and server-side would make a lot of sense as well

6204196
action-filter	onactionexecuting
an action-filter s onactionexecuting method receives an actionexecutingcontext which has an actiondescriptor

6204217
put	get
if i try rather than printing my counter printing each variable from the for command i get numbers from 0 to 2 max since that s what i put on my for

6204218
google-chrome	firefox
css works for firefox but not ie or google-chrome

6204232
post	get
thanks to this two post i get the idea of using n to replace n correctly in the final nsstring so is possible to use other valid control characters

6204284
rss	feed
in the case of the example above let s say i have a task that runs once a day that grabs the latest soccer-related article from an rss feed

6204290
google-chrome	firefox
the question title was check for google-chrome ie firefox that s what i ve answered

6204402
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

6204436
spaces	delimiter
so your real problem is that you have spaces in your keywords which solr is also using as a delimiter of sorts in which case the technical solutions listed there are the only ones i know of

6204470
equals	gethashcode
i suspect the problem is that checkboxlistitem doesn t override equals gethashcode so any two instances are effectively distinct

6204502
screens	tablet
also no small number of older apps will display in a phone-sized area leaving the rest of the tablet screens blank

6204503
client-side	server-side
sure that should work but if you re going to mix server-side and client-side code like that why not just use the server-side code to output one bit of client-side code or the other in the first place

6204517
implements	extends
so if you have c extends b implements a c.class.getdeclaredmethods wont return the methods that you haven t overridden

6204545
put	get
if you mean when you put same formula on below cell then when you drag this you ll get them automatically

6204563
post	get
using fiddler i can call the methods on the service get and post successfully and provided i adjust the json we re sending to the webservice to include the session id for example it trundles along happily

6204582
implements	extends
one option i thought of is making commonsettingsandfunction as abstract create a class commonsettingsandfunctionsreal extends commonsettingsandfunctions then implements the real class per project

6204608

6204693
folder	directory
is there a way to manipulate permissions for using shared folder and or printers for active directory users and groups using powershell

6204704
pop-up	dialog
i can not use ajax callbacks because in that case the browser does not pop-up the download dialog

6204753
width	height
i realize percentage height generally do not work but since the image width changes with the screen the height needs to as well so setting no height forces the css to constrain the proportions

6204756
versioning	upgrade
i ve seen implementations that also allow for downgrade statements for each versioning to undo what the upgrade did and this allows for taking a database from versioning 38 back down to versioning 37

width	height
height 600 width 700

6204919
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
- void tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller tabbarcontroller didselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

6204946
addclass	removeclass
first you addclass loading then you removeclass loading that s why you didn t see it working you should add loading class before the ajax call when the call returns success you can removeclass

6204962
serializable	deserialization
no serializable deserialization pain

6205016
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
i m writing an nsoperation to make a web service request via a nsurlconnection

6205052
vb.net	vb6
i am trying to convert some old vb6 code into vb.net

6205117
bmp	png
using this product you can create jpg png bmp images from the first page of your pdf files with the specified resolution and then use them as thumbnails

6205122
int	boolean
consider using boolean instead of boolean and int 1 instead of int 1

6205133
implements	extends
to extends rex answer a little bit the reason why java style concurrent modifiable collections are not very interesting in scala is its bias for immuatable data the most common way to implements concurrency in scala is the actor model which relies on immutable data not threads

6205160
children	parent
works fine and lists all the children of the parent but as soon as i navigate to one of the children it obviously doesn t work

6205244
width	height
the numeric parameters for -draw are left top width height

6205256
put	get
it appears that i ve got everything set up right but i get no response when i put a message to the associated queue

6205262
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
read the xml from the other application into a bytearrayoutputstream then when that s done copy the output stream to an inputstream you can use commons-io for that and feed that to the parser

6205282
outputstream	inputstream
i can check what the string is and get an outputstream to the client but whenever i write to it and flush the inputstream client-side is never in a ready state and will never get a message back.

6205320
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
i would like to move my finger on the gray uiview with touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and my cards move like this

if you thread is using looper and normally all activity s broadcastrecevier s and service s methods oncreate onreceive ondestroy etc

6205361
user-controls	tabcontrol
in my application changing the tab sometimes resizes things and at times the mouse up event will get called on a another user-controls because the tabcontrol moved

6205361
mouseup	mousedown
if i can set the tab pages to switch only on mouseup rather than mousedown it would solve the issue

6205376
folder	directory
i have a browser folder which contains a configure.zcml file - registering the resource directory and my template files

6205449
jar	war
so the solution i found to my specific problem is to simply use the jar command duh to unpack the war rather than restarting the server

6205466
free	malloc
you have to deallocate it via free because you allocated it via malloc

6205496
width	height
this involves retrieving the width and height of the bitmap calculating the number of bytes bitmap requires as calculating the available memory and then bitmapfactory.options.insamplesize such that the bitmap will use less memory than what is available

6205496
tablet	galaxy
on my samsung galaxy tablet the log statement outputted is 3759416.0

6205509
vim	emacs
i am quite certain that trying to make a vim plugin work in emacs is quite impossible

6205509
emacs	aquamacs
on unix like environments emacs is more native and you can use slime which is usually available as a os package or as a separate download for aquamacs

6205537
post	get
100 characters would best be handled through a post request instead of a get

6205584
ubuntu	debian
on my ubuntu also debian based system it system -- administration -- alternatives configurator

6205585
uiview	subviews
add a uiimageview as the first subviews of the uiview you want the dropshadow on

6205632
min	max
to be honest i d assume if they re calculations like rolling averages min max etc sql won t be that slow.

6205724
int	chars
note if the byte s were not ascii chars values representing int it s just an int encoded as four byte s then you would want to look at the bytebuffer class

6205733
hash	salt
first the password should be encrypted if not hash and salt possibly multiple times

6205768
maven	m2e
the problem is maven can not download the javadocs for the dependency or at least m2e download javadoc feature don t work so eclipse don t show me the javadocs when i use the very handy code completion feature

6205804
put	get
that said if you absolutely want a box with an x of type int in it you could try making your own get and put variants something like this

6205859
rss	feed
using simple pie it is really easy to mix multiple rss feed to one

6205880
versioning	upgrade
versioning 1.0.1 of pip seems to be the latest in that running pip to upgrade itself does not download a newer versioning

6205901
post	get
do not perform critical actions save delete modify articles using get requests..use post for those xsrf

6205950
spaces	delimiter
in this example join will contain all the lines of the file concatenated into a single string delimiter by spaces

6205950
spaces	delimiter
you can use whatever delimiter you wish simply by passing it in as the first argument to string.join if you wanted the lines to be separated by a comma and a spaces you d call string.join lines

6206004
stdout	stderr
this wraps the execution so that stdout is piped to out-file but after that wrapping stderr is redirected to stdout so that it can be assigned to variable err

6206006
jar	manifest.mf
the proper way to embed the classpath with the -jar option is to set a class-path directive in the jar s manifest.mf file

6206024
free	malloc
the most painful part is that you may have to override the global new and delete to use winapi functions exclusively because they are likely to use malloc free internally

6206033
vb.net	vb6
you should be doing your new development by creating com components in a .net language for instance vb.net or c# and having your vb6 application call them

6206060
free	malloc
you should allocate a new threadargs structure with malloc for each thread and free it from within the new thread itself

6206076
width	height
height 600 width 700

6206079
gridview	rowdatabound
you can use findcontrol in the rowdatabound event of the gridview

6206079
gridview	rowdatabound
see this rowdatabound function of gridview

6206091
hide	show
i am basically trying to hide a div on the homepage but have it show elsewhere controled by the url

you can then dynamically show hide the relevant fields on the form with javascript based upon the selected employee type as well as setting the corresponding fields as required

6206165
webkit	gecko
check this site it generats css for webkit gecko css3

6206169
plone	buildout
very new to setting up plone 4 and trying to integrate solgema.fullcalendar but when running buildout i get an error saying it needs zope.schema 3.6.0 and i have 3.5.4

6206190
hide	show
or you can check if .is checked and make your own hide show more bullet-proof

6206191
x86	64bit
you likely will need to set the platform target of your .net application to x86 in order to get it working on both the 64bit and 32-bit machines

6206208
for-loop	arrays
however you could easily create a float c-style arrays and iterate with a simple for-loop over it

6206252
multibyte	htmlspecialchars
there are a few east asian multibyte charsets which can differ in their use of ascii code points so if you re using those you would still need to pass a argument to htmlspecialchars

6206258
gentoo	linux
so i m using matlab on a linux gentoo machine

6206266
getter	setter
now there does exist a notion of a getter and a setter inside of the state monad

6206266
getter	setter
the idea is that a lens provides access to a getter that knows how to extract a b from an a and a setter that knows how to take a b and some old a and replace part of the a yielding a new a

6206269
post	put
when the user is back you send a http post put request to upload the data back to the server

6206276
for-loop	arrays
1 arrays indexing starts at 0 when your for-loop starts with i 1 you are skipping the first element

6206284
vb.net	vb6
i have a fairly lengthly block of code that i m trying to convert from vb6 to vb.net

6206342
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari uses the proprietary h.264 codec whereas firefox google-chrome and opera all support the open-source theora

6206361
getter	setter
this will prevent coupling while discouraging writing silly tests for getter and setter

6206361
getter	setter
if you write tests for getter and setter you get a false sense of coverage and will not be able to determine if the properties are actually used by functional behavior

6206381
hide	show
my question is how can i use the tags to show and hide the list items with classes that match the id of the tag

6206388
pascal	delphi
you may be able to do this with free pascal which is supposedly compatible with delphi at some level but no guarantees

6206413
oncreate	onstart
it would be best to put all data initialization in onstart or onresume and not oncreate

6206456
put	get
i have the first bit of code done but i don t know how to take in and store all the modules id and then how to get their names in the module table and put them in the gridview

6206498
daemons	systemd
depending on your systemd microseconds might matter an os that goes off for 50 usecs to handle a daemons outside your application might be deadly

6206503
inherited	properties
i can make objects that have prototypal inherited and know to set the prototype properties of a function performing as a constructor to initialize the prototype properties of the object

6206527
children	parent
the same product can be in multiple categories including multiple children of the same parent

6206527
children	parent
for instance if the parent category is bikes and the children are bikes - boys and bikes - girls i want to make sure i m including an ordered product only once in the bikes category row even if it is in both child categories

6206541
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
alternatives are option compare text case-insensitive compare and option compare binary case-sensitive

6206542
pull	push
the reason why this is important is that other people might pull in your commits and base their work on your contributions to the code base and if you later on decide to move that content from one place to another rebase it and push those changes then other people will get problems and have to rebase their code

6206564
getter	setter
you should be doing some validation in your getter and setter so you should be testing that

6206564
getter	setter
if you are returning an array or collection you should be testing whether or not the getter is going to be performing defensive copies of the data passed into the setter before returning

6206564
getter	setter
otherwise if you have the most basic setter getter then unit-testing them will add maybe about 10 minutes at most per-object so what is the loss

6206565
jar	war
i m working on a multi-project and right now i have a structure that resembles this actually there are a couple of jar projects and a couple of war projects

6206565
jar	war
actually i don t really care where they read them from at compile time but when i package my ear file i want each jar war to appear just once hence reducing the ear size

6206567
button	checkbox
may be copy paste error with name on checkbox and button

6206586
opera	firefox
tested in ie opera and firefox

6206592
boost	stl
but now as i learn more about c++ stl and boost i find that many of my data structure needs can be met by combining stl classes into more complex composites like

6206696
post	get
what you re trying to do is to send post data over get request which is wrong anyway

6206707
servicebehavior	was
i was able to get rid of the this error by decorating the concrete service with the servicebehavior and giving it a namespace

6206749
width	height
i want to be able to do something like this in the infowindow public images # name .jpg width 25 height 32

6206760
post	get
post and get will by definition return content

6206840
stdout	stderr
alternatively you could figure out a way to intercept your own app s stdout and stderr any solution that works on generic unix may work on ios and watch the text for relevant log messages

6206869
hide	show
the question is how to render the fields in the view in such a manner so that the jquery can also be incorporated in such a way which is similar to hard coded page with jquery to hide show fields

6206878
post	get
so if a post or a get request is send to a sever it must responds with a complete response as it can t know if itwas the 1st or 2nd request

6206887
folder	directory
since you mentioned dropbox you might consider making a bin folder there and adding that directory to your path

6206889
maya	3dsmax
if you want to achieve quickly something like the result in the video you should use a rendering library like ogre which can easily import animated meshes from 3dsmax or maya or softimage

6206927
hide	show
you could simply return a string for example containing the form elements you wish to show hide

6206942
pascal	delphi
i started xxm as a way to build websites with delphi and have scripts with both html and pascal code re-compile with a press of the browser s refresh button after changes made

6206949
geocoding	geocode
and in case anyone asks i do want to submit the form even if geocoding is unsuccessful as in that case i will be using geopy to geocode the address server side

6206980
explode	implode
you ll end up using explode and implode to convert between string and array

6206988
ubuntu	debian
any debian ubuntu folks out there know how to do that

6207003
wan	lan
for example if your server and client are both in lan or a controlled reliable wan you can use udp

6207119
post	get
frist of all the link will result in a get instead of post

6207161
stdout	stderr
you can run node as a separate process and watch the data go by using spawn then watch the stderr stdout exit events to track any progress

6207187
domxpath	domdocument
i am trying to find the last paragraph tag in a block of html using domdocument domxpath but can t seem to figure it out

when i put in file for the first two parameters i get an error that says

6207302
width	height
grayscale data width height bytes

6207337
inherited	subclassing
also consider favor composition over inherited unless the base class is specifically designed for inherited as a change to the base class might break the subclassing

6207357
jobs	cron
unix and derivatives use cron jobs

6207388
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to be a pretty straight forward task in firefox and google-chrome but appears to be a limitation in ie 7

6207388
google-chrome	firefox
what is happening under the hood which which makes ie different from firefox and google-chrome in this instance

6207424
glassfish	geronimo
there is support for running the container in tomcat geronimo as well as standalone or embedded in a plain java se app but there is no support for running it in glassfish

6207448
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
however all decent algorithms i can think of quicksort mergesort heapsort insertionsort only use for loops so their terminations shouldn t depend on the correctness of the sorting routine

6207464
django	web2py
using django or web2py can help mitigate this

6207500
google-chrome	firefox
although it works perfectly in google-chrome but in firefox this gets stuck sometimes

6207501
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie 7 currently does not and probably never will implement the multiple option for file upload input elements which google-chrome firefox safari opera implement

6207522
versioning	upgrade
may have versioning and may upgrade from versioning to versioning

6207527
hide	show
there are many show hide questions and examples but i can t find the answer

6207527
hide	show
each show hide uses its own id so i simply group ids like so

6207527
hide	show
there are 4 different areas that i need the show hide within a page and really don t want to repeat the same codes 4 times

6207527
hide	show
p s i need to use the herf anchor because this is important for keyboard user with the js show hide the hidden div can t be toggled

6207531
put	get
probably not the most descriptive title but sometimes it s hard to put stupid sql problems the kind that make you want to put booze in your coffee to get through the day into english

6207564
cpu	processors
the reason is that two or more threads that are accessing a resource may try to access it at different times - precisely when each of them tries to access it will depend on many factors how fast your cpu is how many processors cores it has available what other programs are running at the time whether you are running a release or debug build or running under a debugger etc

6207576
move	drag
if i drag item 2b to the first position in category 1 for example i can get two array lists for two fires of the update the first containing d the list i move from and the second containing c a b the list i move to

6207656
hide	show
i love using the hide and show methods but i ve come across someone s scripting where they never use it

6207685
google-chrome	firefox
you can see the log by a console built into your browser google-chrome console the firefox 4 web console ie developer tools or by using a plugin firebug for firefox 4

6207698
hide	show
hide and show effectively remove the element from the source html

6207732
put	get
i don t think there is any other way to achieve your goal unless you get the source code which you can put into a directory with the name shared

6207753
hide	show
the show and hide methods allow you to use animations if you d like by setting a duration for the show or hide

6207753
hide	show
when you use show hide or .css to control display is preferential based on what you re trying to accomplish

6207837
qlist	qvector
operations like prepend and insert are usually faster than with qvector because of the way qlist stores its items in memory see algorithmic complexity for details and its index-based api is more convenient than qlinkedlist s iterator-based api

6207847
hide	show
the sstab does hide show the child controls by shifting them to from a negative value

6207856
post	get
passing arguments as get post parameters

6207861
ravendb	couchdb
couchdb eearlang and ravendb .net both are based on lucene so it should be possible to make them both support faceted search

6207863
client-side	server-side
you have to be aware that you re dealing with two paradigms here the first one is server-side logic php and the second one is client-side logic javascript

6207897
cassini	iis
visual studio uses cassini which differs from full iis in several ways

6207897
cassini	iis
it s a self-contained version of iis 7.5 so you won t hit problems in production that didn t exist when testing using cassini

6207908
qsharedpointer	qpointer
full containment would be achieved if you had a container of objects like qpointer or qsharedpointer instances which logically share-and-track references to reference counted objects etc

6207927
width	height
first set the width and height to wrap_content

6207927
width	height
first set both the height and width to wrap_content

operates primarily in the matlab simulink environment

6207930
matlab	simulink
exports efficient symbolic multibody dynamics for simulation visualization in matlab simulink as well

6207950
draggable	droppable
this is a rather crude and codeless solution but you could try using the hoverclass option with your droppable and creating a new class called hovering to set droppable behavior that only happens when the draggable is hovering over the droppable

6207993
post	get
basically you need to use the webrequest class and simulate a user controlling a web browser and manually execute each get and post operation that is required to log into the site

6208006
sudoku	chess
suppose someone makes a program to play chess or solve sudoku

6208021

6208084
pull	push
i put push and pull shortcuts on my task bar so push pull to from tfs is a single click

6208092

6208187
google-chrome	firefox
i ve seen that behavior in google-chrome and firefox 4

6208197
client-side	server-side
i understand that it s a client-side technology but i also need to be able to interact with server-side code via web services

6208205
put	get
if you put the calls to the special functions together in a single function you get coordination 2 for free

6208228
width	height
the width is zero because hidden elements elements with display none have by definition zero height and width

6208228
hide	fadeout
after fadeout jquery hide the element s

6208261
range	min	range	max	min	max
mt_srand is used to set your seed and mt_rand takes in a min and max if you want to set the range

6208267
post	put
consider the classic guestbook example where you put a new guestbook post entity and then immediately query all the post in the guestbook

6208267
put	get
if you put an entity and immediately call db.get to fetch it back the result is strongly consistent you will get the latest snapshot of the entity

6208352

use the equals method or the compareto method to compare values

6208394
submit	submission
the task form has a submit button which submit to the hosting environment to complete the task and the page by default will then redirect to the wrkstat.aspx page to display the status of the workflow after submission the task

6208410
spaces	delimiter
input format and search replace pairings info is going to necessary to refine this answer if it comes close to start with but this would be my initial stab at it assuming some form of regularity in the input data spaces delimiter in my example code below

6208421
multiplying	division
multiplying by 1000 - compensate for previous division to get a number actually rounded to the thousands

6208473
post	get	post	put	put	get

6208510
sorting	grouping
i have another data grid that does server side sorting and grouping and paging and this works just fine

i don t see why you want both a sin and a cos term in your equation this should do it.

6208524
button	checkbox
the user selects which item they wish to add by clicking a checkbox in the treeview for that node and then clicks an update button to refresh the chart

6208548

about 1 2 the way down this page you can see how sin and cos are approximated

6208631
post	get
to get post get data

6208641
qthread	qobject
although qthread has its own event loop only events and signals for qobject created in the run method created in that thread will be processed in the qthread event loop

6208641
qthread	qobject
it is much better to encapsulate your thread logic in a qobject subclass and then move that object to an instance of a plain qthread

6208730
paradox	bde
you should really get away from the bde and paradox files as well as ttable

6208756

i have a multiview application and i have built a custom panelview controller to display panels with limited information about a product the problem is that there should be 3 panels in portrait aspect and 4 in landscape

6208758
octal	decimal	octal	binary
i made a simple algorithm to do that for type int for decimal octal hexadecimal and little endian binary but i don t think compiler do such thing like that to detect overflow in numbers

6208761
cos	sin
while modern cpu do have hardware implementation of common transcendantal functions like sin cos etc... it is rarely used as is

6208799
nexus	artifactory
there are some great open source options out there such as artifactory nexus or archiva

6208801
atoi	atof
seeing that compilers will have to convert to the integral numeric type anyway they can just as well let their atoi atol atof functions raise an error when the destination capacity gets exceeded

6208829
gitolite	gitosis
further use gitolite instead of gitosis as gitosis is no longer actively developed

6208865
innodb	myisam
we just switched our mysql database from myisam to innodb and we are seeing an odd issue arise in django

6208869
jboss	glassfish
you would need a real application server like glassfish or jboss

we recently evaluated gradle buildr and maven 2 as alternatives to our current mix of ant and homegrown ant-wrappers and ended up settling on gradle

6209040
ceil	floor
as for your edit in general ceil and floor might well be implemented in hardware

6209107
put	get	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
in fact if you put your view controller in a uinavigationcontroller you get the uinavigationbar and all the functionality of the navigation controller if you choose to use it

6209114
width	height
my relative layout has width and height set to fill_parent

6209161
inherited	properties
if use the inspector to change the #footer element on this page to be 7px solid red rather than 7px solid black the change will be reflected in when i run getcomputedstyle document.getelementbyid footer .csstext in the console but it will also give me a host of inherited properties that were never modified by either the user using the inspector or by the stylesheets on the page

6209168
uiview	calayer
you can do this all using uiview calayer

6209175
children	parent
my final structure that i need to put them into is sorted parent and children

6209175
sorting	grouping	children	parent
i would like to know how to grouping these under their parent type sorting by that parent type and sorting the children

6209271
cos	sin
for real-only inputs this can be rewritten in terms of cos and sin or in terms of cos with a phase term but it s usually easier just to stick with the complex representation

6209272
calloc	malloc
try allocating the entry_3d array dynamically using calloc malloc

6209282
children	parent
you could also store the elements in a tree so instead of having a list of strings that are in the parent node format you would have a tree of nodes with children

6209291
google-chrome	firefox
interestingly i found that if you pass in an empty string as opposed to a null string or a list of properties for the third attribute of window.open it would open in a new tab for google-chrome firefox and ie

6209317
put	get
you re doing an individual get and put for each phrase

6209317
put	get
instead you should use the variants of put and get that accept an iterable of entities or keys and execute them all in a single transaction

6209336
hide	show
when selection has been changed call action#setvisible true|false to hide or show menu items

6209345

the problem is that i have no choice as to what width or height the iframe is going to be since the users are making the embed codes through youtube s site

6209357
disk	ram
so the size of your executable on disk and the amount of ram it takes while running can be very very different.

6209387
subscript	superscript
use the selectioncharoffset property along with selectionstart and selectionlength to select one character at a time and see if its a positive number since positive represents superscript and negative represents subscript

6209391
public	protected
don t use var but rather use public protected or private var has been deprecated as of php 5.0 and is currently an alias for public

6209391
accessor	properties
you should make private as a rule of thumb all properties should be private or protected and accessor methods should be provided when needed - read about the concept of encapsulation

6209426
required	placeholder
you need to use is null or is not null where appropriate because null is not a value -- it s a placeholder for the lack of any value which required special handling in sql

6209482
capistrano	bundler
you just need to add require bundler capistrano to your cap file and all should be fine from then on

6209504
pop-up	dialog
when the code runs i don t get a nice lightbox dialog i get a pop-up blocker warning in both ie and chrome

6209511
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i created clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml files under silverlightappusedb application

6209596
setinterval	settimeout
that might mean using setinterval or settimeout to poll for its existence and when it s found proceed

6209627
g++	gcc
it would appear you re using gcc that is to say g++

6209629
translation	localization
it involves creating a custom assembly in vs that has a main function that does the translation using localization resource files in much the same way you d do it for an application

6209648
width	height
what you need to do is 1 fetch a user s window height 2 generate a span or div with a piece of text in it the whole character set would be most conclusive if you have enough width 3 fetch the height of that div span to determine the height of the font 4 remove the sample span div 5 divide and floor the window height by the font height

6209766
return-value-optimization	nrvo
is return-value-optimization or nrvo the cause

6209780
post	get
using the result of that i m joining to the sql variables variables to get the varrow increased every time a new comment and reset back to 1 each time a post id changes hence the inner prequery orders by post id first

6210003
post	get
i saw many post complaining xcode 4 problem in push where it always says authentication error and we have to try push again to get rid of that

6210069
width	height
if the images are going to be different different height and widths ...then i don t believe that you can keep them the same height and width without distortion

6210076
fortran	ada	ada	pascal
the dwarf format is designed to be processor architecture and operating system independent and supports debugging of programs written in procedural languages like c c++ fortran ada java modula2 and pascal

6210208
post	get
i have used httpconnection to get the data and post the data

6210231
int	chars
i am wondering why the parameter to indexof method an int when the description says a chars

6210231
int	chars
a basically what i am confused about is int in java is 32bit while unicode chars are 16 bits

6210231
int	chars
b why not use the chars themselves rather than using int

6210231
int	chars
are chars difficult to represent than int

6210247
int	chars
chars in java are stored in their unicode int representation

6210247
int	chars
the methods that accept an int value support all unicode chars including supplementary chars

6210248
int	chars
if you pass a chars into it java will cast the chars to int since chars is a 16-bit number

6210277
int	chars
for your specific question the conversion of int to chars is a narrowing primitive conversion. see section 5.1.3 in the above document

6210277
int	chars
that being said it s a common programming practice to interchange small positive int and chars which are encoded as int

6210332
hex	binary
normaly you use hex notatition not binary because keeping track of so many digits is difficult

6210343
int	chars
the real reason is that indexof int expects a unicode codepoint not a 16-bit utf-16 chars

6210343
int	chars
if you give indexof int a code point 65535 it will search for the pair of utf-16 chars that encode the codepoint

6210389
width	height
my basic understanding here is that the code is setting the viewing port angle to 45 degrees and the width to height ratio of the window size

6210389
width	height
how does changing the orientation and width to height ratio effect the equation

6210389
width	height
how does one figure out the required width and height in units

6210397
folder	directory
on your cloned working directory just update the paths found in the .hg hgrc file located in the .hg folder if that wasn t clear

6210449

6210639
children	parent
problem i need to display one parent post all it s children posts up to a certain number before requiring pagination and up to 5 comments associated with each child post and the parent

6210639
children	parent
the query returns the parent post all it s children and the first 5 comments it encounters usually they belong to the parent because we are ordering by posttypeid and the parent is the first post

6210639
children	parent
what i need is to return one parent post and all it s children posts and up to 5 comments for each child the parent

6210639
children	parent
the only condition is that the parent and children posts retrieval happens in the same query

6210649
pecl	pear
i was trying to find my way through installing the imagick extension but i got really lost when i read about pecl and pear and i really don t want to screw up the working php installation somehow

6210721
width	height
there wouldn t be any reason to change the width to height ratio or 45 degree angle

6210724
google-chrome	firefox
also i have noticed on google-chrome but not firefox that files explicitly listed in network do not fall back to the offline fallback urls when offline

6210767
int	double
150094635296999121 is the correct answer as an int but that number cannot be exactly represented as a double

6210768
getter	setter
add setter getter as necessary

6210791
google-chrome	firefox
all works as expected for firefox and google-chrome image is shown

in addition to what has been pointed out by brianreavis you don t want to convert the fractions math_2_pi real 256 to an integer since that will always be 0

6211057
width	height
the width and height of the presented view are smaller than those of the screen and the view is centered on the screen

6211064
min	max
set yaxis min 0 max 500 numberticks 5

6211204
inherited	properties
if this is a method that all of your forms need to use then perhaps you should allow them to inherited it through an abstract class providing an abstract properties as well that your child classes will use to implement set making it update whatever ui component the child class needs updated on that method call

6211268
waitpid	fork
the big idea here is the waitpid call which causes the parent process to wait until the child process it just fork ed to terminate

6211268
waitpid	fork
after the child prcoess completes the parent continues after the waitpid call starting another iteration of the for-loop and fork another the next process

textview	imageview
i m not tied to using an arrayadapter but what i want is a list where each item contains an imageview a textview and a seekbar to where i can update the images texts as well as receive callbacks from each slider obviously i need to be able to add and delete rows dynamically

6211339
textview	listactivity	textview	imageview
after several days of mucking around with it and searching on the internet i still can t see a solution to have a listactivity that uses a layoutinflator to create composite list rows consisting of an imageview textview and seekbar that i can communicate properly with

6211339
textview	imageview
i really don t care how to solve the problem i just need to have a dynamically resizeable list where each item contains an imageview textview and seekbar and to where i can modify each and receive callbacks for each individual seekbar

6211343
post	get
to get the post ids that the user likes it would be something like

6211343
post	get
and you could nest it another level deep to get more post info by using the like s post_id field

6211365
width	height
the whole width height thing was used when connection was very slow and everyone used phone lines with ancient modems - that way you could see the proper layout of the page before all images were loaded and it took a while to see all images after seeing the page with all the text

6214087

and the browser can perform this get request without any risk so the problem is on server side every action that can change alter data database session etc must check the request is a post one

i am hoping to put together a list of all of the browser toolbars for ie firefox google-chrome and safari that apply special formatting to the web page so i can test and change the design of my pages so that they don t look so bad when these toolbars are installed

6216794
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
only boolean chars byte short int long float and double are primitives

6216821
for-loop	arrays
in fact if the expression is an arrays it is translated into the equivalent indexed for-loop rather than actually using an iterator

then in node i get this data put into a buffer with base64 encoding and send it to the webpage

6216870
cocos2d-x	corona
i can t speak for corona but cocos2d-x is just an obj-c library so you ll still have to know a bit of obj-c to get it going

part and vehicle would then inherited from inventoryitem and extend it with whatever properties they need

6216920
portrait	landscape
unfortunately i have to deal with a uinavigationcontroller and each page has to support both portrait and landscape modes and reproduce the same functionalities in both modes

6216920
portrait	landscape
that means that if a user at some point decides to switch from portrait to landscape the whole app should allow him to navigate back and forth through the pages in the mode he chose

6216920
put	get
it all seems to go well but when i navigate back i get the previous portraitviewcontroller shown not the landscape and also its subviews are all spread around not where i put them

6217029
jlist	jtextfield
jcombobox is really a composite component with a jtextfield jbutton and jlist buried inside it so you were adding the actionlistener to the wrapping component when the mouse events are really going to the inner jtextfield

6217102
opera	google-chrome
try this in opera or the non-dev version of google-chrome

width	height
the big.jpg has more width than height so when it s resized the wrapping containers get the correct new height but they still have the old width

6217150
glm	predict
perhaps a reasonable example is the output of lm glm as classes and the implementation of summary anova predict residuals etc

6217166
google-chrome	firefox
this jsperf benchmark shows the slice indexof solution to be about twice as fast on google-chrome and firefox

6217167
mp3	ogg
if you are storing the actual audio data in the database in a format that the android audio system can natively interpret mp3 3gpp ogg then one way you could do it is to implement a web server in a service and have that service open the sqlite database fetch the blob using cursor.getblob and then feeding that blob out to a mediaplayer instance through the web server by wrapping the byte array with a bytearrayinputstream

6217172
getter	setter
you can use getter and setter ro react on properties change

6217326
width	height
after looking at image it seems that it needs explicit height width or else it won t scale down properly

6217326
width	height
it s a bit stupid not to scale to the maxheight but you could always use flex 4.5 image class instead or just create your own to handle max height width

6217367
google-chrome	firefox
it is also worth pointing out that clickonce applications can be only be installed from ie well you can use firefox and possibly google-chrome but the user will have to have a plugin installed. this is because windows installer 3.1 updates ie so that it knows what to do with the .application file

6217381
comparator	comparable
within my add method i need to use the comparator method which i believe means that i also have to extend comparable

6217426
http	spdy
alternatively you could write your own spdy http stack but if you wanted to use this with iis then you re in for a lot of work

6217432

however you do not need to extends comparable you need to implements comparable

6217432
implements	extends
you do not extends an interface you implements it

6217435
int	boolean
i ve tried testing the bindings of other properties - simple strings boolean and int but the changes made at either end aren t reflected to the other

6217450
webkit	gecko
works fine in webkit gecko

i need to get the exact same thing the jqgrid passes on the get post _search parameter

6217528

6217558
min	max
just remember to add precision modifiers and supply your own replacements for the absent min and max functions

6217562
textarea	textbox
i suggest keeping a backup of the data used in dynamically created element within an input type hidden or textarea set to display none then onload using the value of the textbox to rebuild the dynamic elements to the way they were

6217576

you can set up a server or shared directory inside the company firewall for everyone who has access to use and have your offsite people each set up their own local ssh or something you can push and pull from as necessary

6217647

the best solution is to usually uninstaller all prerequisites reboot manually re-install the prerequisites not from the clickonce setup.exe file and then launch the application

how can i tell the my_form_process that builds the form when the validation has failed show the create new div and hide the select old div

6217744
junit	testng
i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing

6217784
post	put
the previous post is accurate in terms of a model to put orders or requests into a queue asynchronously and then have them be picked up later

6217822
draggable	droppable
a quick and easy solution would be to tell jquery ui to recalculate droppable positions on every mousemove by using the refreshpositions true option on the draggable

6217838

6217857

versioning	upgrade
needed to upgrade from mediawiki versioning 1.13 to 1.16

6218120
d3.js	protovis
i ve done a fair amount of work with protovis and a few things with d3.js

6218120
d3.js	protovis
where protovis provides a simplified abstraction layer between the visual properties you re specifying d3.js uses the actual css and dom specs - so instead of .width 10 or .fillstyle #00c you d use .style width 10 or .attr fill #00c

6218120
d3.js	protovis
the result is that using d3.js can feel a little lower-level - you have more control but you have to be pretty familiar with svg syntax to do some of the things protovis does much more easily

6218120
d3.js	protovis
as you note protovis is all rendered in svg while d3.js can use other parts of the dom

6218120
d3.js	protovis
d3.js changes or drops some of the basic protovis utilities like scales and data manipulation

6218120
d3.js	protovis
edit 10 1 12 d3.js has filled out its data utilities but there are still a few that protovis includes and d3.js doesn t pv.dict pv.numerate and pv.repeat

6218120
d3.js	protovis
d3.js api documentation is almost completely lacking incomplete compared to quite detailed docs for protovis

6218120
d3.js	protovis
finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions

6218120
d3.js	protovis
edit 7 12 11 it looks like there s a new major difference - as of june 28 2011 protovis is no longer under active development and the protovis team is pushing d3.js instead

6218146
listview	gridview
it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice

6218254
width	height
meta name viewport content height device-height width device-width initial-scale 1.0 maximum-scale 1.0

6218254
width	height
this viewport sizes the page to the device-screen width and height and does not allow zooming

6218254
mdpi	hdpi
this will require putting an image named splash.png i think any file extension will work in the res drawable- dpi directories there are usually hdpi mdpi and ldpi directories

6218275
innodb	myisam
there are many options that control mysqldump s behavior when dumping myisam and innodb data plus accommodations for making the mysqldump s output perform binary log rotation on the master prior to dumping and preparing replication slaves to change replication coordinates master log file master log position during reload

post	get
check my post why to use stringbuilder over string to get better performance

6218709
int	chars
if you have a pointer to a chars and assign it to a pointer to an int there might be good reasons to do this but if done accidentally you could well get bus errors or invalid results when you dereference that pointer also on some very old platforms the sizes of the pointers were different

6218749
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if same uinavigationcontroller is used for all uiviewcontroller you can use uiviewcontroller parentviewcontroller for this purpose

6218871
innodb	myisam
since i am moving the application and database to amazon ec2 and rds i was wondering what are the key considerations when migrating tables from myisam to innodb

6218871
innodb	myisam
create 17 tables with the same structure as they exist on myisam and build them in rds innodb

6218871
innodb	myisam
export data from the myisam tables and import them in to the new tables created in rds on innodb

6218871
innodb	myisam
i am worried mainly because i read that innodb and myisam s way of buffering i o cpu and memory usage are different

6218887
tabcontrol	tabitem
these tabitem will be dynamically created at runtime and added to a tabcontrol as the user needs them

6218916

i m using rvm and bundler too

6218916
rvm	bundler
when i installed the taps and sequel gems i did not use rvm nor bundler

instead you should pop-up a dialog to say what went wrong eg error writing to database please try again

6219147
post	get
weigh it up between post and get

6219147
post	get
however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to

6219153
implements	extends
this way you can implements servlets the usual way by creating classes which extends httpservlet

6219171
for-loop	arrays
arrays use 0 based counting and in your for-loop you go i a.length which means you ll be accessing a element that doesn t exists

6219195
google-chrome	firefox
flash doesn t send cookies correctly it sends ie cookies even if you use firefox or google-chrome

6219208

6219282
winpcap	wireshark

6219300
jboss	glassfish

6219305
for-loop	loops
you can write a for-loop that will do it in one pass over the ordered set and that loops will run much faster than the linqtoobjects

6219306
qgraphicsscene	qwidget	qmouseevent	qgraphicsscene	qmouseevent	qwidget
you should use qmouseevent which are delivered to qwidget or qgraphicsscenemouseevent which are delivered to qgraphicsscene

when i delete the files and folder in this directory and replace them with my own then attempt to run the app cpanel says that it is running on the confirmation page but it never actually starts

6219323
strstr	strtok
take a look at the functions strtok strchr strstr and strspn .

6219337
tabcontrol	tabitem
chances are you ll want a custom tabcontrol that overrides its container generation to return instances of your codepage instead of tabitem but that s another story

6219338
google-chrome	firefox
i tried to test the web service even with just the initial hello world method build solution start without debugging - the asp.net development server starts localhost 49345 but the browser google-chrome firefox ie says could not find localhost 49345

6219409
accessor	properties
the first idea was just to put checking to properties accessor and throw exception on invalid data

6219420
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover can accept two handler functions one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave just add the handlerout function like so

6219428
bash	zsh
approach 1 bash zsh and a few other shells read a file whose name is in the env environment variable after the usual rc files and before the interactive commands or the script to run

6219428
bash	zsh
however bash only does this if invoked as sh and zsh only does this if invoked as sh or ksh which is rather limiting

6219482
ceil	math.h
use the ceil function from math.h

6219507
put	get
so in short words i send a form with information - get results - hit reset - form is all cleared - put in new information - hit submit - nothing happens

i tested in google-chrome 12 firefox 4.0.1 and ie 9

6219848
3des	aes
a shared secret is easy to code but complete useless in practice which means aes 3des xdes or any other similar cipher are not the answer so you need an scheme that starts based on public key cryptography

6219879
equals	gethashcode
remember to implement equals and gethashcode and just delegate to the underlying object

6219936

6220104
execvp	fork
the second fork is not going to be reached in case execvp succeeds because the latter should replace the image of the process and will stop executing the current code

6220152
fgets	fread
what is the difference between fgets and fread

6220152

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox and ies but for some reason google-chrome and safari doesn t seem to like it

6220258

6220354
width	height
the current config just shows the first image the entire width and almost height of the screen and the second image is not shown at all

6220360
preventdefault	keyup
i don t think you can preventdefault which is what you d need to use to stop the browser from performing the default action for a key on the keyup event - it is fired after the default event has already occurred

6220360
submit	submission
as for stopping the form from submission you could bind to the submit event and return false

6220360
submit	submission
when the submit was not triggered by the submit button see jquery how to get which button was clicked upon form submission

6220365
actionscript	haxe

pop-up	dialog
alternatively is there a way i can programmatically just execute the same code that android does without the confirmation dialog box that android pop-up when the user tries to connect to an ap

6220642

often these web api s take structured data in a post or cgi variables in a get and don t return html but rather xml or json or some other programming-friendly return data

6220659
hash	salt
i am using the following php function to salt hash user passwords for a web app

6220678
maven	m2e
the best way imo is to use m2e - maven plugin for eclipse

6220678
maven	pom.xml
in maven all the dependencies are defined in pom.xml and downloaded automatically as needed

6220699
jtextfield	jlabel
a simple jlabel to show the image with the problem and a jtextfield for the answer will be enough

6220722
hash	salt
you are not adding too much security by iterating through the same salt and hash over and over and over again

6220729
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works splendidly in google-chrome safari firefox

6220741

pkcs#12	pfx
i have been able to openssl tools to extract the certificate and private key bytes from an existing pfx pkcs#12 file

6220855

6221027
addclass	removeclass
i didn t originally have the complicating addclass and removeclass this is what i was originally working with and it didn t work either

6221046
innodb	myisam
one issue is that an insert or update to an event now may also include one or more insert update deletes to the cross-reference table which on myisam means the cross-reference table is locked and on innodb means the rows are locked so if your database is busy with a significant number of writes you re going to have a larger contention problems than if just the event rows were locked

6221075
hdfs	oozie
i am trying to use oozie for running a simple mapreduce job that searches for a string value in hdfs location and if it finds it it outputs it

6221129
google-chrome	firefox
what s even more weird is that both google-chrome firefox are now showing the error when i visit other websites

6221148

portrait	landscape
i have code that detects the rotation of the device and re-arranges the panels accordingly so there s 3 panels wide on portrait and 4 panels wide on landscape

6221185
implements	extends
the imageadapter class should extends android.widget.baseadapter - there are plent of example around showing how to implements an adapter of this type

6221193
hide	show
this part works flawlessly with minor hide show glitches which i assume are related to using the existing animations in a way they weren t meant to but so not the point right now

6221237
post	get
it performs a post instead of a get

6221242
implements	extends
public class impacts extends activity implements view.onclicklistener

6221262

opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the right aligned image arrow is pushed down in firefox mac but not safari or opera dependent on the length of the text to the left and above

6221325
onfocus	onblur
to make this prettier you could put a div behind the textbox onfocus so it hides the actual site content and you could center the textbox using the top and left css properties just make sure to clear those too onblur

6221344
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in google-chrome safari ie and they all seem to do the same thing so i don t think the problem is browser specific

6221359
width	height
for my sample height 65 width 375 horizontalresolution verticalresolution 150.01239

6221359
width	height
msdn says height and width are in pixels but the horizontalresolution and the verticalresolution are pixel per inch

6221359
width	height
what i don t understand is if all image formats store a the pixel size of the image height width that the browser will display resize in the image tag and b some other dpi equivalent that the printer will use to print

6221378
public	protected
extending gives you access to all of the public and protected variables and functions however not the private ones

yii codeigniter akelos symfony prado cakephp and solarphp

6221455
awt	swing
android has no awt nor swing related classes in its runtime

6221456
width	height
this suggests you didn t set width and height values for your img element arrow.png so the first time it has no idea what size it s going to be and subsequent times it does

6221456
width	height
otherwise you could just apply or add width and height attributes to the img element

6221462
width	height
is there anything i can do to remedy this without actually going in and specifying each node s width and height

6221482
width	height
i set width and height of that offdiv like below

6221499
try-catch	exception-handling
however lift-json also throws an exception-handling if it is unable to convert the jvalue to a device so i ve wrapped my whole request with helper.tryo a lift helper method that wraps a try-catch call returning a box

6221500
super	extends
amazingly easy to template and super easy to extends

6221519
for-loop	loops
i m trying to break up the animations via a for-loop and several if loops within but it doesn t work

6221594
uiview	subviews
if the uiview is a subviews of your textview you should be able to call

6221599
put	get
the solution is to put all the stuff after the get set into the callback since you don t want anything happening until after that taburl is finished being set.

6221605
express	node.js
i am creating an express js app on node.js and have implemented a page that will callback for live updates as per chat.nodejs.org i ve followed the approach in node_chat to a t and the page updates correctly if an update is made from another browser

6221606
width	height
is on the right track but the image needs to be loaded before you can try to read the width height

6221638
super	self
note this is what i see in intruments when i take autorelease out and after i changed the if self super init to if self super init

6221724
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
m is a superclass of foo so foo#bar overrides m#bar because that s how inherited works subclassing override superclass not the other way around

6221768
post	get
the error i get as in the post is could not find datatype with id 71b8ad1a-8dc2-425c-b6b8-faa158075e63 so searching for this id in the cmsdatatype table is returning nothing and leaving me with nothing to modify

hid	keyboard
usb msrs magnetic stripe readers are often set up as hid devices which means that input looks just like it s coming in over the keyboard

6221884
pseudo-class	visited
instead of manipulating the pseudo-class directly create real classes that model the same things like a hover class or a visited class

6221931
uiview	subviews
then add this uiview as a subviews of your uitabbar

6221931
hide	show

i type setter and first option on the menu is the generate getter and setter wizard

6221959

you can set the image in your oncreate then in onstart launch a asynctask that will sleep for 1 second then load the second image and then sleep for another second and then launch your main screen

6222090
getter	setter
i am trying to build a base class that all of my classes extend from that allows for property access through simple syntax but if get_property or is defined then any attempt to get or set that property is routed through those getter and setter

6222090
getter	setter
i would just write getter s and setter but they vary based on the db schema and it would be lovely if there was an elegantly simple solution

6222107
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
it literally replaces malloc calloc realloc free to add instrumentation code

6222112
min	max
there is one for columns betweencolumns as well and the function between just returns true false if a given number is between a min and max value

6222114
implements	extends
i haven t used the implements keyword before and i ve been trying to use it to implements the ieventdispatcher class to see if this would allow me to use addeventlistener in a class that extends object this is my understanding of what it s for - correct me if i m wrong

6222142
free	malloc
i don t want dataptr hanging around for the entire execution of the program and it may change in size anyway so i want to malloc free it as necessary

6222172

6222266
mouse	trackpad

6222267
sorting	filtering
if you have an inequality filtering and are also sorting the output you need to sort first on the column used in the inequality filtering

6222272
getter	setter
track shows how i set up getter setter for a set of keys

6222296

6222345
postgresql	mysql
with propel as its orm where some data is stored in mysql database and some other data is stored on another server in postgresql database

6222345
postgresql	mysql
to be more precise i want to store some models in mysql database and other models in postgresql database at the same time and do it seamlessly without explicit database switching i mean propel will use proper database connection and sql dialect to retrieve store data

6222345
postgresql	mysql
models from mysql part will not have relations with postgresql

6222345
postgresql	mysql
if yes i also would like to know how to setup development environment i want to access different mysql postgresql dbs in developement and production environments

6222350
jar	war
if your external jar files are in a war web-inf lib directory as part of your project if you go into configure build path and add them as external jar files they are added using a full qualified path which is not what you want

6222350
jar	war
if you open the actual war web-inf lib directory in your project and right click on the jars and select build path add to build path then the jar files are added with a relative path

6222376
hash	salt
forgive me if i m missing something but looking at your hash and your model you don t seem to store the salt anywhere instead you use a new salt each time

6222376
hash	salt
so when the password is set you must store both the hash and the salt

6222376
hash	salt
when you want to check an entered password you retrieve the salt compute the hash using it then compare against the stored one

6222380
children	parent
note the recursive call to flatten and that this is an extension method defined on the function that returns the children from a given parent item

6222380
children	parent
and then assuming that all dimension parent and children properties are not null we can use this query to produce the list of records to add to the table

6222400
freemarker	velocity
for frontend templating you can use either jsp freemarker velocity or gsp

6222422
implements	extends
on the other hand if you don t want to implements custom functionality you can just extends eventdispatcher

6222441

for this reason java chars are 16-bit unsigned int

6222562
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

6222568
google-chrome	safari

6222776
google-chrome	firefox
the following example is working fine in firefox and google-chrome with the exact json you provided

6222821
integer	unsigned
what is happening is that in order for guid 0 to return an unsigned integer it is trying to convert guid from a negative signed integer to an unsigned integer resulting in 0x7fffffffffffffff then shifting it over zero places which is an identity operation resulting in the same 0x7fffffffffffffff

6222855
uiview	subviews
i had the same problem after trying various ideas i just added a subviews a shadow colour gray behind the uiview i needed to have a shadow see code included is the code for 3.2.x 4.x as well

portrait	landscape
i am taking print as landscape in javascript as there was no standard code so i changed it to like that i rotate my page div to 90 degree which makes it landscape way and then perform window.print but the problem is i made it fool as basically it is portrait printing in landscape way so the text is quite small and fields also i want that they should be zoomed so is there anyway to zoom the page for printing

6223080

6223378
versioning	upgrade
but the real process is the application got uninstalled then installed again with the upgrade versioning

6223412
implements	extends
then each of my controllers that extends the base controller implements their own version of getpageddata

6223430
implements	extends
public class launcheractivity extends e3activity implements uncaughtexceptionhandler fpslistener sceneupdatelistener

6223474
pop-up	dialog
the dialog that pop-up when you try to do this can dictate where the file gets created based on various setting within

6223634
inherited	subclassing
the controllers for each view would then be subclassing of that class so that each inherited the button and action

6223651
put	get
so i suggest that you put some print statements that rely on getters to get data instead of direct access to properties and see what gets printed

6223658
dictionary	map
python s dictionary is similar to c++ s map

6223725
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

innodb	myisam
create tables with similar structures as the myisam but only with the engine changed to innodb

6227294

you could use single or first if you re expecting only 1 result or want to use the first result respectively or you need to write code based on there being an ienumerable iqueryable of objects returned

innodb	myisam
it would be completely ok to use innodb instead of myisam for selecting user data

you generally don t intend for backslashes to be interpreted in this way in a path so -- even though all the backslashes in your post are interpreted literally -- it is generally a good idea to get in the habit of using raw strings r appdata local temp to specify paths so you don t get unexpected surprises later

6228946
nsurl	nsstring
whether it s a url to a remote or local location i believe the most conventional thing to do would be to store it in the class as an nsurl and when you need to work on the path retreive the string using nsurl s absolutestring and the name of the local nsstring in that case would be path filepath resourcepath imagepath

getter	setter
but getting an existing attribute indeed seems of less general utility though one could imagine a situation where you were passing around attribute nodes sometimes created anew without an element and sometimes retrieved from an existing element--using getattributenode allows you to avoid building your own object which has getter and setter and handle them with the same interface

ostream	istream
in your code you inform istream and ostream that your clientserverprogramviewcontroller object is to be the delegate for each

6231362
width	height
i am wondering how would i scale an image on browser resize with minimum and maximum width and height parameters

6231362
minimum	max
i know how to use the event.resize function to make my image proportional with the browser using stage.stagewidth height but i am trying to figure out a way to have a movieclip or image scale up or down to a certain dimension such as on browser resize the image max would be 640x480 and the minimum being 320x240

6231369
allocator	stl
this is because a stl container s std allocator actually uses the placement version of the new operator to copy construct the objects in pre-allocated memory blocks and that requires the existence of a copy-constructor to copy the actual instance of the object you re wanting to add to the container into the memory address that had been pre-allocated by the container s allocator

6231381
firefox	safari
but the css doesn t display at all on firefox 4.0.1 or safari 5.0.5 also checked firefox on windows 7

6231393
getter	setter
instead of coding a getter setter orgy you can then spend the time thinking about how you can make the database layer more modular etc

6231396
hash	md5
s3objectsummary has memeber called etag which is md5 hash of the object

6231425
width	height
you can change the size of the figure by calling where x and y are the width and height in inches

6231445
width	height
in pil there is pil.image.fromarray np_array rgba that reads suitable numpy arrays â the datatype must usually be and the shape is height width n_channels

6231448
width	height
use math.min and math.max to clamp the values for your width and height

6231461
getter	setter
it should have a property called id with a getter getid and setter setid

6231471
ubuntu	linux

i am unable to duplicate your problems on xp with firefox 4.0.1 google-chrome 11.0.696.65 ie8 or safari 5.0.5

6231525
hex	binary
basically you should use the opposite of hex2bin in order to convert the arbitrary binary data into hex

6231528
free	malloc
as a rule of thumb only use free on what was allocated with malloc and only use delete on what was allocated with new

6231536
google-chrome	firefox
i ve run into a bug with my app that i traced down to inconsistent text rendering between google-chrome and firefox 4

6231536
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome tells me that a certain string of text is 215px wide whereas firefox 4 tells me its 218px wide

6231536
google-chrome	firefox
a bit of searching indicates that the issue is with firefox 4 not google-chrome

6231551
codeigniter	kohana
just fyi i don t use exceptions in codeigniter tho i m using them a lot in kohana just because the framework throws them and everything is designed to work with exceptions unlike codeigniter

6231551
codeigniter	kohana
i don t really don t want to enter in framework comparison discussions but i need to compare two pieces of code to clarify your question one piece from ci2 and another from kohana 3 it born as a branch of codeigniter with better object oriented implementation

6231563
ostringstream	std
so i m using ostringstream and set the flag std ios showpoint

6231596
for-loop	loops
in your for-loop test you re referencing a variable val which probably comes back as having a length of 0 so your loops will never do anything and the function will simply return true

6231626
ati	nvidia
it s a nice library build by ms research that runs your code on anything that has lots of cores many-core nvidia ati gpus and multi-core processors

6231663
width	height
i would like that instance not aligned as a simple cgrect setting its offset and width and height but i want it rather to be resized dynamically making it fill the whole width of the screen with an offset of 5px from top left and right each and a height of 20px

6231667
vpn	lan
it turns out that lan settings and vpn settings are separate

6231746
pull	push
you will push and pull branches to and from the remote to get and make changes to branches

6231752
free	malloc
as littleadv proposed i would override new delete probably malloc free and trace the allocations and the size of them

6231800
width	height
chances are you re using divisions because you need block-level behavior like width and height

6231820
hide	show
after the hide method is called the visible property returns a value of false until the show method is called

6231838
hide	show
i was able to accomplish this by tagging the table row with a fake class name then in the button click events i used jquery s hide show

6231859
typhoeus	curb
if you are moving a lot of http data you might want to look into something like httpclient or curb or typhoeus which are designed for heavy-weight use and save you the trouble of having to write it all using net http

6231881
put	get
i am able to get just a row at a time but i want to put the rows in an array of objects like this

6231889
mdpi	hdpi
ldpi mdpi hdpi

6231926
google-chrome	firefox
there is actually a dedicated version of firebug for that called chromebug named after the google-chrome of firefox not google s google-chrome

6231929
temp	tmp
sort 1 actually does a pretty good job of handling large data though you ll want to look at the --temporary-directory argument if you think it will overflow tmp with its temp files while chewing through the stuff you feed it

6231944
for-loop	arrays
maybe try casting to arrays in your for-loop this is untested and may not work as is but should get you on the right track

6231954
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome 13.0.782.1 safari 5 and opera 11 i get 211

openkm	dms
openkm document management - dms updated 2011-05-25

6232035
openkm	dms
openkm is powerful scalable document management system dms

6232051
union	distinct
next i thought of taking the union of the two columns and removing distinct elements because if an element shows up more than once in this union then it must have been present in both columns assuming both columns contain only distinct elements

6232055
children	parent
i have four children in a parent container

6232080
daemons	systemd
the systemd works like this the daemons listen on a queue for messages

6232131
range	min	range	max	min	max
the problem we re looking to solve is how to automatically create client-side validation to handle basic issues like required fields min and max length numeric range etc

6232145
width	height
if you mean that you want your terminal to have the entire width and height of the viewport then adding css to this effect

6232145
width	height
should suffice in making a div with the id terminal_container consume the entire height and width of the document

6232182
splash	homescreen
the goal is to be able to add a bookmark to the ipad s homescreen with an icon and a splash page

6232212
subtract	add
subtract 6 from the month portion and decrement year and add 12 to month if your month number is negative

6232217

i imagine you should be able to put together a query that will get the formula one videos that you re interested in

6232244
hide	show
i m using the script to show and hide a div

6232244
hide	show
what happens is that it only show the content and never hide

6232265
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
neither uitabbarcontroller nor uinavigationcontroller is a view

6232265
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
if you have an actualview controlled by an actualviewcontroller that is pushed on top of a rootview controlled by a rootviewcontroller that is the rootviewcontroller for the navigationcontroller and you also have a modalview controlled by a modalviewcontroller then put

6232265
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
if modalviewcontroller was never added to the navigationcontroller then it doesn t know that the navigationcontroller exists

6232269
daemons	systemd
even better you can first code this build upon the filesystem quite easily which has multiple backends too without the hurdle to rely on another daemons so already get started with caching - probably file systemd is already enough for your caching needs

6232294
g++	gcc
edit we have a winner g++ gcc surprise surprise...

6232303
hide	show
why you are using toggle hide and show together

6232310
min	max
if you are looking to find elements with the min and max values from an array the following will work

6232310
min	max
check out the documentation for array_keys min max

6232313
gif	png
however i ve noticed that png s and gif s uploaded and converted to jpg s end up with a strange colors and some kind of in-versing effect

6232313
gif	png
i know jpg s don t support transparency but i ve recently found the need to accept png s and gif s and not convert them to jpg.

6232331
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that some browsers like google-chrome do not store cookies when using file but both firefox and internet explorer do

6232362

you don t need all that hide show mess simply use toggle as that s what it does for you

6232367
unsigned	short
long short half fixed unsigned superp

6232373
client-side	server-side
this was all done server-side before and i am noting that the client-side functionality of radsplitter for mvc is lacking

6232405
width	height
you are given a rectangle with width x and height y

6232441
implements	extends
my action class extends another class baseaction that extends actionsupport and implements sessionaware

6232505
put	get
if you still get errors also put your web service s certificate into your client trust store as well

6232521
width	height
nest a relativelayout inside it which fills parent in both width and height

6232665
folder	directory
if you create a separate text file somewhere in your site directory say includes you can select insert server-side include and pick out your text file in the includes folder

6232692
atomic	compare-and-swap
ignoring the fact that atomic compare-and-swap may not succeed due to concurrent modifications is rarely safe

6232711
queue	fifo
i ve also tried setting all queue to fifo in fair-scheduler.xml but i get the same results

6232741
int	chars
this works ok but i want to replace the int doctorid with a chars doctorid length length could 20 or something to store the doctors name with spaces and

6232743
put	get
i can put garbage in the file and get a 500 error

6232776
put	get
one way to get the real client-side id is to pull the value from the clientid property of the control but you should only look at that value once it has been put in a controls collection

6232784
int	double	comparator	comparable
if you can change what you put into the column to something that implements the comparable interface int double then it will use that comparator instead

6232784
implements	extends
in order to do that you will have to extends defaulttablemodel or implements abstracttablemodel or tablemodel and override the getcolumnclass method

6232842
fileoutputstream	gzipoutputstream
the equivalent gzipped content written out using the gzipoutputstream and fileoutputstream to the local file system

6232842
fileoutputstream	gzipoutputstream
although the content is gzipped properly i haven t created the checksum suffix that gzipped files require which the gzipoutputstream does do in conjunction with the fileoutputstream if you re doing this on a local file system

6232867
nunit	mstest
i have tried the tests with nunit and with mstest with the same behavior in both environments

6232905
parent-child	one-to-many
personally i prefer to use nulls with some judicious moving of data to child tables if the data is truly a different entity and often these fields turn out to need the one-to-many structure of a parent-child relationship anyway such as when you may or may not know the phone number of a person put it in a separate phone table and then you will often discover you needed to store multiple phone numbers anyway

6232942
put	get
how would i put a criteria only on the current week but get back three weeks when it does pass the criteria

6232944
hash	md5
hash values such as sha1 and md5 are used to verify integrity

select part substr mystring 0 charindex deliminator mystring 0

6233037
charindex	substr
select mystring substr mystring charindex deliminator mystring 0 + len deliminator len mystring - charindex mystring 0

6233078
put	get
this code is only passing the form s get data not the get data that i ve already put in there

6233147
uiview	subviews
if you re adding subviews you should probably have b subclass uiview instead of uiviewcontroller

6233188
subtract	add
the most obvious thing to do is to add up all the other blocks in the container and subtract that from the container height

6233241
int	chars
the reason ghc can t just infer that a needs to be chars is that theoretically you could have one instance collection tree chars chars and another collection tree int chars

6233270
google-chrome	firefox
the desired affect is achieved in firefox 4 and ie 8 9 but the issue seems to be with google-chrome latest version stable channel

6233595
wordpress	joomla
i built my blog engine from scratch using php and mysql and do not use wordpress joomla or anything like it

6233670
width	height
you could always just put the iframe on your page without any width height details load the page and then inspect the iframe element with something like firebug

6233670
width	height
firebug will tell you the computed width and height of the window

6233749
outputstream	inputstream
we can t simply wrap socketfactories around each other like we can do for inputstream and outputstream

6233749
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
based on this gzipoutputstream and gzipinputstream implement the gzip file format

6233767
google-chrome	firefox
the code works in google-chrome and firefox however in ie9 the original rays are not drawn when i leave the erase section active

i have been using both for better than 5+ years i have seen both virtualbox and vmware mature

6234095
vmware	virtualbox
i use virtualbox as a test bed for linux born guest it is less painful to use than vmware

6234095
vmware	virtualbox
try installing vmware guest addons versus virtualbox guest addons and you will see what i mean

6234095

ironruby	ironpython
if you re concerned about performance of delegate you ll want to track the variables and flow closed over values in via your own data structure this is what both ironruby and ironpython do

6234338
postorder	inorder
i assume inorder and postorder would be similar too any ideas

6234360
google-chrome	safari
you might just want to do something quick-and-dirty like settimeout for however many milliseconds it takes to get it from google-chrome or safari reliably

6234369

the same steps show the image fine in google-chrome and safari

6234656
viewdidload	viewwillappear
via breakpoints i can see that both viewdidload and viewwillappear are being called in savelocationviewcontroller so it is getting loaded but the view is not being displayed

6234986
getter	setter
does it make sense to declare variables as private with getter setter for class member definitions should bar be declared as private in foo or should it be just declared as string bar

6235004
getter	setter
if it s only for data access not having getter setter should be ok some purists may disagree

6235027
pascal	delphi
thirdly i ve found tools like pascal analyzer from peganza and the audits-and-metrics feature in some editions of delphi can help you find areas of your code that have problems

6235040

some embedded systems with large operating systems and complex hardware can achieve instant-on by never truly switching off but rather going into a low power mode where the system state is retained in memory while all the high powered devices such as a screens wifi bluetooth etc

6235137
getter	setter
i can understand b would be different from a and c in the case of a non-trivial getter setter linq would presumably use the getter setter in case b but not in case a or c is that correct

getter	setter
if you use getter and setter all you would need to do is change your setter to throw an exception if an attempt is made to set bar to null

6235358
getter	setter
getter and setter do not imply that a field member of the same name and type exists internally of the class

6235376

6236042
put	get
i searched a lot but didn t get any satisfactorily solution.hence i thought to put it up so that in future it might help others

6236061
int	chars
it sounds like you might be interested in packing the data as tightly as possible from your comment on converting int to chars in which case maybe you should just write a set of low level packing routines at either end

6236070
int	chars
input a string and convert to an int if it s not your exit chars string

6236089

6236110
width	height
on the other hand width and height is always correct it is used by window manager so it should better be

6236110
width	height
i d say the best idea is to do the width height checking always

6236110
width	height	portrait	landscape
if you think about a moment this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height portrait the opposite landscape or if they are the same square

6236157
folder	dir	folder	directory
i am asking because i noticed that on a mac it is like the .app folder is the file launched and not the jar inside and thus the parent dir is the working directory where all my files will be stored

6236269
uitextview	uiresponder
theorically since uitextview is a subclass of uiresponder you should be able to override methods like the one you shown

6236269
uitextview	uiresponder
however you should try it by yourself because the last time i tried in ios 3.0 there were some methods that were not called uitextview implementation changed a lot between 2.x and 3.0 it seemed to me that uitextview was hijacking some uiresponder methods and won t let the user use them

listview	gridview
i found out that the overrides isenabled and areallitemsenabled from baseadapter will only be called if the adapter is attached to a listview but not to a gridview

6236467
listview	gridview
you are welcome to create your own clone of gridview that attempts to implement the stuff you ll find in lookforselectablepositiononscreen in the listview implementation but this is unlikely to be easy

6236755
implements	extends
you can extends baserequestlistener class and implements its oncomplete method to do that

6236801

one difference i can see easily is that a bundle allows you to put int boolean etc. into it while a hashmap seems to require you to convert them to from objects

6236834
lxml	beautifulsoup
i found beautifulsoup lxml and mechanize to be quite usefull

6236892

i have a custom listview with imageview and textview in a row

6237288
unsigned	short
because the shift operator operated on a single unsigned char you ll need further code to copy to the next 3 or 4 unsigned chars into an auxiliary short long then or-copy to the result the relevant bits that will make the full unsigned long

6237308
uiview	subviews
is there a way to hide the table view completely from the display after adding the uiview as the subviews

6237471
width	height
so height and width of the blocks are 3

6237508
mouse	keyboard
i did some debugging experiments and it appears that though mouse stays still over controll the mousemove is actually called frequently and not only when control move is caused by some ui behaviour scrolling of parent controll called using keyboard

6237509
hide	show
the toggle is a short-cut string that toggles between the show hide state of the element

6237509
hide	show
in addition to numeric values each property can take the strings show hide and toggle

6237518
hide	show
in addition to numeric values each property can take the strings show hide and toggle

6237528
hide	show
toggle toggles between show and hide

6237528
hide	show
in addition to specific values we can also specify one of the strings hide show or

6237528
hide	show
like the hide and show commands

6237553
super	self
as such they go through all the same dynamic dispatch you can use self to access other class methods you can use super to call into the superclass s class methods

6237558
width	height
this is caused by the implicit width and height of 100 on the svg element

6237561
hide	show
and even better use show and hide instead of setting the display

6237634
put	get
so that if you want get info from one machine we have to use get method and add info in one system we need to use the method post..like wise put and delete

6237653
hide	show
as you can see when the user changes the tab the code show the new tab child and hide the old ones

6237825

6237825

i also get a ienumerable of the different post types

6237825
post	get
i get 1 is invalid 1 being the value of the select list which makes sense as my post model expects a posttype object not int

6237858
versioning	upgrade
recent versioning of delphi support png natively amongst many other enhancements and you would be well advised to upgrade

6237866
int	boolean
i updated the old version now it should support unquoted values such as int and boolean

6237894
multiplying	add
if you parse a mere tokenizer just gives you and then you have to figure out how to do the 2 3 before adding the 4 to get 10 and not just brute force add 4 and 2 then multiplying by 3 which gives the wrong answer of 18

6237900
h.264	webm
don t expect anything else than h.264 and webm to work and you need both

6237900
h.264	webm
even fast low-quality encode of h.264 and webm is going to give you compression much much better than m-jpeg

6237923
google-chrome	firefox
why is google-chrome saving them and firefox isn t

6237957
x86	64bit
could it be that you are on a 64bit machine and your project is set to x86 architecture

6237962
for-loop	loops
you ll need to do loops differently probably with a for-loop instead of for each

6237967
hide	show
the way it works is by default we hide any element we don t want to be show on pages example disqus adding the class .pagefix between in the div wrapper we can tell it to show elements on posts with tags that way elements will only be show on posts and not pages because pages don t have tags

6237968

maven	pom.xml
an alternative way with maven is to create a new module and place all required resources in src main resources and then add a dependency to this artifact in your webapp pom.xml

6238204
onresume	onpause
but it works good for me and it s easy to implement no overriding of activity s onpause onresume onstart onstop nor writing of special thread methods like resume pause are required

6238215
vbscript	vba
i need some excel vba examples where with in the vba code excel macro i could call a vbscript and will get some values like filename and directory information from the vbscript and assign it to the variables in vba code

6238250
interpolation	splines
is there a library module or other straightforward way to implement multivariate splines interpolation in python

6238250
interpolation	splines
the n-dimensional interpolation routines i have found are not quite good enough i would prefer splines over linearndinterpolator for smoothness and i have far too many data points often over one million for a radial basis function to work

6238274
width	height
so if i set height attribute to 40 i might find myself with images larger than 120 width

6238274
width	height
if i set both width to 120 and height to 40 well it fits but the original ratio is lost and i don t want that

6238274
width	height
get the original properties of the image in javascript and then set one of them either to 120 width or 40 height so that the other fits in 120 40

6238305
width	height
do not set any width or height properties these might cause problems

6238311

6238606
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	mp3	aiff	wav	ogg	wav	aiff	aiff	ogg
but when i use and try it on the rails framework only midi format is working and the rest of the formats mp3 ogg aiff and wav are getting executed but there is no sound

is this fixed now on latest versions and has anyone tried these formats mp3 ogg on rgor

6238667
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is small enough to be embedded in many apps see here for a list of famous apps ranging from photoshop to apple mail + safari dropbox firefox google-chrome skype and more yet complete enough to cover most sql aspects you may need

6238693
put	get
so say there was a folder and i wanted to get the first file in that folder and put the name in a string

6238899
folder	directory
i have it starting from the folder c messy but currently a user can go to all directory from this starting position

6238931
dictionary	map
i guess most people just use a std map and have swig convert it to a python dictionary

6238974
ienumerable	ilist
for example if your routine were expecting an ienumerable of car but were passed an ilist of hondacivic it would be nice if you could use its read-by-index function

6238974
ienumerable	ilist
the reverseprint function casts or converts an ienumerable to an ilist and outputs it in reverse order

6238986
post	get	post	put	put	get
i get the same number of li -elements as i put in but they all seem to be evaluated to null as explained in my previous post

6238991
hide	show
this is a recurring problem with some dojo animation effects such as show hide wipein wipeout etc

6238991

6239148
minimum	max
the goal is to minimize the max travelling time making this sort of a minimum makespan problem

6239200
ienumerable	ilist
a routine expecting an ienumerable of car will be perfectly happy if given an ienumerable of hondacivic which in turns means it would be happy with an ilist of hondacivic

6239228
button	checkbox
it is here that you must set the state of the checkbox because a checkbox or radio button does not change its state automatically

6239253
x86	64bit

next	except
the problem is that scanf of pretty much anything will leave the characters after the value you read usually a newline in the buffer except that c reads the next character regardless of what it is

6239379
stdout	stderr
ffmpeg is writing that information to stderr not stdout

6239379

notice the redirection of stderr to stdout

6239385

i can t seem to figure out should i use httpwebrequest or webclient for downloading the html page source and perform comparison

6239565

it works in firefox as long as you set the appropriate 180px height for the 320px width video 16 9 aspect ratio - otherwise the curved borders aren t visible because they re outside the frame of the video

6239607
integer	unsigned
unlike java c has unsigned integer types

6239607
integer	unsigned
you should always use unsigned integer types for bitwise manipulation like this

6239645
dbcontext	objectcontext
the first problem is that this object is not directly accessible from dbcontext api - you must convert dbcontext to objectcontext and use objectstatemanager to get the access to objectstateentry representing the relation

6239645
dbcontext	objectcontext
more discussion about this problem global in ef is here - it is not related to the dbcontext api but because the new api is just wrapper of the old objectcontext api same problems remain

6239654
public	protected
the usual fix is to give the public and protected functions different names

6239725
mouse	keyboard
please edit your question to show what keyboard mouse actions are required

6239783

of course i don t want to keep all the images in the ram - i need to create a small cache of images in the ram and write the images that i don t need right now to the disk

6241929

note that getchar returns an int not a chars

6241930

b i note in my logs after this point that appointmentlistcontroller viewdidload seems to get called before the previous appointmentlistcontroller dealloc method is called like i was in controller a went back to controller b but got thrown back to a - and the initial dealloc for the first part didn t kick in until late...

6242586
width	height
the approach that worked for me was to dynamically determine the dimensions of the content and set the height and width of the infobox correctly

6242586
width	height
insert content in infobox and set its height and width based on temp container dimensions

6242621
width	height
all you d have to do is determine the textview width and height and compute the number of characters that would fit

6242624
post	get
the problem is that if the page post something i could read that page but couldn t get page s profile at the same time so it wouldn t work well

6242626
disk	ram
on a very limited environment slow cpu little ram but a lot of disk space what would be the advantages of using different storage engine than myisam assuming an optimized php script w using cache daily performs a lot of read queries select and almost no writes m b 5 - update queries

6242637
int	chars
here the return type could be int or chars

6242656

but i have a redirect from my post action to get action

6243047
folder	directory
so the problem is obviously that make is searching the source files in the root directory and if i copy native.c to my root folder everything works perfectly

6243064
getter	setter
bottom line is the menu works but it creates a javascript exception when trying to use specific style setter getter that will fail due to the framework not understanding the browser version

6243064
versioning	upgrade
in short the answer you may not want to hear upgrade your mootools to at least 1.2.5.1 or ideally 1.3.2 - you may need to use the compatibility mode versioning so your old plugins continue to work

6243066
getter	setter
it differs from case to case if you want to use private variables with public getter and setter or if you just want to declare a variable as public directly

6243066
getter	setter
the reason it might be good to use getter and setter is if you want to have control over when someone accessess the data

6243070
firefox	safari
but the text is not centered in the footer in firefox or in safari have yet to check it in ie

6243281
webkit	gecko	height	border-box	box-sizing	border-box

this should certainly work well enough so long as i continue to keep the number of comments in moderation low as any moderated comments for that particular post or page means all visitors will get the scripts included not just the commenter

6243669
width	height
the reason the cell is not filled 100 is very likely because the table by default has cell spacing set which restricts you from getting a 100 width height

6243701

6258969
getter	setter
i m having a hard time performing this because the attributes essentially just translate to empty setter getter in java rather than their primitive data types

my feeling about how this works is that the delegate listeners get put in the run loop i m not totally clear on this but i think they re not in separate threads

6259270

6259317
int	chars
going on in the chars - int promotion

basically calling begininvoke on a multicastdelegate is ambiguous do you want the delegation to wait for each other or not

6259513
inherited	properties
by the javascript prototype method do you mean using the function.prototype properties to implement inherited

6259530
min	max
edit though normally it is a bad idea to select both the min and max in a single query

6259530
min	max
edit2 the min max issue is related to how some rdbms including oracle handle aggregations on indexed columns

6259530
min	max
it may not affect this particular query but the premise is that it s easy to use the index to find either the min or the max but not both at the same time because any index may not be used effectively

6259573
jar	manifest.mf
i ve looked at the manifest.mf file for clues and stripped the jar file down to just the classes i need

hash	md5
with that hash the attacker could crack it or if it is md5 find a collision fairly quickly and login into your administrator account

width	height
but i really like to set my grid to be stretched as window and set my textbox width height to auto or nan then define special margins alignments to my textbox

6259913
memcpy	memmove
i looked at my code and i think memcpy and memmove might cause this error

6259930
min	max
i though a min heigh and max height but unsure how to do that in css

6259942
super	extends
you could explicitly check in your code and set the opaque property after any change to the image property or you could extends uiimageview and provide you own implementation of setimage that sets opaque after calling the super setimage method

6259949
put	get
when i query google appengine s datastore using php through quercus and the low-level data-access api for an entity i get an error that the entity doesn t exist even though i ve put it in the datastore previously

opml	feed	opml	rss	rss	feed
it provides different classes for different kinds of feed like atom rss and opml

6260234
inherited	properties
these classes don t inherited from any other class and they don t implement a common interface for accessing their properties

6260234
inherited	properties
or inherited from the rssfeed and atomfeed classes and implement an interface to expose the properties i feel should be similar from both

my dilema now is that i need to convert each request.param string into a dictionary object so i can map it back to my database model

6260239
freemarker	velocity
you can do this with velocity or freemarker

6260258

setting minwidth maxwidth etc is fine just try to avoid explicitly setting width where possible the same goes for the height properties

6260272
decoder	encoder
say for example if you wanted to take advantage of the stringbuilder decoder encoder etc.

6260291
rspec	capybara
just about any combination of rspec shoulda capybara test unit rack test could work for you depending on your need

6260316
subtract	add
i have 2 classes called subber and adder which both have a member function called dostuff which will either subtract of add 2 numbers

6260331
submit	submission
however rather than the suggestions to be adding hidden form inputs or giving up on the double submit block you can simply add a settimeout function on your double submit block with a timeout of 1 millisecond which allows the double submit block to work without preventing the submission of the button

6260349
background-color	transparency
nsstring stringwithformat body background-color transparency

6260368

6260479
x86	64bit
instance of same versioned postgresql under windows with enterprisedb s installer no need to use initdb and pg_ctl assuming 64bit installation probably you need to use program files x86 for 32-bit installation

6260483
post	get	post	put	put	get
my guess is that will be overridden when you make your actual get post put delete however in the controller spec

6260496
int	chars
x will be treated as int y will be treated as chars

6260496
int	double
you ask for int d you pass float double double and int have different internal representation so the bit representation of 16.0 3.0 double corresponds to bit representation of 1431655765 int

6260513
post	get
i can get the story attributes and the post_id but i canâ t figure out how to get the rest of the post attributes

6260865
try-catch	exception-handling
the controversial way surround the whole thing in a try-catch block and throw an exception-handling when you want to break

6260876
int	double
the reason this would fail is because nlist can take any number -- it can take int it can take double or for that matter any subclass of number

6260876
int	double
you cannot add a double to ilist because it accepts only int and its subclasses

6260892
button	checkbox
now when user clicks on the save button a javascript should validate all the textbox whose respected checkbox are checked

in any case you could start by adding a user properties to a controller from which all other controllers inherited

6265803
fadein	hide
add first hide to it and the use fadein after appending it

6265813
outputstream	inputstream
the read write methods of the inputstream outputstream classes are not synchronized

6265813

it is possible however that if you re using a sub-class of inputstream outputstream that the reading writing methods you re calling are synchronized

6265831
config	ini
the following are ini and xml examples showing config of resources in that module

6265837
fieldset	formpanel
i would just use a single formpanel with multiple fieldset in if all the values need to be submitted in a single request

6265840
subtract	add
quick idea - go through the roman number from right to left if value of more to the left is smaller than then subtract it from the result if larger then add it

6265857
int	chars
assuming that the treatment of an int first argument is consistent all that will happen is that the const chars will be placed in a register when dosomethingwithfn calls abinaryfunction aunaryfunction will run as expected and the const chars may be overwritten during aunaryfunction but that s fine because nothing else will use it anyway

6265858
interpolation	splines
one of the problems you face is that a splines doesn t usually go through its control points as a kind of interpolation function

6265892
width	height
i have creating php application which takes images with any height and width

6265892

you should put the aicu32.dll and icudt40l.dat either into your application directory or into the system32 syswow64 folder on the client side

6265994
addition	multiplication
in the old days you had to write your own addition and multiplication subroutines for multi byte values

6266107
width	height
if you are already using the font height + 10 for height you can easily use the string width + x

6266148
versioning	upgrade
of course your other option would be a single app with an inapppurchase to upgrade to the full versioning

6266245
superclass	subclassing
however subclassing often define their own initializer or override an initializer of their superclass to add class-specific initializations

6266261

6266424
int	chars
replace your chars with string numbers and convert to int before sorting like

6266468
int	chars
we can t move the size to the beginning such as 2int32tuple because int are not valid chars to begin a class name

6266476
post	get
it seems that your code trigger a get action after the post success

6266513
nsoperation	nsblockoperation	nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
i would suggest that if you need to have finer grained control over the operation s cancel state and interplay with the nsoperationqueue that you would be better off using an nsoperation rather than an nsblockoperation

6266530
serializable	deserialization
your snippet is right but serializable deserialization via bytearray cannot perform real deep copy copying of all references and containers

6266551
getter	setter
or you can create a global class which extends from the application class and write your own setter and getter methods to access data stored in this global class

6266557
primefaces	richfaces
if upgrading to jsf 2.x is indeed not an option then you ll have to look for a 3rd party jsf 1.x component library with builtin ajax functionality such as richfaces 3.x not 4.x since it requires jsf 2.x or primefaces 1.x not 2.x or newer since it requires jsf 2.x

6266591

width	height
you would always get the same value for example if you are asking a dummy string that s less than a line long how much height it would take for the supplied width

6266735
hide	show
the key is to use the rendered attribute to show hide the components so that only one or the other is actually updating the model at a time

6266751
post	get
this caused the get after the post

6266751
post	get

ie has been supporting .htc files since 2000 why havn t google-chrome safari firefox and opera started supporting them

6266950
post	get
also personally when retrieving webpages especially when sending post or get variables i prefer to use curl

6266958
setinterval	settimeout
the setinterval and settimeout functions put the passed function into the callstack after the supplied duration has elapsed

6266982
hide	show
realistically you can t add controls once they ve been defined and passed off to word so it usually works best to predefine all the controls you re likely to need up front in your xml or the ribbon designer then hide show or disable enable the applicable controls as things happen in word

6267004
children	parent
instead of a massive loadstories method that knows everything about the entire data hierarchy you would load the xml document and pass it to a story initializer which will to initialize its scenes pass the document and the appropriate parent element to a scene initializer which will take care of building its children and on down the line

6267006
freebsd	linux	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux
ok works on ubuntu freebsd or mac yes linux

but i believe hillel coren s autocomplete supports that as part of it s multi-select functionality

6267909

client-side	server-side
presumably in all these cases the language preference must be stored either server-side in the session or client-side with cookies

6268784
punctuation	words
depending on how you want to treat the data you might also want to strip punctuation or go for more advanced words isolation with a break iterator - see the java.text package or the icu project

6268844

6268877
int	double
based on my tests casting a decimal or double to an int or long simply keeps the whole number portion of the number and discards the decimal portion

6268880
bluetooth	usb
interfacing with usb is more difficult than it sounds it would be harder to build something which would interface with that and measure millivolts than with bluetooth because the pic processor you use for analog to digital sampling and usb client would in fact have to either act as usb host or usb otg on a phone which is far more complicated than being a usb peripheral

6268911
int	double
you require the cast for decimal to int or double to int because the conversion results in a loss of precision therefore rather than allowing you to inadvertently perform a lossy operation you are expected to be explicit about it

6268911
int	double
going the other way around a double or decimal can fully represent any value assigned from an int and therefore the conversion can be done implicitly on your behalf

6268911
int	double
in terms of performance the cast of a double to int simply uses the conv.i4 opcode where using something like convert.toint32 double results in a function call to perform the conversion

6268913
int	double
why don t you simply use math.round for converting decimal or double to int

6268913
int	double
note that math.round still returns decimal double but now properly rounded so you can cast it to int

then you have to increase the frame of your mapview with a simple pytaghoras - calculation the width and height must be at least as big as the diagonal sqrt visiblewidth 320 2 + visibleheight 480-88 2 506

6269541
mamp	wamp
or do you copy the database and the files to a local server mamp wamp xammp and work on it there then if it works update the live site with the changes

6273739
int	boolean
one option is to use two int representing the hour and the minute and a boolean representing am or pm

6273739
int	boolean
in this case we ve followed the convention that an int is used to store a boolean value

6273746
hash	salt
i don t think it would be a great idea to hash on the client side though as that would be revealing your salt to anyone who looks at your javascript

6273750
hash	salt
you can hash it on client but your hash password and salt might be compromised anyway so easy password can be bruted

6273797
hash	salt
hashing on the client side is not safe at all as it exposes not only your chosen hash method but also your salting mechanism and for a compromised client the actual salt value.

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you allocate an object in viewwillappear or viewdidappear then release it in viewwilldisappear or viewdiddisppear

6274223
lwp	libwww-perl
libwww-perl is the name of the distribution and lwp is the name of the main module in that distribution

6274223
lwp	libwww-perl
so in order to use lwp you would install the libwww-perl distribution

getter	setter
i have a doubt which will be better - using getter setter methods or direct field access

6274591
getter	setter
in android site performance tips - its given as avoid internal getter setter

6274591
getter	setter
my choice is to use direct field access but my friends are telling to use getter setter methods in android

6274591
getter	setter
is that right if so then what is the use of using getter setter methods

6274688

6274692
fadein	fadeout

6274704
implements	extends
instead of extends thread use implements runnable

6274726
jobs	cron
in the linux world you would call these daemons or cron jobs

6274749
getter	setter
the choice between using getter and setter and allowing for direct field access is not typically one of performance but instead one of maintainability and encapsulation of data

6274749
getter	setter
typically you will use getter and setter to have tighter control over your data

6274765
width	height
each column or row correspond to iteration and height of same colors width for rows correspond to the variable value

6274772
decoder	encoder
this would require a small amount of static memory for both the encoder and decoder

6274799
getter	setter
to add to the answer from ed what the link you send refers to is to avoid internal getter setter

6274799
getter	setter
within the same class using the getter setter to access a field will cost you for nothing.

6274799
getter	setter
does not mean you should not use getter setter from other classes

gson currently has a mechanism to register a type hierarchy adapter that reportedly can be configured for simple polymorphic deserialization but i don t see how that s the case as a type hierarchy adapter appears to just be a combined serializable deserializer instance creator leaving the details of instance creation up to the coder without providing any actual polymorphic type registration

int	boolean
by the way it should be clear that a for-loop is a construct in all the languages and not a function so it should never return a value like an int or a boolean or whatever else but only handle the flow of the code through the processor

6279481
super	extends
extends is for reading from a list and super is for writing to a list

folder	directory
you could put all the build data for all your projects into one folder as per xcode 4 - build output directory

6280007
put	get
here s where it starts to get tricky presumably because it takes a moment for the plugin to load and because the plugin only loads when the image is visible i ve put together the following jquery to hide the image at first fade it in imperceptibly to give the plugin a chance to load and then fade the image out again

6280007
google-chrome	firefox
alas whilst this little workaround serves its purpose very nicely in firefox and google-chrome ie 7 and 8 ignore the instructions to fade and simply drops the image in at full opacity before removing it a moment later

i wouldn t get too hung up on what a uri looks like but in this case you can think of a retweet as a resource and that you are creating a retweet when you post to that uri

6280166
width	height
you will need to style your elements as position absolute to the parent and z-index it and set the width and height for cross browser compatibility

i came across a post where a user says that if i can get to the springboard process and use the functionality i can know if the passcode is set or not

6280282
width	height
if you know the width and height of each tile you can calculate the vector2 position of each tile - it s deterministic based on an index so it doesn t need to be stored

6280282
division	modulo
knowing that each grid row is 3 tiles across and each column 3 tiles down we can use the modulo and division operators to get the row column for any tile index.

6280282

the attribute selected is not how you specify a selected radio button in firefox and google-chrome at least

6280653

6281206
int	chars
on the embedded side i need to parse chars strings for floating point and int data

6281259
hash	md5
if so you could perhaps hash ala md5 sha the arrays and assume that if the two hash match then the two arrays match this would of course require benchmarking to ensure that it actually sped things up

6281478
min	max
seeing the min max dates will help you understand when the mismatches are occurring

a chars and an int is interpreted differently

6281582

6281592
folder	directory
i have experimented with a task that runs cmd.exe to del s q the working directory folder

6281616
folder	directory
it looks just like a regular os x app and the only difference i see in the directory structure is that my max msp made application has extra .framework folder as well as the objects i use which i guess are similar to functions in jscript

6281631
stateless	stateful
i could also see the argument especially in the java world where stateless and stateful beans are much more well defined

6281637

6282038
google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox and google-chrome

6282040
implements	extends
if you just want a custom reusable toolbar that only changes some visual properties like the label of a the left button or let the right button visible or not etc.. maybe the best approach is to implements a base class that extends from uitoolbar and then use it in your view controllers

6282133

i ve done all this development in google-chrome but i receive the same errors in firefox 4 and ie8 also

if i resize based upon width the resulting resized image will be 120x92 i could just then fix the height but that will pixelate or squash the image i could also crop the end off with either imagegd or css overflow hidden

regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get

6285401

it s just as easy to spoof a post request like a form as it is to spoof a get request like an anchor link

6285476

6285609
multiplying	add

6285683
jobs	cron
also the mongodb documentation talks about cron jobs google site mongodb.org cron for examples so presumably cron jobs are to be expected with mongodb

width	height
why would i need those if i am already using my custom attributes to define the height and the width of my view

6285857

6285868
int	double
probably because if h is 0.721 it is a float or a double which means that the product is a float or a double which means that you should cast it to int first or use f

i know that in theory enabling -msse -msse2 and -mfpmath sse should expose more registers for gcc g++ to use therefor potentially making my program run faster in practice will it always do so

6286212
cpu	hyperthreading
sse instructions use different cpu resources so they could cause a decrease in performance because those resources are not available for hyperthreading but in real life this should be very rare indeed

6295616
factors	mean
i m plotting a set of discrete levels of a factors on the x axis and their relevant mean outcome value on the y-axis something like this

6295651
superclass	subclassing
i like that the labels for the classes are kept with the classes themselves instead of having information about a subclassing stored with the superclass

6295651
superclass	subclassing
note that something needs to make sure those subclassing are loaded before vehicle_from_name is run presumably these three classes would be in different source files otherwise the superclass will have no way of knowing what subclassing exists you cannot depend on autoload to pull those classes in when running the constructor

6295706
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
ios uses a case-sensitive filesystem so if you refer to sun.png and the file is actually called sun.png then it will work fine in the simulator on a case-insensitive filesystem but fail on a real device

multiplying	multiplication
multiplying all the bytes to get int multiplication

6295785
pull	push
git makes contributing changes back to the source of the fork is as simple as asking someone from the original project to pull from you or requesting write access to push changes back yourself

i ve got 2 layouts currently one takes up about 130dip height and that s fine for most screens but when i switching to landscape the other linearlayout becomes barely visible on certain screens sizes

6295933
codeigniter	pyrocms	pyrocms	fuelcms
if you need to build custom functionality where your cms is really a window to the rest of your business layers then use something like pyrocms or fuelcms which are based off of codeigniter framework

6296084
temp	tmp
ps i can think of making two tmp tables adding values make a third temp table use a while loop and check for each product etc

6296087

this already works in google-chrome and implementation for firefox is in progress see

6296234
hide	show
after i have only to show and hide this windows and change the attached viewmodel

the ideal way of doing is for a user we can add parent siblings children for extra relations they must be derived from the family members relation brother-in-law must be derived as sister s husband or wife s brother

6296287
inherited	properties
reviewing the properties of the textbox control will allow you to determine how it is composed from the inherited hierarchy through inherited

6296290

ensure that your entity classes have a version and id columns and their respective getter setter

6296363
super	self
i m a little confused about the line self super init

6296370
getter	setter
how would i write a setter and getter method for this

6296497
getter	setter
i m sure you already know that using synthesize will create setter getter methods for you but it s good to know what s going on under the hood to understand the concepts

6296500
filtering	grouping
dropping the grouping and filtering with a key range can also get you the information you want but it ll look different

6296500
filtering	grouping
combining them to both to grouping the values before reducing and filtering out the months you don t want

6296502
gson	jackson	serializable	deserialization
a major benefit of using an api like gson or jackson is for simple mapping and serializable deserialization of java data structures to from json

6296505
centos	linux
good afternoon we are building a prototype deduper for centos linux release x86_32 and microsoft windows

6296505
centos	linux
for centos linux 5.5 we call msync to synchronize the file with the memory map

for really large in terms of their size on screen - width x height images this data can be really large

6296509
width	height
width height 4 is what i ve commonly seen cited for its uncompressed size

6296538
autocompletetextview	spinner
for example spinner and autocompletetextview both use popupwindow to display their associated lists of choices

6296556
inherited	properties
if you think of oo inherited properties it is at the same time an object of its class and of its superclass if it is clear what i am trying to say

6296593
stdout	stderr
you could always just write the regular output to stdout and your debug statements to stderr

6296597
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a uisegmentedcontrol which loads two different datasources for the uitableview

6296601
serializable	deserialization
in the case many things like json serializable and deserialization will be made automatically for you

6296626
children	parent
it seems like a hack to have to go to parent and then back to children

6296640
superclass	subclassing
but in almost every case you need to know this behavior of the superclass in order to properly subclassing it

6296680
children	parent
thats why when you go to the parent and ask for all children you get the right answer

6296708
super	self
super a self .__init__

6296719
portrait	landscape
so i think it if finding the coordinates that i m hitting in landscape but acting as if i was in portrait

6296720
pop-up	dialog
how can i make the pop-up modal dialog link work the same way every time

6296729
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if the user moves slowly we usually get a few touchesmoved before touchesshouldcancel is called. as a result i have no way of calculating the touch direction since i only have the one point from touchesbegan

6296742
min	max
the aggregate operations max min sum that are abelian commutative to sharding are supported

6296746
boost	stl
using just the stl can t use third party stuff like boost what is the type of _a_ptr_to_some_member and how do i bind the method updateguiforstopstate to it

is there a simple way for integrating bison flex yacc into xcode

6296775
inherited	properties
so clearly the popup wont inherited any of its creator s properties including the cursor

6296789
persistent	transient
usually you would make a transient property that would calculate a value each time it is queried and but would not persistent it to the store

6296828
pop-up	dialog
plop a big invisible button not hidden invisible over the entire page with a click action that pop-up a message dialog with whatever warning you wish

6296855
width	height
also in your example you re setting the width to auto not the height

6296893
hide	show
anyway there is a way to hide show columns using java script using the gridview s client side movecolumn method

6296894
nhibernate	massive
it may be worth looking at some of the so called micro orm solutions such as dapper petapoco or massive as alternatives to nhibernate subsonic linq2sql ef etc

6296906
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems impose their own rules on what constitutes a legal filename specifically characters like and path seperators are illegal on ntfs

6296938
google-chrome	firefox
i ll start out saying that this works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but not ie ie9

6296938
pop-up	dialog
when you click on the hyperlink it uses a jquery function to pop-up a dialog to enter a new note

6296998
min	max
ib requires that the textviews be inside their own nsscrollviews even though their min max sizes are fixed so that they wonâ t actually scroll

6297037
solaris	bsd
the second fails because the shell builtin kill understands symbolic signals but the external command on solaris doesn t whereas on bsd and linux it does

6297067
stateless	stateful
yes there is the onunload event that you can use to trigger a quick ajax call but http is by definition a stateless protocol and attempting to create a solution which emulate a stateful connection will have flaws

6297086
rss	feed
i am pulling info from my flickr rss feed and have hit a road bump

6297086
rss	feed
but in the flickr rss feed tags and descriptions are outputted like this

6297245
getter	setter
or do i have to make use of setter getter functions

6297285
wildfly	glassfish
wildfly tomcat 8 glassfish 4 etc then you could use the new operator for this

6297285
jboss	glassfish
jboss 6 7 tomcat 7 glassfish 3 etc capability of invoking direct methods with arguments which you then apply on string#concat

6297297
equals	gethashcode
whenever you override equals you must override gethashcode so they are consistent

6297297
equals	gethashcode
but even with this implementation of gethashcode you ll still should fix the symmetry of your equals

6297312
hex	binary
the print is turning it in to hex because you re asking it to print the whole tuple and print sees your string as arbitrary binary data

6297328
hide	show
so one solution can be to hide the form before the application hide it so it won t get show while restoring

6297337
google-chrome	firefox
it means if user a is logged in on firefox and then from other computer or from other browser google-chrome comes request to log user a the first one should be logged out

6297392
udp	tcp
i would like to use some mechanism within sql server or one of its services to push change messages out via udp for example but tcp is ok too when rows get inserted into a table

6297409
cpu	processors
if the processors is loaded enough then my thread works fine but when the processors is more or less free i rich quickly my cpu limitation 50 and finally the pool terminates and needs to be recycled

6297415
atomic	interlocked
just one note lock-free approaches deal with atomic interlocked operations which means the data size needs to be small

6297421
serializable	deserialization
my approach has been to create one and only one mechanism for reading a given source of data by defining 1 a model 2 a serializable deserialization layer and 3 a service layer

6297432
mp3	wav
i m trying to do some note recognition on mp3 or wav files

6297454
rss	feed
i also highly suggest subscribing to facebook s developer rss feed

inherited	subclassing
you can use abstract inherited to make gift a primitive type and then subclassing it to create problematicgift s and something like goodgifts

6297505
int	double
create a class that contains three vectors one for int one for double and one that has an entry for each item to tell the type of the corresponding item and its index in the corresponding vector

6297549
children	parent
i you don t need the parent with the child objects anymore after saving setting the children to null would be sufficient of course

6297549
children	parent
another and much better solution pull the original parent from the database again - without the children since you know that you only want to save changed parent properties

6297551
mouseup	mouseleave
when i select text and move mouse within jtextpane area all is fine but when mouseleave jtextpane area and i continue moving mouseup and down i have low performance

6297554
profiling	debugging
profiling is set to debugging build within the scheme of the project

6297571
int	boolean
incidentally you should be using a boolean instead of an int

6297636
int	double
you should be using math.ceiling which will return the smallest int value that is greater than the double passed in

6297650
put	get
i d have liked to be able to get at it as it enumerates versus after it s put into an array like here but couldn t figure out how to get that deep into ar arel

6297654
put	get
i recommend you to get the number of columns and rows and put the data in 1 single flat array

6297666
ant	maven
it looks like it has both maven and ant builds so you can generate eclipse projects with both of these

6297666
maven	m2e
install m2e and import existing maven

6297727
dictionary	map
the elements variable is a map a dictionary returned from an ajax call which contains the titles and urls of the elements that need to be displayed in the accordion

6297727
google-chrome	firefox
i m on a corp laptop with no way to install firefox or google-chrome so i can t look at the dynamic dom to see if the structure is being created correctly or what

6297781
keydown	keyup
you could bind by using keyup keydown change click etc

6297784
hash	salt
verifying passwords should repeat the encryption on the user s input using the known salt and comparing the resulting hash

6297903
gridview	sqldatasource
here is the abridged sqldatasource of the gridview

6297937
toupper	uppercase
some languages do not have uppercase letter - what should toupper return for those

i can create a legislator object and fill it with what information i have but then i have to have some mechanism of tracking information availability with the getter and setter

6298054
ratingbar	textview
i have a listview where each listitem has a textview and ratingbar

6298062
asp.net-mvc	openrasta	wcf	openrasta
as for which framework to use i would check out the wcf http project openrasta or straight .net asp.net-mvc

6298071
int	boolean
getchildview int int boolean view

6298077
accessor	properties
first we ll put the accessor for all the properties we care about

6298083
folder	directory
the problem with this is that in the gui where the user enters the application source directory it s not clear what part of the folder structure they have to enter and what is resolved by app.config

6298139
postgresql	mysql
does this work in mysql and postgresql

6298196

ocean	petrel
i want to add custom units in petrel s custom unit system through ocean

6298213
folder	directory
error message as its checking my home folder for the key instead of the project directory

6298235
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop above is assigning the title of each calendar in my account to the string arrays calendarnames .

6298254
getter	setter
i will also need to create the getter and setter dynamically as well since i will be accessing the values

6298262
implements	extends
create your custom class my_config_database extends zend_config and implements any logic you want

6298323
getter	setter
it will allow you to add fields and methods such as the usual getter setter to a class definition

6298354
g++	gcc
note i think there was also a good reason to prefer g++ for c++ targets rather than using gcc

6298405
fflush	gets
if you have a problem exception it won t throw it at the point when the exception occurs but rather when the session gets fflush when it tries to write the sql to the db

6298415
getter	setter
with private objects + public getter setter you d only have to modify the code in the getter and setter assuming you want to keep the things being returned the same

6298446
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
the optimal solution would be if each task could have their own xml file which is loaded and added to the root preferencescreen as far as i know however this is not possible the only way to load it is into a preferenceactivity

6298475
copying	overwrite
the only thing i could think to check would be 1 accidentally writing to or overwriting the store somewhere else in code you intend to back the file up by copying it but instead overwrite it partially

6298496
mouse	keyboard
that should observe every observable mouse or keyboard event

6298518
versioning	upgrade
is there any solution to upgrade our existing versioning with the new one we would like to publish in the store

6298523
post	get
i thought this would be easy enough but when i run the query i get results including some post that don t meet the master class join criteria

6298537
profiling	debugging
this configuration works since i m able to debugging through dllhost but if i try and profiling the code or just attach the profiling to dllhost while i m debugging the profiling stops and i get the following output

6298553
width	height
if that is the only div on the page use a mobile stylesheet to strip out the positioning keeping only the width height and some smaller simpler margins

6298620
subtract	add
if you want the remainder to be always positive you need to subtract 1 from rg3 and add rg2 to r

6298679
equals	gethashcode
with the hashset my understanding is that adding elements to it takes care of the non-duplication by itself assuming you ve overrided the gethashcode and equals methods in someobject

6298684
ati	nvidia
on my intel hd graphics laptop everything works fine but on the nvidia geforce gl version 3.2 and the ati radeon gl version 2.1 at work my window with clear colour yellow shows but nothing renders

6298709
versioning	upgrade
to me it looks like the dependence on versioning 762 is being upgrade to versioning 4940 whereas the dependence on 5592 obviously cannot be

6298716
google-chrome	firefox
from css font-face not working with firefox but working with google-chrome and ie

6298718
put	get
take msn messenger loads up and you get the use pass prompt put the details in and then you get your contacts

6298744
rpm	yum
so far i ve set up yum to use the remi repository done yum install php php-oci8 php-pdo and downloaded the oracle instant client and done rpm -uh oracle-instantclient11.2-basic-11.2.0.2.0.x86_64 1 .rpm

6298761
xmonad	xmobar
i also suggest that you spawn the xmobar instances in main rather than in loghook since the latter will spawn brand new copies of xmobar every time you do any xmonad action like changing focus

6298764
draggable	droppable
i m building a web-app that will allow users to drag and drop from a static set of 30 draggable elements onto a droppable canvas

6298764
draggable	droppable
i want to record the draggable elements positions inside the droppable div with x y offsets from the top left corner

6298764
draggable	droppable
my current strategy for doing this is to first use .offset to record the x y position of the droppable div and then subtract this from the .offset returned by the draggable element that was dropped to get the position from top left corner of the droppable

6298764
width	height
i will then convert my x y values into percentages of the width and height of the box

6298794
onclick	onmousedown
this also happens with the onclick and onmousedown events of controls in ie6 7 8

6298829
int	double
i cast to int because your types are int although they probably should be double or converted to your int lattice more intelligently

6298841
ocean	petrel
can i serialize an entire petrel property properties grids or any other petrel ocean s objects into my custom datasource

6298848
int	double
of course you ll have to convert the double to int using whatever rounding you prefer

6298861
width	height
the graphing program takes a number of arguments about the height width legends etc. and the data to be graphed

6298909
sorting	filtering
if you want that the data filtering paging and sorting will be done by client side the jqgrid itself you can consider to use loadonce true parameter of jqgrid

6298909
sorting	filtering
after the first data loading the jqgrid will change the datatype json to datatype local and later jqgrid will make sorting paging and filtering of the data locally

6298940
stderr	fflush
only rarely i will see it fflush the output from stderr to the console that i m using

6299002
width	height
you should then be able to set any options on the second main form when you show it such as its height width or screen position as desired

6299022
jtextfield	jlabel
if you have a bunch of jtextfields with associated jlabel i ve had success and fun working from an array of string that represents the jlabel texts and then placing the jtextfields into a so that i can easily get a reference to the jtextfield based on it s related string

6299037
jobs	cron
however if you are going to run thousands of jobs per day then you might run into the problem that the maximum frequency cron allows is once per minute

6299051
protovis	infovis
there are alternatives to graphviz protovis infovis

6299055
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox google-chrome and ie8

6299143
sudo	passwd
well i found out that i can have capistrano send the sudo passwd first by running a sudo command

6299143
sudo	passwd
sudo remembers your passwd for a small time 5 minutes by default

6299143
sudo	passwd
and rvmsudo simply calls sudo with some environment variables set so it too remembers your passwd

6299197
min	max
get the highest set bit positions of the min and max for 4 it would be 3 and for 17 it would be 5

6299197
min	max
if that number is between min and max return

6299240
post	get
i ve worked around this by calling the redirect inside the post callback but that adds a few second delay because it doesn t get called until after the post completes

6299244
portrait	landscape
i m trying to make a spec on the ipad for an image gallery that has a 3x3 portrait layout but changes to a 3x2 layout on landscape

6299244
portrait	landscape
i m trying to get the landscape or portrait grid on application load and then change also on orientation change but every time i do change my orientation the thumbnails flicker and the grid is all out of wack

6299249
division	subtraction
easiest would be to convert the date time values into a unix timestamp and then simply do some subtraction division

6299275
move	drag
i think this would be your best option even though the user won t be able to physically click drag the components to move and resize them

6299296
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome allow me to connect to localhost 3000 when i run rails server but for some reason ie says this page cannot be displayed. why is this

because of this new installation and upgrade of existing installation often fail to authorize to wmq using the same channel that previously worked

6299380
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried the following code on google-chrome and firefox and i can t get the alert to pop up

6299461
for-loop	loops
there will be no real difference in performance between the foreach and the for loops - therefore the for-loop will be a better alternative for the situation you want to achieve

6299485
equals	gethashcode
as pointed out by guffa this will work best if the values are unique or the default equality comparer equalitycomparer function uses a unique value such as a custom gethashcode equals overload

6299542
ant	maven
iâ m working with maven 3 migrating the old application using hivemind and ant

6299549
udp	tcp
i have heard about a trick using udp instead of tcp

so i ve got this bit of css working on firefox and google-chrome but it isn t working in ie9

6299654
post	get
apologies i cant seem to get the code to display properly in this post

6299700
google-chrome	firefox
what s confusing me however is that my current server setup is working in google-chrome but not in firefox

6299700
google-chrome	firefox
do google-chrome and firefox handle cross-domain restrictions differently

6299708
min	max
the way he has implemented the next min max method is as follows

6299722
width	height
use .getsize which returns an object with x and y properties for width and height

6299743
for-loop	loops
update ooh i discovered an incredibly short version with ugly imperative syntax by abusing for loops reverse-ordering the fact that assignments return a value consisting of only 25 characters though you will want var y which you can insert into a for-loop and +1 if you don t want 0...19

6299769
margin	text-align
playing about with text-align extra elements margin auto and so on

6299786
min	max
i got a great suggestion from someone about aabb point testing and it works great but i have gotten to the point where a max and a min point testing do not always work because often they won t be in the frustum but a plane from one of the sides will be

6299791
move	drag
i can drag from the unassigned list to either of the two tracks drag between the tracks or move an item back to the unassigned list

6299796
innodb	myisam
just change my database from myisam to innodb and all works fine

6299837
post	get
after looking after several existing post i am still not able to get my simpledateformat parser working

6299929
org.json	jackson
instead of using org.json s simplistic lib you could upgrade to a better json library such as jackson bind data as regular maps lists numbers etc and then most templating engines could access things as expected

6299929
getter	setter
or even use full data binding to pojos with setter getter if you need to access data from java code as well
