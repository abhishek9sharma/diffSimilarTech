qtextedit	qmainwindow
i also tried new qtextedit this hoping it would appear on the qmainwindow with the properties defined by the objects geometry to no luck

7300027
qtextedit	qmainwindow
if i setcentralwidget to be that of the qtextedit than it works but i don t want the object to consume the entire qmainwindow and restrict access to existing widgets

daemon	cron	jobs	cron	stdout	stderr
i guess the cron daemon on your server is configured to redirect stdout and stderr of all the cron jobs it runs to a file

width	height
the second idea was to listen to document height and width changes which i think is the most efficient way to do it

7300297
width	height
another example is a class which has height and width properties but you also want to give the user a convenient area property

7300297
width	height
you obviously don t want to have a separate variable for area so you just write a __get method which returns the height multiplied by the width when the user asks for the area

because you are passing in a value of type chars which is a signed type the value is being converted to an int and being sign extended

7301006
put	get
you can get more info here printf placeholders essentially between the and the x you can put extra parameters

7301007
int	chars
chars is a signed type it gets promoted to int when passed as an argument

7301009
int	chars
this means printf expect an int or a long again depends on os but you are only supplying it with chars so the value is up-cast to the appropriate type

7301352
qlistwidget	qtextedit
i wanted to add multiple qtextedit so i can use a residing qlistwidget

7301352
qstackedwidget	qtextedit
you could put a qstackedwidget in place of your qtextedit and add all the qtextedit s to it

7301352
qlistwidget	qtextedit
only one of the textedits would be visible at all time but you can switch between them automatically by connecting the signal currentrowchanged int of your qlistwidget to the slot setcurrentindex int so that the index of the qtextedit stay the same as the index of the selected item in your list

everything works fine in ie9 and firefox and google-chrome even iphone but ie8 and ie7 throws an error i debugged the issue to be that the .css method can t resolve the property

7301840
width	height
this query should give you max for the width and height given the two need not to be associated with anything

7301852
width	height
it expects both a and b to be objects with x y width and height properties

7301881
django	web2py
i ve flirted with django but i just recently discovered web2py and it s definitely caught my eye

awt	swing
swing is double buffered by default and i see no reason to use awt components with a buffer stategy

7301963
jruby	mri
but unless you really need to use the c-ruby mri i would greatly recommend you to avoid any of the approaches above and just use jruby as delving into native code will lead to possible segfaults memory management issues and all options above force you to run in a single thread while you could build a multi-threaded solution by using jruby

7301985
httpresponse	request
i was looking over some code and came to this question -- django what is the difference b w httpresponse vs httpresponseredirect vs render_to_response -- which discusses the different types of request responses

7302014
post	put
to put data i use dopost post request

7302014

7302255
int	double
in doing so it can also handle missing int and double otherwise the resulting data type will remain as string eg

7302366
printf	strlen
you also can t use any of the standard functions like strlen printf and friends

7302375
next	document.write
it is because of document.write which clears table so in the next iteration document.getelementsbytagname tr returns nothing

7302383
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
however i don t have any uinavigationbar in my xib file as it is created programatically via the uinavigationcontroller

7302406
width	height
fwiw it appears that setting the width height of the div containing the uploader to 0 does not make the error occur

7302426
getter	setter
i assume it is related to the fact that the code uses indexed properties with getter and setter defined in an ancestor class

7302426
getter	setter
i guess you could write your own getter and setter and call the inherited getter with the given index

7302447
hide	show
so how can i hide the already show soft keyboard when user focused on my text field

7302455
post	get
is there a way i can get the drop down to include a custom taxonomy and a custom post type

7302466
minimum	max
the idea is that a max and a minimum value are posted and then a random number between the two is generated

7302510
width	height	portrait	landscape
i drop this on my main page in the wp7 app and it looks fine in landscape mode but when i switch to portrait the width expands and the height contracts so it is no longer a circle

7302510
width	height
i ve tried putting sizechanged event on layoutroot and setting the grdcircle width height to whatever was smaller - the layoutroot actual width or the layoutroot actual height but as soon as i do that changing the orientation doesn t fire the sizechanged event of layoutroot anymore because layoutroot also becomes smaller

7302526
width	height
graphviz only supports svg input where the width and height attributes are set on using absolute units pixels inches etc.

i have tried to do this a few ways but the closest i can get is a function which will put all the more values into 1 array like this

7302585
rspec	minitest
my current client uses ruby 1.9.2 and all the tests are written using minitest and they are concerned about the slowness of rspec

7302595
disk	ram
stuff like ram disk can speed up stuff like -compilereport since it can generate a huge number of files

7302657
gridview	sqldatasource
in search.aspx i have gridview that shows me results and sqldatasource

7302718
jar	manifest.mf
after searching on the internet i found that it is necessary to specify a main class in the file manifest.mf of a jar file in order to run it

7302728
twig	smarty
the slim framework makes use of other templating engines such as twig or smarty so as long as you choose a templating engine that allows subviews then it ll work

7302747
sorting	grouping
using the muenchian grouping method plus sorting we obtain in sorted order each grouping of name elements consisting of all names starting with the same character

7302759

7302766
mdpi	hdpi
so on device there s the drawable directories for hdpi mdpi ldpi etc.

7302766
mdpi	hdpi
is there some way i can check if the current device is hdpi mdpi ldpi and download the right resolution accordingly

7302766
mdpi	hdpi
i guess if i download a high res image onto a hdpi phone then it will assume its a mdpi image that just has larger dimensions than intended

7302787
hide	show
you can still use autocomplete on an input element that is hidden and you can hide and show the element or its containing div as much as you like

7302824
addclass	removeclass
an alternative is using addclass and removeclass but i have not been able to re-create the exact behavior that i can get with animate

7302824
addclass	removeclass
here is my current best attempt using addclass and removeclass note that for the animation to work you need jquery-ui

7302824
addclass	removeclass
when animating addclass and removeclass jquery adds a temporary style to the element and then increments the appropriate values until they reach the values of the provided class and only then does it actually add remove the class

7302865
width	height
then set the top left margins as half the height and half the width to center the whole iframe

7302877
cos	sin
so we take the standard usage and swap sin and cos

7302881

another way is to create a linked table for the .csv file select the correct file type from the open dialog pop-up form when creating a new linked table and create an append query with the additional field holding date or now as default value

7302983
int	double
would anyone know the method for testing whether a double or int is infinity for example when 1 0 operation is performed

7302994
abstract-class	superclass
let s say i have an abstract-class superclass from which i derived

the above mentioned query get the difference between maximum and minimum values and divide by 9 turn out to be 10 sections for each range of data i would like to get how many records belongs to that range

7303035
width	height
i use jquery mobile to generate my buttons and i have a css code below to change its design but no matter what value i put in width and height the size of the button doesn t change but it is relatively dependent on the font size of the label

7303049
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are there to help you control the hierarchy of your app

7303049
flip	slide
possible animations are slide in from bottom default horizontal flip of entire screen fade in out and half-page curl

7303056
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
if you want a later gcc macports and fink and homebrew have a later version as a port

7303069
hide	show
then in your javascript you hide the standard login div and show the forgotten details one

7303074
width	height
to speed things up create just one array the largetst pixel width height and reuse it throughout the lifetime of the function

7303118
hash	salt
but note that salt don t really make a lot of sense for something like aes because it s not a hash algorithm

7303120
post	put
i d take telerik hands down...#1 reason being support #2 reason is that if the control can t do what you need you just need to put in a ticket or post to the support forums and you can drive their feature development

7303210
post	get
i am currently just converting it to a querystring and posting it as a get however what i really need is something that will convert my array to a data array for the ajax post as the querystring becomes too long

7303234
folder	directory
i want to replace the src obviously with my own logo3w.png that will be located in the root of the extension folder thus afaik no advanced directory is needed

7303240
hide	show
the easier way is just to hide the navigation bar on the home view and show it back on the other view.

7303242
post	get
since you ve already been able to create a querystring why not use the query string with post since your issues seems to be the length limitation of get

7303273
hash	salt
a salt is most typically encountered with cryptographic hash functions not encryption functions

7303273
hash	salt
the idea is that rather than hashing just your data a password you hash data+salt where salt is typically a randomly-generated string

7303286
hide	show
i have a previously working website that uses a small jquery script to trigger an image with the class content slide to animate when rolled over and show a div containing content when clicked and hide in when clicked again etc. this worked fine in my main pages example index.html but does not work on my subdirectory pages example subdir code howcssworks.html and i m assuming it s due to the relative link paths no longer working

7303302
comparator	comparable
here are few differences between comparator and comparable i found on web

7303302
comparator	comparable
if you see then logical difference between these two is comparator in java compare two objects provided to him while comparable interface compares this reference with the object specified

7303302
comparator	comparable
if any class implement comparable interface in java then collection of that object either list or array can be sorted automatically by using collections.sort or array.sort method and object will be sorted based on there natural order defined by comparator method

7303302
comparator	comparable
objects which implement comparable in java can be used as keys in a sorted map or elements in a sorted set for example treeset without specifying any comparator

7303302
comparator	comparable

7303302
comparator	comparable
read more how to use comparator and comparable in java

7303307
getter	setter
i create a getter and setter using date or whatever java temporal objects you are comfortable with i prefer date for its immutability but the actual column is a long or long unfortunately it implies a null check needs to be done

7303314
width	height
by default a is display inline and so does not establish box with width height

7303322
min	max
i m trying to get the min max for each column in a large data frame as part of getting to know my data

7303347
hide	show
the idea is an alphabetically ordered and grouped series of unordered lists which i can show and hide easily using javascript

7303362
unification	inference
it already can t do the unification and type inference until it reaches the end of the function

7303387

generally first make sure you can reliably encrypt decrypt using aes then you might move on to using rsa

7303420
min	max
unless you specify that it is an ordered factor operations like max and min will be undefined since r is assuming that you ve created an unordered factor

7303420
min	max
note that this just means that min and max will assume alphabetical ordering by default

7303435
google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome ie and firefox on both platforms

7303442
imperative	declarative
imperative and declarative describe two opposing styles of programming

7303442
imperative	declarative
imperative is the traditional step by step recipe approach while declarative is more this is what i want now you work out how to do it

7303442
imperative	declarative
so it s not unusual for some parts of a program to be written in a more declarative style but for the speed-critical parts to be more imperative

7303442
imperative	declarative
as you might imagine the language you use to write a program affects how declarative you can be - a language that has built-in smarts for working out what to do given a description of the result is going to allow a much more declarative approach than one where the programmer needs to first add that kind of intelligence with imperative code before being able to build a more declarative layer on top

7303442
imperative	declarative
it might seem odd then that functional imperative and declarative are often mentioned together

7303442
imperative	declarative
and if you do that - if you limit how variables can change - then almost by accident you end up forcing the programmer to write programs that are more declarative because a large part of imperative programming is describing how variables change and you can no longer do that

7303442
imperative	declarative
imperative and declarative are two opposing styles of programming the same names are used for programming languages that encourage those styles

7303470
int	chars
so if the user has a 2 card they enter 2 but that 2 is actually chars and must be converted to int

7303470
int	chars
points_for_card is of type chars and number_value is int

7303470
int	chars
so what i am going for here is if the user enters 3 as a chars it becomes int 3

7303470
int	chars
if i move points_for_card to int instead of chars then the arithmetic works perfectly for whatever numbers i enter because at that point it s just adding them together

7303523
inherited	properties
this means that movieclip not only contains it s own native functions and properties but also all functions and properties of sprite and all the functions and properties that sprite inherited from displayobjectcontainer as well and all the functions and properties within the other classes going all the way down the line to object

7303523
inherited	properties
therefore if you create a class that extends sprite you will automatically have access to all of sprite s native and inherited functions and properties

7303535
oncreate	onnewintent
i ve tried to set the launchmode to either singletask or singleinstance and android would bypass oncreate and directly call onnewintent which is expected as it s documented but the problem is each time the editnote then gets the same intent which contains the same rowid so step 3 above editnote a would be launched instead

7303551
post	get
when i make a post to the same url i get a rails exception

7304167
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
it is usually best practice not to catch or throw unchecked expressions illegalargumentexception is a runtimeexception which counts as unchecked

7304175
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
so i solved it using an indirection i firstly check mousedown mouseup and mousemove event and once dragging is detected say when mousedown mousemove for more than 50ms i ll hide the items immediately

7304196
tostring	getter	getter	setter
another possibility is to use gson note i use lombok here to generates getter setter tostring etc

this includes public protected default package access and private methods but excludes inherited methods

7304304
post	get
you may be forced to use post in some circumstances for example if the amount of data you plan to send to the server is greater than the allowable get url length but generally this shouldn t be an issue

7304321
put	get	repo	egit
eclipse now comes with egit included so you could share your project as in put in version control in a git repo and you would get precisely the feature you are looking for

7304373

inherited	subclassing
so whenever you use generics the compiler puts all those generic inherited methods in the subclassing

7304552
superclass	subclassing
i just checked when i removed the generic related code the part from the superclass and the reflection code gave me exactly two methods in the subclassing even though it overrides them

7304554
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller which has a uitabbarcontroller as the rootviewcontroller

7304609
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
most servers have mechanisms to help in that usecase apache and lighttpd have xsendfile nginx has x-accel-redirect

7304720
xts	quantmod
by default the objects created by quantmod getsymbols are in fact of class xts

7304726
maven	pom.xml
as far as i know if the cloned repository lies on the root of your eclipse workspace and your maven project file hierarchy has a pom.xml on its root then importing such root project will rename the cloned folder with the template you chose defaults to artifactid

7304727
hide	show
to hide and show it just switch the subclassed viewâ s hidden property to either yes or no

fiddler 2 is configured to publish itself in the lan at localcomputerip 8888 - 10.0.0.3 8888 so then from android instead of trying to access 10.0.0.2 localhost 8087 - my azure web role direct address i set it to connect to fiddler direct lan ip at 10.0.0.3 8888 and fiddler forwarded the requests to localhost 8087

7304820
superclass	subclassing
just define a common superclass c and two subclassing a b of c

7304878
inherited	base-class
the usual way to create a pointer that can point to either of the two is to make them inherited from a common base-class

7304878
base-class	subclassing
any pointer of the base-class can point to any subclassing

7304878
base-class	subclassing
as for your second question using the technique described above you can create a set of pointers to a base-class which can then hold instance of any of the subclassing these can also be mixed

7304910
nsstring	nsdata
make sure all the objects you keep in the array are the property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary

7304951

7305006
post	get
for post requests to a servlet we use a link thus making a get

7305006
post	get
the client side either makes a get or a post request

7305006
post	get
the convention is to use post to send post data to the server while get is used to return data

7305016
post	put	post	get	put	get
four methods are supported get post put delete

7305016
post	get
in reality only get and post are used often

7305037
post	get
i assume post_view is to process the pr_form on post request although both get and post can be processed in the same view

7305043
antlr2	antlr3
antlr2 had an example of using flex with the cpp target unfortunately there are no such examples for antlr3

7305046
outputstream	inputstream
httpcomponents is obtaining an inputstream of the file and compress is providing an outputstream

7305047
put	get
as long as whatever you put into the hash function generates the desired hash it will get you through correct input or incorrect input

7305047
hash	salt
if you include the username or a salt in the hash it s a different story

7305048
post	get
you can write a client that creates get and post http messages and invoke a servlet

7305048
post	get
also from your question you seem to thin that all servlets handle get requests via a post request

7305048
post	get
the reason it is done in the servlet you viewed is because the servlet does that same thing for both get and post request

7305048
post	get
well a browser is just a client that efficiently and easily lets us make get and post requests to a server in our case a servlet

7305048
post	get
we can also write a java proram to make get and post request to our servlet but that will be tedious and cumbersome

7305050
ubuntu	linux
the gcc toolchain is the very same we ve found only 1 difference to linux ubuntu in a 10k line source server stuff some include was in different place

7305057

also some linux applications that rely on gnome or kde may not be available or might not work 100 on mac os x

7305057
g++	gcc
you should have no problem with gcc g++ etc

7305121

don t use hide and show here

7305284
post	get
if you do want to get without making a call refer to this post instead

7305291
post	get
depending on the amount of theming and how you implement it you can either update the ui in javascript to the new theme which could be tedious possibly loading css on the fly and etc or maybe consider simply refreshing the page with a full post or get which would render the page server-side with the new theme settings since your brain.php would be executed again and it would pull the most recent data from the database

7305297
hash	md5
b take any md5 hash run it thru this algo

7305327
put	get
i put the datatable function initialization inside an object but i don t get the same result as when i initialize it outside the object

post	put	post	get	put	get
you have 8 http 1.1 methods get post head trace options put delete and connect

7305343
post	get
here is my understanding for post requests to a servlet we use a link thus making a get request on that servlet and in the servlet we need to call dopost from doget

7305343
post	get
get post

7305343
post	get
for convenience some ides set up servlets so their dopost method calls doget because they are intended to handle get and post requests identically

7305348
keydown	keyup
you might want to try keyup or keydown events assuming the update process will involve data entry

7305360
switching	screens
i got an null pointer exception on android 3.2 emulator on a simple android project created by wizerd with a service in separated process when i switching between stretch to fill screens to zoom to fill screens

7305360

superclass	subclassing
it is possible that using final keyword could be taken advantage by a smart analysis tool though i would imagine that analysis is done bottom-up in the class hierarchy because a superclass doesn t need to care about subclassing anyway

7311556
hash	salt
you should generate a salt of at least 256 bits with a cryptographic random number generator add that to your original password and then use a hash that has not been cracked aka sha-512

7311563

7311936
stdout	fflush
i am guessing its an issue with stdout not being fflush before the user is being prompted for input

7311936
stdout	fflush
to fix this you could try flushing stdout after each print statement using fflush stdout

7311940
stdout	fflush
call fflush stdout to force the output to be written after calling printf then you can be sure that the output will be written

7311956
put	get
what i don t get are the two join s for table2 t2 and table5 t5 which have no join condition listed next to them and the two extra on conditions at the end of the view definition - i can t seem to rip this apart and put it back together in proper ansi join syntax so that my row count is the same....

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
the qgraphicsscene doesn t actually render anything it just a scene graph the qgraphicsview is then used to render the contents of the scene graph

7312370

7312902
portrait	landscape
because in landscape mode there s only one textview whereas in portrait mode i got 3

7312902
portrait	landscape
so when i m in portrait mode i m only able to write something in textview 1 2 and 3 but nothing into landscape s textview and vice versa

7313138
pull	push
you can then push and pull without specifying which local and remote

7313138
pull	push
however if you ve already created the branch then you can use the -u switch to tell git s push and pull you d like to use the specified local and remote branches from now on like so

7313167
width	height
below that is a button with a fixed width and height

7313175

subtract	add
the factorial one also doesn t reduce the search space that quickly since it subtract one from the argument each recursive call similar to add

my idea right now would be have a cached collection of label tags innerhtml then loop through each tag and check for search term when found hide all others but show only matching. my concern is what will happen when list is too long on every keypress looping is not the best idea i suppose

7316209

7316472
getter	setter
however for clarity and testing i would add public getter setter for the tree

7316472
getter	setter
your getter can lazy-load from zend_registry as you are doing but at least allowing a public setter more clearly reflects the dependence and allows you to test with a mock tree

7316486
primefaces	richfaces
i m familiar with richfaces but relatively new to primefaces and trying to implement a simple h graphicimage inside a p datatable additionally inside a ui repeat

7316490

i do not have any metrics regarding performance between richfaces and icefaces primefaces but the ease of development should be approximately the same

7316923
richfaces	icefaces
imo richfaces and icefaces are the two frameworks that have been around the longest and i would put my bet on one of these two

7316924
mousemove	mouseenter
but if you insist on not creating another div then i would bind custom mousemove handler that would be binded on document on mouseenter over div and would detect the fact that mouse move away from div bounding box for more than 10px

7316945
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
first use touchesbegan and touchesmoved methods to detect how much pixels the image has been dragged

7316981
getter	setter
and as normal i added synthesize to the property to generate setter and getter functions

7317000

7317068
mouse	keyboard
to your 2nd question how can i differentiate between select events that are triggered by keyboard with the ones triggered by mouse

7317071
stdout	stderr
connect the repl to stdout stderr stdin

7317078
getter	setter
now these objects are created but you need to wire up these associations - you can do that externally in a separate initializer class container so to speak and just use setter getter to connect them

7317079
postgresql	mysql
geospatial data is a common specialization - so much so that a lot of other database types will provide vector functionality mysql and postgresql which are relational databases

7317092
getter	setter
note if you want to keep attributes inside private region then provide getter and setter methods in node for accessing them.

7317209
hide	show
i dont want to write javascripts for show hide of divs rather want logic to be coded somewhere at server side

7317225
post	put	post	get	put	get
in extjs4 any read is send by get and any write post put delete is send by post

7317286
int	chars	unsigned	short
an unsigned long int short chars is not negative if the msb is set

7317365
rss	feed
also i have downloaded universal feed reader python rss atom reader module

7317374
vim	emacs
all in all these are more powerful than nano but less powerful than np++ which i m not familiar with and a fortiori vim or emacs

7317374
vim	emacs
i don t know about emacs but vim can be used in easy mode like this vim -y yourfile.php

7317374
vim	emacs
vim and emacs both offer these fatures and sooo much more either natively or via plugins

7317374
vim	emacs
the first problems you may be facing is the abruptness of the learning path and the weirdness of their models but most vim emacs users will tell you that once its internalized it s hard to come back

7317374
vim	emacs
why vim or emacs

7317558
primefaces	richfaces
i used primefaces for a new project almost a year ago because at that time it was the only one that was fully compatible with jsf 2 both icefacves and richfaces have had jsf 2 compatible releases in the meantime

7317571
int	double
for general int of arbitrary precision you can use repeated squaring combined with a binary search to take logarithms using only o log log n arithmetic operations each time you square a number you double the exponent which means you can only square the number log log n times before you ve exceeded its value and can do a binary search

7317588
hide	show
this will show the .info div on the first click of .showdesc and hide it on the second and so on

7317590
int	chars
now suppose for whatever reason i don t want the users of class a to create objects with chars or class b which fortunately or unfortunately can implicitly convert to int then you can disable them as

7317613
int	chars
as someone else pointed out unsigned chars gets promoted to an int since any value of a for an unsigned chars a can easily fit in the range of an int

7317617
fadein	fadeout
you have jquery animation functions fadein and fadeout

7317617
hide	show
you can also use show and hide functions

7317668

when submission the form the local server using http its working fine but when accessing sharepoint externally through https i m getting the below-warning message and i can t submit the form since i have try again and exit form

7317685
let	curry
first of all let s look at why f can be called with four arguments when its definition only names three arguments as you probably know ml allows curry function definitions and the definition is really just a shortcut for

7317695
implements	extends
if all the classes are implementations of matrices then it probably makes sense to have them implements a common interface or extends a common abstract class

7317823
width	height
in css an em does not represent the width of an â œmâ but rather the height of the current font

7317849
put	get

7317860
nsstring	nsdata
i m trying to convert a hex nsstring to nsdata i m using the below attached code

7318024
min	max
min max length will count space as an character

7318035
int	double
therefore if you send a double as argument of printf and read d it reads the same number of bytes 4 but interprets the bits as an int and not double -- what you get is gibberish

7318037
width	height
the height attribute as well as the width one must have an integer as value not a string

7318045
public	protected
after that you can call performfiltering 0 it s a protected function so you can export this call via a public function in your class

7318097
range	max

i was thinking about building one form with all the possible fields and hide or show fields depending on the case

7322681
implements	extends
1 is it because i implements an interface that extends from iterable

7322728
google-chrome	firefox
try the code in other browsers like firefox google-chrome etc--it looks like you re using ie to see if the behavior is any different

7322748
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

7322752
implements	extends
1 is it because i implements an interface that extends from iterable

7322752
implements	extends
if you create your own collection that you want to be iterable but that doesn t extends a collection that already implements iterable then you ll need to create your own iterator

7322783
junit	jmock
i m currently using junit and jmock both latest versions

7322788
post	get
it s completely optional if you never need to get to the post from the comment comment.post you won t have to specify the belongs_to relation in comment

7322847
post	get
a select list in a form i know there s no problem to pass the option value using post or get

7322851
pow	math.h
is a bitwise xor operator i.e why the compiler is giving warning.try using pow function declared in math.h header file

7322852
implements	extends
finally you could think of not extends iterable for your ipowerlist if that has nothing to do with iterations it seems to me that way but rather make powerlist implements both interfaces multiple inheritance on interfaces is allowed in java

7322906
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
first i have 3 textboxes a dropdownlistfor a checkbox and 2 linkbuttons in a table

7322907
post	get
you can send them via get or post--though i highly recommend post since it changes data so using a get would technically be against http specs

7322940
rss	feed
i think that there may be a way of using the facebook api kind of like an rss feed but i can t find any instructions

7322949
int	chars
how to convert a single chars into an int

7323027
addclass	removeclass
i just had to create an id for each li and then use jquery addclass and removeclass to swap the classes

7323051
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox google-chrome and ie9

7323151
post	get
post does go next is response and on response i get this error

7323176
hide	show
when someone changes a filter jquery processes the changes and show hide rows in the table that match the filters

7323196
qtreewidget	qitemdelegate
you can use a qitemdelegate with a qtreewidget this way example in pyqt sorry

7323197
button	checkbox
when i click the select all checkbox again it selects all and when i click the select all button once more it deselects all but the select all button still remains checked

7323205
post	get
i m not real clear on is this best accomplished using bindinterceptor to intercept any get or post method on any page or is it better to use a filter

7323210
portrait	landscape
in the same activity i would like to add a button which changes the screen orientation from landscape to portrait

7323217
atoi	atof
if you find one you can treat it as a double and use the function atof instead of atoi and if you don t just stick with atoi

7323253
button	checkbox
i m trying to find a way to keep the state of this page checkbox that are checked to remain checked when i hit the navigation button to go to the previous page

7323266
implements	extends
however if you control all the types involved you can pull a nasty hack at the library level- you either extends b from a or have b implements a

7323324
width	height
and if you want scroll bars you should use css to make the height width fixed and then set the overflow to scroll

7323334
int	double
but this could be more involving if you are working with numeric values like int floats double etc

7323334
int	double
i defined convert for double - int and double - bigint but you can also define you own for the types you need

7323376
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
yes uinavigationcontroller retains the uiviewcontroller in that are in its stacks

7323376
viewdidload	viewwillappear
which would have helped you a lot to know in which method of your code the crash really occurs probably some method like viewwillappear or viewdidload

7323385
puts	gets
cvqueryframe is just a wrapper that calls 2 other functions cvgrabframe which gets data from the camera very quickly and cvretrieveframe which uncompresses this data and puts it into an iplimage

7323403
google-chrome	firefox
the pair works great for us in firefox google-chrome but we re unable to get the count to work properly in ie

7323434
super	self
file c python27 lib site-packages django db models sql compiler.py line 791 in execute_sql cursor super sqlinsertcompiler self .execute_sql none

7323443

i suggest implements a custom appender by extends skeletonappender and handling everything yourself in the methods you override

7323476
mp3	wav
i can o p the aduio mp3 wav which is no problem - the issue is that i want to control the usb s output sample clock rate i need to be able to change this from 44.1 to 48 khz

7323525
qtableview	qtablewidget
if you can use a qtablewidget instead of a qtableview you can use qtablewidget.setcellwidget to put another widget inside a cell

7323592
post	get
you should be using the post redirect get pattern

7323592
post	get
attempting to circumvent post redirect get is not a good solution

7323610
width	height
one thing that i m concerned about is the screen size stage size should i have the game adjust it s self to fill the whole client area like a youtube video in full screen with a dynamic width and height

7323639
pop-up	dialog
it can still be presented to the user as a pop-up using jquery dialog or using updatepanels and modalpopupextenders if you re masochistic

7323712
jax-ws	jax-rs
in java ee for example you could already use a simple servlet for this but also jax-rs and jax-ws is supported for restful xml json and xml webservices respectively

7323727
vaadin	jsf
i don t know the intricacies of vaadin but i m assuming it s a server-side component model like jsf

7323752
inherited	properties
a good solution would be to create an object that contains a list and your properties and inherited implements ixmlserializable

7323760
filesystems	ntfs
what specific conditions in an ntfs filesystems can lead to this particular error being reported on a call to fflush

7323783
jlabel	jeditorpane
a variety of swing components will render basic html version 3.2 including jlabel jeditorpane

7323839
google-chrome	firefox
however if compression is enabled in iis either gzip or deflate then the browser waits until all the content has been received before downloading any of the other items from the page i m using google-chrome and firefox to test this

7323904
autofixture	xunit.net
however most of the arrange part is now purely declarative and since you seem to already be using xunit.net you can use autodata theories for autofixture to move most of the variables to method arguments

7323945
profiling	instrumentation
what you won t be able to do is instrumentation and profiling monitor the primordial jvm and accessing native functions requires jni calls

7323958
post	put
i looked at this api from joyent and in all their put and post requests they pass some data in the request body

7323958
post	put
is it really wrong not to require a request body in a put and post request

7323969
youtube	vimeo
i consider using api s like youtube and vimeo

7323969
youtube	vimeo
i ve got 2 questions 1.do you know other sites like youtube and vimeo which offer embeddable content

7323969
youtube	vimeo
2.what platform should i use if i want to embed own video content to youtube vimeo facebook site fan page and others automatically

7323978
for-loop	arrays
please check the how many objects test arrays contains at beginning of for-loop

7323997
integer	unsigned
nsuinteger -1 -1 interpreted as an unsigned integer which is 0xffffffff or namely the maximum value of the nsuinteger type

7323999
translation	localization
but if you re serious about localization and have a moderate to high volume of content and want to work with any translation provider - you need a proper rich scalable integration between your cms and the tms translation management system used by your translation firm lsp

7324043
jasmine	sinon
i set up a sinon timer in my jasmine unit testing code and test after a tick of 7 seconds to see if the post-animation properties are as they should be

7324043
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the page loads the animation function is called the unit test immediately fails and then also immediately the animation visibly occurs

7324043
opera	safari
in ie opera and safari the page loads the animation function is called the unit test immediately fails and the animation never visibly occurs

7324043
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
settimeout cleartimeout setinterval clearinterval date

7324054
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
in ie google-chrome safari opera this works

7324080
folder	directory
that tends to fail if they are not copied to a directory that s on the path or copied into the same folder as the main exe

7324160
post	put
the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is

7324160
post	put
both post and put include the phrase entity enclosed in the request

7324160
post	put
based on my reading i believe that a body is desired a non-normative description i know for both post and put

7324160
post	put
in the context of rest post is create and put is update

7324224
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
for instance task manager gives me a dialog for assigning the processors affinity labeled cpu 0 through cpu 7 for any process

7324224
cpu	processors
so cpu 5 would be the second hyperthread running on physical processors 2

7324290
google-chrome	firefox
the function works properly in firefox google-chrome and ie7 but not in ie8

7324295
button	checkbox
for example i know how to create a label or a button but how can i find a checkbox or add a browser to a button a list box .

7324295
button	checkbox
a checkbox is a button with the swt.check style

7324359
post	get
scan the form get the name value pairs from all the fields not just hidden then fill username password and do a post

7324367
charindex	substr
you could use charindex with substr

7324380
int	double
on 32-bit platforms you can only do 9 digits in an int so we ll make the function return a double and generate a string of ascii digits then convert

7324387
fflush	gets
now i fflush it and the user- id gets changed i have no idea why this

7324467
put	get
in logcat i get this error and the log statement that i put never prints out

7324493
cdr	cons
the only external functions used are cons car cdr null

7324599
mef	prism
read chapter 3 of the prism 4.0 help file managing dependencies between components registering types with either unity or mef depending on what you are using as your di container

7324624
google-chrome	firefox
i can see it in google-chrome firefox and ie

7324629
hide	show
actually the bar can already be hidden and show but that takes an alt-key to make the menu appear a right click to get the popup menu a click on the standard item modifying the dropdown contents then another right click and another click to hide it back

7324648
put	get
then you ll want to take a database backup put it on tape and get it off-site

7324648
wan	lan
your lan or wan or internet connection

7324667
jpct	jmonkeyengine	jpct	ardor3d	jmonkeyengine	ardor3d
jmonkeyengine ardor3d jpct or xith3d are much better options these days

7324705
children	parent
when i get data i have 5 entities in list and all have correctly configured parent and children navigation properties

7324717
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of mpich2 versioning 1.4.1p1

7324793
des	aes
in your case you would use aes or rijndael_128 instead of des i suppose i didn t test it

7324815
folder	directory
when i edit the gitolite.rc file to change the directory to map to my e repositories folder where i want it to go i get an error

7324838
portrait	landscape
the orientation changes to landscape - the user clicks a button that shows another view - this new view gets created and shown but its default positioning is for portrait orientation - when the view is shown the elements i rearrange in the willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation method are in the wrong position

7324849
fflush	gets
a stream may use an internal buffer which gets actually streamed when the stream is fflush

7324849
cout	cin
in case of cout you may not notice the difference since it s somehow synchronized tied with cin but for an arbitrary stream such as file stream you ll notice a difference in a multithreaded program for example

7324881
post	put
one possible reason put forward in other post on this site is that there are dependent dlls that must be referenced and in fact after downloading dpendencywalker i found that my dll uses ipps-7.0.dll

7324912
autocomplete	multi-select
i am implementing a multi-select autocomplete textbox similar to one that stackoverflow uses for tags input using fcbkcomplete

7325021
versioning	upgrade
here is a similar question automatically upgrade user settings from previous versioning of app.config file

7325021
versioning	upgrade
in that case you will not lose values and there will be no need to upgrade settings between versioning

7325023
for-loop	arrays
it works right now but i want to reuse these arrays in other functions so i tried to move the arrays declaration and the for-loop outside the function the function errors out when it reaches the first reference to aarr i as though the function does not recognized aarr

7325043
versioning	upgrade
user upgrade to a later versioning of your application application

7325114
post	get
however when i post the form back to the controller i only get the first selected value returned

7325129
google-chrome	safari
so i guess test it out in google-chrome or safari

7325151
int	chars
otherwise you would be requiring the global_id to have a chars to differentiate it from the int field and create unnecessary cycles to determine how to query the data based on the content of the data

7325153
g++	gcc
now regarding the difference between g++ and gcc continue with the next

7325191
std	ostream
the data class will want to have a member function that takes a std ostream by reference and saves the reservations to a text file easiest is one variable per line

7325191
std	ostream
then it calls the std ostream member function again to save the changes

7325208
for-loop	arrays
i can t from the example quite figure out what index and current are supposed to be but either way if the for-loop is ran before the dom is ready then you re arrays are obvisouly empty and the indexing will be messed up

7325214
width	height
onattach is event fired by every widget when it is been added to its parent once any widget as been added then you can get the offset height and width

7325214
width	height
extend panel class for top central and bottom then when all these panels has been added to parent try to get width and height

7325239
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton	uitapgesturerecognizer	uicontrol	uicontrol	uibutton
you can use uitapgesturerecognizer and pass the event through a delegate or use uicontrol which is a subclass of uiview but with uibutton tap events like touchupinside and so and then pass the event with a delegate to your view

7325257
getter	setter
i know spring roo uses this for getter and setter the idea being that having that boilerplate code out of the .java file makes it cleaner

7325299
move	drag
you have to use intermediate again in the drag functions start move up but with translate function which make everybody in the set move in the same way

7325301
stdout	stderr
as far as the standard streams go there are different ways to access them for example using stdout stderr like file handles to fwrite but there are only 2 of them at the end of the day

7325301
stdout	stderr
sometimes actual output will be done on stdout and progress or debugging related output on stderr

7325301
stdout	stderr
that way the user can pipe stdout into a file and leave stderr going to the console

7325381
put	get
it s a hack but you could take the tests out of the tests directory and put them somewhere else that they won t get run automatically inst tests then use your own parallelizable framework make run in parallel may be relevant to run the tests .

7325399
solaris	aix
it works on some platforms and on some it doesn t works on windows macos and aix doesn t work on linux hp_ux solaris freebsd...

7325422
folder	directory
i can extract it to the same directory as the tar file but not into another folder

7325474
children	parent
basically its a parent which contains a collection of children

7325474
children	parent
right this works fine for creating new parent without children

7325509
src	attr
so that now we can clone that image and give it a different src and place it underneath the first one .clone .insertafter this attr src hover

7325561
children	parent
assuming your parent are truly unique you know that another thread just did the parents...proceed with children

7325613
parent-child	one-to-many
from the question it seems that the parent-child relationship has been setup as one-to-one rather than one-to-many

7325614
getter	setter
i tried adding some debug statements and breakpoints into the property s getter and setter but they are never hit

7325630
mouseover	mouseenter
my problem is that when doing that the appropriate mouseover mouseenter callbacks don t get called when he mouse cursor is directly above them

7325671
mouseover	mouseenter
probably should file a bug report with the browser manufacturer and check other browsers to see if the behavior is replicated - which i m guessing it will because dont think any browser will fire a mouseover mouseenter event if the mouse was not physically moved

7325675
portrait	landscape
there should always be a case where you return yes for either portrait or landscape regardless of whether it s an ipad or you have uisplitviewcontroller class

7325687
portrait	landscape
also if you need to check if the device orientation is landscape or portrait its better to use

7325759
rss	feed
wordpress generates an rss feed of your blog

7325811
put	get
in addition put another applet on the server that obtains data from whatismyipaddress.com actually the estmated location of the pc and tries to get weather data from buienradar for that location the latter fails because of the applet security

7325817
clang	llvm
according to opencl wikipedia at 2011-09 the apple 22 nvidia 23 rapidmind 24 and gallium3d 25 implementations of opencl are all based on the llvm compiler technology and use the clang compiler as its frontend.

7325844
min	max
one of the functions that we have to have is to be able to take a statistician list count sum min max and mean and multiply it by a certain integer

7325848
oncreate	setcontentview
tactically you cannot create an activity via its constructor nor can you call setcontentview before oncreate is called in the activity

7325878
rss	feed
please add it to the list of objects to be notified. it s kind of like subscribing to an rss feed in a sense - everyone on the list gets the update when it happens

7325905
ubuntu	opensuse
the code below works with every server i ve tested so far redhat ubuntu opensuse

7325907
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side language and php is a server-side language

7325924
hide	show
i m using the following function to show and hide divs that contain loading images when the browser is working

7325924
hide	show
and here is an example of a show hide call

7325929
width	height
needs to be initialized if you want to get its width and height

7325946
getter	setter
don t provider a getter or setter method

7325969
robocopy	xcopy
you can set verify to on before running xcopy or robocopy to ensure the file integrity

7325972
google-chrome	firefox
works google-chrome 13 firefox 6 ie9 on win7

7325990
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to save the file from all the major browsers i checked on firefox and google-chrome but when i tried to save the file from internet explorer..

7325997
switching	screens
unfortunately this solution seems undesirable to me because of what happens visually when you switching between desktop modes screens goes black temporary repositioning of windows - it s basically not a clean transition

7326013
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome everything seems to be fine but in firefox it isn t working

7326051
width	height
i can get a specific style property value using document.getelementbyid myid .style.property where property is something like width height etc

7326098
hide	show
the next solution and the easiest is to create a report that has all the possible fields you could ever need and then use the reportobject model to dynamically hide the fields you don t need to show

7326115
mp3	wav
it is about 1 4 the size of the raw wav files so it isn t as good as mp3 but the performance is much better especially if you are using a lot of small audio tracks

7326117
hide	show
therefore the decision about bookmarkability is your responsibility the hash will invoke a specific route and what views that route hide or show is up to you

7326122
super	self
self is the class that the method is a part of super is the class that the self inherits from

7326123
printf	atoi
i m aware of stringstream printf atoi etc

7326235
put	get
i am able to put a die statement in index.php and get output to the screen--so even more troubling is that i get complete abject failure of the hmvc module in centos not just a notice

7326260
int	chars
since is now holding the int value of the key it can t be used as an array and silently fails echoing an empty chars

7326269
rss	feed
i have been looking this sample project and i wanted to populate these page views with data taken from an rss feed

7326291
serializable	deserialization
i think what needs to happen is that the name of the class datetime needs to get serializable out and checked on deserialization

7326321
hide	show
i have a view in which i have a code block where i am setting some variables and later on using those variables to show or hide some areas.

7326322
versioning	upgrade
i would try to upgrade your jdk versioning versioning 7 where the bug seems fixed

7326345
trac	mantis
other tools very interesting in my opinion is some kind of continuous integration like jenkins and some ticketing system like trac or mantis

7326402
inherited	subclassing
suppose you have a class named flynetarrayofdataset which inherited from is a subclassing of nsarray

7326417
width	height
providing the width and the height will not really help speed if not for layout purposes

7326438
put	get
if i were you i d first get the lexer much cleaner by removing all the literal spaces and put them on the hidden channel so you won t have to account for them inside other parser- and lexer rules

7326480
accessor	properties
javascript pretty much just has properties accessor an operator for does this object have a properties with this name

7326532
int	double
asymptotically this is probably the best way to go since it would be possible to support all the relevant features of json documents along with supporting some specialized methods for doing stuff like diffing int double and strings using relative encoding edit distance

7326553
filesystems	ntfs
i expect the san to be ntfs for now in case there are any special features of certain filesystems

7326573
for-loop	loops
i am wondering what the stats would look like if the class.forname misc.a is done only once outside the for-loop it doesn t really have to be done for every invocation of loops

7326579
width	height
if the bitmapdata objects are equivalent with the same width height

7326640
equals	gethashcode
it would satisfy all the constraints of gethashcode - namely that if you call it on two equals values it will return the same hash code

7326720
pdostatement	bindvalue
the pdostatement bindvalue method offers a way to specify the type of the variable bound

7326720
pdostatement	bindvalue
pdostatement bindvalue parameter value data_type pdo param_str

7326727
post	get
the image shows you have to use a post which you can t do with bare-bones file_get_contents - it defaults to using a get query

7326766
for-loop	arrays
why is it that i cannot for-loop the arrays of objects and access them as such

7326774
rss	feed
i understand there s an rss type feed i can poll and check manually but i m wondering if there s a smarter push mechanism available

7326803
getter	setter
beans have a standard nomenclature for getter and setter if you have a getter like getstringrep hibernate will try to find a property called stringrep - which you don t have -

7326847
folder	directory
- does the target directory exist and does the user account that is running the tier have write permission to that folder

7326851
gif	png
just use an image with transparent areas so it has to be a png or gif set the windowstyle to none set the window s background to transparent and set allowtransparency to true

7326866
versioning	upgrade
i m running the latest versioning of everything made sure to upgrade before posting

7326888
innodb	myisam
innodb myisam and disk space

7326903
folder	directory
but since the user folder will all differ its impossible to know what directory path to specify

7326910
udp	tcp
the specific communication protocol was always defined above some standard protocol udp tcp ip serial can and included a set of messages passing from one side to another

7326925
hide	show
i am looking at examples to hide show div tags using javascript

7326935
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
i ve tried mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave hover and even using live in combination with them

7326944
margin	height
function outerheight true counts height of the element including border and margin

7326961
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am using uitabbarcontroller + uinavigationcontroller

7326975
mp3	ogg
for html5 audio you will need at least two copies of the sound file to hit every browser i would say one in mp3 format the other in ogg vorbis

7326987
versioning	upgrade
after this stopped working i tried installing the fb 4.5.1 upgrade patch in the hope that this would also update any local framework sdk files to the latest versioning

7327009
ubuntu	debian
you can install it on debian ubuntu with sudo apt-get install sloccount

7327017
centroid	threshold
you could find the connected components in the image and only include those components that have a total size above a certain threshold in your centroid calcuation

7327019
qfile	qdir	qfile	qbytearray	qbytearray	qdir
basically qdir homepath returns qfile decodename qbytearray getenv home almost unchecked

7327037
getter	setter
the key message is and no properties discovered to create beanserializer your classes resourceresultsetcol and resourceresultsetrow should have default public constructor and getter setter for all properties

7327049
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem is a you need to use mouseenter mouseleave and b the tooltip div needs to live inside the element that has the mouseenter mouseleave listeners

nswindow	nspanel
nspanel is a subclass of nswindow so anything you read about swapping views in windows should work identically on panels

7327305
pull	push
just about any time i start to pull something out into an include or if i find myself copying a piece of display logic from one page to another i start thinking about how i can push that code into a custom tag

7327338
ssl	https
using an ssl cert and forcing https will make it much harder nearly impossible to catch the traffic on the netwrok

7327340
mouseleave	mouseenter
rather than firing the mouseenter and mouseleave events immediately it waits for the mouse cursor to stay still for a bit you can adjust the sensitivity and timeout so if you hover on each item quickly only the last item that s hovered on will show the tooltip

7327363
interpolation	splines
recently i ve been looking to find the interpolation cubic splines of some data that i have

7327363

filtering	grouping
we have a bunch of templates some of which are only visible when adding a new item to a c# web application project filtering using the web template grouping id

7327410
filtering	grouping
i took a look in the registry under hkcu software microsoft visualstudio 10.0exp_config projects fae04ec0-301f-11d3-bf4b-00c04f79efbc the unflavoured c# project type registration and i can see that it does not specify any filtering based on template grouping id so that s no help it seems

7327410
filtering	grouping
flavoured project subtypes such as workflow do seem to filtering the items they allow you to add using for example a template grouping id of workflowitemtemplategroupid but it seems like unflavoured projects don t filtering their items and therefore any items that have visiblebydefault set to false will always be invisible since they can t specify a template grouping id

7327475
uiview	subviews	uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
maybe a better approach is to put a uiview subclass instead of a uibutton as subviews on uiscrollview and add a uitapgesturerecognizer on them

is it possible then that you wrap the plugin in say a div and on the div have a mouseleave event and force the plugin to execute mouseup

7327525
google-chrome	safari
users report to be using either google-chrome or safari on windows so this may be an issue with webkit

7327536
hash	md5
so comparing the md5 hash doesn t really help

7327543
floating-point	integer
that problem occurs because in javascript every number is 64bit floating-point there no such thing as an integer

installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
an option would be an unlocker project that enables pro features but i prefer an installation of either the free versioning with later upgrade or directly install the pro versioning

7327611
equals	gethashcode
to start with - you must also override equals as gethashcode is only meant to be a fast method to determine if two objects are not equals

7327611
equals	gethashcode
that s what equals is for - it is meant to be the final check that two objects are equals and it could be much slower to compute than gethashcode

7327611
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode returned the length of the strings then you could very quickly determine that the third string is definitely not equals to the first two

7327647
width	height
you don t need to use initwithframe as the cell s frame is decided by the width of the uitableview it s a part of and the height you pass in heightforrowatindexpath in the uitableview s data source methods

7327668
getter	setter
you really need to learn how to propertize setter getter a variable rather than asking people to post code for you

7327728
udp	tcp
for now i m using c++ and tcp qt sockets or boost sockets but if needed i don t mind doing udp in c and wrapping it

7327752
udp	tcp
i m not aware of any way to reliably punch through firewalls for tcp but there s a similar method for udp traffic that s pretty well documented

i can repro this in google-chrome firefox and ie

7327813
versioning	upgrade
or you could make apps b and c both have paid versioning that are the full app and free versioning that are the lite versioning and then use in-app purchases or your code idea to upgrade from the lite versioning to the pro versioning

7327836
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when you add the uinavigationcontroller via the nib it actually creates an instance of a uinavigationcontroller inside the nib file with a default rootviewcontroller set of type uiviewcontroller and with a default title of rootviewcontroller

7327886
domxpath	domdocument
once you have the domdocument instance you can perform create a domxpath object and perform queries on it

7327927
actionlistener	documentlistener
a documentlistener is not an actionlistener so as i stated earlier the use of an action doesn t seem appropriate

7327940
udp	tcp
the reason why i used the udp protocol was because it is similar to tcp when using c#

7327964
post	get
i will post code when i get bak to my laptop but i was just curious if anyone had any ideas

it works fine in firefox and safari

7328003
udp	tcp
simple traversal of udp through nats and tcp too stunt which extends stun to include tcp functionality is a lightweight protocol that allows applications running behind a nat to determine external ip and port-binding properties packet filtering rules and various timeouts associated with tcp connections through the nat

7328040
subtract	add
you have a total number of pixels to start with then add or subtract from the counter depending on the pixel s color

7328045
width	height
note rectangle is actually a struct i created with 4 size_t fields for the top-left x y coordinate and the width and height of the rectangle

7328049
int	chars
because 1 + 2 12 in javascript you need to convert your chars to int

7328064
hash	md5
md5 or other cryptographic hash seems like it would be too expensive and overkill for this purpose

7328070
nsstring	nsdata
asihttprequest can return it as nsdata or nsstring

7328075
next	except
question as currently there is only a preview 4 version out april 2011 and i could not find much on when ms expects to release it except an impression it will be either this year or next year - should i use it already

7328162
folder	directory

7328194
gridview	repeater
repeater has fewer templates then gridview

7328197
post	get
to use it first get access token then tried to get post friends and they are fine

7328216
udp	tcp
if you are interested in knowing why i want to make udp reliable and why i don t use tcp instead take a look at this question

7328216
hash	md5
the hash will be an efficient algorithm such as md5 to make sure data got received in the right order

7328275
gridview	repeater
gridview also has a much more rich object model while repeater is rather simplistic

7328342
post	get

width	height
given a center point width height and angle forming an obb how can i find if a given point p is inside the obb

7328450
integer	unsigned
in the case of an integer a negative signed value x will be converted to uint_max+1-x just as if it were stored as a signed value in two s complement and then interpreted as an unsigned value

7328450
integer	unsigned
however 0 - 5 in unsigned integer math leads to an underflow error which is defined to result in uint_max+1-5

7328450
integer	unsigned
however the reason you see -5 printed in your output is a combination of the fact that the unsigned integer uint_max-4 and -5 have the same exact binary representation just like -5 and 251 do with a single-byte datatype and the fact that when you used d as the formatting string that told printf to interpret the value of c as a signed integer instead of an unsigned integer

7328454
pull	push
when i move to one of those locations i d like to use the local server for push pull

7328475
width	height
you can have the image automatically resize width and height using the little arrows on the layout page -- that s a bit hard to describe

7328510
actionlistener	documentlistener
you can add actionlistener to the button just like you have added documentlistener to the document of the input

7328558
solaris	aix
on at least some versions of aix int 0 0 and solaris has optional compatibility with this aix feature.

7328600
post	get
i think the problem you are having is that you are doing a post instead of a get so changing it to the following may do the trick

7328672
getter	setter
also getter and setter methods for array fields can be confusing

7328689
tunnel	vpn
use a vpn or ssh tunnel to send your network traffic through the gfw is a common option to bypass censorship

7328689
tunnel	vpn
i myself setup my own homebrew ssh tunnel vpn on linode vps

7328745
int	double
is it correct to say that the quotient of num 2 is not a double because you need to parse the int to double

7328766
for-loop	arrays
the vba macro you d need to take the data from the spreadsheet and output it as a js file with a valid javascript arrays declaration would be trivial no more than 20 or 30 lines of code basically a simple nested for-loop ought to do it with some initialisation to open a file for writing etc

7328791
google-chrome	firefox
the script is working n firefox google-chrome but not in ie6

7328804
put	get
i have managed to get that working but i know the javascript code i implemented is obtrusive and am wanting to put the same code or equivalent onto my external javascript file to make it not obtrusive

7328850
mouseover	mouseout
the main issue that i see is that mouseover and mouseout handlers need to be functions

7328887
post	get
basically once you get your html from the post you can invoke validation using jquery.validator.unobtrusive.parse

7328933
jsf	seam
seam 2.x was created to ease development against java ee 5 and to serve as an incubator for future standards mainly java ee 6 and jsf 2

7328933
jsf	seam
java ee 6 took the ideas from seam 2 and others to specify cdi and improve apis like jsf

7328933
jsf	seam
seam 3 brings new ideas to java ee 6 and serves as an incubator for future standards mainly java ee 7 and jsf 2.x

7328933
jsf	seam
cdi is so much more mature than seam 2 bijection jsf 2 is so much easier than jsf 1.2 that any kind of application development will simply be much more fun with seam 3

7329129
cells	tablecell
you can create a uiview with image as background with your tablecell s dimensions and add it to your cells then you can add rest of the controls and elements on your uiview

7329157
width	height
what i would like to do is have the image width take up the whole cell minus padding 280 and the height variable based on the image size

7329157
portrait	landscape
in reality some of the images are portrait and some are landscape orientation

7329165

7329214
udp	tcp
i referred to different threads about reliable udp vs tcp for large file transfers

7329214
udp	tcp
however before making the decision of choosing udp over tcp and add reliability mechanism to udp i want to benchmark performance of udp tcp

7329214
udp	tcp
but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp for 10mb of data

7329214
udp	tcp
this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp

7329214
udp	tcp
does udp always perform better than tcp

7329214
udp	tcp
scenario where udp is better than tcp

7329214
udp	tcp
is there any standard utilty to measure tcp and udp performance on a particular network

post	get
django cms uses request.language_code to determine what language to use if you don t specifically asks for a certain language in your get or post parameters

7329322
int	chars
the underlying fact that you are missing is that chars s are promoted to int s as are short s to do arithmetic

7329322
int	chars
stick with chars s or int s

7329342
udp	tcp
use udp when tcp windowing and congestion control is not optimised such as high latency high bandwidth wan links see udt and wan accelerators for example

7329356
maven	m2e
ever since i ve installed the new m2e plugin for maven my groovy project no longer builds

7329399
g++	gcc
this should not be a compiler issue but still have tried it on gcc icpc icc g++

7329456
equals	compareto
but because the treemap and everything deriving from sortedset only uses compareto and ignores the equals method we find that searching for duplicates based on id doesn t work

7329494
int	chars
as chars codes are non-negative int this may explain why the behaviour you re seeing only works for such numbers and not floating point and negative numbers

7329513
qdialog	qwidget
a simple alternative is to use a plain qwidget as your container instead of a qdialog

7329533
wakelock	powermanager
i have looked at the powermanager class and more specifically the wakelock mechanism

7329565
config	ini
python s standard library configparser exposes the sections and options of an ini style config file using the mapping protocol and so you can retrieve your options directly from that as though it were a dictionary

7329574
daemons	launchd

7329585
hide	show
users are able to click register which hide the login div and show the register div

7329604
onclick	onmousedown
to get the coordinates of the mouse on a picturebox you should not handle the onclick event but the onmousedown for example in this way

7329611
fast-forward	merge
if no that a fast-forward merge will be done and that s what you need

7329645
qsort	bsearch
simply sort the array using qsort then search with bsearch or roll your own

7329656
peer	p2p
typically a super peer is an edge peer with extra functionalities to support the structure of the p2p network

7329689
serializable	deserialization
which one serializable deserialization solution is the best for distant serializable deserialization on server

7329737
qsort	bsearch
so i wouldn t bother with hashes at all but just resort to sorting your string table on startup using qsort and later using a binary search using bsearch to look up entries

7329860
put	get
in the absence of that all i can think of is to put the info in hidden fields on the page and have jquery get its data from these fields

7329876
oncreate	ondestroy
if you need to have activity and service running simultaneously then start you watcher service in oncreate and stop it in ondestroy

7329904
set	bag
this solution is ok but when we add one more fetch for query then collection in object also be multiplied that is why i modified collection type from ilist bag to iset set

7329907
interpreted-language	compiled-language
even in c most statements evaluate as an expression - however a comparison between a compiled-language c and an interpreted-language coffeescript is rather useless

7329914
post	get
you d have to post that to get more specific advice

7329925
xmodem	zmodem	kermit	zmodem	kermit	xmodem
there are still plenty of open source implementations of things like xmodem zmodem kermit ymodem and many others still floating around since most of these can and did work with byte streams then it shouldn t be too difficult to make them work with a byte stream over udp instead of a byte stream over a serial port

7329939
hash	salt
if i had the need to share the users credentials i would probably share the username and the hash + salt password so you would be safe and only share the representation of a password not it s contents

7329953
post	get
also i recomand not to use the post method but the get method as you are not calling a ressource via get

7329979
width	height
now the layout appears fine if the content inside the td is less...but if there is more content ie kind of expands the cell width height and displays the content fine

7329979
width	height
but in firefox the width height for the content div remains fixed and does not expand as per the content which makes the layout appear a bit broken

7329986
width	height
i need to use same widgets buttons editext textviews with same properties like width height textcolor size etc in multiple screens xmls

7329986
width	height
if i define layout width height also in styles and simply giving style style mybuttonstyle for button in xml is working fine even though i did n t mention width height in xml might be inheriting from style

7329986
width	height
if i give width height in xml without style prop and simply giving my custom theme to activity is bringing all styles i specified in theme

7329986
width	height
but i did n t mention width height in xml it is raising an exception saying that u have specify layout width height which i already specified in style itself

7329987
listview	gridview
i need to implement gridview inline edit update and delete operations through listview in wpf from db similar to normal windows datagridview

7330549
stdout	stderr
in case of big output use file handles for stdout and stderr

7330604
post	get
otherwise my best suggestion for a limited fetch store would be to adjust your back-end code to support filtering options such that when the store makes a post or get you parse out an array of fields that you want to search against and the result set is returned accordingly

7330628
put	get
as a fudge i have put an animation which does nothing on the containers which do not get collapsed and now it works.

working with the paperclip gem and i want to change the dimensions for each style applied to an uploaded image differently depending on whether the image is in landscape or portrait orientation

7330816
submit	submission
you can use the submit event to cancel the form submission do your analytics ajax stuff and then submit the form programmatically using the submit method on the form element

7330817
keydown	keyup
the keypress event is for detecting typed characters while keyup and keydown are for detcting physical keys in those events keycode works in every major browser

7330825
google-chrome	firefox
i may be wrong but it seems to me that in firefox and all the browsers that work the height always returns 200 but in google-chrome it returns 200 if the content is small so fadeout never gets called on content that is not collapsable..

7330826
pull	push
propagation between repo pull push of public branches ie branches made to be replicated amongst repo

7330838

since the images might be png jpg or gif the format problem shouldn t apply

width	height
the current setup is wrong because the scrollviewer does not limit the width and height of its child unlimited moreover the grid always fills all the available horizontal and vertical space available on its parent container and that is why you see this weird behavior

7331270
width	height
or set a fixed height and width for your grid

7331359
pop-up	dialog
so if yourclass is a listactivity the inside you can put a pop-up dialog for example with another list with customer details and then you can add a close button

put	get
here the ajax code that you can call to the server side php file and get the out put and do what you want

7331393
rss	feed
a button suscribe on the aspx would add the current user to this list which would be taken as a source for the rss feed mailing list

7331393
rss	feed
another possibity would be to redirect the user to the rss suscribing page of sharepoint view rss feed or the mailing list alert me but maybe would it be less ergonomic.

7331397
hide	show
so i would have some sort of document.onready handler which will hide your images and insert the loading... text then your load event handler will show your images and remove the loading text

the great php getter setter debate

7331983
getter	setter
is it really that wrong not using setter and getter

7331988
webchromeclient	webviewclient
if you only want this for debugging purposes i think the simplest way to do it is to create a small app that loads your website in a webview and through the use of webviewclient specifically the onloadresource method and possibly webchromeclient logs all the requests that are made on the page

7332015
rss	feed
link to an rss feed of the list

just put a null-check before that assignment and you ll get rid of that error but you may have to raise an exception or deal with the null argument appropriately

7332225

this should allow you to define the type of the argument to int string or boolean

7332226
jlabel	jtextpane	jlabel	jeditorpane	jtextpane	jeditorpane
1 if you want to multiline jcomponents without using jlabel then you have to look for textcomponent as are jtextarea jtextpane jeditorpane if should t be editable then mytextcomponent#seteditable false

7332264
min	max
here is an example take a look at the min and max of the density function and real min max of the data

7332370
git-rebase	amend
the most flexible way to do this is to do an interactive git-rebase to squash together or amend your commits

7332444
google-chrome	firefox
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

7332444
google-chrome	firefox
since the speed of math.min a b on firefox â the speed of on google-chrome and speed of on firefox â the speed of math.min a b on google-chrome firefox is slow or firefox is fast can t be a reason

7332450
folder	directory
you need to give permission to write the cache folder in your lib for me sites all modules print lib cache directory

7332473
getter	setter
in php if at all you are uncomfortable with the magic getter and setter you can write them in your class as you have done in strongly typed language and you can use it as you have used it there

7332473
getter	setter
i think we can automatically generate getter and setter functions in some framework like symfony

7332473
getter	setter
you can write the appropriate implementation of magic getter and setter if you need more type enforcement or control over the properties

7332477
git-rebase	amend
in mercurial there is no amend or git-rebase by default and it is a design choice philosophy

7332495
put	get
i want to count similar values and get a out put like

7332548
hide	show
or you can use jquery s show hide functions

7332586
put	get
i know this will get a lot of traditional answers but i would also like to put forward something completely original we tried and succeeded doing ourselves for more efficient localisation of silverlight using attached properties instead of binding

7332776
vbscript	jscript
where you can define your function in jscript and reference it in vbscript

inherited	properties
inherited means your class can extend from other class es inheriting all the properties from it and adding new ones

7333051
getter	setter
i see php magic getter and setter as one of its sickness

7333051
getter	setter
in most languages getter and setter are actually a functions where you can add some small logic it is not so wisely done in php

7333085
hide	show
look at that response and show hide the div based on the respons and show hide another div embedding another video from local sources

7333098
inherited	properties
by default all properties are set to inherited from parent or project defaults which just shows the parent object s value for that properties but once overriden at a child level in this case a .cpp file the file ignores changes from the parent properties

7333114
pow	sqrt
see pow and sqrt functions manual

7333186
jboss	glassfish
i have seen this occur on application servers like jboss and glassfish that by default come prepackaged with their own jsf implementation

7333186
jboss	glassfish
likewise the jboss glassfish classloaders gave preference to the bundled jsf implementation libraries versus any jsf implementations that appear in web-inf lib

7333198
post	get
problem here is that post.all returns an array but i would rather like to have an activerecord relation like i get from post to work with it later on

7333492
qthread	qwidget
how can i inherit from both qwidget and qthread

7333499
for-loop	loops
you can put all that in a for-loop and make a new directory each iteration of loops

7333518
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
in this case you should use classes like sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldatareader from the system.data.sqlclient namespace in your application

7333528
uiview	subviews
i have a subclass of a uiview myview that has some uitextfield as subviews

7333528
uiview	subviews
so i created a uiview mysubview made it subviews of myview and placed all textfields inside of it

public	protected
if you want to use your variable a in your derived classes you should make it protected because you cannot use it by public inheritance if it is private

7333980
width	height
if you want your button to be inside the geopointview it needs to have x y coordinates that fit within the width 120 and height 100 of geopointview so something like this will put it in the top left corner 0 0 of geopointview

apache	nginx
this is a strandard nginx reverse proxy - apache backend server

7334208
expander	itemscontrol
each expander contains an itemscontrol that can potentially have a lot of items in and therefore need to scroll

7334208
expander	grid
i can sort of achieve what i m after by using a grid and putting each expander in a row with a height but this means they are always taking up 1 3 of the window each which defeats the point of the expander

7334236
post	get
use a post request for data that changes something not a get

7334237
post	get
use the escape function on the value or use a post instead of a get

7334298
nstextfield	nsslider
i have a nsslider which updates the content of an nstextfield

equals	gethashcode
instead based on what you are doing here i d recommend that you convert your pair class to a struct structure in vb leaving equals and gethashcode alone

7334322
implements	extends
i m not sure this is what you re trying to achieve as you set the ontouchlistener for the button - but if what you want to achieve is a swipeable activity e.g swipe the screen and the content of the screen changes you could try letting your activity extends the class posted below and then implements the next and previous methods with what ever actions you want

7334349
icmp	tcp
this will block until some tcp timeout has been reached in the case that the server is unreachable or an evil firewall in between is blocking icmp packets

i am wondering if vb6 has something similar to request.path in vb.net

7334837

ibatis	mybatis
currently working on upgrading from ibatis to mybatis

7334868
mockito	jmock
2 jmock or mockito these seem to me not to not really mock anything at all as most members will just remain null

mockito	jmock
don t know if jmock or mockito can actually call the propper initialization methods

7334879
google-chrome	firefox
clears the form in google-chrome but this did not work for firefox 6.x

free	malloc
the person object allocated by malloc will never be destroyed unless you explicitly call free on it hwich you haven t - so you have a memory leak

7334968
goto	break
the above mechanisms ensure that goto doesn t let you break the language

7334997
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in ie7 ie8 ie9 google-chrome firefox .

7335000
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc
of course to not let memory leaks slip in you have to free the strdup ed pointers just as with malloc

7335004
expander	grid
if you don t mind a little code-behind you could probably hook into the expanded collapsed events find the parent grid get the rowdefinition for the expander and set the value equal to if its expanded or auto if not

matlab	simulink
it is commonly used in control design where algorithms can be either matlab scripts formulas simulink blocks or embedded code in the form of so-called s-functions

7335070
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
note however that it s much easier to do such upgrades with requestfactory than with gwt-rpc because rf generates stable obfuscated names between builds that only depend on the interface or method name not on its signature or the type and number of fields in the class as in gwt-rpc

7335071

i want my ok button to behave like firefox in all the other browsers ie opera safari google-chrome how i can achieve this

7335083
free	malloc
you explicitly allocate storage for a person variable with the malloc call and that storage will remain allocated until someone deallocates is via free

7335113
cos	sin
to position the labels you may want to use a 3d engine or rotate them in a circle around your device x x+r cos y y+r sin and use a billboard effect

7335145
udp	tcp
one improvement on your code is to use udp instead of tcp sock_dgram instead of sock_stream

7335171
jwindow	jdialog
for swing gui is better create only once jframe and another top-level containers would be jdialog or jwindow un-decorated by default

7335192

7335380
subclass	abstract-class
when you use new to create a new instance of a subclass of an abstract-class the memory required for the base abstract-class will be allocated then as well

7335397
abstract-class	superclass
the variables in an abstract-class are allocated the same way as the variables of any other class which happens to be a superclass of the actual class being initialized - they live with the variables from the other classes in the hierarchy basically

remember to overwrite gethashcode when you implement equals otherwise it will produce strange results if you put your objects for example into a dictionary or hashtable as key

7336333

for distinct and many other linq features to work the class being compared barobject in your example must implement implement equals and gethashcode or alternatively provide a separate as an argument to distinct

7338612
post	put	submit	submission
the idea i got is to put an handler on the paginator that would call an ajax function that would submit the post into a dynamic php page for the sole purpose of saving the _post into forminv after submission of course i would have to modifiy the for action attribute via jquery to point to the dynamic page but the paginator already has a link that actually goes to the number of the page you click so is it possible to submit the form save the data into forminv and then proceed to the clicked page

7338618
crypt	hash	crypt	md5	hash	md5
a bunch of the passwords are stored as the md5 hash output from php s crypt function see the third example there

7338618
crypt	md5
the crypt md5 output seems to use a different alphabet than django s md5 support which appears to be using a hexdigest

7338618
hash	md5
there s a similar and unanswered question with an interesting potential solution to convert the php hash to a base-16 encoding but based on some initial poking it doesn t seem to produce a usable md5 hexdigest

7338618
crypt	md5
crypt is operating in md5 mode but it s some wacky danish translation of the md5 algorithm update it s md5-crypt

7338618
hash	salt
in python i need to be able to reproduce that hash or some regular derivation of it given the original password and salt

7338640

it all fits nicely on a 1280x800 tablet screens

7338782
post	get
i m new to struts2 coming from a php background where i d often have the same file handling get and post requests and processing a form if the request is a post request

7338782
post	get
which works fine but it bothers me that the url that handles post is different since now if the user reloads the page they get an error rather than simply seeing the contents of the get page

7338782
post	get
so my question is is there any way to tell struts2 to call one method if it s a get request and another method if it s a post request

7338784
google-chrome	firefox
according to quirksmode defining multiple backgrounds works in at least ie9 google-chrome and firefox 3.6

google-chrome	firefox
firefox 6 and google-chrome 13 however display only the fallback gradient-only background

7338837
kde	gnome
as mru correctly pointed out there is no standardized way under linux to determine the proxy so i guess the best solution is to check if the user is using linux and in that case try to get the proxy settings from http_proxy environment variable or from gconf for gnome or from kioslaverc kde

7338868
m2e	groovy-eclipse
if that is the case then you must install the newer version of the groovy-eclipse configurator for m2e

post	get
i get also two messages but only one piece of timing data appended to post content - identical to the one delivered by the first message

7339058
google-chrome	safari
in this case i m guessing that safari may handle your attempt to crowbar the layout into the page differently from google-chrome -- it s possible for example that it simply ignores the in the section because it s in a second and it s already seen one of those

7339072
public	protected
the concept of private protected public is somewhat alien to objective c even though access control is supported for member variables

my c is a bit rusty but didn t you have to use struct s unless you typedef it

each attribute has a unique name and should have a specific type that corresponds to a certain java type such as int string short double .

7339277
iframe	prettyphoto
yes i know you can load pages within an iframe element using prettyphoto jquery plugin prettyphoto

7339300
put	get
also in this case since your operation is at the end you could just put it in its own continuation and get the behavior you want

7339316
getter	setter
however the performselector withobject call is incorrect here because while the name of the getter is mysubview the setter would then be setmysubview

7339316
getter	setter
obviously i could manipulate the string to achieve this task but i d hope there is a cleaner and more stable way to access the getter and setter for the same ivar

7339318
getter	setter
i want eclipse to generate the getter and setter codes as

7339324
versioning	upgrade
failing that you could upgrade to a newer versioning of php

7339325
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby seems a little behind ironpython for now just imo so i think i m going to stick with testing my mvvm framework for wpf in ironpython for now

7339380
fileoutputstream	filewriter
you can use filewriter instead but i prefer to wrap a fileoutputstream in an outputstreamwriter as that way i can control the encoding

7339405
junit	testng
learning to use junit or testng will pay off in the long run but even a few ad-hoc print statements might help you for now

7339408
mp3	wav
i learned how to encode wav into an mp3 using lame_encode_buffer_interleaved from this question is there any lame c++ wraper simplifier working on linux mac and win from pure code

7339408
mp3	wav
now i want to decode the mp3 back into wav

7339408
mp3	wav
now can someone provide a simple working example on decoding an mp3 into a wav using lame in c c++

swing	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swt	windowbuilder
windowbuilder allows you to build swing swt and gwt user interfaces and windowtester allows you to test the user interfaces that you constructed

7339456
children	parent
use jquery s .children selector method where you give jquery a selector to operate on the children of the given parent element as such

7339465
put	get
if you wish to automate code reading but not morphing you can use linecache as shown in here and just instead of printing put it into a list and get whatever value you want

7339484
salt	md5
django s salt md5 algorithm uses a very simple algorithm md5 salt + password which is then encoded to hexidecimal

7339484
crypt	hash	crypt	md5	hash	md5
on the other hand the hash output by php s crypt which begin with are not simple md5 hash

7339484
hash	md5
this is much more complex and secure than a simple md5 hash

7339484
crypt	hash
while django does have code which called python s stdlib crypt function the way django mangles the hash means there s no easy way to get a hash beginning with all the way through django and into crypt

7339586
versioning	upgrade
while we look at restructuring the library to seperate the parts we can make common between them we are thinking about how we might reduce space on the disk while supporting versioning upgrade

7339586
google-chrome	firefox
my first thought was we allowadvertise and when firefox tries to load the dll as directed by google-chrome it will cause the install it doesn t seem to work

7339651
post	get
but it bothers me that the url that handles post is different since now if the user reloads the page they get an error rather than simply seeing the contents of the get page

7339651
post	get
look at the redirect after post or post redirect get pattern

7339681
yacc	bison
your flex lex and bison yacc files will tell me more about this problem

7339721
opera	google-chrome
works on google-chrome and opera but neither dolphin or the stock browser work

7339721
opera	google-chrome
works like a charm on google-chrome and opera but not on either of the mobile browsers i need it to work on

7339744
waitpid	fork
edit as stated in the comments you d rather make use of fork and exec then use waitpid 2 to correctly update status

7339747
spaces	delimiter
access can import a text file which uses spaces instead of commas as the delimiter

7339747
spaces	delimiter
click next and on the next wizard page select the radio button next to spaces under the choose the delimiter that separates your fields heading

7339834
button	checkbox
based on what you stated it s not the checkbox which will perform the postback but some other button so you can check your whole selection at once

7339856
factors	matrix
returns a matrix of integers indicating their row number in a matrix-like object or a factors indicating the row labels

7339873
mousemove	mouseleave
i created a mousemove and mouseleave handler for my dynamic submenu items

7339911
post	get
you can get more info from the blog post

7339935
range	minimum
put minimum and maximum attributes on a single upgradeversion element to specify a range

7339945
folder	dir
i am thinking perhaps the tc nunit runner is using some other dir as the main app execution folder and thus preventing from files that are actually residing next to the test dll to not load properly but cannot prove this claim yet.

7339951
min	max
once you have the binary non-black part of the image so just the object and not the background you just want to find the min max corners of each voxel

7340003
margin	height
all i am doing on the page is animating the height of the ad container and animating the top margin of the content div

7340053
versioning	upgrade
then i upgrade the hosted versioning to a bundle versioning 2.0 and perform the same download again the app upgrade and launches without problems

7340067
google-chrome	firefox
tag is already supported by at least current versions of firefox and google-chrome

7340112
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
an idea to help you track the problem as you don t share the link you can easily just share the first page is to use safari google-chrome or even firefox and make them act as an iphone so you can use their inspector firebug to track the problem

7340133
superclass	subclassing
2 - why subclassing why not a superclass

7340140
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a page with linqdatasource and a gridview

7340152
int	chars
the c++ is interpreted as an int8 result and in c# it s simply interpreted as a positive int int is 32 bit an truncating to 16 by casting to chars doesn t affect the sign in this case

7340156
distance	polygons
do a comparison on those distance and then based on those comparisons narrow it down to the minimally far away line segment of the polygons

7340173
hash	md5
for the sake of saving 12 bytes per item that you are generating a hash for i would still suggest something like md5 which is know to work is probably better than rolling your own.

7340186
width	margin
it s expected behavior - you re using fixed-size margins and paddings which means that at a certain point the total 50px of padding and margin from your two columns will be greater than the 5 of width that your columns don t take up and will bump into each other

7340193
post	get
another note it may also be a good idea to use the method post instead of get as it s more secure however you may have reasons to be using get but it s just a heads up

7340213
superclass	subclassing
all of this can be summarized by saying that a subclassing has to behave as if it was a superclass

7340246
addclass	removeclass
when using removeclass and addclass do not include the dot

7340270
superclass	subclassing
2 - why subclassing why not a superclass

7340272
addclass	removeclass
your class name is heart so your selectors are correct but when you use the addclass removeclass and toggleclass methods use the actual class name addclass heart

7340283
button	checkbox
for radio button we use an array filter so if you really want checkbox and you really want they to all be the same name then try

7340325
google-chrome	firefox
only tested in the latest firefox and google-chrome

7340347
getter	setter
then getter and setter make no sense and moreover i write some code in setter method

7340347
getter	setter
i read in a book enterprise flex with blazeds by brain telintelo chapter 15 that out of box blazeds only serializes fileds that have matching getter and setter

7340347
getter	setter
can some body please explain how normal serializtion not amf serializtion takes place and keeps track of private transient variables even though they have public getter and setter

7340397
dbcontext	objectcontext
i can see the objectcontext in the debugger but can t find the dbcontext

7340523
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example exposing an api which could be essentially accessed in the same manner you describe but respond to more http verbs other than get post head put delete

7340524
ant	maven
it looks like you re making use of maven ant tasks

7340540
hide	show
part of the code in hopes of getting the demo page s scrollbar to show up vertical but all it did was hide the horizontal scrollbar that was already there and now i just have a blank page

7340568
opera	firefox
however in ie and newer versions of firefox and opera you can do so by calling the element s native dom method .click directly like this

7340578
put	get
i am using an asihttprequest method to connect to my php script that calls requests data from the database from there i initiate the nsxmlparser delegates everything seems to work fine i can even nslog the results as they get parsed however it seems that when i try to put these results into a nsmutablearray the results dont seem to want to go into it

7340615
hash	md5
as soon as i changed it to md5 hash it worked

7340655
hide	show
i need to hide a div and only show it when a file is selected

7340784
centos	linux
i use linux centos with openssl-devel.i386 0.9.8e-12.el5_5.7

7340790
opera	firefox
edit in ie and newer versions of firefox and opera you can use the native dom method .click to simulate an actual click on the link

7340798
hide	show
i have a ssrs 2008 report in which i have created 5 parameter so that whenever i preview the report it show 5 drop down to select values based on which report is generated.now i want that when i preview the report there should be a check box like something so that i am able to show or hide the drop down list

7340800
direct3d	direct2d
i believe it would also be possible to do this with just direct3d no use of direct2d and just have a simple vertex for each pixel and draw it in orthogonal view

7340815
width	height
launching various sample apps from xna 4.0 and vs express 2010 for windows phone they tend to be 854 for the default width and 480 for the default height

7340818
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked set-cookie

7340822
innodb	myisam
having both full text searches and foreign key contraints which are good for joins is a hassle for mysql as they are only supported by myisam and innodb engines respectively

7340836
maven	pom.xml
if you are a maven purist and i ll risk a claim you might be you could add the ep-commons to a section of the root pom.xml but that will only save you one line in each pom.xml for version

7340839
post	get
so how to get this post s comment

7340839
post	get
how can i get this post id

7340860
dbcontext	objectcontext
so you could try this to create a dbcontext wrapping the objectcontext which you retrieved from your proxy create an appropriate constructor for your derived context.

7340863
superclass	subclassing
an alternative solution is to store a boolean on your superclass which indicates whether the object requires iap and then always set this to yes for one subclassing and no for all others

7340881
put	get
so if you put a 4 entry input you ll get a 13 entry output

7340899
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	show	hide	fadeout
you should use fadein docs and fadeout docs instead because those will also hide show the element as well

7340904
post	get
this can be done by either making the ajax call through an ajax object which then references other objects or you can take an easy approach and simply set an extra post or get field which indicates an ajax call

7340907
put	get
there s no cost to get started or to put your apps on your own device other than actually having an android device

7340942
portrait	landscape
the app supports only portrait mode thus in default landscape mode of the emulator it s rotated by 90â as on android 2.2

7341034
post	put
so my second approach was to put the html into a hidden form set the form s target to the new window and post the form

7341048
multiplying	subtract
then you can divide the rest of the days remaining by 7 multiplying that number by 2 and subtract to the days

7341052
put	get
where i put the comment i need to get another attribute c.attribute objective

7341072
avr	microcontroller
currently commands are sent over a serial interface to an avr microcontroller

7341101
move	drag
i ve managed the drag and drop functionality but need to persist the text in the text boxes once the program is shut down so that when reopened the last location of all move text is still present

7341111
post	get
all get and post data must be treated as malicious

7341113
vim	notepad++
here is one example of exactly this but of course it doesn t cover several of the programs that i use extensively myself which include vim sed notepad++ eclipse and believe it or not ms word at least version 2010 i suspect 2007 also has this they call it wildcards has a simple regex implementation too

7341116
srp	principles
stuffing all the actions in a single controller is a bad practice imho and violates a couple of principles like restful routing and srp

7341149
jquery	simplemodal
this can be achieved quite easily with jquery and simplemodal

7341170
ssl	https
when you connect to an https server you can trust that the server is the owner of that certificate because the server must be holding the private key and hopefully nobody else has it because otherwise the ssl connection is not possible

7341174
udp	rtp
you could make your software send midi events using midi rtp or midi udp so you don t care about the driver os

7341184
post	get
you can get a list of feed post and then you could issue an http delete to the item you want to delete like

7341191
width	height
the div#main is set to height and width similar to div#u-button and set overflow to hidden

7341200
google-chrome	firefox
i went ahead and continued developing my script in google-chrome seems it seemed i got further than in firefox

7341200
put	get
it was easier just to re-use the getscript function to also get jqueryui and put the alert in a function called from the callback

7341226
wordpress	joomla
the web is filled with wordpress tutorials but finding a good article for joomla is extremely hard

7341239
min	max
if you want to replace more than one then you would have to add the g flag and change the regex slightly for min match instead of max match to this

7341240
nvda	narrator
also keep in mind that narrator is a basic screenreader most users will actually be using something like jaws which costs 800 or so or nvda free

7341276
int	double
am thinking a double can be converted to two int and submitted together

7341286
post	get
any external received from get post file etc

7341318
width	height
i am trying to accurately capture the window height and width of a mobile browser when the orientation changes but in android i m testing - when the orientation listener fires and the function is called to capture the window height and width the new size has not yet accurately been reflected so i end up having to call an arbitrary delay to get things to register their proper size

7341341
int	double
you might as well just convert your double to an int in actionscript

7341341
int	double
you won t lose any accuracy because in actionscript double and int have the same bit depth

7341343
carrierwave	fog
i m using carrierwave with fog to handle thumbnail uploads for an app hosted on heroku and the image urls don t seem to be generating properly

7341364
width	height
their layout height is set to wrap_content and layout width ist match_parent

7341372
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome when my form is displayed it correctly shows the watermark everytime

7341375
mouseover	mousemove
you should get click mousemove mouseover etc

7341380
spaces	linefeed
the first renders converts the characters from ascii to ebcdic so you can see what they are the second goes through and pads out lines so that linefeed markers are replaced with enough spaces to reach the record length

7341404
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a cfform with two submit buttons the logic in my action page works perfectly fine with safari google-chrome firefox and ie9

7341442
min	max
using mike s max min trick we can make previous next jumps for all sorts of things

7341442
min	max
the trick is we can previous next # of whatever s with max min and a jump function

7341446
administration	activation
with the components services administration tool formerly known as dcom config you can change the activation configuration to use the currently logged on user and the dllhost.exe instance will run in the active window station

7341464
hide	show
sounds like this was an animation focused questions you wanted a smooth show hide type of animation

7341464
fadein	fadeout
imo you actually should use fadein or fadeout for ultimate smootheness imo

7341464
hide	show
but you can set the time on the show hide if that is what you really prefer

7341469
factors	mean
the advantage of this approach is that by tweaking the underlying distribution and its parameters mean and variance in the case of a normal distribution you can fine-tune to what extent the agility measure factors in

7341477
photoshop	fireworks
i m thinking of developing an application with adobe flash cs4 but i m having some serious quality issues when importing material from photoshop cs4 and adobe fireworks cs4

7341492
google-chrome	firefox
the web service is called in google-chrome and firefox without any problems no matter how many times i call it

7341550
put	get
if your wondering about the try and catch in the coursexml object s title getter method i put that there so if you try and access any of the _xml property s members before the xml file is loaded and assigned to it you don t get a nasty typeerror

7341581
put	get
if i cannot put the library in the git repository this means i may have to do manual tinkering just to get a specific commit version of my programs to work again

7341598
inherited	properties
when i serialize the derived class all of its properties are serialized but the properties it inherited from the base class are not

7341622
udp	tcp
if you are going to implement this on a lan or possibly even over the internet it is worth considering udp over tcp - in a chat application it is not usually absolutely mission critical that messages arrive in the right order and even if it was users would probably not be able to type faster than the variations in network latency probably 100ms

7341622
udp	tcp	udp	tftp	tftp	tcp
then for file transfers you could either negotiate a seperate tcp socket for the data exchange like ftp or implement some kind of udp ack system like tftp

7341635
qgraphicsview	qgraphicstextitem
if i want to place one letter a qgraphicstextitem in a qgraphicsview is there any way i can set the text to display in the middle of the coordinates i specify

7341638
put	get
if i put that extra there they get lined up where i want them but i have to go back and delete it obviously then reindent the nil

7341648
cdr	cons
it comprises cons cells or dotted pairs which each have two slots traditionally named car and cdr

7341648
cdr	cons
the car slot points to the value and the cdr points to the next cons pair

7341648
cdr	cons
works is to find the last cons the one whose cdr is pointing to and change its cdr to point to the list you re appending

7341662
move	drag
what i would like to do is enable the user to drag and drop specific layout elements divs which would theoretically move the blocks of the design around

7341667
inherited	properties
so one would think that i d inherited the styles from the bluesky skin where relevant and then since i m specifying a style class any properties mentioned in the custom style sheet would be overridden

7341674
getter	setter
if you have an arraylist you wish to have accessible throughout the system you can place a holder arraylist in the application class and provide getter and setter so that they system can utilize it globally

7341691
gif	png
set the compression to lossless png gif

7341692
profiling	debugging
i know this sounds like global variables and thus evil but i need this to control profiling and debugging and to set the backend the package can use a variety of external program to do its thing and i call them backends

7341705
width	height
width was returned as 320 while height got set to 533

7341705
width	height
when i toast the variables width and height the returned dimensions are 320 wide and 533 tall meaning that nothing changed

7341716
firefox	safari
this only happens in firefox 6.0.2 and safari in a windows vista machine

7341716
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with google-chrome on the same machine but not firefox and safari

7341720
super	extends
if droidgap isn t actually extends webview and is instead just passing along what you give it in loadurl to a private webview object contained inside it then using super is not going to work

7341759
nstableview	nssplitview
what i ve done i have a nssplitview with a nstableview

7341781
post	put
my intent was not to put code in page_load for the message wuc_pagemessage control because i wanted to be able to call a method to post the message during the component load of wuc_lookup

7341789
post	get
generally i ve read many time you should do ajax calls as get requests not post because post produces more overhead and traffic

7341803
hide	show
when the icon for the div is clicked it toggles to show hide and i wanna be able to click and drag it over a web page

7341803
hide	show
later on this will be helpful for calculators stopwatches etc but i can t seem to figure out how to have the div show hide nor how to be able to drag it

7341816
put	get
when i try to use put or delete i get a 401 unauthorized access is denied due to invalid credentials

7341826
getter	setter
note that unless you have declared public properties you ll have to use your getter setter methods

7341829
post	get
i am trying to post an album to picasa but always get bad request response

7341830
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have an ios app that it has a maincontrollerview there i create a uinavigationcontroller and then i push into that uinavcontroller a new uiviewcontroller called firstviewcontroller and other views

7341838
listview	gridview
by pressing button in gridview i need to find control in listview

7341852
post	get
if for example i got so submit a new post the browser hangs and in the terminal i get

7341871
background-color	transparency
if it is sufficient to override only the background color of your links background-color transparency instead of background transparency could do the trick but i guess you might have thought of that already

7341872
screens	tablet
is there a way to force the tablet and desktop to keep the mobile dimensions and look like a mobile app on those screens

7341900
serializable	deserialization
i want to generate a serializable assembly or .cs file to serializable my types using xmlattributeoverrides and then reference this assembly .cs file in my project directly rather than use xmlserializer to perform xml serializable deserialization

7341900
serializable	deserialization
to be clear i can t just use sgen.exe because that only generates assemblies that perform the default xml serializable deserialization

7341908
folder	directory
however my understanding is that the makefile project folder would first have to be copied into scons build directory since the build process should not be changing anything in the source tree

7341919
accessor	properties
however if you declare the properties you also need to synthesize the accessor

7341927
fancybox	colorbox
i suggest fancybox or colorbox for what you re trying to do

7341936
glut	lwjgl
ignore the glut wgl and glx stuff because that stuff is handled by the lwjgl classes

7341943
getter	setter
the getter setter for this property are generated using synthesize viewcontroller and all seems well

7341943
getter	setter
in order to figure out what is going on i overrode the getter and setter as follows

7341993
nsstring	nsxmlparser
this nsstring category uses the nsxmlparser to accurately remove any html tags from an nsstring

7342025
cos	sin
tan-1 tan ï cos î - cotan î sin î sec ï

7342026
onresume	onpause
- increment the value in the onresume method and decrement it in the onpause method

7342081
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
yes it is supported in google-chrome and internet explorer as well as later versions of firefox and opera

7342091
pull	push
enqueue a pull task with the data and have a regular push task or a backend consume the queue and batch-and-insert into the datastore

7342105
hide	show
alternatively you could capture all pages show hide functionality and work out some logic for those pages there

7342126
put	get
either put all the file names in an index file and iterate over that file or get a list of files by using readdir or preferably a library boost to do it for you

7342163
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i have some inputs which will add multiplying subtract divide etc in a calculator format

7342175
folder	directory
my issue is that when i perform a build the source code directory tree cannot be accessed to delete the target folder during the clean phase

7342211
post	get
even if you query the like table for the current user you only get a list of post videos shared by friends that have been liked by the current user

7342257
children	parent
this include deletion of its parent or children items if it is a lookup field

7342309
free	malloc
if your second malloc fails you should free the result of the first malloc

7342351
getter	setter
setting the property makes it accessible outside the class and the synthesizer sets up the getter and setter but it doesn t alloc and init it

7342354
getter	setter
in objc synthesize does not initialize variables - just generates a getter and a setter method

7342365
mouse	keyboard
my problem is that the change -event listener is not only fired when an item is clicked by mouse but also when arrow keys on the keyboard are pressed

7342423
width	height
we would like to set the height and width of the textboxfor wherever we have used for that we have done this

7342427
superclass	subclassing
in a subclassing of a hierarchy masks completely the superclass s namedqueries declaration

7342458
listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview
a detailsview is used to tackle with one row at a time so you can directly call findcontrol on the detailsview but gridview and listview are meant to display multiple records and your markup you define inside is just a template for each row

7342472
force.com	salesforce
we have sales cloud in salesforce and planning to migrate more applications to force.com platform salesforce in the coming years

if you really need to hide show them then try adding removing them in code instead of in xaml - see some sample code for adding in and for modifying in

i figured there would be template tags like wordpress or something similar that would give me complete control of my html but with joomla everything just gets rendered as complete components with html and css all set in

mouseover and mouseout a triggered when you enter leave a child of the element maybe that s the effect you are seeing

7349374
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
an other problem is that you are binding the handler to both mouseover and mouseenter and mouseleave and mouseout

7349374
mouseleave	mouseenter
only bind to mouseenter and mouseleave

7349412
width	height
i have experienced that setting the width or height depending on which direction you want your layouts to span to 0 can be usefull from time to time

7349428
uipagecontrol	subviews
9 when i experimented and switch the addsubview to any other view my app would not crash so that was mildly encouraging so i tried removing the only elements activity indicator and uiwebview and uipagecontrol that were unique to the actual view i wanted to add as a subviews on the vague theory that some small element was corrupted in my xcode setup

7349645
equals	gethashcode
if you haven t go ahead and override equals for each of your types as well they can inherit your implementation of gethashcode if you like or have new ones and there you can make sure that the type of the compare-to object are the same before declaring them equals

7349645
equals	gethashcode
and make sure equals and gethashcode are always implemented so that

7349645
equals	gethashcode
objects that are equals must have same gethashcode results

7349645
equals	gethashcode
objects with different gethashcode must not be equals

7349663
equals	gethashcode
this means that whever you implement gethashcode you should also implement equals and check that the types match

7349663
equals	gethashcode
similarly whenever you implement equals you should also implement gethashcode

7349755
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

7350458
wordpress	joomla
first of all just to clear it up the joomla templating is a proper templating engine where as wordpress is not it s not even a cms - check their website this is often construed as poor coding rather than best practice as it s more of a steep learning curve

7350480

7350495
ienumerable	ienumerator
i understand they are contracts and i understand how ienumerable and ienumerator work - or so i think

7350501

if you really want to guarantee that users call super it would be better to make the super class abstract clearly designate an abstract implementation method for them to override and have the super control the flow of execution

7350505
archetypes	dexterity
just as with archetypes image fields a set of predefined scales are automatically available in dexterity

7350516
namenode	hdfs
if you store your images on hdfs and only keep a path in hbase you will have to ensure that you will not have too many images as hdfs does not deal well with a lot of files depends on the size of ram allocated to your namenode but there is still an upper limit

7350516

int	chars
therefore since the chars take up 2 bytes there are two unused bytes between it and the first unsigned int

int	chars
it is a coincidence that int is aligned on 4 bytes and chars is aligned on 1 byte

for-loop	loops	int	boolean
i got the message and the problem is solved but i would like to asume that using switch within a for-loop isn t a god idea because i heard from lot of developer s i should break from loops in the moment when i get the desired result so using switch need s extra boolean or push the int i value to 50 direclty but what would happen if we re using while loops

you can use goto in order to break out of the loop within the switch

mouseover	mouseout
i would use hover since it will handle mouseout as well as mouseover

7353339

since i use mousedown i would also use mouseup to change the img back

7353339
mouseup	mousedown
then on mousedown and mouseup change the css classes to achieve the desired effects

7353348
mouseover	mousedown
bind to mouseover out and mousedown up and save the states so the mouseout-event won t remove the brown icon while the mousebutton is still down

7353358
google-chrome	firefox
btw this problem only occurs in ie - firefox google-chrome work fine in all scenarios

7353368

7353870
fadein	fadeout
this is because empty is called before fadeout is finished now using this method empty append and fadein will be valled after fadeout is finished

7353944
width	margin

maven-install-plugin	pom.xml
i cannot add them to the corporate repository so i have created a repository that is local to this project and i have added these jars to that repository using maven-install-plugin install-file and setup the repository entry in the pom.xml file so it knows to search the local repository

maven	pom.xml
update the dependency in the maven pom.xml of the web app

7354657
opera	firefox
i tested the map app as local files where it just worked as intended but when i uploaded the application to a web server the browsers failed to load the css from the server - firefox shows an unstyled version of the svg while opera shows nothing at all and says it is still loading element 2 2

7354680
postgresql	mysql
postgresql 9 specifically states that there is no performance difference among these three types but afaik there are some differences in mysql so this is something to keep in mind

i don t have much experience with javascript but i ve managed to validate my form with both client-side and server-side validation except for the recaptcha field

client-side	server-side
the problem is that if i fill in the code correctly and press submit the client-side verification returns succes but the server-side validation always returns wrong

i noticed that even if i set the orientation of the activity to portrait mode when the app store dialog pop-up shows up the activity can still change orientations

7355036

i think the better way is to become familiar with rails and ruby and only then dive into tdd bdd with test unit or minitest or rspec cucumber or a lot of other testing techniques

7355040
addition	modulo
if we examine the situation where n is 2 we can see that using xor does exactly this bitwise addition modulo 2

win64	windows
if you want to get really down and dirty with win64 assembly you ll probably want to go ahead and just use the windows api leaving out msvcrt.dll

7355201
binutils	bfd
use the bfd library or try to grok the source code from binutils to parse the elf core format

7355219

if you look at linearlayout and abslistview the parent of gridview source you ll see they convert their children layout params to linearslayout.layoutparams and abslistview.layoutparams respectively

7355341
mouseleave	mouseenter

7355350
hash	salt
you password should be stored as at least a sha1 hash along with a random salt in the database

7355353

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
without changes to the test case the behavior is the same in opera firefox and google-chrome except the google-chrome bugs

7357192
google-chrome	firefox
on the other hand firefox and google-chrome both clear the custom validation error and close the validation error message bug

7357207
post	get
you could create a column in the database to store unix timestamps for the times of the post and then sort by this column if your asking how to get the most recent post first

7357218
ant	maven
the way i understand the question the website maven project depends on the ant sharedlibrariesresource project

7357218
ant	maven
install sharedlibrariesresource to your local maven repository each time ant builds it

7357218
ant	maven
we can use maven ant tasks to achieve the first

7357227
imageview	imageswitcher
you can set the animations to the imageswitcher only imageview is only used to display a single image

7357267
int	boolean
is false - the first is an int the second is a boolean

7357298

if you have a grid of tiles then given a mouse position you can retrieve the x and y index of the tile by dividing the x mouse position by the width of a tile and y position with the height and flooring both

7357324
public	protected
you could reverse it if you wish but the key point is that you have one set of methods to access at a public privilege and another to access at a protected privilege level

7357334
titlebar	window
i think there is an article on the devexpress suport that might help you - unable to change report preview window titlebar caption

unfortunately this results in an object references an unsaved transient instances error because the cascade from parent to desk hasn t resulted in the new desk object being persistent yet

7357439
hide	show
you can hide show it at will etc

7357471
textview	imageview
according to the android documentation the default orientation of the linearlayout is horizontal which means your imageview and textview are in one line

7357572
google-chrome	firefox
the yahoo pingbox on my site appears in google-chrome but not in firefox currently i ve 3.6

7357600
free	malloc
it is an error to pass to free anything not coming from malloc

7357609
free	malloc
you can t free that since it wasn t malloc ed in the first place

7357623
free	malloc
you are reassigning s from the malloc d pointer to a constant string literal which you then try to free

7357623
free	malloc
as the string literal was not allocated with malloc free ing it unsurprisingly leads to bad things

7357623
free	malloc
if you re using c++ then you should be using new delete rather than malloc free

7357647
kerberos	ntlm
normally when you configure to use windows authentication you are asking to use spnego which means using kerberos whenever possible and then fall back to ntlm if kerberos fails

7357647
kerberos	ntlm
ie7 stops at kerberos in certain cases but not falling back to ntlm

7357647
google-chrome	firefox	kerberos	ntlm
i guess firefox and google-chrome works because they are using ntlm but not kerberos

7357682
ready	each
i have everything ready just cannot get how to position those sites beside each other

7357696
inherited	properties	public	protected
it does also require a default public constructor but thanks to the protected setter on the name properties only code running in the inherited hierarchy can set the name so if an instance appeared without a name you know that someone is doing something wrong

7357705
move	drag
now note how the rectangles are rendered correctly but as soon as you drag one they fly off to the top left corner and cannot be move anymore

7357850
superclass	subclassing
this situation is called field hiding - the subclassing field output is hiding the field of the same name in the superclass

7357850
superclass	subclassing
in both your superclass and your subclassing

7357850
superclass	subclassing
references to output in the subclassing will be to its field but you re setting output in the superclass - the subclassing field will remain null

7357850
superclass	subclassing
change the declaration of output in the superclass to protected so the subclassing can access it

7357888
int	chars
it s not clear why it s int rather than chars admittedly - it would make sense if you could use this to send non-bmp chars but the documentation states

7357888
int	chars
the chars to be written is contained in the 16 low-order bits of the given int value

7357970
folder	directory
after that copy the following files from the app folder keeping the directory structure intact and run on any windows machine which has the air framework installed

7358027
maven	m2e
if you use the embedded m2e maven installation maven has no information to your settings

7358027
maven	m2e
m2e can only use the proxy set in your maven settings file not the one in your eclipse environment

7358042
hide	show
instead i have a 2-3 second delay then the overlay hide and the data show

7358044
mvp	presenter
with mvp validation is supposed to take place in the presenter implementations as they have access to your view instances during postbacks

7358055
width	height
where 280 is the width and 680 is the height you would take the original height of the scrollview here it is 340 and multiply it by the number of pages you want

7358067
hide	show
you can use differnt div tags and show hide them using

7358079

nhibernate	queryover
now i m fairly new to nhibernate 3.0 and queryover and i have a bit of a problem translating this sql query to c# code

7358324
pull	push
you might want to include both machinesâ public keys in githubâ s repository configuration so you can push and pull without a password

7358347
width	height
here i got class name imageview height x width but

7358359
getter	setter
i prefer readxxxx over getxxxx because getxxx may refer to getter setter methods of bean and may create confusion in maintenance of code

7358369
submit	submission
as it looks like you re firing an asynchronous request in the submit event handler rather than using the default form behaviour i would suggest disabling the checkbox or removing the event handler in the submit event handler and then re-enabling it in the success callback of the get method to prevent the user from submission repeatedly

7358378
firefox	safari
currently i am facing a design issue in firefox and safari

7358378
firefox	safari
it looks right in firefox but in safari it takes some space from the top

7358489
opera	firefox
i confirmed opera 11.50 worked as your expectation but firefox 6 and

7358534
spaces	delimiter
as you can see i have to deal with different delimiter newline spaces and comma as well as making sure that when reading in strings it respects the inverted commas as well as forgets them they don t end up as part of the resulting string

7358539
jar	.war
is it possible to have tag files sample.tag inside a jar archive instead of the web-inf of the .war archive

7358553
width	height
i mean by center the center in the width and the center in the height

7358555
nsurlcache	uiwebview
i have built a class that intercepts uiwebview resource loading by subclassing nsurlcache and overriding cachedresponseforrequest similar to this example

7358568
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel
another option is the qlistview or other derivate from qabstractitemview but i can t find how to pass a widget as a qlistitemmodel or other reimplemented qabstractitemmodel

7358603
integer	unsigned
so 32 bit unsigned integer would do well

7358631
folder	directory
directory is set in filebrowser.settings by default to uploads does this folder exist inside your media root

7358677
put	get
you can also add service references which also get put under their own special folder

7358682
ready	each
each data fetch takes too long to load inline so it s preferred to have data ready for them when they come

7358684
width	height
it will grow in width height

7358689
wav	flac	flac	wma
i also tried wav flac wma -- same result

7358706
hash	salt
if a salt value is used then it would be extremely difficult for a hacker to get the actual password even if she has access to the hash password

7358746
put	get
now you get all sort of problems if you put ehcache.jar in tomcat s lib it will work as expected

7358775
sorting	filtering
one example being that there isn t a full featured treetable component which can do sorting and filtering searching

7358775
awt	swing
it is not related to swing and awt at all

7358775
sorting	filtering
but i don t think they support sorting and filtering out of the box

7358775
sorting	filtering
but the treetable does not support filtering and sorting as far as i know

7358775
awt	swing
it renders ui using java2d thus minimizing the impact of imo bloated legacies of swing and awt

7358798
put	get
can someone pls tell me how to put my programs together so that i can get my application running

7358832
maven	pom.xml
in the end it was wrong case in some of my maven pom.xml tags that caused the error

7358841
cos	sin
there is also a chance that mentioned sun forums thread was migrated to this one sin cos with cldc

7358841
cos	atan2	cos	sin	atan2	sin
of functions mentioned in question sin cos tan are there asin acos atan atan2 aren t

7358853
children	parent
so that s why i need to get all of the children for each parent cat.

7358915
put	get
to get the every bit of performance you could also try passing actual objects created using document.createelement to the append function instead of strings that obviously have to be parsed in order to get list of the elements you want to put in the dom

7358918
awt	swing
it renders ui using java2d thus minimizing the impact of imo bloated legacies of swing and awt

7358924
swt	swing
the other option is swt together with the eclipse rcp but it s harder though not impossible to integrate pure swing components into such an application

7358934
hex	binary
if i had to pack raw binary data into a text file personally i d probably go for base-64 rather than hex it will be shorter but either is fine

7358940
width	margin
in resharper | options | languages | c# | formatting style | line breaks and wrapping under line wrapping there is an entry right margin columns - adjust this upwards to match the width you want resharper to wrap to

7358950
codeigniter	cakephp
and stay away from framework cakephp and codeigniter which others will no doubt advertise

7359118
awt	swing
excluding awt and javafx are all of your desribed frameworks are based on swing if you ll start with swing then you d be understand clearly for all these swing s based frameworks

7359132
children	parent
i can create decent estimates but need to adjust them so they conform to known parent children across all dimensions and levels this is much harder than it sounds

7359171
profiler	visualvm
use a profiler like visualvm to show the memory usage of your program

7359193
versioning	upgrade
to manually update certain package to your desired versioning either upgrade downgrade remove the versioning that comes along with ubuntu and download from developer

7359195
onresume	onpause
then in the onresume onpause i handle registering and unregistering the receiver

7359206
filesystems	ntfs
you should also investigate transactional ntfs to ensure your db and filesystems stay in sync

7359231
jgrowl	thickbox
both works as expected except when the jgrowl is shown first than the thickbox

7359284
int	chars
inavalid types int chars for aaray subscript

7359303
width	height
i define the height and width in the parameters

7359345
pull	push
pop3 is what you can use for retrieving mail but it does not have support for push either so you would have to pull for mail

7359366
glfw	freeglut
the results did not differ between the windows toolkits freeglut and glfw

7359370
put	get	prerequisites	uninstaller
the purpose of the setup is to set up the environment in which your project will run check if the necessary prerequisites are met check license put the executable into some standard folder somewhere in programfiles get the necessary configuration most notably for all users only for this user set up shortcuts and the uninstaller which should be able to revert all that

7359427

how would i get the height and width of a video from ffmpeg s information output

7362142

7362150
min	max
plot data.dat u 1 2 #to get the max and min value

7362222
hash	md5
basically you can use some other tools than perl to compute md5 hash of the word.

7362229
hash	md5
why is the same input returning two different md5 hash

7362264
globalization	localization
you definitely should take a look at the msdn article series on globalization and localization

7362264

asp.net globalization and localization

7362310
versioning	upgrade
would it be possible to control the updates if we didn t want to upgrade to a certain patch versioning of mysql

7362338
width	height
i assume when you say it isn t displaying the same as your screen size you are talking about the height and not width

7362338
width	height
in your style tag you have the height set to 417px if you want the div to fill the entire screen you need to set this to 100 just like the width part is

7362340
width	height
when a div with fixed height s content ends up getting larger than the div we need a scroll bar but the scrollbar takes out some width and thus a horizontal bar is added to

7362355
wadl	wsdl
unlike wsdl and mex for soap there s no widely used metadata format for rest endpoints wadl is one of them but it s not much used and not implemented by wcf so on the add service reference or svcutil will only see one endpoint in the metadata and only that one will be created

7362355
webclient	httpwebrequest
your webhttbinding -endpoint will do that return json or xml based on the incoming request since you enabled auto format selection but the way you d consume this service doesn t need to be with a wcf client - using webclient httpwebrequest should work out just fine

7362395
int	chars
this method first writes the length of the string as a utf-7 encoded unsigned int and then writes that many chars to the stream by using the binarywriter instance s current encoding

7362399
hash	salt
the authentication token should be something strong and verifiable hash a combination of the user ip + browser + rotating salt + some other things you can check for

7362429

so now i want to know how can i get the height and width of this special image

7362486
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve created a form form website page that works perfectly on ie8 google-chrome firefox safari opera and seamonkey but not when i m using the compatibilty view to emulate ie7

7362502
post	get
most of the time it s more ideal to use the post redirect get pattern so that users are presented with a resource who s state is not dependent on a server post

7362530
width	height
this is not working you better change the image size for depend upon the device screen height and width

7362537
emitmapper	automapper
i can t use automapper emitmapper or any other external packages

7362566
mouseover	mouseout
i ve tried binding a hover event for all delete buttons that unbinds the row click on mouseover and rebinds it on mouseout like this pseudocode below

7362580
width	height
you need to unclick the conserver les proportions checkbox that will let you specify height and width without photoshop doing any automatic scaling

7362592
salt	md5
i thought that when salt is used md5 is computed from concatenation string + salt

7362620
google-chrome	firefox
note that the behavior is consistent across google-chrome firefox and ie

7362631
inherited	properties
hiding a method call in what others would expect to be an inherited properties isn t a readable or maintainable approach

7362639
freemarker	velocity
for traditional mvc you still have plain jsp jstl velocity and freemarker

7362653
post	put
hence i can issue a post request which would be treated as a put request inside the rest engine

7362696
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you need to implement the java.io.serializable interface and write and read to and from the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream classes to store and retrieve data respectively

7362756
nexus	artifactory
i would highly recommend you consider setting up you own local instance of nexus or artifactory or archiva ...

7362770
width	height
let s say i would like to extract the width height using the following regexp

7362815
width	height
you might also need to play with the the height width of the webbrowser to specify the initial size

7362889
return-type	return-value
first the function signature of openfile has a return-type of void yet you check for a return-value here

7362889
free	realloc
third you can t call free filedata in func1 since you by calling realloc inside your func2 function have changed the value of where the memory is pointing and you are not passing the actual memory address for the original filedata variable by reference to your func2 function

7362889
realloc	malloc
in other words if the call to malloc in func1 returned a value of let s say 0x10000 and you called realloc on that allocated memory somewhere else in the code the memory that was allocated at 0x10000 has now moved somewhere else but the value of filedata in the context of the local scope of func1 is still 0x10000

7362889
free	realloc
then when you call realloc anywhere else you are actually modifying the value of filedata as it was allocated in func1 as well and can call free on that pointer

7362924
google-chrome	firefox
this code successfully opens a print dialog in both firefox and google-chrome

i m currently working with websockets and a php server it works very well with google-chrome and opera but not with firefox 6

7363095

7363511
width	height
i m not sure if you problem is the same as mine but i found that accessing the width or height property of a normal django imagefield would read the file from the storage backend load it into pil and return the dimensions from there

7363511
width	height
was opened to address this but the django devs closed as wontfix because they want the width and height properties to always return the true values

7363558
width	height
width and height of the browser window and outputs the width and

7363572
versioning	upgrade
when we deploy our framework.dll as framework.1.0.nupkg and want to upgrade the framework is there a way to set in our projects to use the highest versioning or will nuget do that already

7363666
onresume	onpause
what happens to a processes threads when the os enters the onstart onstop and onresume onpause sequences

7363667
postgresql	mysql
usually same as i do in mysql postgresql i stores dates in int mysql post or text sqlite to store them in the timestamp format

7363668
uitableview	reloaddata
so unless every cell height is the same then when a uitableview is created and whenever you send it a reloaddata message the datasource is sent one heightforrowatindexpath message for each cell

7363668
uitableview	reloaddata
in that case when created and when you send it a reloaddata message the uitableview will send one cellforrowatindexpath message per visible row that message gets sent six times

7363682
memcpy	strcpy
if you want to copy the contents of one array to another you need to use a library function like strcpy or memcpy

7363703

7365850
width	height
when i ve added this code no setting on width and height works

7365871

im experimenting with windowbuilder for eclipse and swing

7366215

7366216
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine for us in google-chrome and firefox

7366231
dictionary	map
i m tempted to write this as a class dictionary since the keys are constant but since the keys map to attributes of an instance ie cols self.width this doesn t compile

7366238
serializable	deserialization
if you are concerned about performance with web services consuming and producing you might want to research alternative web service packages and replacing the xml serializable deserialization bits

7366356
google-chrome	firefox

spaces	delimiter
an alternative solution is to try and match the format of the date instead of using so you no longer rely on the double spaces as a delimiter

7366398

however instead of using up half the array as show in the code below it can be enhanced by using a better algorithm where you hide the value in the index array

7366499
installation	upgrade
also indy is open-source so you can upgrade an indy installation using source code from indy s public access svn server or mirror

7366504
post	get
best practice is to use post redirect get pattern since you are asking specific about refresh after submit

7366517
post	get
note that in jsf 2.x you ve also the opportunity to use the new which fires a get request instead of a post request

7366537
outputstream	inputstream
now i want to store this into a local file i am using fileoutputstream to do this but the problem is how to effectively convert the inputstream to outputstream if i am using something like this

all the addon would have to do is run a dir work you want to find from the folder you are in and then filter the output

7366574

this works great for my form except for checkbox and radio button

7366644
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it s ok more or less in comparison to what i have used css3 for firefox google-chrome and opera

7366660
sat	np-complete
for example the proof that sat is np-complete uses the fact that sat can be used to encode a turing machine and it s execution on an input

7366662
post	get
when the app finished the post and tried to request the data it had just saved i get the infamous error when it tries to serialize my model.

anyway the data is push not pull so soap doesn t really cut it

7366742
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari come with built-in debuggers that take 15 mins to learn how to set a breakpoint and then inspect the values of variables once it hits that breakpiont

7366745
children	parent
i made it by switching 2 of the children to absolute because they will never expand than i putted the children whom size wont change to the top and than i moved the last one upwards by few pixels so it overlays and still can resize the parent

7366750
children	parent
however it turns out that all children are evaluated prior to being stored on their parent so

7366752
inherited	subclassing
basically i have a base class and i can have any number of subclassing which inherited from it

7366778
children	parent
elements that are absolutely positioned do not take up any space so changes to the number or size of the children will have no effect on the size of the parent element

7366778
children	parent
if you want the parent container to expand contract with its children you need to float both the container and its children

7366798
apache	nginx
keep it simple -- leverage what apache or nginx or whatever offers you

7366798
apache	nginx
use apache or nginx or whatever to split the customer s url s from each other

7366798
apache	nginx
if you use apache or nginx or whatever to split these things up then each top-level path element can direct the request to a specific mod_wsgi instance

printf	strtok
this is even more limited than pdclib and suitable if you just need a few basic functions such as printf and strtok

7367057
getter	setter
both the getter and the setter behavior are defined by property declarations

7367057
getter	setter
this of course is only true if you use synthesize and do not override or change the getter and setter methods

express	node.js
i m looking into the express framework for node.js and all the inheritance is done by

7367105

7367177
titlebar	window
a window is an area with border and the standard buttons and titlebar at the top

however i d also suggest that you use a single container for all the banners and maybe put the the icons in there too and set the mouseenter mouseleave events on that rather than on individual banners

7367251
getter	setter
either thing is actually a getter setter with some horrible logic

7367257

post	get
as i mentioned before i have got the problem several times and manage to fix it but still didnt get the exact reason so i will not post any specific code

7367436
folder	directory
i am not sure what you did to windows installation but your user.home points to directory vmware-host shared folder

7367442
maven	pom.xml
because you declare your project to be dependent upon bouncy castle in your maven pom.xml anybody using maven to depend upon your library will by default pull in bouncy castle as a transitive dependency

7367442
jar	war
for example jar type packaging by default does not include dependencies whereas war will include those in compile scope but not test or provided

7367457
folder	directory
with multiple sessions they each have their own global environment just be careful that they don t overwrite files if working from the same folder directory

it is likely that the merge has not been fast-forward because your branch had differences with remote one before pulling

7367722
sorting	grouping
sorting by the min of myrank per grouping will effect the same order as sorting ascending by myrank globally first then doing a distinc

chown	chmod
you can change permissions using the chown and chmod commands in a shell

7367996
hide	show
personally i use commands and have the main controller hide and show forms based on the commands passed in so there is as little logic in the forms as possible

7368019
int	double
an int will get converted back to a double invisibly which is why you weren t seeing any errors in your code

7368025
put	get

7368443
udp	tcp
if you need to print directly to a pos printer they usually have their own binary protocol that you can use over tcp udp

7368535
allocator	stl
for example you can provide an allocator to an stl container or you can override new and delete on a class by class basis

7368535
free	malloc
note also that replacing malloc and free will not necessarily change the allocator used by operators new and delete

7368535
free	malloc
if you re using c chances are you can wrap or replace key malloc and free calls with your custom allocator just where it matters and leave the rest of the program to use the default allocator

7368542
pop-up	dialog
i want to be able to handle it using the appdomain s unhandled exception handler which in our case logs the error pop-up a dialog notifying the user and exits the application but so far i have not found a good way to do this

7368933
margin	height
keep in mind that the height of an element does not include the margin and padding for the element they are added together in the end

7368933
margin	height
you should be able to put them both into another division at height 100 and make it work properly but you ll most likely find that the page still extends past the screen by 16px because of the margin on the body

7368938
y-combinator	combinators
the y-combinator pretty much like any other fixed point combinators will only work properly when your functions are called by need or lazily evaluated

7368946
mouse	keyboard
most applications do not support external automation so your only option in those cases is to use mouse_event and keybd_event to simulate mouse keyboard activity and or use postmessage and or sendmessage to send simulated messages directly to specific windows

7369065
hide	show
to hide the details div and show the immediately-following div assumed to be specs try this jquery snippet

7369065
hide	show
it attaches a click handler to every product-details div and when it fires it hide that div and show its immediate sibling

7369067
listview	gridview
i m using a gridview but i believe this should also work for listview

7369090
jar	war
maven only comes into the picture because you presumably have resource files in your project version control that need to be included in the jar or war or whatever artifacts that you are building

7369146

1 chown this file to apache user and chmod it to 700

7369220
hide	show
when you hover the tag it show the submenu then when you go to click a submenu item you re not hover the any more so it hide it again

7369229
for-loop	arrays
if you want this function to also accept an arrays of rho phi z values i suggest you simply process the values in a for-loop as i doubt any further vectorization will bring significant improvements plus the code will be harder to read

7369253
children	parent
no it is not possible through pure css to make a parent element automatically resize to contain all of its positioned children

7369257
int	double
i want to use the extrainfo member to be a useful flexible addition to the message class so i would like for it to be able to contain any type an int node index a double path cost a relevant vector3 position from xna etc etc...

7369261
inherited	properties
controls that are not designed for user input for example the label control no longer render the disabled disabled attribute if their enabled properties is set to false or if they inherited this setting from a container control

7369284
dictionary	map
this will initialize a dictionary with the same keys that you parsed from your csv file and each one will map to an empty list to which i assume you will append your suspect row values

7369289
apache	lighttpd
are you working from a web server like apache or lighttpd or mongrel or directly from files you will see file in your browser bar

7369295
next	except
it looks like a normal function except that it contains yield statements for producing a series a values usable in a for-loop or that can be retrieved one at a time with the next function

7369311
hash	md5
i have one nvarchar column in sql server which stores passwords hash in md5

7369311
hash	md5
i use the following for generating the md5 hash

7369314
int	double
the rationale for this is that template-parameter-dependent name lookup is performed right before the instantiation of i so it finds h double but not h int

7369314
int	double
gcc seems to be looking up the template-parameter-dependent names in the template after everything else has been compiled so it finds both h double and h int and prefers the latter

7369314
int	double
clang seems to be looking up the template-parameter-dependent names in the template at the point where the template is declared so it finds neither h double nor h int

7369315
superclass	subclassing
in addition to the answers provided by matt ball and hovercraft full of eels you can avoid having to explicitly cast by declaring methods implemented by the subclassing as abstract methods in the superclass

7369315
abstract-class	superclass
as mentioned by kublai khan it is necessary to then make the superclass an abstract-class

7369358
folder	directory
right click on the folder directory web sites and select new - web site

7369373
put	get
to get strings out of read you d have to use the printed representation of strings put them in double quotes

need to know the complete story so that we feel safe to upgrade to bigger versioning

7369378
apache	nginx
in nginx so that apache will never need to redirect

7369388
for-loop	arrays
since langauges is an arrays you can use it as ilist object and consume it in a for-loop like mentioned by json skeet

7369415
portrait	landscape
i believe you are providing support for both the landscape and portrait mode for the application so you should detect the device orientation in the cellforrowatindexpath method and create the cell for the current orientation

7369416
postgresql	mysql
i have both mysql and postgresql

7369419
versioning	upgrade
need to know the complete story so that we feel safe to upgrade to bigger versioning

submit	submission
3 submit via ajax to page 3 before submission the form to page 2

7369445
stdout	stderr
if you have a handle that was inherited from your parent process different from stdin stdout or stderr or a pipe from createpipe is it possible to get a buffered stream from it

7369473
hide	show
you could then just do a little jquery when you click more...to show the rest and hide more

7369495
bash	subshell
even running it as bash virtualenv_blah.sh wont work since this will simply create the environment inside the subshell

7369544
mousemove	mousedown
i assign an object to a variable in the mousedown event and track itâ s relative position by examining the mousemove event of the neighbouring panels as i drag the mouse over them

7369544
mousemove	mousedown
the problem is that the sender parameter of the mousemove event never changes â it always returns the object that received the mousedown event

7369600
erlang	lisp
other languages including the functional language lisp ml haskell erlang etc most of the major dynamic languages python ruby javascript etc and the other application languages c# scala go d etc support some form of lambda literal. even c++ has them now since c++11 although in that case they are somewhat more complicated because c++ lacks automatic memory management and won t save your stack frame for you

7369610
portrait	landscape
style media screen max-device-width 1024px and orientation portrait portrait media screen max-device-width 1024px and orientation landscape landscape #60

7369613

7369649
bmp	png
i have an png image with alpha i need to convert it to bmp to be loaded to my opengl application

7369661
textarea	autogrow

then it will autogrow the textarea fitting the text amount length

7369692
notepad++	jedit
any other free editor like notepad++ or jedit would also do here

7369762
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you are not really using iqueryable interface simple solution would be to cal .tolist and work with ienumerable or list return type

7369767
mkmapview	mapkit
you might want to look at mkcircle and mkcircleview which are part of the mapkit api and are designed for drawing circles on an mkmapview

7369770
width	height
header size in this case would be determined by the size of variables holding width height and maxsize plus two bytes for p5 plus 4 bytes of whitespace

7369770
width	height
other cases where this might break are if the width or height are larger than an int very big image

7369770
width	height
or if the pgm is 8-bit rather than 16-bit which can be determined from maxval and possible width height and the filesize

7369775
uiview	subviews
and uiview has subviews property which is an nsarray of uiview objects

7369784
post	get
to the new page either by get termed query strings in asp.net or post here is an example how to do it

7369793
width	height
you will have to create picker programitcally so that you can create your own sized picker with cgrectmake x y width height then you will have to rotate it but rotating it will also rotate in the picker s datasources methods you will have to rotate the view inverse of picker s rotation i am including code hopfully it will help

7369796
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
work beautifuly in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in ie

7369799
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
what i normally do in these situations is create a uinavigationcontroller setting it to have no navbar at the top and another uiviewcontroller perhaps the one with a uitabbarcontroller in it which i set as the rootviewcontroller for the uinavigationcontroller

7369799
viewdidload	viewwillappear
then in viewdidload or viewwillappear you do you login logic and depending on the result push or pop the correct uiviewcontroller with no animation

7369943
min	max
pick the two extreme points with the min and max x value call them x min and x max and draw the line between them

7369943
min	max	minimum	max
in the case where you have multiple points with the same x value at the extremes pick x min with the minimum y value and x max with the maximum y value

7369943
min	max
split the list of points into two sub lists where all of the points below the line connecting x min and x max are in one list and all those above that line are in another

7369943
min	max
include x min in the first list and x max in the second

7369967
width	height
there is an scrollheight and and scrollwidth property that equals to width and height of what is inside an scrollable element

7369967
width	height
so setting height and width of that element to scrollwidth and scrollheight can solve the problem

7370070
alertdialog	progressdialog
when it is doing all these work i want at that time progressdialog should show if successfully data fetches then dialog should close and some alertdialog should show for msg successfully data fetched

you could just create a profile which includes the avg mean min max of how often each sensor is tripped how long it is tripped how long is the time between a trip and the next trip etc

7370119
lisp	scheme
an alternative to common lisp would be a implementation of scheme

one of the component was creating a floating toolbox like you get with photoshop with a thin border and no title or min max close buttons

7370179
width	height
this is how you vil get the size availabel for parent div.then set the width and height of parent div according to it.now if you have width of parent div its easy to set middle_div in middle of parent div

7370205
nhibernate	queryover
could someone help me to translate linq expression to nhibernate queryover

7370223
postgresql	mysql
but you might also want to consider if you re the person creating thousands of files in the first place whether that is the best way of storing your data - if you usually need the ability to search quickly you might want to either use a database instead of plain files mysql postgresql sqlite et cetera or keep a search index using sphinx solr or lucene

7370254
portrait	landscape
so to be clear you want the entire app and all views in portrait except for the view triggered by the second tab bar button which you want to always appear in landscape

7370272
width	height
width 0 height 0 any self-respecting spam suppression software virus checker etc. will silently and automatically remove html elements with 0 size

7370315
portrait	landscape
but for a extra detail if you wanted to support only landscape left and portrait upside down orientation the function would look like this

7370316
button	checkbox
the site describes how to set styles for button radios and checkbox

7370346
rss	feed
i only want to read rss feed so it probably does not need to support the entire spec

rtos	qnx
the blackberry tablet os runs on top of the qnx neutrino rtos

7370361
rtos	qnx
qnx is most famous for being the real time operating system of which there are two versions qnx rtos v4 is an older product but is still used in many existing systems and still supported by the company

7370361
rtos	qnx
more recently qnx neutrino rtos v6 was released

7370361

questions specifically about the blackberry tablet os should probably not have this tag unless you are coding directly against the underlying qnx neutrino rtos apis

7370372
ubuntu	linux
i want to create a dsn in ubuntu linux 10.10 for a java application with a mysql back end

7370382
google-chrome	firefox
it differs from how it works in other browsers such as firefox google-chrome and ie

7370382
width	height
the result was wider in opera as it changed both width and height

7370382
width	height
that is if we change the width the height is no longer actual because the content spreads over the new width making itself shorter in height

7370382
width	height
that explains why the second jsfiddle worked as intended firstly i got the new width and applied it then the content occupied the new dimensions and only after that i got the new height and applied it

7370382
width	height
so if we need to change both width and height we need to firstly change the width and only then change the height

7370410
width	height
public absolutelayout.layoutparams int width int height int x int y

7370410

7370873
iccube	mondrian
amongst them vou ve the classical mondrian rolap and one new coming iccube molap

7370929
for-loop	loops
you should also consider using a foreach loops instead of a for-loop

7370935
django	web.py
i am learning django but gave web.py a try first

7370935
django	web.py
can the web.py type classes be implemented in django like

7370939
graphdb	allegrograph
allegrograph okay they are a graphdb rdf store hybrid

7370939
stardog	allegrograph
an alternative approach might be starting with allegrograph or stardog

7370941
rjava	jri
try using the rjava distribution instead jri is now part of rjava

7370942
many-to-many	one-to-many
you may also specify the default comparative and sorting behavior of a relational collection by declaring the where and orderby property attributes on the parent entity of a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

7371011
pull	push
use git push to publish commits and git pull to get the latest tree from the remote origin

7371028
jobs	cron
i found this article helpful for the error handling aspects of running cron jobs

7371047
glassfish	weblogic
these implementations are also come pre-bundled with java ee application servers glassfish and weblogic contain jersey

7371051
rss	feed
serving it as a web page or rss feed even when password-protected is very rarely wise

7371084
for-loop	arrays
this basically means that when you use the less than or equel to operator in your for-loop you re looping from zero to the number of items in your collection however since your arrays index begins are zero you re eventually going to be requesting an item from your arrays that doesn t exist

7371087
inherited	subclassing
does a subclassing inherited the main class friend associations both the main class own and other classes friended with the main class

7371115
inherited	subclassing
the answer is very simple no subclassing do not inherited friend associations

7371115
children	parent
a friend can only access the private members of the class the association is declared in not those of parent and or children of that class

7371185
folder	directory
i am guessing using some ide you don t specify which that is copying certain files from your source folder into the destination either a jar or a directory of classes and resources

7371202
google-chrome	firefox
for the debugging part the two major browsers talking about actual browsers not ie google-chrome and firefox both have great debugging tools

7371202
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has the built in developer tools ctrl-shift-i to launch and firefox has firebug

7371268
submit	submission
so i am in the process of gathering a user s email address and submission it to a database - but what i would really like to do is also submit an html email to them

7371279
put	get
here i ll put the files - please see because i didn t get what to do and how.

7371334
mouseover	mouseout
the simplest would be to modify your code to reference a variable here hold which is set on mouseover and cleared on mouseout

7371402
hide	show
and i want to press x class close to change height of parent div to 20px and show v class open but hide x class close in each div with class im separately

7371402
hide	show
then press v class open to change height of parent div to 220px and show x but hide v

7371402
hide	show
how can i hide and show only one of v which is child of the parent div which is parent of x class .close

7371406
post	get
you should not mix the post and the get method or you will run into trouble

7371431
viewdidload	viewdidappear
disable your currentlocation button until mapview get user s current location then the currentlocation button when get user s current location.you can do this by disabling currentlocation button in viewdidload viewdidappear and enable currentlocation button in method after

7371448
int	chars
my overall advice is to not compare a chars field to an int and rely on an implicit conversion

7371454
post	get
do post if you get some code for direct comparison

7371457
width	height
its working good if i use direction left or right becuase i have incrased width but how do i set the height of the th or table

7371461
keydown	keyup
i m trying when i navigate using keyup and keydown on dropdownlist the it focus on the next element but change the index of previous dropdown

7371461
keydown	keyup
actually i want to stop keyup and keydown indexing changing functionality on element

7371469
mouseleave	mouseenter
but it can byte when you rely on the mouseenter and mouseleave event for example with a control that is close to the edge of its container

7371478
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
you cannot know the values of x and y until runtime so there is nothing you can do but use an if like you were going to and think of the math that will require the fewest operations taking into account that 1 subtraction addition multiplication division usually

7371514
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i was initially using a bufferedreader bufferedwriter but i cannot set the data to private which means anyone can just edit the file

7371532
hide	show
hiding the element is done using the jquery hide method there is also show if you want to make the elements visible again later

7371533
mouseover	mouseout
i would use mouseover and mouseout as suggested in the jquery documentation like so

7371534
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade - upgrading netbeans is a simple process all your settings are automtically configured in the newly installed versioning

7371555
int	chars
also you should make sure you use the correct key type - int 0 is not the same as a chars 0

7371561
post	get
this code will log post or get data to your firebug window if found place it in the page you request with ajax

7371565
post	get
how would i then in sinatra and ruby properly get at the get and post variables

7371576
google-chrome	firefox
i am still unsure what causes script error. with the period btw that s how it shows up in our ajax logger in firefox but in google-chrome we were able to narrow it down to.

7371621
redmine	chiliproject
if you drop the following file into lib redmine core_ext vendor_gem_source_index.rb of your chiliproject dirctory you should be able to run warbler

7371629
client-side	server-side
prereq use a template-engine that can both render server-side and client-side

7371629
client-side	server-side
this makes sure you can render models without js- through server-side templating and render models with js through client-side templating

7371629
sorting	filtering
initially all links product-detail page paging sorting filtering are real server-side urls no hashbang urls

7371629
sorting	filtering
the end-result is a page which can be navigated 100 with paging sorting filtering without the use of js

7371629
sorting	filtering
all paging sorting filtering urls result in a request to the server which in turn results in a new set of products being rendered

7371629
client-side	server-side
visually nothing should change after all server-side and client-side rendering was done on same models with same template but at least now there s a binding between the client-side model and the view

7371629
sorting	filtering
now every filtering paging sorting url should result in a client-side state-change which would probably result in your js-framework doing an ajax-request to the server to return new products in json-format

7371629
client-side	server-side
i ve done some testing to return html-snippets on ajax using server-side mustache-template rendering instead of doing the same on the client-side as suggested in my answer above

7371656
google-chrome	firefox
the load event does not correctly bubble up the parent document and the event.target isn t set by firefox ie9 or google-chrome which is required to do event delegation

7371671
public	protected
the fact that it is internal to list and it is protected locks everyone outside of the hierarchy of list from using the type at all all of the methods in node can be public

7371732
pseudo-class	visited
similarly the style defined for .foo a visited overrides the style for a hover when both visited as well as hover pseudo-class apply to an a element of class foo

7371740
gridview	rowdatabound
if you want to bind the image control url dynamically you will have to hook into the rowdatabound event of the gridview

7371752
qbytearray	qimage
you can construct a qimage from a qbytearray with the qimage fromdata static method

7371764
asterisk	pbx	asterisk	freeswitch	freeswitch	pbx
and asterisk and freeswitch are pbx software and probably are not what you are looking for

7371776
hide	show
to show hide upload fields you can use for example the css display attribute

7371832
crossover	mutation
yet since there are so many settings population size mutation rate crossover rate and so on... i don t know if this is due to some bugs in my code or because i made a poor choice of those aforementioned parameteres

7371832
crossover	mutation
as i said i m using tournament selection the crossover is implemented by chosing each gene with equal probability from one of the two parents and the mutation by adding or subtracting a value from 0 to max_perturbation to the current value

7371832
crossover	mutation
can you point me out to any tutorial discussing how to optimize the use of genetic algorithm with neural networks what kind of crossover works best what kind of population size is better also mutation rate and so on... or can give me any tips

7371837
inherited	properties
you can achieve this using tag properties of button any child of uiview inherited that in following way

7371852
inherited	subclassing
then for every class that wants access to the node they inherited nodeaccess as protected which grants them and all other subclassing access rights to node within the protected ruleset but prevents any other class from accessing node directly

7371863
google-chrome	firefox
please test this jsfiddle to see the problem yourself and here is an image of how it looks in firefox 5 and an image of that in google-chrome to compare what is wrong with overflow in ff5

7371866
int	boolean
for any of the types int float string boolean and resource

7371867
post	get
instead of trying to hide the username and password in get or post parameters you should instead use basic authentication which was invented especially for that purpose and is universally available in clients and is available using convenience methods in sinatra

7371867
post	put	post	get	put	get
if you get there you gather information about that resource if you post you create a new resource if you put yopu update n existing resource and if you delete well you delete it

7371947
post	get
is there a way to get removed comments for particular post

7371954
int	chars
i have two chars 4 bytes that representing int value geted from stream

7371983
setinterval	settimeout
the only exceptions are ajax timers settimeout and setinterval and html5 web workers

7372020
int	chars
however to turn two chars into an int you can use

7372103
setinterval	settimeout
except ajax settimeout and setinterval there is nothing that can asynchronously executed in javascript

7372112
webclient	webrequest
the use of the webrequest class can be greatly simplified with a simple extension method that makes it behave like the webclient

7372138
for-loop	arrays
so instead of a for-loop i make use of the map method - each arrays element each input node is replaced with its id value

7372179
typedef	struct
and the second snippet is a pure c typedef struct

7372201
multiplying	add
the obvious solution is to say that a unix timestamp is in seconds so just multiplying the number of days by the number of seconds in a day 86400 and add that to the current time time

7372208
mutators	setter
the mutators method sometimes called a setter is most often used in object-oriented programming in keeping with the principle of encapsulation

7372208
getter	setter
often a setter is accompanied by a getter also known as an accessor which returns the value of the private member variable

7372229
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

7372248
getter	setter
getter and setter are methods on an object that allow you to hide the internal implementation of something but still allow other objects to access things

7372248
getter	setter
in objective-c they are tied to the idea of properties - if you define a property you get getter and setter for the object s function

7372248
getter	setter
there s more documentation about properties here and jussi s link is a better overview of getter setter in general

7372287
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome firefox or any other name with the respective

7372310
decoder	encoder
you ll need to find or write a hex decoder and a base-64 encoder and use a as an intermediate form

7372312
udp	tcp
i m using udp and tcp packets

7372312
udp	tcp
the tcp seeme to work really good throgh the udp comes after a delay of 5 seconds sometimes

7372323
rss	feed
a url in this form returns the most recent n items of the rss feed

7372323
rss	feed
rss the url for the rss feed

7372323
rss	feed
rss the url for the rss feed

7372323
rss	feed
to get newest 1000 item of this rss feed the url to be used should look like

7372333
memcached	apc
the problem is that this file is really big - i ve tried memcached apc etc

7372377
width	height
the entire area will be covered however part of the image may not be visible if the width height of the resized image is too great

7372386
multibyte	setlocale
in linux you can either proceed to use wcstombs to transform the wide character into the system s and locale s narrow character multibyte encoding don t forget setlocale lc_ctype

7372390
setinterval	settimeout
i use settimeout instead of setinterval ... 1 to reduce cpu load in my case

7372408
jpql	hql
sure you can do it with hibernate tools eclipse plugin it s about hql but it can manage jpql

7372443
children	parent
finally there s a slight difference in how constructors are overridden in java children classes must call the parent s constructor refinement overriding whereas in python children classes can override the constructor and not call the parent s constructor replacement overriding

7372464
inherited	subclassing	super	implements
to use this subclassing make your custom view controller a subclassing of gmkeyboardvc and it inherited this feature just be sure if you implements viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear they must call super

7372468
move	drag
i have a magazine type app which has textviews on each of the pages i need to be able to ignore the swipe gesture and pass it to the parent so that when the user drag sideways it move to the next page instead of trying to scroll the textview

7372477
mouse	keyboard
you shouldn t be using the mouse press release events to detect actions on your buttons unless you have very specific needs and don t care at all about keyboard actions and shortcuts

7372480
width	height
you can adjust the width and height to your wishes

7372480
background-color	transparency
you can also use background-color rgba 1 1 1 0.2 where 0.2 is the transparency level 0 invisible 1 fully visible

7372480
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this css attrbute is available for firefox 3+ google-chrome safari 3+ opera 10+ and ie 9+

7372501
hide	show
you would add a click handler to your link to show its corresponding div and hide the others

7372531
post	get
i realise i should probably be implementing the mvc model here and although use this to populate the textboxes on loading can t pull the information from a textbox back out again on the post back to get values in the javascript function in the view

7372531
post	get
would i get which one had been selected from the controller in the post

7372561
robocopy	xcopy
use xcopy or robocopy

7372600
put	get
for the dropdownlist if you put it in the form tag it will be bind to the model so you will get in the controller

7372658
children	parent
i had to add an after_save hook on the parent model to look up all of the children and save them

7372664
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome gives me blank output while firefox gives me the value in the text box

7372677
getter	setter
what s worse the selected property on the button only looks like a bound property with setter and getter but isn t never fires propertychange

7372681
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
2 install from a package manager macports fink homebrew - this makes it easier if you have complex c library dependencies

7372734
quicksort	mergesort
that s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksort

7372734
quicksort	mergesort
but remember mergesort is not in place it require 2n memeroy space.and mergesort also need to do many array copies which we don t include in the analysis of algorithm.in a word mergesort is really faseter than quicksort in theroy but in reality you need to consider memeory space the cost of array copy merger is slower than quick sort.i once made an experiment where i was given 1000000 digits in java by random class and it took 2610ms by mergesort 1370ms by quicksort

7372736
inherited	subclassing
i have a main class that is inherited by numerous subclassing

7372736
inherited	subclassing
the inherited main class has to be at least protected in inherited to prevent non-derivative classes from using or altering it via the subclassing

7372736
inherited	subclassing
is there a way to permit the various subclassing to alter each other s inherited main class variables but without permitting public access to the main class

7372736
public	protected
all classes wanting rights to node inherit accessnode as protected so the accessnode class isn t public

7372736
public	protected
the problem is in order for templatelist to copy charlist a subclass of templatelist via read-only it needs access to the nodes of charlist to avoid using charlist s iterator - the problem is the nodes are protected to prevent external non-accessnode interference and implementing a public method that grants access to the nodes would defeat the point

7372736
inherited	subclassing
what i need is sideways inherited so all subclassing of type accessnode can access each other s node without granting access publicly

7372774
base	fractions
just like some fractions like one-third cannot be expressed exactly as a non-repeating base 10 decimal number many fractions cannot be expressed exactly as binary fractions

7372781
jobs	cron
many shared web hosts allow you to set up cron jobs

7372793
inherited	subclassing
i m not completely sure i understand what you mean by subclassing to alter each other s inherited main class variables

7372860
inherited	properties
my domain model is as follows where the location class is abstract one and each inherited class conatins related navigation properties

7372863
width	height
this typically happens when attempting to set the width or height property to a display object when it is still empty before a loader has finished loading

7372863
width	height
however i remember experiencing flash runtime bugs where the object s width height property wasn t updated when it should leading to exactly this issue though i m not 100 sure it is your case

7372863
width	height
if this is the case a workaround is to directly set the scalex and scaley properties rather than the width and height properties

7372863
width	height
otherwise you can use the width and height properties of the loaderinfo object instead of those of the loader object

7372875
post	get
i am wondering the best way to go about the issue to get the title of the next post and a preview of the body summary

7372909
google-chrome	firefox
this issue happens on android and google-chrome but not in firefox

7372953
put	get
you need to look at the apache httpd documentation to figure out how to get the front-end to put the information that you need into the http request headers on the way through

7372965
post	put
if i check with firebug there is a put tab with all my parameters and the parameters are correctly spelled since if i switch from put to post on both sides everything works

7373044
pdostatement	bindvalue
the data type parameter to pdostatement bindvalue isn t terribly useful

7373122
submit	submission
one way of submission a form is by including an input element of type submit within the form which is what the web designer has done here

7373140
width	height
beware setting width and height of an object in flash will scale the object

7373187
google-chrome	firefox
but if i try to run it from the console in either google-chrome or firefox 1 will still return but then send out a message of undefined

7373195
post	get
is there really any kind of difference using post and get in this perspective

7373227
slideup	slidedown
i have this simple flyer page which uses jquery to reveal a form via two buttons that when clicked call slideup and slidedown

7373248
min	max
where min and max are functions that return the min and max element of an array

7373248
min	max
if i understand correctly it should be easy to code min and max

7373263
post	get
with all those things done i still get an error when i try to load the nib using the code i shared at the top of this post can someone tell me what it is that i am doing wrong

7373275
multiplying	subtract
instead of multiplying and dividing by powers of 10 like the other answers you can use the fmod function to find the digits after the precision you want and then subtract to remove them

7373329
ant	maven
i m converting my project from using maven ant tasks for dependency management to ivy

7373329
ant	maven
since i was previously successfully using maven ant tasks i copied my

7373329
ant	maven
this is way more than the 65 jars the maven ant tasks were previously downloading

7373355
post	get
i get this funny message when calling a fb dialog to post to a friends wall in my new app

7373362
hide	show
below is the code usedto hide and show divs

7373369
width	height
an aspect ratio the way i understand it is width to height

7373369
width	height
hence given the 3 1 requirement the width of an image can be up to 3x the height

7373480
int	chars
wait a min as per c documentation getchar returns int but see in the above code i m storing it in chars

7373480
int	chars
and also in while loop i have compared c which is an chars with eof which is an int and compiler doesn t throw any error and my program executes

7373485
cvs	svn
teamcity has a plugin for each vcs system git svn cvs etc. in general it just polls the vcs for changes and if there are changes it checks them out and builds them

7373489
int	chars
it simply means that the returned value which is an int implicitly converts into chars type

7373489
int	chars
the compiler may generate warning messages for such conversion as sizeof int is greater than sizeof chars

7373497
int	chars
what you have demonstrated is that a chars and int in c c++ are pretty much the same and c c++ automatically casts between the two

7373508
min	max
the values of min and max are stored but the values array is not

7373563
int	chars
if you want to assign an int to a chars then you can

7373563
int	chars
as an aside the title of this question should be something like why does c let me assign an int to a chars

7373585
webchromeclient	webviewclient
i had javascript enabled i tried diffrent websettings i had set the webchromeclient and webviewclient looking for javascript errors.

7373652
comparator	icomparer
if i pass in a custom icomparer to an instance of a list s sort method will the comparator s compare x y method ever be called with the same item

7373653
integer	unsigned
for example if the number was 8 and the type was a 32 bit unsigned integer then the type would be 7 which would be copied to the first leftmost byte and then the next 4 bytes would be encoded with the actual number 8 in this case

7373685
int	chars
unsigned int pnnewsize int nblockuse const chars szfilename int

7373685
int	chars
int nblockuse const chars szfilename int nline line 1040 + 0x1b

7373700
inherited	properties
you can inherited from only one prototype and then copy the rest of the properties that you want

7373703
width	height
so i m currently reading every line from the rectangle of interest into an array which leaves me with a bitmap which has correct height but wrong width

7373743
udp	tcp
with cdns you can deliver your media to multiple nodes through tcp and udp both

7373756
serializable	deserialization
most languages have really easy json serializable deserialization to native data types

7373765
pull	push
i m getting this error when i try to clone push or pull a repository in a brand new ubuntu vm i m running

7373790

7373836
button	checkbox
it looked good and seemed to work well with flash components button checkbox texfields because they are transparent

7373851
put	get
i have put an image in canvas and i want to get the rgb value of the pixels of that image when the user moves the mouse over the image

7373878
ubuntu	linux
i do all my development in ubuntu linux so i didn t notice but the data doesn t show up in ie

7373937
onclick	onchange
no submit button or onclick or onchange event of javascript

7373939
integer	unsigned
from â 7.21.6.1 of n1570 the x specifier interprets its argument as an unsigned integer

7374001
width	height
hi i don t want an image for my submit button so i have gone with the default submit button but i want to edit its width and height

7374030
width	height
you can change height and width with css

7374036
width	height
just use style attribute with height and width option

7374042
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome just ignores the expiration i set and firefox never loads the page

7374054
post	put
i tried to put a bufferedreader in the client code and then post a new runnable just like the server code does

7374062
put	get
i shouldn t need help with the sorting but i don t know how to get the word count from each of the text files or put them into an array

7374106
inherited	properties
now if i override size properties in my class which inherited from the base class does max then calculate size from base class or from inherited class or should it be just size without this

7374127
inherited	properties
if you override the virtual properties the inherited class will use everything from the inherited class

7374247
inherited	properties
attribute lookup still follows a pretty fancy algorithm making hashtable lookups those are amortized o 1 but big o isn t everything walking up longish well not so much in the case of builtins inherited chains and invoking other descriptors properties getting bound methods

7374284
hide	show
now when i click the button in form1 it hide and show form2

7374298
sorting	filtering
category filtering and sorting is also not important at all right now

7374300
peer	p2p
the issue is that the connectivity and reachability of peer in a p2p networkis transient

7374310
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari seem to support it fully

7374320
post	get
i ll post it here if i get it

7374338
put	get
then i need to get json encode out put so im doing it like this

7374338
put	get
how to prevent that and get the out put like without those 0 s and 2 etc..

7374370
pop-up	dialog
it s supposed to do a pop-up with the message facebook dialog are so easy

7374396
portrait	landscape
the task i m currently trying to do with uitableviewcontroller is to have one-column-cell-row in portrait mode and two-column-cell-row in landscape mode

7374416
strsplit	substr
substr would work but i would recommend looking into strsplit

7374426
udp	tcp
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp

7374431
tablet	galaxy
i am thinking of developing an application for samsung galaxy tab 10.1 or perhaps some other tablet

7374516
integer	unsigned
basically for an unsigned integer you write 7 bits for each byte using the 8th bit to mark if another byte is needed

7374594
accessor	properties
declared properties address the problems with standard accessor

7374621
getter	setter
so when you do a synthesize the compiler will generate your getter and setter allowing one to do class.variablename value indicating that the compiler will execute class variablename value

7374624
getter	setter
these properties are convenience methods for creating getter and setter

7374624
getter	setter
if you are writing your own setter getter atomic nonatomic retain assign copy are merely advisory

7374624
getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

7374624
getter	setter
that is if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value -- an autoreleased object most likely -- will be returned to the caller in a

7374624
getter	setter
if thread a is calling the getter simultaneously with thread b and c calling the setter with different values thread a may get any one of the three values returned -- the one prior to any setter being called or either of the values passed into the setter in b and c

7374626
carrierwave	paperclip
i m starting to play around with carrierwave as an alternative to paperclip

7374646
versioning	upgrade
i used the upgrade code to find out the product code using msienumrelatedproducts api but when i try to use msigetproductinfo using the product code the versioning info comes back as garbage

7374687
getter	setter
the properties is a nice feature which gives you getter and setter method automatically by synthesize and give you relief by not setting and getting the value

7374697
free	malloc
is using c allocations is okey malloc and free

7374756
hide	fadeout
this is shorter and also for first run it is better that hide target by fadeout instead of hide

7374793
google-chrome	firefox
this code works in firefox but not google-chrome

7374810
post	get
is it right to do a get or a post

7374810
post	get
a get or a post

7374811
getter	setter
however there is a property decorator in python which provides getter setter access to an attribute or other data

7374813
fadein	fadeout
fadeout fadein and delay are jquery methods

7374821
maven	pom.xml
oddly i didn t needed that in another project using some very similar web.xml and pom.xml files i m using maven

7374827
post	get
get vs post in ajax

7374831
getter	setter
with a property you have complete control on his getter setter and deleter methods thing you don t have if not using caveats with an attribute

7374840
division	modulo
the modulo remainder of division prevents that the number is higher then the number of songs

7374848
put	get
i want make some get put delete call as well so i don t want to use any function like .getjson

7374863
post	get
this question might also be usefull when do you use post and when do you use get

7374868
post	get
shorter answer is use get for retrieval and post for modification

7374869
put	get
to be a little more helpful to get a cookie-friendly date i d probably just put the string together myself

7374892
getter	setter
the property allows you to get and set values like you would normal attributes but underneath there is a method being called translating it into a getter and setter for you

7374892
getter	setter
it s really just a convenience to cut down on the boilerplate of calling getter and setter

7374892
getter	setter
in python you can define getter setter and delete methods with the property function

7374911
min	max	minimum	max
title short name long name current maximum minimum day max day min

7374917
width	height
your demo link does not work but i did some tests and it worked fine for me using chrome when you add width height of 100 to the body html elements like so

7374918
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i m writing a userscript greasemonkey which i am developing in firefox but works in opera firefox and google-chrome

7374918
opera	firefox
the script does nothing at all so there must be some syntax error that firefox can handle but opera not

7374918
opera	firefox
is there some javascript stuff that firefox can handle but opera not

7374939
google-chrome	firefox
to answer my own question neither google-chrome nor firefox support more than two values in background-position

7374948
free	malloc
the key time to use malloc free is if you want the scope of your variable to last outside of the current function

7374966
subtract	add
i don t know what the range of your samples is but if they are around the same size you can subtract an approximate average from each value average the differences and add the approximate average back on at the end

7375070
passenger	webrick
i have tested this both on passenger apache and webrick so i don t think it is the apache that is causing this

7375073
mouse	keyboard
robot class allows to simulate key strokes pressed released typed and mouse movement acting as a user using the keyboard and mouse

7375073
mouse	keyboard
when you use the robot class you define the sequence of actions to simulate mouse movements and keyboard usage

7375106
folder	directory
looks like i had all the spring jars in my app web-inf lib directory which probably was bad because they are also in red5 lib folder so they were duplicated

7375133
textview	imageview
i need to be able to change two textview and one imageview

7375172
explode	implode
create just one field with pipes as separators and implode explode results

7375174
google-chrome	firefox
update this version works in firefox but not google-chrome

7375223
mouseup	mousedown
actually looks like there s a problem with the live method for binding both the mousedown and mouseup events

7375223
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
check with google-chrome and firefox for example it works ok to me but not in opera since as far as i know is doesn t support it

7375228
google-chrome	firefox
however it seems it s not working in google-chrome but it is working in firefox

7375256
mouseup	mousedown
but i m also not sure about how the cursor css reacts to mousedown and mouseup - i have a feeling that may be limiting in some browsers a bit of fiddling got it working on mouseup but not mousedown - which seems strange

7375362
free	malloc
the thing is c has two main things going actually a lot more the heap that stores memory that has been requested with alloc or malloc in c and these require to be free

7375396
min	max
so if we walk through it min is called once initialization and until the condition is met max is called each time continue condition

7375397
for-loop	loops
the second two expressions in a for-loop are evaluated every time through loops

7375415
postgresql	mysql
i have selected so far mongodb postgresql mysql drizzle riak and kyoto cabinet

7375418
accessor	properties
as far as ambiguity the lexical analysis stage has already distinguished array_init from an object properties accessor or brackets inside strings regex literals foo bar or

7375424
post	get
my idea of a solution is to code up an http server for android and ios and then get post data with ajax so i can have access to the device s internal storage

7375430
suppressfinalize	finalizer
where dispose is used outside of the context of a finalizer then there is no need for the gc to call the finalizer and therefore suppressfinalize is used as an optimisation to prevent it happening twice

7375438
int	boolean
use with primitive data type like int boolean ..

7375450
subtraction	addition
you are looking at each character in the string exactly once and for each character your are doing either an hashtable insert or lookup and an addition or subtraction and a check against 0

7375462
disk	ram
to drive this point home consider that reading a value from ram is about 1000 times faster than reading it from disk

7375490
goto	break
note that people will tell you that the goto is bad and use the break and continue statements in loops like crazy

7375527
hide	show
bind a click event for the whole document and hide the menu if it is show

7375555
int	double
conversion from â a int bâ to non-scalar type â a double bâ requested

7375561
for-loop	arrays
anyone have any ideas on how to tell if the arrays contains only numbers from strings maybe using a for-loop

7375588
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
from what i understand you can get the same effect using different properties in google-chrome opera firefox safari and ie9

7375614
document.write	window.open
my intention to that html i am going to print using window.open print document.write

7375664
post	get
changed get to post

7375673
post	get
it s puzzling me that i ve got 2 functions with http post where one breaks foreign characters and i just do self.request.post.get text to get the value in both functions

7375705
google-chrome	safari
the code that works with google-chrome safari etc.

7375730
put	get
it works fine but when i put a button or any other control on the canvas i get the same background colour included in the elements

7375766
super	implements
now i try to implements the progressbar and i am a bit stuck obviously something super simple is missing out

7375770
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that while window.performance works for google-chrome nothing works for firefox including window.mozperformance

7375775
multiplying	add
basically is there a way during run-time to change add s return value by multiplying it by some value

7375779
width	height
how to know the width and the height of image using app-engine image api wit python someone adviesed me to use the composite function - pass your image in as the sole input image and specify the canvas size as the desired size of the output image

7375785
daemons	launchd
i have a daemons which runs from root and launchd agent which runs from current user

7375785
daemons	launchd
how can daemons request data or send command to launchd agent

7375790
post	get
can you post some sample code so i can get better understanding of you implementation

7375802
superclass	subclassing
you can overload the function in the subclassing but that s essentially treating that function in the superclass as an abstract function which has to be overloaded

7375826
width	height
i need a div with width of 40px to have a height of 100 minus a 60px gap at the top and another 60px gap at the bottom of the browser window

7375847
accessor	properties
for an unmodeled properties just use a conventional accessor something like

7375858
int	boolean
i am getting the following error message arrays used as indices must be of int or boolean type.

7375866
sml	curry
in sml it s common and easy to define a function using both curry and pattern matching

7375877
libxml2	xerces
also i would recommend using a library like libxml2 or xerces if you dont mind c++ to build your soap messages if you are doing anything more complex than sending a simple pre formatted request

7375878
stdout	stderr
it looks like you are redirecting the real cl.exe stdout but not stderr

7375972
pop-up	dialog
my mbp is connected over wifi so i turned off the wifi then turned it back on while xcode is running and suddenly it caused xcode to pop-up a certificate verification dialog for the ip where my svn repo exists

7375987
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the computing power to even generate a list of md5 hash of sha1 plaintext is huge but it s still no harm to have the salt there to protect against such an attack

7375989
hash	md5
see examples for different types of hash including md5 and sha256 in the manual

7376004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
page will not work in google-chrome safari or firefox

7376005
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
this code only works for mouseover mousedown and not for mouseup

7376010
public	protected
hi i am very new to regex but would like to construct something that will match on the word public | private | protected and the following word to grab the following word unless the following word is not void string int bool

7376018
post	get
the problem i cannot seem to get multiple post to display horizontally next to each other despite floating both post

7376019
implements	extends
i m looking for the most pythonic way to implements a version of the list extends function where it extends to a given index instead of the end of the list

7376049
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you have short_open_tags on in your php.ini httpd.conf .htaccess and you try to put an xml tag into your document like so.

7376050
int	chars	public	protected
after a word break match but don t capture public or private or protected then one or more whitespace chars then one or more word chars as long as the word is not void or string or int or bool

7376067
google-chrome	firefox
i should mention that this jumping bug happens in both google-chrome and firefox

7376069
qpushbutton	qwidget
a qpushbutton is a subclass of qwidget so the style rule is applied to it

7376074
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
after the app is working you can go back and rework the presentation layer facelets markup to optimize into reusable components or higher-function components like those from richfaces icefaces primefaces or faces

7376093
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when i say console i m talking about the developer toolbars in google-chrome safari and firefox firebug

7376128
pull	push
you can pull from the central server do whatever you want in your sandbox including branching and integrating and then if you wish push back to the central server

7376144
int	double
you cannot use int or double but you can use int or double

7376146
int	double
you can t use primitive data type like int or long or double if you want to use one you can look for the wrapper class that represent it

7376163
min	max
this example shows a spectrum of jspinner sizes for various min and max values

7376174
width	height
edit also just to make note of it many js-based animation issues can be solved by giving the animated elements defined dimensions via width and height css properties

7376192
google-chrome	safari
open up safari or google-chrome right click and choose inspect element... on something you have a short-hand property on and you should see the expanded property

7376203
post	get
basically i used a firefox extension to get post and get data from a login to my school website

7376203
post	get
i think it has something to do with redirects because the first post should redirect to the right place but i cant get it to work and trying to get the location header throws a null pointer

7376256
requestfactory	gwt
having upgraded to gwt 2.4.0 i want need to enable annotation processing for my requestfactory interfaces

7376265
post	get
if i get data store it in a class instance is it cached for form post in .net

7376267
public	protected
i need to register all implementation of an interface via structur map the problem i have is that these instances does not have the default ctor i need to inject a dependency when i want to create n instance but because hibernate need public or protected default ctor i had to have a protected default ctor like here

7376291
qcombobox	qstackedwidget
i have a qstackedwidget which holds several pages full of various qlineedit and qcombobox children

7376309
hide	show
can i disable systemtray.isvisible during runtime so my consumers can hide the systemtray or show it when they want to

7376317
cvs	svn	twig	smarty
my choice is netbeans - crossplatform open source svn and other cvs supports many tepmlate engines smarty twig and one of the fastest full featured ides

7376382
post	get
all in all it seems like you re missing a lot of pieces so hopefully some of these resources can help you get on track mac-iphone communication with a python server apple s bonjour documentation and an answer on a related so post with some good links

7376391
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
assuming the nsurlconnection s are created by tasks on the nsoperationqueue that you mention you may also be creating them on some runloop other than that attached to the main thread bringing a whole sweep of thread safety issues into the mix

7376455
accessor	properties	getter	setter
if you need getter and setter to expose some instance variables or you want some automatic retain release memory management or thread safe accessor then properties are a less verbose way to automatically create these smart getter and setter

7376463
trac	bugzilla
and i looked at several bug tracking tools to go along with my repository - lighthouseapp fogbugz bugzilla trac and so on

7376484
for-loop	loops
i am not sure whether there is some convenient way to get this done or not when i am trying to do it using while loops and for-loop

7376487
hide	show
the systemtray automatically hide itself but keep it s allocated 12 pixels and only show when you tap at the top

7376514
wav	riff
stop copying before you get to the wav riff header commonly the 1st 44 bytes

7376525
dbcontext	objectcontext
the difference between the ado.net c# dbcontext generator and the ado.net c# poco entity generator is that the former creates a context based on the dbcontext and the latter creates them based on the objectcontext

7376525
dbcontext	objectcontext
in both cases you then generate poco classes and either a dbcontext or objectcontext from the .edmx file

7376525
dbcontext	objectcontext
the entity framework power tools ctp1 reverse engineers a code first model from the database including poco class the dbcontext don t think it offers objectcontext generation and the mappings via the onmodelcreating method

7376553
gif	png
they all work and recognized the files gif png xls .

7376564
range	max
other columns range from all null one value to a max of 40k unique values

7376585
width	height
height width and border are for example only

7376643
put	get
now the administration things are done time to get to the index.php to show the data i put inside index.php when i open it here s what happened

7376645
google-chrome	firefox
if you have an es2015 environment as of this writing io.js ie11 google-chrome firefox webkit nightly then the following will work and will be fast viz

7376669
websphere	ibm
how might i delete selected alias queues in ibm websphere s queue manager

7376690
put	get
for example if you put the phone on a slightly tilted turntable you will get a sine wave in the x and y acceleration readings

7376694
jruby	mri
i ve been getting in to jruby myself lately and i am extremely surprised how simple it is to switch from mri to jruby

7376694
thin	unicorn
if you want to have an app server that supports threading and you re familiar with mongrel thin unicorn etc then trinidad is probably the easiest to migrate to since it s practically identical from the users perspective

7376695
int	boolean
i don t want to read the value as int or string and then convert the value to boolean

7376714
free	malloc
if what you want is array of bar length then malloc it and free it when you no longer need it

7376745
inherited	subclassing
therefore neither the class nor any public methods beside those inherited from object may be declared final and a default constructor must be accessible to the subclassing

7376780
google-chrome	firefox
i came up with the work-around below tested on the latest google-chrome and firefox

7376789
int	boolean
for example if the result boolean doesn t come from parameter int it still compiles

7376792
hide	show
you may customize this example include the mouseover events which will show hide the panels

7376815
width	height
i am drawing a screen to the web using javascript css and html by using a for-loop to iterate through the screen width and height in intervals of 16x16

7376826
comparator	comparable
apart from the comparator option i believe it would be possible to achieve the same behavior by just making your class implement the comparable interface

7376844
128bit	64bit
the way it works is i have functions for converting strings to 64bit 128bit or 256-bit numbers where the 128bit function calls the 64bit function twice the 256-bit function calls the 128bit one twice and the 64bit one either uses strotull or manually converts the string

7376844
boost	stl
due to licensing issues i work at a big corporation far removed from purchasing or legal decision making i need to use only standard libraries gnu boost stl etc... or else it will simply take me too long to get access to the solution

7376894
clang	llvm
however you might want to check if llvm isn t headed that way with a branch considering its both a compiler and jit using clang or gcc front ends as i ve seem some topics suggesting it might be implemented

7376901
firefox	safari
in safari all works great but in firefox 6 if i leave my site and then go back using hte back button i get the javascript instead of the page

7376906
scheme	racket
racket is a functional language a dialect of scheme with an class system

7376906
lisp	scheme
actually there are many object systems for lisp and scheme

7376925
express	node.js
i ve started few weeks ago to use node.js at the moment i m developing my simple website with node.js + express but i m looking for a module to manage a blog a simple blog articles+comments

7377009
width	height
if i understand your question you just need to use the attributes width and height from a reference of google.appengine.api.images.image

7377108
switching	screens
when i open one of my screens for the fist time there is lag but after it has been opened and i switching it runs smoothly

7377108
switching	screens
is there a way to load the all the images before the app starts so that it doesn t lag the first time i switching to those screens

7377137
division	modulo	division	addition	addition	modulo
there are some interesting parts the use of the integer division that is always rounded down the fact that in vb.net you have to tell to dim the maximum element of the array so the length of the array is +1 this is funny only for c# programmers and it s solved by the -1 in the dim the + 2 addition i need to round up the division by 3 so i simply add 2 to the dividend i could have used a ternary operator and the modulo and in the first test i did it and the use of the ternary operator if in getting the substring

7377150
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream will read object serialized in file by objectoutputstream

7377171
portrait	landscape
my subviews have different layout when in portrait and landscape orientation

7377188
width	height
adding width 100 height 100 to the form does not change anything

7377201
division	modulo
by performing a modulo division you will find the array position of the next character

7377208
onresume	onpause
even though it is stopeed in onpause it is started again in next onresume

7377302
google-chrome	firefox
it didn t work in firefox nor in ie9 but it did work in google-chrome

7377302
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

7377318
equals	gethashcode
i use the default here but you can override the equals and gethashcode methods in class custaction to define what is a duplicate for example

7377321
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
to do so set an alarm with an intent that your appwidgetprovider receives using the alarmmanager

7377333
portrait	landscape
i want landscape enabled only when a button is tapped and then back to portrait when another button is tapped

7377344
tiled	gaming
i am doing this because of the wide range of stuff in which parsers are useful web development programming language interpreters inhouse tools gaming engines map and tiled editors etc

7377389
hash	md5
create a md5 hash and use it as directory

7377400
getter	setter
in the same spirit you can also share some variables between functions defining those functions inside the module scope - in this case you may not need getter and setter methods and such global functions with shared state are closures

7377428
selecteditem	selectedindex
the next this is to use the selectedindex or selecteditem property of the dropdown list component

7377440
width	height
index 0 and 1 of the returned array from getimagesize contain respectively the width and the height of the image

7377458
ibatis	mybatis
so far i have narrowed my choices to ibatis mybatis and ormlite

7377475
hash	salt
there is one constant though for both files and databases never ever store passwords in plaintext but use a salt hash

7377484
pop-up	dialog
android is a multitasking environment so hiding an app does not necessarily mean it gets closed but you can do it for example by calling finish in your onstop method or even in onpause if you want any dialog including sms pop-up to kill your app

7377488
hash	md5
you d have to make sure that the password field is big enough to store md5 hash

7377488
hash	md5
remember that md5 hash are 32 characters long

7377521
notepad	textpad
on windows machine i would probably go with textpad personally i now use programmers notepad 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than textpad by any measure

7377564
equals	icomparable	equals	gethashcode	icomparable	gethashcode
you can think of those contraints as a form of type-classes light normaly overriding equals gethashcode and implementing icomparable is sufficient to use it in this cases

7377581
chunked	transfer-encoding
the server with this problem are sending data in transfer-encoding chunked

7377679
required	placeholder
it may be that the api still required a placeholder passphrase but i believe it will be ignored in this case

7377687
post	get
and how i must format the post to get it up to facebook i d hugely appreciate it

7377714
width	height
this should give a complexity of where k is the width or height of your grid

7377719
uilabel	uibutton
ui items like uibutton uilabel etc... - these items are connected in ib i don t have an alloc from within the code - is ib releasing them or am i supposed to do it myself

7377727
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

disk	ram
also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram

i m seeing the marquee once i press the place button

7381563
mouse	trackpad
i don t think what you re seeing is mouse wheel scrolling as much as tap-to-click on your trackpad

7381563
mouse	trackpad
if your mouse pointer is pointed to a different part of the document than where you typing and you accidentally brush the trackpad and your trackpad os interprets that as a mouse click then the your input point will jump to the place the mouse cursor is pointed at

post	get
essentially the form element looks like this i think the issue i have is post and not get

7381842
post	get
instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case

7381844
post	get
you can still mix and match post and get data on this form using the and php super globals respectively

7381844
post	get
although i am not recommending it you re life might be easier by using which is a merge of both post and get data

7381912
post	get
trying to hide the username and password by changing the http method from get to post has basically no added security

7381949

upon further investigation today i have discovered that after the rotation the cells will resize so that they use the height of the table as both width and height of the cell

7382175
put	get
in 1.2 we had num_latest which we could put in our info dict to get the latest items

7382179

7382470
children	parent
instead either fetch all the parent that match the parent criteria then perform a separate query on each result for its children or denormalize and add the properties you care about to the child entity

7382492
width	height
as for the width and height you could average every two lines of vertical pixels to halve the height

7382506

7383070
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
on the mac in google-chrome safari and opera both the body live and the document keydown bindings work

7383120
cout	cin
the difference is obvious is os are input output streams while cin cout are the standard input output streams

7383120
cout	cin
cin cout are instances of i o streams not synonyms

7383120
cout	cin
if you use cin cout in your streaming operators ignoring the stream they should read write to then you ll end up with

7383124
viewdidload	viewwillappear
also viewdidload is intended to only be called once every time the view is loaded viewwillappear a

7383139

i have an nsobject with a method that has an nsstring object as a parameter this is where i would like to pass the information from my uitableviewcell label too.

7383262
submit	submission
to do something along the lines of this you can place an onclientclick event on the submit button or just the general form submission event

7383321
keydown	keyup
instead of this you should use setinterval to create your own tick for moving and then monitor keydown keyup to change the direction of movement

7383373
viewdidload	viewwillappear
try this in viewwillappear rather than viewdidload

portrait	landscape
first of all you will need two xib files one for a landscape orientation and one for a portrait orientation

7384188
portrait	landscape
as for preparing for landscape or portrait views using autoresizing can work but you may need to have totally seperate xibs

7384236
express	node.js
alternatively you could look into setting up express node.js to handle streamed uploading and use ajax to update dom in this case your node.js service would run decoupled from rails - you d be connecting to it from rails via json

7384348
inherited	subclassing
instead the standard way to do this simulate object inherited when only a few attributes differ between the subclassing is to do something called single table inherited

7384502
post	get
browser not saves cookies but does a post don t know why not get but it doesn t matter

7384509

7384662
hide	show
then hide and show certain number of the above radio buttons based on the number of data in the dataarray

7384690
portrait	landscape
the table resizes its width after changing between portrait and landscape mode

7384719

7385003
disk	ram
the problem of switching to disk once ram is gone and tricks to tweak this process should already be in place

children	parent
the code should be able to do webclient.cancelasync on the parent and its children s webclient when desired

7385038
punctuation	words
mostly the most punctuation words delimiters are around a whitespace so matching on would be a close approximation as well

7385049
serializable	deserialization
i recently read a comment saying that usage of serialversionuid to make different versions of the same class compatible for serializable deserialization is no longer needed from java 5 onwards

7385051
client-side	server-side
there it states submitmode#cancel indicates the client-side validation should be omitted though server-side validation still occurs . so you will still need to stop the server side validation

7385055
getter	setter
this function acts as a getter setter depending on whether a parameter is passed or not

7385059
client-side	server-side
form processing will be a whole lot easier as you won t have to do any pre-submit client-side or post-submit server-side processing of dynamically-generated radio buttons

7385069
width	height
don t set a fixed height and width properties for your controls

7385116
maven	m2e
in the indigo release maven is already included by the eclipse plugin m2e

7385117
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

7385119
sorting	filtering
however there is such a thing as custom binding which allows you to take full control over paging sorting filtering

7385130
width	height
for example if you use a grid a textbox and a button with horizontal and vertical alignment stretch and width and height auto the textfield and button will grow and shrink dynamically

7385146
range	min	range	max	min	max
i wish to create that date filter as a range slider with max min are static and current selection

7385146

visible output has to be always in a format dd mm yyyy and i will show it for min max and from to range selectors

7385146
subtraction	addition
and this function works well for me however if step 1day i need 1 day value in unix to make addition + and subtraction - when user moves slider

7385146

7385233
maven	m2e
m2e is the maven integration for eclipse

7385234

7385281
min	max
the ordering parts of the enumerable interface min max sort use but that s not important here

7385315
rss	icalendar
in the end you could easily use the generated rss from the sharepoint calendar to sync it to the icalendar format

7385393
google-chrome	safari	mp4	h.264
this works perfectly in google-chrome but because it is ogv it will of course not work on the ipad so i need to use h.264 mp4 as that is supported built in with safari but when using the stream command 1 or 3 then i get no video displayed on ipad or google-chrome

7385394

otherwise how can you distinguish two 32 bit int from a double or from an array of eight chars

7386184
int	double
if your messages are very simple in nature they comprise an int two int a double you might be able to get away with a union or something similar but you will still need some key that indicates which element of the union is applicable

7386208

first of all javascript is client-side and php is server-side

7386373
outputstream	inputstream
you will have to write your inputstream to your response outputstream as follows

accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
if your model objects were a subclass of nsmanagedobject then your accessor would be using kvc you declare the properties then use dynamic rather than synthesize in the .m file to indicate that the accessor will be taken care of by other code

7386796
accessor	properties
so your proxy object would have a single visible properties which is your actual object and in the accessor for that you would then check to see if you d gone to the database for this particular object if not do your housekeeping

7387491
django-grappelli	django-admin-tools
i don t know the need to overriding or extending the admin index view but i guess its fair to show something custom while showing the admin index page if you want to add a couple of links of your own which looks neat and nice then django-admin-tools and django-grappelli will accomplish that

7387503

width	height
for example if you sprite was 200 x 65 the sprite will have a width of 256 and the image will be expanded to a width of 256 increasing it slightly by 128 almost doubling the height

7387691
width	height
my solution was to modify my image file to have a height and width of a factor of 2 and then only draw the portion that was the original size

7387725
put	get
i know this will get a lot of traditional answers but i would also like to put forward something completely original we tried and succeeded doing ourselves for more efficient localisation of silverlight using attached properties instead of binding

if you are on 7 it doesn t generate an md5 hash by default instead it generates a sha1

7387866
free	malloc
i do this to avoid continual malloc free new dispose ease debugging i dump the pool level to a status bar using a timer so i always notice if a request leaks or gets double-freed and to eliminate the need for explicit thread termination on app close if multiple threads are only ever reading writing to data areas that outlive the application forms etc the app will close easily and the os can deal with all the threads - there are hundreds of posts about cleanly shutting down threads upon app close - i never bother

7387868
post	get
suppose there are n post when i click on remove of any post the first event works fine...but after that i get n error alerts and all events have the same wall_post_id

the l33t best way is true false this way you can recognize boolean from int when you read the file

7388185
stdout	stderr
i suspect you re blocking reading stdout and stderr

7388187
client-side	server-side
you can then use this access_token to make facebook graph api requests on behalf of that user server-side or if you want you can actually just use the javascript sdk to make all your calls entirely on the client-side with lots of ajax to interact with the django backend

if you have a csv file in your project you could set in its properties to be automatically copied to the output folder copy to output directory copy always and in your application use relative path

7388369
post	get
you may want to look into why your browser is doing a post rather than a get since that implies that there s an important piece of information that you left out

7388373

it appears that in at least the latest version of the most popular web browsers on windows internet explorer firefox google-chrome safari and opera the default filename filled in when saving a webpage is taken from the page s tag so simply making sure the date appears in there should put you right

7388583
apache	nginx
the http server apache nginx will forward the userdata afterwards to php like any other _server parameter

7388617

7388939
webclient	httpwebrequest
it can be done see the post about consuming rest pox services via sl and the post about consuming rest json services via sl but it s not something too easy most people use simple classes such as webclient or httpwebrequest to consume those services

post	put
then you create another form instance bound to the post data but don t put it into the context

7388968

works great except that i want to show a progressdialog before and then an alertdialog after

7389097
alertdialog	progressdialog
for some reason the progressdialog doesn t appear at all whereas the alertdialog does but the execution of the code continues through and doesn t wait

7389103
put	get
also put your new rule before the rules that rewrites for non-existent file so it doesn t rewrite your url before you get a chance to use it and add a flag to the rule so it doesn t get further modified by the other rules

boost	stl
i m sure that boost has a way of doing this but i d like to see a solution with the stl for pedagogical purposes

7391346
post	get
does asp.net mvc only populate one parameter by a particular name for post requests but multiple instances of a parameter by a particular parameter name for get requests

7391363
actualheight	actualwidth
you might be able to do that by binding the canvas.top canvas.left values to the textblock s actualwidth actualheight and using a converter

7391363
actualheight	actualwidth
in that case you ll need to implement a multiconverter instead of a regular converter so that you can pass it two parameters the x y value and the actualheight actualwidth value

will choosing apache when i m using node.js socket.io will give me poor performance compared to choosing nginx

you can issue multiple different types of calls easily just keep calling setopt to switch between get and post and change the url as needed

7392240
post	get
the sends a get request and supports a navigation case outcome only and the sends a post request and can invoke a bean action method

7392243
implements	extends
this isn t really about the type arguments or the generic constraints - it s about your class not implements the right interfaces or extends an appropriate class

7392271

you have to remember that a whitespace is a character so when you leave a space between a word inside a tag that whitespace also inherited the properties that you re trying to apply

7392284
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome safari but when i try it with internet explorere 9 8 7 the server will not interact with the browser - actions like log in will take forever and eventually fail

7392284
google-chrome	firefox
essentially anything that is not a simple static template sometimes not even that will not load in ie but loads fine in firefox google-chrome

7392298
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
that should satisfy google-chrome firefox opera and ie8

7392502
inherited	properties
my plan was to just inherited from a base component class that has a properties on it but i was hoping there d be a better way

7392508

7392812
width	height
the reason the blink is so noticeable is the fact that the views in the viewstack are different width height

7392828
post	get
you should have a separate method with httppost on it separate controller methods for post get update delete

7392828
post	get
you shouldn t be sharing the same method for get post

7392828
post	get
this is also generally not recommended because mvc expects a prg post redirect get behavior so you ideally want to redirect back to an action when done

7392828
post	get
in your case above it will work ok as its simple with no validations but if you have validations on the page before a file upload things can easily get goofy if you post back and don t redirect back to an action

7392906
sqldatasource	detailsview
after extensive searching on the web i noticed that most examples use a sqldatasource declaratively and assign the id to the detailsview datarouceid attribute

google-chrome	firefox
now i want to run this application using browser ie and firefox and google-chrome etc

7393054
sorting	grouping
no grouping sorting outside of the stored procedure

7393060

7393083
udp	tcp
so the best way is separating the sip control single from the udp data socket make it as a tcp socket this is the best solution but never use tcp socket to transfer voice data

7393096
memcached	apc
footnote you can not share standard sessions instead you could save data in files or memory like apc or memcached

7393112
integer	unsigned
since objectatindex takes an unsigned integer as its parameter -1 is converted to a garbage value of 4294967295

7393114
opera	google-chrome

you could use explode and implode but there s no real reason to get fancy and use arrays when this is just a basic string operation

7393338

i don t know if this is the actual cause of the problem or not but i got my video to start playing by removing display none and setting the iframe s width and height to 0 and then using jquery to dynamically set the correct values just before calling api play

7393360
dlsym	dlopen
however if performance and robustness are not critical then you can spin off bison or any other tool that generates c code via popen 3 or similar spin off gcc on the generated code link it into shared library and load the library via dlopen 3 dlsym 3

7393361

7393380
wordpress	joomla
some examples of cmss are wordpress joomla and drupal

7393381
opera	safari
i ve searched a lot of different sites including this one to try and find why my rounded corners aren t working in safari or opera

7393381
opera	safari
both with the same effect of working in all but safari opera well ie 6-8 too of course

i also considered an md5 hash of the same but that violates #3 and potentially #1 depending on the definition of short

7393516
hide	show
onpostexecute in my asynctask - after the data is loaded hide the loading message and show the data

7393595

fortran	ada
implementations in java c ada fortran et al are available on the web

7396816
min	max
a min and max will get you the endpoints of the sequence which also requires grouping by the county id

7396817
equals	icomparable
while iequatable t should generally not be implemented by unsealed classes since such derivation would play oddly with inheritance unless the implementation simply calls equals in which case it would be pointless the opposite situation arises with the generic icomparable t

7396817
equals	icomparable
icomparable schedulerevent x .compareto y should report zero since the events have equals times but icomparable schedulereventwithmessage x .compareto y should return a negative number since aardvark sorts before zymurgy

7396849
put	get
which if i put it into this site on the right hand site i get my message of hello back

7396852
inherited	properties
in this example widthproperty is the static readonly properties defined on the frameworkelement grid2 and grid3 inherited from frameworkelement so they can use this properties

7396852
inherited	properties
because you are binding to an instance depob you need to define the actual properties or use an inherited one on it s class definition like

i am 100 sure you can create some method possibly an extension method that will be accepting desired properties accessor lambda that should be used when results are generated

7396911

7396968
aggregate-functions	sum
the sum and total aggregate-functions return sum of all

7396999
free	malloc
than you need to free the memory that was allocated reserved by malloc

7397003
free	malloc
as a general rule for every malloc there should be a corresponding free

7397003
free	malloc
i don t see any calls to free in your code so it s impossible to say where your problem lies but i noticed right away that you malloc some memory and assign it to readline inside of a loop yet you don t call free on readline at the end of the loop so you are leaking memory there

7397004
free	malloc
think of malloc and free as begin and end

7397004
free	malloc
any time you call malloc do what you need to and once you re done always call free

7397004
free	malloc
to re-iterate free whatever malloc returns except null

7397010
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
in general - any memory allocated dynamically - using calloc malloc realloc needs to be free using free before the pointer goes out of scope

7397013
free	malloc
you should also add free readline after count++ in the last loop to free the memory created by malloc

7397017
spaces	delimiter
use paste -d qq1 qq2 if you want a spaces rather than a tab for the delimiter

7397026
opera	firefox
it is reported to be supported in firefox and opera

7397043
free	malloc
there needs to be a call to free for each successful call to malloc

7397043
free	malloc
that doesn t necessarily mean that you need to have equal numbers of malloc and free calls in your code

7397043
free	malloc
it means that for every malloc call that s executed when your program runs you should call free passing it the pointer value you got from malloc

7397043
free	malloc
you can almost certainly get away with not free ing allocated memory when your program terminates since it will be reclaimed by the operating system but just as a matter of style and good practice you should still match malloc s with free s.

7397043
realloc	calloc
i m ignoring calloc and realloc calls

7397047

you should think about the interface of your class and instead of providing a bunch of getter setter so that anybody can just manipulate anything you should strive to define meaningful methods

7399238
carrierwave	fog
i have also loaded all the required gems carrierwave_direct fog carrierwave

7399293
translation	localization
since that would duplicate the categories in each localization and in many cases only the translation change not necessarily other keys you could work around this if you use a separate lookup table plist for the localized translation of the values in the category plist

7399306
getter	setter
a property is a field in your bean which needs a public getter and setter method

7399306

the only way to do that without weakening the guid uuid randomness would be to prefix the 16-byte guid uuid with an unsigned integer which would make your identifier data 20-bytes or more depending on your integer

division	subtract
of course you could additionally subtract half of your cell layout s height from the division above to get the selection exactly in the middle

7399507

if you want to customize uiswitch with your own text you can instead you use uisegmentedcontrol with your new texts

7400169
post	get
in such a case it would be nice to be able to include the http referer get post arguments etc

7400247
glew	qglwidget
in my experience the qt wrappers for opengl objects are rather poor and limited i just made a thin-wrapper for straight opengl objects made cross-platform and easy via glew and made the usual opengl calls in qglwidget

7400250
getter	setter
the purpose for it is to implement getter setter on arbitrary unparented variables

7400250
getter	setter
for properties in the global or window contexts you can accomplish the goal of having a setter getter for direct references to the object

7400250
getter	setter
and it is then available in all frames created later as a global routed through the specified getter setter

7400250
google-chrome	firefox
i ve crashed firefox and google-chrome a few hundred times in pursuit of this so far by doing things like redefining intercepting modifying object.prototype.valueof tostring function.prototype function.prototype.constructor function.prototype.call apply arguments.callee.caller etc

7400258
integer	unsigned
not ok means the static analysis tool did complain -- claiming that some operand of a bitwise operation is not an unsigned integer

7400292
put	get
it s been a while since i ve used hashtable for anything significant but i seem to recall the get and put methods being synchronized

7400327
put	get
it is threadsafe because the get put contains methods etc are synchronized

rss	feed
i would like to place some articles and tutorials on this site and feel that it would be nice to offer an rss feed for both

7400433
queue	fifo
you probably want to have a fifo fifo queue

7400440
temporary	tablespace
based on the fact that it works when removing the group by my guess is that mysmallts is also assigned as the default temporary tablespace for that user

7400440
temporary	tablespace
building the intermediate result will be done in the temporary tablespace and when using the group by this gets too big for mysmallts

7400447
rss	feed
yes you can have an rss feed for any site but preferably for one that you are adding or changing from time to time

7400459
int	chars
this is because in c the resulting type of an operation on two unsigned chars s is int

7400477
width	height
also tried with specifying the avassetwriterinput settings to quicktimemovie width height bitrate

7400480
int	chars
nothing in c is done below int eg when adding two unsigned chars even before the addition the operands are converted to int according to the default promotions

7400480
int	chars
in the last line first u1 and u2 are converted to int then the + operator is applied to obtain a int value and then that value is converted back to unsigned chars of course the compiler can use shortcuts

7400528
stdout	stderr
the standard method of logging in my experience is to use either the stdout or stderr streams

7400528
stdout	stderr
you re moving the standard output stream stdout which is used by cout to output.txt in write mode and you re moving stderr which is used by cerr to error.txt also in write mode

7400599
put	get
you have to put all needed elements into the parcel and get it from it later

7400605
rss	feed
it s a little tougher with static sites to get an rss feed because you can end up duplicating content unless you re prepared to add another tool to your site generation or do a little bit of programming and probably in a language different from the ones you re currently using.

7400605
rss	feed
but if you just write an rss feed on top of what you re doing right now you ll obviously be duplicating some or all of the site content which isn t ideal

7400605
rss	feed
so i d suggest that what you need is a way of taking your content and transforming it into an rss feed -- or vice versa

7400605
rss	feed
when i created a static-content site with an rss feed the way i did it was to start with the rss feed

7400605
rss	feed
then i wrote some code that would take the rss feed and create my html articles from it -- in my case i used xslt to transform the rss into a series of html files but you could use any technology you want

7400605
rss	feed
then whenever i wanted to add an article to my static site i d edit the rss feed just to add a new article with a new date etc

7400605
rss	feed
to it and there are tools around for various platforms for creating rss feed manually like this. then i d run my code which would burn my html articles so i d always end up with static articles and an rss feed in line with each other and only one source copy of the content

7400605
rss	feed
there s also tools out there for various platforms that can automate or semi-automate generating an rss feed from a bunch of stuff on disk which is a way of approaching the problem from the other direction

7400605
rss	feed
my answer therefore is that unless you re prepared to add another language or tool apart from css html and javascript to your repertoire there s no very satisfactory way to add an rss feed to a static site

7400616
decoder	encoder
or create own encoder decoder functionality

7400632

one notable exception are the special file descriptors 0 1 and 2 stdin stdout and stderr but even for those you usually use the predefined constants rather than literal integer values

7410315
width	height
you should make these members location width height properties instead and you should also make them virtual like the other properties

super	implements
clone is kept in object class because in your clone implementation it is advised that you call super s clone this can happen only if the super class has a clone function even if its not marked cloneable by implements cloneable hence keeping the clone function in object makes sense

7412289
width	height
the + 2 to the width and height values are a fudge factor to account for the width of the datagridview s interior elements

you seem confused about the use of public protected etc

7412495
public	protected
programming against interfaces or using access modifiers like public protected or private has no performance impact

7412522
hide	show
assign for every uiimage and uibutton the same tag by settag proprieties then when you click on a specific uibutton search the array and tag the tag that related to the selected uibutton then use the retrieve tag to retrieve the uiimage and use the proprieties sethidden to hide show it

you must put much bigger effort to analysis of the problem if you want to get answer including which periods cause problem what timezones are used etc

7412857
width	height
a quick check to see if this is a related problem is to set the height and width properties of the datagrid to a fixed size for the duration of the test and try running again

7412859
google-chrome	firefox
a tip is to use firefox with firebug or google-chrome or any browser that has a console it will help you debug codes like this in the future super fast and super easy

7412866

7412979
opera	google-chrome
please see this jsfiddle jsfiddle.net ymtgj but both google-chrome and opera fail setting up the right widths and as a result there one pixel gap between the two divs as you can see from see image i.stack.imgur.com o9zxw.png can t google-chrome and opera handle the float properly

7413216
ireport	subreports
using ireport v4.0.1 with jasperserver v4.1.0 i m trying to find a syntax for linking subreports to the main report that lets me test it in ireport then deploy to the server through the repository browser

7413216
ireport	subreports
the default syntax for subreports in ireport for the subreports expression is something like

7413216
ireport	subreports
that s great but unfortunately it then edits the file in ireport to save this change which means you can no longer run the report in ireport without manually re-editing all the subreports expressions - this makes the process of testing and deploying to the server really painful particularly when there are multiple subreports in a report

7413226
put	get
i see that i can put cookies to webview but i dont know how to get them from browser

7413253
try-catch	exception-handling
or you can handle the exception-handling at another level of your application wrap the call to getallversions into a try-catch block

7413259

what you can do next is to delete unneeded rows with country names and headers or use another formula on another sheet to duplicate the data except when unwanted rows you can then filter the blank data in the pivot chart

7413294
cobertura	jenkins
after a while it showed to be too unflexible and configuring sonar is a mess so we moved from sonar to jenkins hudson plugins like cobertura for code coverage or pmd for code style

with the upcoming ssl migration at facebook on 1 october all apps will have to support connections over https and for that you ll need an ssl certificate

7413355

sscanf with the x format specifier wants an int pointer not a chars one

7413358
integer	unsigned
x matches an unsigned hexadecimal integer

7413363

the only thing you need to be aware of is that you can t use any graphical and ui classes as swing and awt

7413365
pull	push
ideally you d want to initiate a pull of data from the device when it receives a push notification from your server

7413381
int	chars
as the number now is an int you can use it in string context and extract the first two chars which will be the first two digits if the number is not negative

7413396
google-chrome	safari
you could use an rgba value for the border-color but then you get dark corners in google-chrome and safari i think where the borders overlap

7413489
hide	show
of course show hide of it depends on your app logic

7413500
appdata	uninstaller
app now works great but when the app updates from market it crashes unless the appdata is removed or v1 is uninstaller first

7413527
portrait	landscape
i m implementing uitableviewcontroller that displays one cell in portrait mode and two cells in landscape mode

7413548
width	height
the cons are that you can t user without knowing the height and width of the div you re going to create

7413555
width	height
but while i can specify the tilegroup to use 100 width and height and set the number of rows and columns to 3

7413580

the first team will be a push pull self-organising team of people who can make changes at will

7413648
getter	setter
do your class with all the fields and getter setter that you need

7413648
getter	setter
do a child class that inherits from the previews one and since the field isn t accessible you force the use of the getter setter pair

7413652
firefox	safari
chromium firefox oop webkit2 and almost certainly safari s oop mode which is what you are getting in 64-bit treat npn_forceredraw as a no-op

7413673

when i run it locally on jetty and make the client request the data then the visualvm profiler points out that sun.rmi.transport.tcp.tcptransport.connectionhandler.run consumes 80 of the cpu time

7413675
svg	vml
the reason it works with ie is because it transparently detects the browser and switches to drawing the graphics using vml instead of svg

7413683
getter	setter
this can be a problem when we try to force all co- authors to go through the getter setter because those method do some conversion checking or bookkeeping stuff

7413683
getter	setter
you d have to create an annotation and the annotation processor code to ensure that it is a compile time error if the field is used outside of it s getter setter method

7413692
getter	setter
in the worst case they remove your getter and setter and just put in a public field instead

7413692
getter	setter
then private fields are of course only accessed via setter and getter

7413692
getter	setter
you could move the data into a different class and use your getter and setter to access the data in the other class

7413711
margin	height
as soon as the element is visible it has a margin which is not included in the height animation

7413762

7413900
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
open the file with a fileinputstream then use an inputstreamreader with the utf-8 charset to read characters from the stream and use a bufferedreader to read lines via bufferedreader#readline which will give you a string

7413918
for-loop	loops
can only reiterate in this case you re pushing back an empty vector in a for-loop and accessing the data within the same loops using i so you must change it to

7413991

7414209
put	get
when doing a put or delete with an if-match header in case the etag sent by a client indicates staleness rather than just returning a 412 i d like to return the whole up-to-date entity including its new etag in the http header so the client does not have to perform another get round trip which they otherwise would certainly do - in my use-case at least they d do in probably 100 of the cases

7414224
translation	localization
a long time ago iirc it was delphi 5 borland released a translation repository file for its own localization tool supporting some languages but not chinese though

7414292
hide	show
instead of popping up a new window and populating it with the bits you re wanting to print a better solution would be to print as standard window.print and use a print media stylesheet to show hide the portions of the page you want printable

7414302
width	height
therefore wrap images with and set background color and color of this outer div and provide alt alternative text for image note also that images with empty src do not preserve width and height while rendered by the browser

7414372
client-side	server-side
a solution would be to build the dynamic form server-side -- if it really needs to be client-side i think you need to manipulate the form stored in document.forms in addition to the dom

7414395
textarea	textbox
this will be stored until the user closes the present textarea or textbox

7414395
textarea	textbox
if the user opens up a new textbox or a new textarea types something the new usercontent will be stored in the buffer memeory the old buffer will be deleted

7414617
folder	directory
i guess i could create separate folder for each file but i d like a clean and flat directory structure

7414636
google-chrome	firefox
now everything works fine on firefox and google-chrome because change event is fired when a user leaves the field he presses tab screen disabler pops up and asks to wait a bit and after ajax is finished my javascript handles the tab order of the next element correctly

7414636
google-chrome	firefox
in ie change event for drop-down is fired differently then on firefox google-chrome

7414699

7414783
equals	gethashcode
i know there are other ways i can go about doing this - create an internedstring class which holds a reference to the string but does not implement equals or gethashcode or store indexes rather than strings with each object but i m now curious - is there actually a way to implement a generic referenceequalitycomparer

7414802

7415433
x86	64bit
1 gigahertz ghz or faster 32-bit x86 or 64bit x64 processor

7415540
opengl-es	glreadpixels
opengl-es you can t you could draw the texture to a framebuffer and use glreadpixels though

7415590
int	boolean
it is my understanding that commonly a boolean is stored as an int in a jvm implementation

7415612
spaces	delimiter
these unnecessary characters usually include white spaces characters new line characters comments and sometimes block delimiter which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute

7415617

7415785
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a custom uiviewcontroller is allocated and pushed onto a uinavigationcontroller s stack

7415785

it turned out that the first uiviewcontroller was passed as a delegate to the uinavigationcontroller hence my confusion when the zombie call was coming from the navigation controller itself

7415827
ffmpeg	libav
it may be possible by using libav aka ffmpeg library.you can decode the .flv file into some other formate and use it

7415847
getter	setter
there are some bits you can skip - i left out all the getter and setter as its just me using the code

7415864
getter	setter
i then instantiate windowsphonesettings in app.xaml.cs and make a public getter and setter for it

7415909
udp	tcp
tcp and udp do not have addresses specific to them as such rather the ip level has different sizes of address for ipv4 and ipv6

7415928

7416041
hide	show
it manipulates with the background-color of the form field to show hide the label

7416071
folder	directory
it sounds like your program is getting database connection settings from a file which is in the same folder as the program and your code is just assuming it will find this file in the current directory

7416076
sorting	grouping
i think that after sorting yo may use regular expression to find your grouping transition

7416093
implements	extends
the clientsocket class is extended by thread and implements runnable i ve also tried just extends or implements

7416130
pull	push
then git pull and git push will do the right things

7416138
int	double	int	boolean
i am quite certain that this will only work with native types like string int float double boolean etc but not enumerations

7416183
int	chars
for instance the string defined by chars s hello world in c and a c statement like int debug 1 outside the main would be stored in initialized read-write area

7416183
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
the heap area is managed by malloc realloc and free which may use the brk and sbrk system calls to adjust its size note that the use of brk sbrk and a single heap area is not required to fulfill the contract of malloc realloc free

since jaxb is attempting to instantiate an instance of the abstract super class foo.bar.base it appears as though your xml message does not contain enough information to specify the correct sub-type to be unmarshalled

you could convert nsstring into nsdata with the rest of your code is ok

7416417

we had a similar problem with our google+1 buttons disappearing in google-chrome only no problems in firefox ie safari

7416456

you can check many links on the internet about updatepanel not working in google-chrome or safari also i believe i saw similar questions here in so.

7416940

what happens is that i d like to have two kinds of openfiledialog savefiledialog the default ones from windows api and custom ones with special features that suits my business scenario

7417076
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
i need it like this because i m also using third-party controls devexpress for example and i need that when any of the devexpress controls calls openfiledialog or savefiledialog the same business rule should be applied to define if the default or custom dialog will be shown

7417076
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
so everytime that anyone in my application scope calls openfiledialog or savefiledialog this business rule should be triggered to find out the correct dialog to show default one or custom one

7417445
setinterval	settimeout
you should be using settimeout instead of setinterval

setinterval is fired even tho the ajax response may not be finished after those 5 seconds may i recommend you using settimeout after you have slidedown your new content

7417450
width	margin
when inspecting element i can see what looks like padding being that it is between the width of the box and the content but setting padding to 0px and margin to 0px does nothing the list starts further into the header than it should

7417453
setinterval	settimeout
change your setinterval by the settimeout function

7417460
inherited	properties
the properties you are setting are common to all through since they all inherited from uiviewcontroller

7417498
accessor	properties
as for thatâ s a combination of the prefix increment operator ++ an array literal defining an array with single element that is itself an empty array and a properties accessor called on the array defined by the array literal

7417514
opera	firefox
i m assuming you haven t overridden all of those stylesheet definitions for your list so you could include a so-called reset stylesheet - the one from eric meyer is very popular - or further inspect what is formatting your list by using tools such as firebug for firefox or dragonfly for opera

7417537
post	get
obviously for get i could use geturl url target but i can t find any similar functions for post

7417541

i would recommend that you create a new uiviewcontroller subclassing that implements tabtitle and use that as the superclass for each of your custom controllers

7417664

is the ability to use them as getter and setter in classes which was always a nightmare to achieve before javascript can be used in the same way but they do both act almost identically from what i ve seen

7417666
sproutcore	cappuccino
so in other words with sproutcore and cappuccino and other full-blows mvc javascript frameworks you can let your client do what it does best render and display html css and javascript while leaving your server to worry about what it does best retrieve store and update data

client-side	server-side
i have written an article about the differnt approaches between server-side mvc and client-side mvc here

try setting the width with the view port meta tag and make sure the html body and map div are all set to 100 height and 0 margin padding

7417767

you might as well come up with a schema where you can pull the data from the service to your data store let users play with it then push the data back when they re done

7417775

- how can i get the string url so i can put it in here

7417802

7417837
mkmapview	mkannotationview
i want to use a custom image as a map where each pixel is considered the coordinates much as mkmapview uses a google maps map together with mkannotationview

7417876

7417987
post	get
when i get information from a post form the html form adds slashes before random characters

7418002
mdpi	hdpi
your normal sized image should be optimized for mdpi 160dpi while the ldpi image is 25 smaller 120dpi and the hdpi image is 50 larger 240dpi

7418002
mdpi	hdpi
so even if you only have a hdpi image and no ldpi mdpi android will scale it down on devices with low ressolution displays and it should look passable

7418076
ddms	adb
use the file explorer of the eclipse ddms plugin or the adb shell command from your android platform tools to browse and delete the file system on your device

7418119
src	attr
i ve tried setting the attr src tag for the cropbox id but it needs to execute the php code inside first

7418494

put	get
the problem is i try to the get the data i put into the intent after the picture had been taken but it always says that the intent is null.pointer.exception

7418518
cpu	processors
i am guessing that even reading from shared data in openmp causes some parallel overheads as depending on processors architecture if different cores have their own cache... it may be necessary to refresh the cache to ensure that no other cpu has modified the data before reading

7418530
int	double
i have tried using double floats and int

7418537
button	checkbox
the capturing works well for all other widgets button checkbox ... but my glwidget remains blank to the normal user it is fully responsive

7418743
getter	setter
and i want to use setter and getter functions but i cant access them here is my code

7418745
hide	show
however the principle to make it work is to hide your page from view in css or with inline styles as the css will still have to load then once everything is ready in javascript show it all again

7418745
hide	show
that is because they hide the page the javascript loader loads then once the rest of the javascript has finished it hide the loader and show the page

7418778
filtering	grouping
this leads me to the question of if i can filtering or grouping results based on the highlighted snippets that are returned

7418807

using instrumentation within xcode to profiling my code i always get a leak here

7418975
google-chrome	firefox
according to the discussions they did create it for firefox which it works in some people have commented it doesn t work in google-chrome so you might be looking at a solution that needs to target different browsers your question doesn t specify if it must work in google-chrome just that you were using it

7418975
mouseup	mousedown
this is what they are using to select the unread messages it looks like they are simulating the mousedown and mouseup events on each item

7419000
ubuntu	linux
i m using a linux ubuntu 10.10 vm

7419003
trie	dawg
what you do instead is you build a trie data structure out of the dictionary or if you re really buff you build a dawg -- a directed acyclic word graph -- which is a sort of compressed trie.

7419003
trie	dawg
once you have a trie dawg it becomes very inexpensive to test every word in the dictionary against a given rack because you can prune out whole huge branches of the dictionary that the rack cannot possibly match

7419003
trie	dawg
don t forget that of course you only have to compute the trie dawg once if the dictionary is not changing over time

7419003
trie	dawg
you can optimize the memory usage by building a dawg out of the trie

7419034
put	get
also when i click on link that wants to open new tab or window i want to get the url and put it into iframe.src

7419044

7419178
min	max
ie get count min max etc for last 15mins 1 hour 1 day 1 week 1 month etc

7419230
put	get
the data label wont be above the line itself i took the higher angle of the point and put the data label in higher-angle 2 - so it will be in the middle of the higher angle - i succeed to get the higher-angle but didn t succeed to get the position on graph in pixels relatively

7419242
gridview	rowdatabound
when populating the gridview you should populate each dropdownlist in the rowdatabound event

7419319
slider	jcarousel
you can simulate a fading effect even though jcarousel knows only to scroll the slider

7419330
range	max
you can t store a number bigger than what your underlying data type could hold so that fact that the range attribute requires a max value is a very good thing

7419356
opera	safari
note opera 9.3 and safari 3 do not support url values

7419361
hide	show
you can make your code more dry by making this into one function - pass it an array of all the selectors and the one you want to leave out then on click loop through that array and if it matches the one you want to leave out show it if not hide it

7419399
pop-up	dialog
if an unhandled exception occurs somewhere in an external dll visual studio pop-up a dialog box that lets me select the path of its source code so that it can show me the exact line which caused the exception

7419411
width	height
you could also just change the height and width to make something bigger smaller

7419465
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito

bazaar	svn
how can i accomplish this so that the meta-data and individual commits are properly converted to bazaar with the same granularity as they happen on the svn side

7419491
google-chrome	firefox
the main point of jplayer is so that you can use html5 with flash fallback so you should leverage the html5 of firefox and google-chrome not depending on it falling back to flash

7419491
mp3	ogg
firefox doesn t support mp3 on html5 they support ogg which is better anyway

7419491

i have a directory dst directory which has files and folder in it and i have src directory which also has files and folder in it

7419665
folder	directory
the same applies for some folder moving a folder and merging the contents with the same folder in dst directory

7419665
folder	directory
solved i solved my problem by using distutils.dir_util.copy_tree src dst this copies the folder and files from src directory to dst directory and overwrites merges where neccesary

7419683
put	get
i set monument.infobox right there in the loop and if i put a breakpoint on the line marked breakpoint 1 i can see that monument.infobox changes on every loop iteration yet when i get to breakpoint 2 which doesn t get executed until the event fires it references the last infobox i created not the infobox that i attached to that pin when attaching the event handler

7419731
carrierwave	paperclip
i m looking at changing to paperclip carrierwave or dragonfly for file uploads or maybe a rails 3 compatible maintained version of attachment_fu

my app needs to store a lot of small videos and images in a cache folder for this reason im using the standard sdcard android cache directory

7419788
int	chars
in which case you can convert a chars to its equivalent int value as follows

if your chars array already holds the int value for each digit then you can of course skip the conversion and jump straight to the base-10 maths

7419829
getter	setter
it relates to getter setter method names

7419841
filesystems	fat
since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting it permission based way would be more convoluted

7420386
post	get
i am able to get the selected value in the post back

7420410
width	height
your super.onmeasure widthmeasurespec heightmeasurespec uses the passed in values i would think you would want these to be the actual measured width and height

7420473
for-loop	loops
i guess you could add another for-loop on the target_alphabet inside the existing for-loop and check for the characters not be same with a small if condition and continue the inner loops if same or break if not

7420494
post	get
i was able to do a get request but can t figure out how to work around the fact that google places has a nested parameter to post into

7420537
margin	height
you can perform the same type of operations for the height to get its margin border and padding

7420544
nsmanagedobject	nspersistentstore
basically you need to make sure that your background thread doesn t use the same nsmanagedcontext it must create a new one from the same nspersistentstore and doesn t pass nsmanagedobject between threads only pass object ids back to the ui thread not the objects themselves

i can t exactly put the finger on the problem in your code most probably it fails because mouseout event for link fires before mouseover event for the menu

7420628
ssl	https
unfortunately i can only post 2 hyperlinks so you ll have to swap the http protocol with https to see how each player renders under ssl

how can i make the mirror seamless on pull and get it out of the way on push

7420672
put	get
if i put my ip i get the same response but works if i put my host name

7420726
range	minimum
the simplest way to do this is to compute a box with a minimum maximum latitude and minimum maximum longitude and use between to exclude everything outside of those range

7420739
puts	gets
when ajax gets back from making the request it has all the html code of what goes in the window it creates a new div element and uses document.body.appendchild to add the element to the document and puts the html code into the div tag

7420799
getter	setter
i understand that it s to use setter for instance variables but are ther any reasons to use getter istead of direct access

there s a rich choice of open free full java ee servers available check out glassfish jboss geronimo or jonas

7420884
mouseup	mousedown
you re not far off with your mousedown event handler but probably better to catch mouseup as this is the event that will fire when they have finished selecting

7420885
postgresql	mysql
last but not the least i will be using either mysql or postgresql as the backend database but would prefer the approach to be db agnostic - if possible

7420897
width	font-size
i m using sass scss and want to create a function mixin which will figure the max possible font-size for a container given a dynamic width

7420897
fontfamily	font-size	letter-spacing	fontfamily	letter-spacing	font-size
i set it to 12.3em which would be 123px relative to the font-size of the tag but that could change depending on letter-spacing fontfamily or other aspects

7420917
inherited	properties
doctrine supports inherited so you should create two different entities that share a common parrent say abstractvote which defines all properties

7420936
min	max
however i would not be concerned with the data being sparse in this case - there are relatively few columns involved especially if you have only one min max per weekday per product

7420939
many-to-many	one-to-many
imo things can get a little confusing when dealing with entities that have a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

7420950
post	get
i can t seem to get the variable post name to work

7421058
unicorn	webrick
6 run unicorn -e production or rails s -e production if you re on webrick and visit root url

7421104
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that in ie all versions if i press enter with invalid input for some reason both the keypress and blur events are fired i suspect it s the alert box but it doesn t do this on firefox google-chrome and it shows two of the same alert box

7421104
google-chrome	firefox
edit in firefox google-chrome i now noticed that a second alert box appears when i click anywhere after i try to validate with enter

7421167
post	get
the funny thing is if i copy the form into a local mamp installation and run it i get post

7421190
getter	setter
the reason you re getting a warning from the analyzer is that a getter method is not required to actually return the exact same object as what you passed in to the setter

7421190
getter	setter
in short never assume that a getter returns the same object you passed to the setter

7421212
gif	png
this matches the lower quality of a gif or an 8-bit png but because you re not using those formats you should use imagecreatetruecolor docs instead

7421214
cpu	processors
should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory

7421233
firefox	safari
i see a memory leak in all broswers that i ve tried ie safari firefox

7421261
width	height
the above plot can also be generated with sectorchart although this plot is primarily intended to show varying width and height of the data and isn t fine-tuned for plots where you have fixed-width sectors and you want to highlight directions and data counts in those directions

7421266
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
it is a generic solution thus it works with most popular version control systems such as cvs svn bazaar mercurial git darcs and some others

7421303
google-chrome	firefox
anyway current versions of google-chrome and firefox do not have this upper boundary

7421303
opera	safari
however opera and safari are still in the old days

7421303
google-chrome	firefox
then again if you are testing older versions of ie firefox or even google-chrome then you ll run into the 4kb limit as well

7421391
superclass	subclassing
you can t cast ordinary pointers between incomplete subclassing and superclass either

7421393
google-chrome	firefox
modern versions of firefox and google-chrome do this natively - they cache images and code whenever they can

7421412
free	realloc
freeing memory with free or realloc doesn t mean at all that it is returned to the system

7421441
prepare	execute
if you want to execute the same query multiple times with different parameters use prepare statements

7421454
lxml	elementtree
that would require using the elementtree or lxml modules instead

7421461
children	parent
this can be done but rabbitmq doesn t do it automatically you need to manage the lifecycle yourself by wrapping the children messages in a parent message

7421546
post	get
once i finally found the time to get back on here and look up the referenced post it had been updated to say that the fix was no longer needed

7421554
int	double
stick with double values and use a double-precision sin function or scale the number to a value less than about 6 int digits before converting to float

7421559
calloc	malloc
you can use calloc instead of malloc to clear the allocated memory to zero

7421564
memset	malloc
you will need to do a memset after allocating memory using malloc

7421564
calloc	malloc
when should you use malloc over calloc or vice versa

7421564
calloc	malloc
since calloc sets the allocated memory to 0 this may take a little time so you may probably want to use malloc if that performance is an issue. ofcourse one most profile their usage to see if this really is a problem

7421605
redmine	trac
i am looking for something similar to trac or redmine but i would also like subtasking my tasks as well

7421606
accessor	properties
then in the vm the properties that was changed steps through that class inpc as part of the set accessor and this time propertychanged is not null so the propertychanged method is invoked

7421606
accessor	properties
for the result properties however inpc is not raised that properties doesn t have inpc invoked by the other properties s set accessor

7421612
jar	war
as a result i ve added the slf4j-api.jar 1.6 jar to my war file bundle

7421630
width	height
unfortunately the ipad screen and the iphone screen don t have the same proportions ipad s width height ratio is 0.75 and iphone s is 0.66

7421676
width	height
by default the width is set to 320 points and the height is set to 1100 points

7421742
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie but does not work in firefox or google-chrome

7421785
hide	show
see this code sample on showwindow or sendmessage which tells an external window to show or hide itself

7421786
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
and then use a basic fileoutputstream to output since as i understand it the objectoutputstream is used to serialize a object to binary and does not have inherent support for json

7421828
hide	show
how to use the showwindow api to hide and show a form

7421840

7421916
rsa	aes
those are security protocols that use cryptographic algorithms like rsa and aes

7421926
width	height
again the data sizes almost correclty when the grid is created then changing the column width within the grid does not resize the row height as the item renderer adjusts to its new width

7421926
width	height
smaller width column some renderers have hit max height and are creating scroll bars the last renderer is still using the measured height of the label

7421971
memcpy	strcpy
to make this work for suitably loose definitions of work you would need to use either the strcpy or memcpy library functions

7422000
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
if you happen to have a requirement for a newly allocated block of memory you can call memset after calling malloc or you can use calloc instead of malloc

7422025
width	height
as mentioned by others setting height or width to x means x of the container and not of the background-image

7422035
hide	show
you may notice some white squares i just made a quick edit in this picture to hide the directories and images as i can t show them

7422054
free	malloc
using malloc free is discouraged in c++ and so i was wondering

7422064
google-chrome	safari
somehow i had the same issue always in google-chrome but not in safari

7422067
free	malloc
the code was tested with a large linked list about 6 millon nodes each 16 bytes in sizes against a naive malloc free scheme and performed roughly 15 faster than that

7422081
clang	llvm
i m using apple clang version 2.0 tags apple clang-139 based on llvm 2.9svn

7422088
range	max
in this case the complete dataset can be retrieved by setting all the range to the max values

7422147
post	get
that will get you only direct child li s with a class of post that are direct children of a ul that is a direct child of a div with a class of bloglist

7422183
decoder	encoder
in addition to the baseline specification the encoder and decoder support packbits modified huffman and ccitt bilevel encodings fax jpeg-in-tiff per tiff technical note #2 and deflate compression schemes can handle images with 16- and 32-bit integral samples and 32-bit floating point samples and can read and write tiled images of all supported data types

7422184
postgresql	mysql
however client server database engines such as postgresql mysql or oracle usually support a higher level of concurrency and allow multiple processes to be writing to the same database at the same time

7422184
postgresql	mysql
your best bet is to pick a few like sqlite postgresql mysql and see the performance implications of each by running some tests which simulate common scenarios you will encounter in you application

7422212
pop-up	dialog
you can use that to render a facebook pop-up with the share dialog inside.

width	height
i would like to know if it s possible to force the camera to send video in landscape mode width height

7422459
portrait	landscape
what i want is to have the mobile in portrait mode but i want to show the video in landscape format of course it will be resized to fit in the screen as your screen is on portrait mode

7422459
portrait	landscape
i think of some possibilities and maybe to force the camera to record in landscape mode even if the phone is in portrait mode

7422467

vsto	add-in
is there a way to run a vsto add-in in excel in a client machine running without having vsto runtime installed

7422539
stdout	stderr
note that this only opens kernel handles so you would need to use _open_osfhandle and _fdopen to connect stdout stderr to your console

7422574
post	get
i m building a website where i want to pull a pages wall post which is publicly available you don t need to be logged into fb to see its contents however when i try to get the data using the open graph protocol using

7422895
hide	show
how i can know if i am editing or adding in order to hide show the fields

7422911
mousemove	mousedown
however you can certainly detect a mousedown event on the mask and use that to cause the window s mousemove event to adjust the position of the underlying image

7422911
mousemove	mouseup
you would then use a mouseup event to end the drag the window s mousemove event would no longer affect the position of the image

7422912
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
with caliburn.micro i d like to know the pros and cons of exposing an ef4 entity as a property of the viewmodel a technique discussed here and here

7422912
getter	setter
this allows me to avoid writing getter and setter for every field see onecustomer below

7422919
folder	directory
i d like to specify a list of files and directory and commands to execute when a file or folder changes

7422967
lwjgl	slick2d
slick2d is a wrapper around the lwjgl opengl library for java

public class lightsoutactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener

7422976
folder	directory
your other folder contains an asp.net application which has a web.config directory

7422983
apache	nginx
there is nothing native to a node.js installation or app built with it that ensures it s started in the run-levels unlike nginx or apache

7423024
mouse	keyboard
users will not have access to a keyboard or mouse

7423025
std	ostream
a i don t know anything about ollydbg but in all cases std ostream makes it s own copy of text before foo returns so any changing of the variables after the call will not affect the output

7423078
inherited	properties
i tend to have my viewmodels inherited from dependencyobject and ensure that they are constructed on the ui thread which poises them perfectly to handle this situation - they have a dispatcher properties that corresponds to the ui thread s dispatcher

7423088
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve got a uitabbarcontroller which contains a uinavigationcontroller

7423208
boost	allocator
this works fine until i try to change from using boost interprocess allocator to boost interprocess cached_node_allocator

7423211
folder	directory
i have deleted the virtual directory all temp files in the framework folder and recreated the project on the server and i still get the same error

7423259
ivar	subclassing
did you subclassing uitableview or do you mean this is an ivar of your uitableviewdatasource

7423263
min	max
it is more that the annotation value of min and max is of type long so it can not express any number with decimal places

7423264
getter	setter
getter or setter if you want

7423270
client-side	server-side
how should i manage this combination of client-side server-side interaction

7423285
post	put
in order to deal with a large request body in a http post or put relying on httpservletrequest.getcontentlength is not a good idea since it returns only integer values or -1 for request bodies 2gb

7423296
accessor	properties
a private accessor the properties is declared in a nameless category called an extension so that it is private and not visible to outside classes

7423298

because i have to install multiple versions of python on multiple oracle linux servers which are built via a kickstart process i wanted to build a python rpm for our yum repository

7423300
put	get
like many rpm newbies i get the build part but i don t really grok what happens at the end of rpmbuild and what actually gets put into the rpm file other than the files you specify in files and then what actually happens when you do the rpm install

7423337
hide	show
at this point the idea is just to allow the user to tap one image to reveal what is under it and then when they tap another image it briefly hide the second one and then show both again

7423341
gif	png
jpeg gif and png upload just fine this problem seems to be only with tiffs

7423380
nhibernate	queryover
from what i can read in the nhibernate docs i might be able to solve it by adding some a hint to my queryover chain requesting an explicit lock

7423396
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should add the uinavigationcontroller instance to the uitabbarcontroller and then add a table view controller to the rootviewcontroller property of the uinavigationcontroller instance which should make your life a lot easier

7423396
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller instances are created programmatically and added to the window

7423396
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this will add the detail view uiviewcontroller subclass to the uinavigationcontroller instance s view hierarchy for you and animate the transition

7423411
onkeyup	onblur
i would attach a onkeyup and onblur event handler to the various text fields

7423433
vsto	add-in
the vsto runtime supplies the com wrappers around iextensibility2 that is ultimately what excel exposed for add-in functionality

7423433
vsto	add-in
you have to have vsto installed for your add-in to work in excel

7423433
vsto	add-in
however if your add-in dll exports other functions that other apps might use and they don t involve vsto i +think+ you could just drop that dll on a machine without vsto and it d still be usable

7423488
dictionary	map
map aka dictionary are key value pairs

7423512
rss	feed
i m making an app that needs to be able to read an rss feed offline

7423524
google-chrome	safari
i m getting some parts of background not changing color properly in google-chrome and safari

7423553
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both give similar errors that the page isn t re-directing properly in a way that will never complete - a redirect loop

7423586
width	height	hide	show
if you want to handle show hide of imm virtual keyboard window from your activity you ll need to subclass your layout and override onmesure method so that you can determine the measured width and the measured height of your layout

7423586
hide	show
now you ll be able to handle imm show hide window events

7423592
typedef	struct
to check for the java null in objective-c i can use kcfnull which is a typedef to some struct as far as i can remember

7423639
ddms	adb
i deleted adb file 0 kb without extension and ddms ran ok again

7423656
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uinavigationcontroller pushes through two uiviewcontroller then a uitabbarcontroller your third

7423656
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller contains some view controllers one or more of which is a uinavigationcontroller

7423693
rss	feed
to grab the data in a most simple way is just to get its rss feed which should be publicly available for everyone example

7423698
roxygen	vignette
for further details on the basics of documenting functions there is a wiki in progress the old roxygen vignette as well as the roxygen2 development site on github

7423706
width	height
the affect is that the nicely centered page keeps on shifting by the width of the scroll-bar when the user just selects another navigation link - what s the easiest way to stop this happening without making all my web pages the same height

7423710
post	get
i am getting undefined as a value using the code below when i try to get the value of a textbox after a post

7423731
udp	tcp
put both udp and tcp servers on different threads

7423733
udp	tcp
you can use both tcp and udp sockets in this manner

7423739
inherited	properties
the basic idea of the oo and this is overly simplistic without going into massive amounts of inherited polymorphism etc is that you group together a collection of properties about a specific entity and methods that operate on a specific entity into a single class

7423763
width	font-size
the default width based on the parent font-size

7423763
google-chrome	safari
this solution has a known issue with webkit google-chrome safari browers

7423822
jobs	cron
the dillema for me is due to me having multiple tables containing the different content and that i do regular cron jobs to clean up delete hidden content i ll want the exp given for each action to be easily changable - so if one day i decide i m no longer going to be generous an give 50 points to those who post a topic and changed it to 2 all those who created a topic in the past will also be automatically effected so perhaps having the exp for a certain action be in a class or config file

7423834
min	max
that seems awkward since every range-type response carries with it the min and max

7423834
range	min	range	max	min	max
so a question that takes a 1-10 range would be a row in integerresponse with min 1 and max 10

7423834
min	max
hold a score and refer to the curried integerresponse with min and max set

7423844
ubuntu	debian
probably would run it on ubuntu debian machine

7423844
postgresql	mysql
also would prefer mysql over postgresql based on my experience level with mysql

7423871
width	height
alternative way you could attempt the same operation are to assign the value directly note the data property if memory serves me correct is height width depth format so

7423878
remoteview	appwidgetprovider
the basic foundation of an appwidgetprovider is that of a broadcastreceiver so you can create an intent with a custom intent myappwidgetprovider.action_next that will advance your cursor or index for your list or array to the next item and within onupdate render the remoteview to that you want to have display your data

7423901
getter	setter
the dot syntax is just a shortcut for calling getter and setter that is

7423901
getter	setter
you should generally only use the dot syntax when you re using getter and setter

7423909
maven	m2e
that way it s not resolved by maven but can be read by m2e

7423909
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
that way build-helper-maven-plugin add-sources would be called in eclipse without having you to change your pom.xml

7423918
for-loop	loops
when a for-loop executes it takes the name you give it and binds it in turn to each object in the iterable while running loops

7423941
superclass	subclassing
when nslog comes across the format specifier it sends a description message to the object that should should replace the token this is implemented in the superclass nsobject and can be overridden in the subclassing to get the desired output

7423964
post	get
i know how to get data sending requests with querys but i don t know how to send a post

7423982
google-chrome	firefox
turns out the following worked just fine for me in ie9 google-chrome 13 and firefox 6

7423991
width	height
if the parent layout has width height of fill_parent changing it to wrap_content might do the trick

7424010
children	parent
now i need to write the spouse sibling children grandchildren parent and grandparents function

7424014
versioning	upgrade
now when the time comes to upgrade to a later yii versioning you will need to bring your class in sync with cactiverecord again

7424018
uiview	uitouch	uiview	subviews
perhaps another helpful answer would be if you do get co-ordinates from a uitouch event then want to use this to center an image on these coordinates what would be the code you would use within a uiview subviews within a uinavigationcontroller based iphone app that would center the image properly..

7424040
macports	homebrew
you could save yourself a lot of trouble by installing a complete solution from a third-party distributor like macports or homebrew

7424067
ilist	icollection
i would like my news and post objects to have an ilist icollection comments property

7424075
rss	feed
i have an application that store rss feed in a sqlite database and it s ok

7424075
rss	feed
consider that if you save the .xml file you have to parse it every time for example when you want to show your rss feed into a list

7424105
folder	directory
the code below would not work even though i had the file in my fixture directory under the app folder

7424115
integer	radix
5 for each integer in the lower partition use its value as an index into the array bitfield and set the corresponding bool to true ie do a radix sort

7424122
tcombobox	tmemo
to that procedure you can pass any kind of tstrings be it the lines of a tmemo the items of a tlistbox or tcombobox or a simple standalone tstringlist

7424171
maven	pom.xml
add the following in the pom.xml if you are using maven

7424173
hide	show
jquery show and hide functions modified the styles

7424224
google-chrome	firefox
the effects work in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

7424226
google-chrome	firefox
and i have no problem with it working on google-chrome or firefox it has worked on every browser i have tested it on it also comes with really good instructions

7424272
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly when downloading the file with firefox google-chrome and ie but not with safari

7424292
width	height
you also need the geo-spatial information the coordinates of a reference pixel say the top left pixel corner and the scale the geographic width and height of the pixels and this information is not stored in the file

7424298
min	max
the database connection pool fairly configurable min max sizes growth rates etc

7424316
google-chrome	firefox
good luck with that to establish a rule if you re a browser vendor especially given the recent disappearing of menus bars etc on google-chrome and then firefox and maybe other browsers that may indicate that vendors are chasing a goal of fullscreen display i just press f11 if i want to and want my addressbar back but that s another story and that they will likely be reluctant of losing 20px horizontally

7424334
post	get
i can give out the full trace from the browser as well but i don t want this post to get too wordy

7424359
qevent	qwidget
from the other widgets you would either need to installeventfilter on them too or just reimplement the qwidget event qevent event function in your main widget and look for those events there

7424364
children	parent
using the parent as a key to the hash and using hget key field for a particular child or hkeys key for all the children

7424412
onresume	onpause
you could have a base activity that tells your alarmreceiver service that is in the foreground during onresume and that it is in the background during onpause

7424416
min	max
reading more carefully i see you did mention min max and average

7424420
width	height
next for the subsequent images right bottom of this first image using the width and height of the image i would find out the coordinates where the next image would be placed

7424431
g++	gcc
so i took the answers from here and wrote a tiny benchmarking program and threw it at gcc similar results would be expected for g++ i think at -o0 at -o1 he optimises everything away and my benchmark is broken

7424448
ssl	https
it needs to be configured to handle ssl traffic and direct the requests to your app http and https

7424448
apache	nginx
here you can use apache or nginx

7424448
apache	nginx
passenger sits as a plugin in apache nginx to handle requests through to your application

7424448
apache	nginx
the article shows you how to set it up for pow and nginx but setting up for apache and passenger isn t too dissimilar

7424449
hide	show
why don t you just put the show more content in it s own div and hide and show that instead then you can just make the top level div height auto

7424484
width	height
when you scale to a certain height width the image size can vary far too much for our needs

7424507
apache	nginx
make deploy just reset nginx apache etc

7424519
freebsd	linux	visualvm	jstat
the problem i m trying to monitor some home made java applications on my freebsd server this should apply to linux servers as well using visualvm and jstat but i can t get visualvm to list the processes on the server even after i forwarded the assigned and random jstat ports in my firewall and can see a connection being made using sockstat

7424527
visualvm	jstat
once the two tunnels were open i opened visualvm and right clicked on the local machine on the left side and chose add jstat connection

7424531
sorting	filtering
the problem occurs when i enable all the bells and whistles such as paging sorting filtering etc

7424531
filtering	grouping
it looks like it puts the grouping by filtering sort data in an eventargument post variable

7424537
min	max
basically i m trying to find the max value for step 1 and the min value of step one as well as min max for step 2

7424541
chunked	transfer-encoding
chunked is not a valid content-type although it is a valid transfer-encoding

7424564
post	get
i can see that the csrf token is being passed in the ajax get but i don t know why it would matter anyways since it s a get and not a post

7424603
google-chrome	firefox
it is the object in the top right it looks perfect in google-chrome but in firefox it is not lined up

7424606
setinterval	settimeout
you can make an anonymous function and call it immediately except you use the settimeout function instead of setinterval

7424606
setinterval	settimeout
note that depending on the behavior you desire or in some cases for performance it can be better to use settimeout over setinterval

7424609
min	max
it groups time by step then finds the min and max for each group

7424633
hash	salt
and a salt a publicly known value stored along the hash distinct for each hash password and entering in the password hashing process

7424633
hash	salt
the salt prevents an attacker from efficiently attacking several passwords using precomputed hash tables

7424637
ant	maven
try ant or maven

7424651
int	chars
unfortunately the year is surrounded by three chars and then followed by 5 int

7424651
int	chars
so i would remove sea or another string of three chars at the beginning and the string of five int at the back and be left with 2001 in a new column titled year_id

7424692
post	get
i made a facebook application that people use to share links from my webpage to their walls and now i need to get back a list of the post made through it during a pediod of time from sep

7424732
width	height
i ve made sure the left cap width and top cap height of the 2x image is double that of the normal image which is what i m setting in code but it doesn t work

7424753
rss	feed
using objective c you can parse an rss feed or call an api on a remote site if you have access to that api which returns a json xml to your app

7424753
rss	feed
s the best way to parse rss atom feed for an iphone application

7424763
ssl	https
then as long as you are submitting to an https page the data should be safe without needing to encrypt it first the message itself is encrypted using ssl in this case

7424784
int	boolean
is usually either bitwise-and on int arguments or non-short-circuiting logical and on boolean arguments

7424799
pydev	virtualenv
you really have to add the paths of the base interpreter when configuring the virtualenv interpreter in pydev in the command line when you start that interpreter and do an import sys

7424806
qmodelindex	qabstractitemview
if you haven t already done it you should redefine the qabstractitemview indexat function which returns the qmodelindex at a given position in the view

7424822
int	double
you should assign your variables as float or double to save the correct value instead of using int

7424867
google-chrome	firefox
i checked the relevant css all hand-coded via the google-chrome browser s web developer tools google-chrome s version of firefox s firebug and couldn t find anything relevant

7424889
spaces	delimiter
the following function segments the source string using spaces as delimiter then recognizes and cleans up your alt and src attributes by not appending spaces while assembling the result

7424892
children	parent
change your nesting from a vertical parent with horizontal children to a horizontal parent with vertical children however this opens up possible vertical positioning issues so i don t favor this option

7424894
stdout	stderr
system will not give you the stdout or stderr of the application in its return value

7424900
min	max
if your processor has a fast instruction for absolute value as the x86 does you can do a branchless min and max which will be faster than an if statement or ternary operation

7424912
width	height
you can use specific width and height for laout_width layout_height as in layout_width 150dip

7425028
textview	imageview
each view item contains several textview s and an imageview

7425028
textview	imageview
the imageview is set with an image downloaded from the net using a separate asynctask thread so i can display the listview with textview items first whilst the images appear as the thread downloads them

7425072
rss	feed
first of all you want to find an rss feed you can find some of espn links here once you have an rss url all you have to do is type it between the quotes in the following string

7425072
rss	feed
the url provided is used to get the current weather which is not what you want but all you have to do is change that to the rss feed url you want to display

7425086
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i have also see that someone say override getview in adapter and add onclicklistener to the view i don t know it will work or not on earth but why onitemclicklistener can not work

7425155
filtering	grouping
if you need to do filtering after the grouping use having

7425172
viewdidload	dealloc
load the cache in viewdidload and release it in viewdidunload and dealloc

7425215
google-chrome	firefox
edit i guess this bug is slightly different from the one in the question since it does occur in firefox ie google-chrome everything

7425231
fadein	fadeout
and i want the awesome to change into cool fantastic incredible and keep cycling with loop using fadeout fadein effect maybe

7425239
int	chars
i m writing a small command-line program that reads two floats an int and a small string 4 chars max from stdin

7425257
folder	directory
in few words what i would like to do is to do not change public aaa directory and files on the remote machine and thus to do not track those with git on my local machine so that when i deploy with capistrano those folder on the remote machine are untouched

7425296
firefox	safari
i can t cut the actual video to seven seconds and use the loop function within the video tag as firefox and mobile safari don t support it

7425314
min	max
i can then apply a max or min size when the image is uploaded

7425314
width	height
has anyone done this before and had the width and height of the preview pane change with the width and height of the crop tool

7425324
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu linux x86-64

7425408
mbunit	nunit
which is framework agnostic working very well with nunit xunit.net mbunit .

7425411
bluetooth	usb
what i am doing is in eclipse i am opening a new android project- create project from existing sample- bluetoothchatapp.then i clicked on run and the emulator got launched i have also connected my htc wildfire to the system and enabled usb debugging.when i clicked on the bluetooth chat icon on the emulator it says bluetooth not found.kindly help me on this as this is my very first try on android.thank you

7425421
folder	directory
there are frameworks that use a complex directory structure with many configuration folder and files

7425421
ubuntu	linux
the os is linux ubuntu and i do not use ide

7425425
google-chrome	firefox
all these images can display only in ie but the other browsers like mozilla firefox google-chrome

7425474
width	height
graphicsdeviceservice intptr windowhandle int width int height

7425493
google-chrome	firefox
however if your primary objective is to hide google-chrome firefox ie i don t think it can be done using white-hat methods

7425521
division	multiplication
when writing c++ code when i have to do division by a constant k from inside a loop i have often been able to squeeze out some gains in performance-critical code by defining outside the loop and using multiplication by ki inside the loop

7425522
google-chrome	firefox
everything works well in ie and firefox but on google-chrome is very laggy like it was loosing frames

7425528
decimal	ieee
i ve read a few texts and threads showing how to convert from a decimal to ieee 754 but i am still confused as to how i can convert the number without expanding the decimal which is represented in scientific notation

7425530
width	height
so the width and height of the tabs should be set to the size of the browser

7425536
hide	show
i don t know if this is related to your problem but i was running into some issues using only inputmethodmanager.togglesoftinput when devices would sometimes get out of sync and hide when i wanted to show and vice versa

7425536
hide	show
i ve had some success by taking advantage of the fact that while imm.showsoftinput won t show a keyboard imm.hidesoftinputfromwindow will reliably close one so when i want to show a keyboard i now call imm.hidesoftinputfromwindow followed by imm.togglesoftinput and use imm.hidesoftinputfromwindow by itself to hide one

7425536
onkeyup	onkeydown
and the keypresses get reported via the view s onkeyup and onkeydown methods

7425576
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested your site with google-chrome and firefox and i don t see any problem

7425598
width	height
the min-height and min-width for ie is the height and width but if you put width and height to your style other browsers will fix your div to height and width specified

7425608
decimal	ieee	addition	multiplication
converting a number from a decimal string to binary ieee is fairly straight-forward if you know how to do ieee floating-point addition and multiplication

7425608
decimal	ieee
now going backwards ieee - to decimal is a lot harder

7425622
folder	directory
and choosing not to copy to directory if it s already in the right folder in finder

7425637
post	get
according to this post controlling number of downloads on amazon s3 you can get the number of file downloads via the cloudfront api but it cant find any reference to this on the amazon site

7425675
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have a set of 3 that i need to change the class of each on mouseenter mouseleave and click

7425751
fast-forward	merge
so pay attention to the fast-forward merge that git uses by default don t forget to clean-up the history of branches you are about to merge that way into public branches

7425755
button	checkbox
i have made a simple paypal button generator with a checkbox and jquery to display form fields if checkbox is checked

7425756
filtering	grouping
as far as usage of these operator goes one possible approach would be to grouping all your sequence operator together same as linq queries where your sort of create a pipeline through which the collection elements gets processed one by one and then in the end if you need you can create the list from resulting seq as the list is created at the end of all the filtering mapping take etc work on seq and when the final data is ready you convert it to list

7425762
g++	gcc
the error message is from ld not from gcc or g++

7425762
g++	gcc
the gcc and g++ commands are a drivers that invokes the compiler the linker and other tools.

7425789
post	get
i am using this code in function.php to get post views count

7425851
keydown	keyup
1 i wonder whether it would be better to only move your character on keydown and stop him on keyup

7425856
udp	tcp	udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
udp tcp rtp rtsp mms blocking non-blocking should i use to stream the live and constantly changing video to to my web client

7425870
google-chrome	firefox
on browsers that support it they use history.pushstate i ve tested up-to-date google-chrome and firefox

7425931
postgresql	mysql	case-sensitive	case-insensitive
some databases oracle ibm db2 postgresql etc. will perform case-sensitive string comparisons by default others case-insensitive sql server mysql sqlite

7425943
free	malloc
if you only need to store the last list you should free the old memory in arr before malloc ing the new space

7425943
free	malloc
at the first set of data you don t have any existing malloc but it s always safe to free a null pointer so simply set the pointer to null at the start

7425948
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have not been able to repeat the bug on any other configuration including windows7 ie9 ie8 ie7 last 2 simulated with ietester windowsxp with ie8 firefox google-chrome safari etc

7425959
width	height
if you have empty div tags with requirements for min height width then perhaps you should use absolute positioning in css instead of keeping the div tags in the document flow

7425960
free	malloc
you re also leaking memory because you re not calling free on that you get back from malloc and you re losing track of what you read in every time you assign a new value to arr

7425967
width	height
the following query should give a result set that includes one row for each image that has greatest height or greatest width compared to all images and it will have the id and table name in the row along with the height and width

7425967
width	height
since the maximum height and width may not be from the same image there can t necessarily be just one row in the result with a single image id and table source

7426023
post	get
i don t know how to get wordpress to give me 7 latest post from each of the 6 categories

7426041
stdout	fflush
since there is no newline after the prompt to trigger a fflush in line buffering mode you ll need to hflush stdout yourself or hsetbuffering stdout nobuffering to disable the buffering altogether

7426043
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in safari and google-chrome

7426043
firefox	safari
please try it in google chore safari first then try it in firefox

7426054
put	get
to solve that problem we put the key in a context object that will get set as the this pointer for the success handler so we can get back to the key

7426062
put	get
no use.i put the file write in my end for tracking the status.i selected 53 file and start the delete.but it stopped after 40 objects.then sarted with 0kb files of 105 it stopped at 30 assets.in file write i am getting the values for 105 object delete -- s3 deleted started09 02 34 and the 30th delete ends at completed s3 delete 09 02 44 .then 31st s3 delete started at started s3 delete 09 02 44 but didnt get the result from s3

7426066
uilabel	uibutton
it has something to do with the uibutton because when i just use uilabel the problem doesn t persist

7426076
tolower	toupper
by the way why don t you use toupper and tolower

7426109
google-chrome	firefox
also strangely the problem only occurred in google-chrome and firefox - in ie the images came up without any problem

7426145
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox not ie

7426163
public	protected
the parent has a protected method and the subclass can override the same method and only has 2 choice for visibility protected or public

7426232
width	height
i have a few images with the same width but different height

7426240
free	malloc
if you want to measure memory usage accurate to the byte i would just build a simple wrapper around malloc and free that increments some global value

7426273
ssl	https
everything works fine when i use http but when i try to connect call a method of deployment service using ssl https is enabled at the server

7426273
ssl	https
here is my relevant client configurtion for https ssl only

7426273
ssl	https
wcf service is browesable over ssl https via web browser

7426383
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
check out the touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

7426383
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
one approach would be to subclass imageview and implement touchesbegan touchesmoved in it and use this imageview subclass to display your images in the scroll view

7426435
intersect	contains
since the corresponding two edges of a parabola intersect each other at most at 2 points the list s can contains at most 2n ndash

7426505
width	height
you can then scale it using the wx.image s scale self width height quality method

7426603
button	checkbox
for example adding some checkbox with my own values in it between file type and save close button

7426609
des	rsa

7426643
bash	zsh
i followed the installation guide on the rvm website and tried in both zsh and bash and got the same problem on the very first step

7426705
ant	maven
just use java -jar helloworld.jar firstparam secondparam and i believe you can also use because that how we pass params to maven and ant etc

7426709
uitableview	reloaddata
third you can cause the uitableview to refresh by sending it the reloaddata message

7426710
postgresql	mysql
one of the answers of this question suggests the use of mysql or postgresql .

7426759
width	height
you should give your images a width and height

7426784
omnixml	nativexml
a third option is to simply iterate over all records and write the fields to xml with self-written code using a xml library like omnixml or nativexml

7426819
hex	binary
in order to convert a .net datetime to an equivalent binary representation we need to determine the number of days since 01-01-1900 convert that to hex and then the number of ticks since midnight which is slightly complicated since a .net tick is 100ns

7426844
filtering	grouping
it works just fine on the first level of nesting but not when manipulating filtering in a child filtering grouping

7426844
filtering	grouping
i d like to have different animations for adding removing filtering grouping then adding removing filtering themselves

7426845
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
just for the sake of completeness the sqlexception -class extends runtimeexception which is an unchecked-exception

7426865
ftp	telnet
can t even telnet to the ftp port from b2 b3 b4

7426872
stdout	stderr
we need to find out if there is some way we can have separate stdin stdout stderr pipes for ghci itself and the program ghci is debugging

7426872
ghci	leksah
this will allow interaction but keep stdin clear for leksah to talk to ghci

7426872
stdout	stderr
ideally you would keep stdout and stderr clear too and write to this socket instead but leksah should cope fairly well with arbitrary output

7426894
easymock	powermockito
just so you know you will probably run into tests that are not thread safe due to many test supporting libraries easymock powermockito etc invalidating the ability to parallel your tests

7426927
keydown	keyup
in the keyboard driver the driver used to always give only keyup and not keydown

7426933
profiling	benchmarking
as every benchmarking relies on time keeping i am not sure how to interpret apache benchmarking or xdebug profiling results on vmware and how credible they are

7426961
udp	tcp
using udp protocol instead of tcp ip

7426970
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the app-delegate.h has a window an uiviewcontroller an uinavigationcontroller and an uitabbarcontroller

7426971
cos	sin
cos radian whould be x velocity component and sin radian the y compunent

you can use preventdefault in the click event handler for all checkbox and radio button

7427120
jar	manifest.mf
i ve set up the buildnumber-maven-plugin to pull the version number from svn and stash it away in the meta-inf manifest.mf inside the jar

7431286
width	height
there is a cool feature in dreamweaver where you can drag an image from the file explorer into the code and it would generate the tag with the appropriate width and height dimensions

7431331
scatter	graphing
the bigger picture is that i want to graphing a time-series scatter

7431340
qstring	qvalidator
if you don t like this behaviour you need create an inheritance class from qintvalidator and reimplement virtual qvalidator state validate qstring input int pos const

7431347
komodo	notepad++
komodo edit and notepad++ pros cons python dev

7431365
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been testing this in firefox and google-chrome both on mac getting the same result in both

7431389
width	height
as in the question i had some pre-generated svg output files that have their x y height width settings all based on numeric value with no context to inch centimeter etc

7431395
nsstring	nsdata
this is apparently a common problem but i haven t seen a clear answer on how to convert the nsdata to an nsstring

7431415
msdeploy	webdeploy
take a look at msdeploy and webdeploy

7431418
put	get
after going through much documentation i can t seem to figure out exactly what code to put into the model view and controller to get the links to show up on the show page

7431466
hide	show
hide red box layer update the position show it again

7431468
disk	ram
be aware that some data types can use more space in ram than on disk compressed format

7431468
disk	ram
so you can get bigger results for constants ram format than for table columns disk format when testing the same value or row of values vs

7431497
stdout	fflush
try fflush stdout

7431503
width	height
probably something similar going on with the scrollinglabelitemrenderer as the label probably doesn t get its width validated when it measures itself the first time thus sets the wrong measured size which the grid accepts and uses as row height

7431534
entities	entitymanager
i don t really want to turn on query cache because there are other entities in the same entitymanager that i don t really want cached

7431536
codeigniter	kohana
i ve never worked with zend framework before but i ve worked with others codeigniter kohana etc

7431538
width	height
i tried pretty much anything with display whitespace width s and height but i can only get it to work if i give the ul a certain width

7431570
put	get
in your case i generally put functions and classes that i might want to import inside say native.some where i can easily get to them

7431570
put	get
but then i get the script code and only the script code â only the thin shim that interprets arguments and starts everything running by passing those to a main or go function as parameters â and put that inside of a scripts directory

7431574
min	max
depending on rnd min max and the width of int number of retries may be o 1 it does not increase with increase in number of elements or it may be worse than that

7431610
inherited	properties
by setting the width on the to inherited you can use the overflow properties to set the overflow behavior of the element

7431610
width	height
with the value scroll all of the element s contents will scroll in both x and y directions if the height and the width of the contents overflow that of the box

7431649
tinyint	varchar
e.g california it stores a tinyint instead of the varchar california

7431689
stdout	stderr
is there any way to create a pipe that connects the stderr of one process to the stdin of another keeping the stdout alive in my terminal

7431695
put	get
what if you add two numbers together to get the value that s going to be put in the enum-typed variable

7431714
google-chrome	firefox
its working perfectly well on google-chrome firefox ie6 ie7 but somehow in ie8 and ie9 it opens in same window

7431730
stdout	stderr
if you re happy to mix stdouot and stderr then you can first redirect stderr to stdout and then pipe that

7431744
intersect	contains
you could use the intersect method to get all the items they both contains

7431744
intersect	contains
edit so after looking at it it seems items is an objectcollection which doesn t contains intersect

7431775
min	max
same problem applies to floor rent max min conditions

7431780
swing	windowbuilder
which windowbuilder swing widget should i use to make a system.out console display

7431780
scrollable	panels
the result is a private static reference to a jtextarea inside a scrollable panels inside a windowbuilder structure

7431800
hide	show
i need to show only 30 rows at a time and hide the remaining rows

7431800
hide	show
while dragining clicking vertical scrollbar it should show corresponding rows and hide the other rows

7431800
hide	show
ie if one clicks on upper scroll button it should show one more upper item and hide one lower item and vice versa

7431810
ffmpeg	libavformat
i want to use the rtp data structures rtpmuxcontext in libavformat rtpenc.h provided by ffmpeg s libavformat however they don t seem to be available with the following install

7431827
width	height
for example i want to display the current x y width and height of the map rect but i don t know what events should i handle

7431874
width	height
if you want it to actually get smaller than the specified width height or the original width height of the image you need to do some scripting

7431874
width	height
this means you can hook up the resize event of the browser and reset the width height of the image equally while resizing

7431908
outputstream	inputstream
trigger a delegate â œdidresolveinstanceâ and it will set the inputstream and outputstream values

7431908
outputstream	inputstream
after get ting values for inputstream and outputstream it will call â œopenstreamâ method to open the input and output streams

7431945
superclass	subclassing
then you simply provide further implementations in each subclassing overriding the superclass method

7431945
superclass	subclassing
then when you need to call the method from the superclass you simply use and the correct subclassing method will be called instead

7431966
entities	entitymanager
clear detaches all entities managed by the entitymanager so is detached too and trying to persist a detached entity creates a new entity

7432002
inherited	properties
you can inherited your viewmodels from a baseviewmodel which can have a protected properties returnurl

7432030
stdout	stderr
you may also swap the stdout stderr streams i

7432030
stdout	stderr
stdout becomes the new stderr and stderr becomes the new stdout

7432045
width	height
look carefully at how the width and height are set in the following code

7432052
mouseover	mouseout
if you d test for a mouseover on the tooltip from within the mouseout of the link you could prevent it

7432076
hide	show
you can with show hide

7432088
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
can anybody give me any information on this issue such as why it is happening and a resolution to it also this problem only seems to happen in internet explorer 9 out of firefox opera and google-chrome

7432099
rspec	capybara
we re working on a rails 3 project and testing using capybara rspec

7432099
apache	nginx
the application sent the header x-sendfile which works under apache but nginx expects x-accel-redirect

7432122
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to latest versioning of mysql2 gem

7432162
inherited	subclassing
using inherited employee can be a subclassing of person

7432183
maven	cobertura	cobertura	checkstyle
i would recommend you instead use maven as your build tool and add the cobertura findbugs pmd and checkstyle plugins that will produce reports whenever you compile your code

7432202
outputstream	inputstream
let the point to a servlet url which gets an inputstream of the pdf and writes it to the outputstream of the response

7432202
google-chrome	safari
more hints can be found in this question how do i print an iframe from javascript in safari google-chrome

7432204
tostring	getter	getter	setter
the getter would call tostring on the decimal value stored and the setter would do the conversion back from string to decimal using decimal.parse or similar

7432285
width	height
2 use this code snippet to get the width and height of the screen in pixel and the decide by yourself what code you execute

7432338
post	get
- the point i don t get is how to get a single json response for a post at his depending records tags and comments

7432338
post	get
- how is the url format to get all comments of the first post

7432356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in most cases your google-chrome extension will work seamlessly in firefox and safari

7432356
firefox	safari
the service is still in beta trial and firefox conversion is working better than safari one

7432356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can t fully disclose what s our technical solution but this being an so answer i can add a few details we have re-developed a full javascript api stack that mimics most of google-chrome extension apis for safari and firefox

7432356
google-chrome	safari
safari 5.1 just introduced a popup corresponding to google-chrome s browser_action but we have already an alternative solution that works for previous versions

7432356
firefox	safari
we also provide a way to bring webapps to firefox and soon to safari

7432356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
without pushing you towards our solution i might add that the time to fully cover the google-chrome api on both safari and firefox is probably not worth it - unless you plan to convert several extensions

7432388
getter	setter
as of a proper name for that type of construct well i have never seen your particular construct in c++ but if you consider other languages that is the basic concept of a property in c# where you can make the getter public and the setter private

7432392
google-chrome	firefox
all other browsers ie9 firefox google-chrome etc etc worked but not ie8 and below

7432394
int	double
so do i have to create methods for byte int float double or can 1 method do it all

7432418
folder	directory
many of these problems can be solved with a simple grails clean or if even that does not help try to delete the .grails folder in your user directory and run the plugin installation again

7432422
jobs	cron
i ve added the manage.py cron because its what you run to tell the chronograph function to look for jobs that need running

7432496
hash	md5
i can t use md5 sha hash etc

7432533
ubuntu	debian
i have 2 computers workstation with ubuntu and python 2.7.2 and debian lenny vps with python 2.7.2

7432541
icomparable	compareto
so it follows that if you want to sort using the sort method your class must implement icomparable otherwise when you call compareto on your class how would you expect the sorting algorithm to know how your class logically sorts

7432593
put	get
i have this script who get all sub dirs and put them into dropdown list.

7432593
folder	dir
i have an option new folder who need to create a new folder by gathering the folder name - in this case its numbers like 995 - and discount it by one to create a dir called 994

7432607
width	height
indeed i misread the word width as height

7432658
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
- supported in ie 5.5+ opera and safari 4 and google-chrome verifed please check before downvoting

7432662
jsf	stripes
probably the setting is not the best to do but why does jsf stripes it off when it affects the display of the page

7432675
addclass	removeclass
may be you could use addclass removeclass when the panel is visible hidden respectively

7432739
for-loop	loops
in this situation you want to use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

7432762
udp	tcp
as of now apache synapse supports http s mail pop3 imap smtp jms tcp udp vfs sms xmpp and fix

7432792
google-chrome	firefox
if you open this site in ie then open it in google-chrome or firefox you will notice the gray space on the left hand side

7432816
postgresql	mysql
actually this was one of the many reasons we switched our main database from mysql to postgresql

7432835
gentoo	ubuntu
i did some additional checking and it appears that if i can get the software working with libudev then it should minimally compile on ubuntu slackware and gentoo which would be a really nice benefit

7432860
width	height
using the birt zoom options scale the document to fit height but it doesn t fit width because it first renders the html then apply the zoom

7432879
getter	setter
a hybrid approach to which i do sometimes fall back is to design my service model classes with getter setter for these dependencies - getdbadapter and setdbadapter

7432879
getter	setter
but at least the presence of the getter setter methods explicitly demonstrates that there is a dependency and allows me to mock it out or to provide non-default implementations

7432943
chunked	transfer-encoding
when using http 1.1 chunked encoding which means that the response has a transfer-encoding header do not set the content-length header

7432953
put	get
where i must put the word that i want to search and why i get this error

7432974
persistent	transient	instances	transient
however if the data is not transient and needs to be persistent so that work can carry on after an instances crash and by crash i mean something that terminates the instances or otherwise renders it inoperable and unrecoverable then your data must not be on the root volume but should be on another ebs volume which is attached to the instances

7433042
rss	feed
it is still possible to access the rss feed of the public pages

7433062
implements	extends
extends your controller with class zend_rest_controller instead of zend_controller_action and implements its methods for your rest android client to consume from

7433080
children	parent
instead of creating parent children and grandchildren at a time i want to create parent first then child and grandchild together.my code is

7433095
hide	show
source show hide the console window of a c# console application

7433115
int	double
however when the default tag is used it sorts only alphabetically by int or by double

7433122
helpers	actioncontroller
you don t have to manage view yourself there is an actioncontroller helpers called view renderer it does your job for you all you need to follow is its naming convention i.e if your controller name is bookcontroller then its view file should be located at views scripts book boo.phtml

7433162
printwriter	bufferedwriter
alternatively you could wrap your bufferedwriter in a custom printwriter class and only use the println methods for your index file logging

7433189
put	get
even if i put the calls to nav.viewcontrollers in a separate method which is called from the main thread i still get 0x0 nil

7433195
keydown	keyup
send a keydown event too not just keyup

7433306
requestfactory	gwt
i am building an app with gwt and appengine using requestfactory

7433337
stdout	stderr
this should keep stdin stdout of do-something in your terminal und redirect stderr to my pipe which is read by error-handler

7433351
wav	aiff	wav	caf	aiff	caf
based on what i read so far avaudioplayer only play aiff wav or caf and none of those are compressed

7433353
awt	swing
are you talking about a simple console application or a swing awt app

7433374
uiview	subviews
then make instances of this new class objects and add this object s uiview as a subviews using at the proper location on the screen its bottom

7433385
hide	show
i have a tabbar application where clicking on a tabbar item i should show a camera overlay view but it should not hide the tabbar camera overlay should just fit into the tabbar viewcontrollers just like behind the tabbar view

7433414
folder	dir	folder	directory
i should have a dir object which is the root folder and inside that one i should have an array of directory on each directory i could have another array of directory and so one.

7433418
filtering	grouping
i am trying to check for people in a certain range - let minage and maxage corresponding for age grouping with minage 18 and maxage 24 meaning i am trying to filtering out the people aged between 18 and 24.also datatype for dob of member is string

7433432
post	put
first you ll need to put those post vars into an array instead of splitting them up

7433440
yslow	pagespeed
also during your development when it comes to application optimization you might want to check out yslow and pagespeed as plugin tools for firefox firebug to determine the root cause of any latency issues

7433455
jar	war
you may check if the jar is in your war ear library directory or if the jar exists in jboss s lib dir

7433504
cldc	midp
looking at the connected limited device configuration cldc 1.1 and the mobile information device profile midp 2.0 specifications it appears that the java.text package does not exist

7433571
nexus	artifactory
now that i have that out of the way i suggest you use a maven repository manager like nexus or artifactory

7433571
nexus	artifactory
what artifactory and nexus do is create a network wide repository structure for third party libraries

7433571
versioning	upgrade
we have no idea if the foo project even supports this older versioning or if we got the buggy 1.3 and should have upgrade to versioning 1.4 back in the hoover administration

7433599
width	height
first query is what you have to get to get the max height and width

7433599
width	height
primaryid 4 5 from secondary_images match with the max height and max width of the previous query

7433666
svg	vml
fortunately however ie does support a language similar to svg called vml and there are a number of javacript libraries that allow ie to use both canvas and svg by converting them to vml

7433669
onclick	onmousedown
rather than use onmousedown i would just have the function in the onclick just make sure it returns false at the end of the function which i ve included

7433744
jasmine	qunit
don t overlook something like qunit or jasmine to unit test your javascript

7433754
httprequest	httpresponse
as we all know the httpapplication object holds objects regarding the requested page httprequest and the page where we are supposed to be redirected httpresponse

7433756
put	get	int	boolean
there s also get put extra methods for other data types like boolean int etc

7433793
put	get
i know php can output js - trying to just do something like in the php - but wherever i put that i get some syntax erros due to how the sections are broke up btwn the else

7433824
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop with an anonymous function inside and in the function i want to access the current loops iteration

7433831
slideup	slidedown
for example for a 3-line div the effect results in an initial slidedown of let say 5-lines and then akin to a effect of slideup adjusts itself to the appropriate 3-lines

7433847
folder	directory
i want search in a directory for multiple pattern for example that result shoud return all files and folder that matched with my pattern

7433873
jar	war
it looks like the issue might be that your war doesn t have a dependency for your ejb jar defined

7433873
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
it s best to define a class-path entry your war s meta-inf manifest.mf for your ejb jar files if you have not

7433884
vbscript	vba
if you automate ms office applications using vbscript and use vba sample code as a starting point you may overlook the necessity of defining the wd xl or ad

7433884
vbscript	vba
constants that are predefined in vba but missing in vbscript

7433893
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i would suggest placing the uisegmentedcontrol in a separate view on top of the uitableview rather than in the tableheaderview

7433905
put	get
is there anyway to get more ram or to put your project onto an solid state drive

7433912
for-loop	arrays
i agree with hobbs...if you want to take many inputs like that you can use a for-loop and an arrays like this provided you are taking inputs from stdin

7433920
gridview	detailsview
one way to do this is to have a detailsview that is linked to the selectedvalue property of your gridview

7433920
gridview	detailsview
you can put the detailsview in the popup and it will display whatever was selected in the gridview

7433920
gridview	detailsview
see the controlparameter in this datasource looks at the id of the row that was selected in the gridview and uses that to populate the detailsview

7433924
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i try changing the frame in viewdidload and viewwillappear but nothing seams so work

7433925
post	get
verbs get head post

7433928
width	height
call the setpopovercontentsize animated method on your uipopovercontroller object and that will set the height and width of your popover

7433984
g++	gcc
the version of my g++ and gcc is 4.4.5

7433984
post	put
i am not sure i should put this question in a new post but i think currently it is better to follow the old one

7433995
int	chars
i think i almost understand what the problem is simplifying it a lot even if i speak about chars and enum they all are int and then the overloading is ambiguous

7434035
put	get
i put debug info in each destructor of my classes so after i close the dialog i normally get

7434077
mouseover	mouseleave
for the solution i have seen this question my mouseover mouseleave doesnt work and i have tried all the suggestions but nothing

7434088
int	chars
there are implicit conversions for both enum - chars and enum - int

7434088
int	chars
here there is implicit conversion for enum to int and so it is the one favored by the compiler over the one to chars

7434088
int	chars
compiler tries to convert from myclass to chars and finds that not having a user defined conversion operator chars both user defined int and simpleenum may be used

7434088
int	chars
myclass to int via user defined conversion myclass to simpleenum + implicit conversion simpleenum to chars

7434108
portrait	landscape
valid settings are 1 portrait 2 landscape

7434119
put	get
there you can just load some more items from wherever you get them put them into your adapter and call it s notifydatasetchanged -method

7434147
google-chrome	safari
this happens in google-chrome and safari but no other browsers

7434148
versioning	upgrade
you can either upgrade to the latest versioning of helios or better yet indigo or add the update sites

7434157
dao	facade
view dao facade service etc

7434185
int	chars
alternatively you might like to rethink why you have a function that has separate overloads for int and chars perhaps that could be redesigned as well

7434186
setinterval	settimeout
because of the nature of requestanimationframe you should never queue animations using a setinterval or settimeout loop

7434186
setinterval	settimeout
if you continue to queue animations via setinterval or settimeout while animation is paused all of the queued animations will begin playing when the window tab regains focus

7434189
width	height
but you must add solid width or height values

7434260
hide	show
i would like to push the markers for each date night i into a different object key so that i can hide show a specific night s markers

7434320
min	max
min and max should rather be stored in a question object or even in questiontype - depending on how flexible the system should be in runtime

7434329
margin	height
a #gal container is loaded with lots of images 60 all with defined css height 100px and margin 5px

7434350
getter	setter
the reason why you may want to do the full way though is if you want to add a default value which can be done in the constructor in short hand form or add additional code to the getter or setter

7434383
getter	setter
synthesizing doesn t actually allocate your variables which is why they are null it just provides the getter setter methods for accessing the variables

7434405
children	parent
then to run a simulation just start with a few parent and generate a bunch of children to complete with each other

7434458
onresume	onpause
the problem is when it receives an intent immediately after finish has been called the onnewintent and onresume methods are called but my activity is then destroyed onpause ondestroy by android and the intent is not processed

7434492
getter	setter
auto-implemented properties are syntactic sugar introduced to address exactly these type of situation where the property is used just to avoid having a public field with no extra logic in the getter setter

7434518
children	parent
this whole example functions fine if all the data parent and children is passed at once at the beginning to addjsondata

7434538
implements	sealed
the best practice recommend when you implements dispose method in non sealed class you should have a virtual method for your derived classes to override

7434547
versioning	upgrade
if it is only compatible with b 1.0.0 then you ll have to create your own fork of the a gem and upgrade the gemspec to be compatible with b 1.0.1 and then use that repository as your gem for a instead of the rubygems versioning

7434576
switching	screens
when i switching activities say clicking a button to goto another activity all the elements on the screens as well as the background slides off the screens to the left

7434576
switching	screens
is it possible to keep the background stationary so that it doesn t slide off and on the screens when switching between activities

7434602
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use the developer tools for your browser f12 for ie right-click and inspect element for google-chrome or safari install firebug for firefox to inspect the actual styles applied to the element in question

7434654
expander	grid
if i have two columns of a grid and want to put both in an expander control how do i make it so if both are open they have some default size on the screen like 1 3 for lhs 2 3 for rhs then one lhs collapses rhs takes up whole screen and when rhs collapses then lhs takes up the whole screen

7434658
oncreate	onnewintent
this activity can be started again by some intent but the oncreate will be called not onnewintent

7434658
oncreate	onnewintent
but you need to review you logic and enhance your oncreate and onnewintent method to gracefully handle your scenario

7434660
int	double
however since your printf specifies two int both 4 bytes in this case you are seeing the binary representations of 1.0 as a type double

7434663
min	max
let c be min a b and d be max a b

7434675
firefox	safari
but i just discovered that at least in firefox 6 and safari 5 on my pc there is a delay before i can press-to-select the next value

7434675
keydown	keyup
however in further testing with jquery i discovered that the javascript events keydown keyup and keypress are all fired as you d expect no matter how rapidly you press the keys

7434676
rss	feed
i am in the unfortunate position of needing to parse a rss feed since there is no other way to obtain the data

7434676
rss	feed
i figured i could modify it to do the same for the rss feed so i can get the data into a format that is easier use

7434693
getter	setter
as for your edit those __xxx__ functions are an ugly way to get the getter setter function without executing it

7434693
getter	setter
the function you posted copies getter setter without executing them

7434703
fontfamily	font-size
so instead of defining .create-button .cancel-button .create-and-new button you would just have a .button that defines padding size background color line-height font-size fontfamily and font-weight

7434709
aggregate-functions	sum
to ensure only one row you would have to use an aggregate-functions - count sum max - without a group by clause

7434711
implements	extends
i d like to tack on some interfaces to engine so i subclass it class interfacedengine extends engine implements awesomeinterface

after image load s you can access to properties width and height

7447129

for example if you have a rectangle class with final height and final width then your rectangle s area function only needs to compute it once since it knows that height and width cannot change

at the very least have a look at host connection accept-encoding content-type and content-length

7447244
getter	setter
or just define the getter and setter methods yourself then you are able to access the ivar via _backgroundimageholder without any danger of accidentally calling the setter again

7447265
getter	setter
note doing this stuff in a getter is a bad design but since you re preparing foo in a setter instead of a prerenderview listener method there s no other way otherwise it would be done right in the same listener method

7448179

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m assuming this is an issue with .load as its only on ie works fine on google-chrome firefox and safari

7448594

google-chrome	firefox
i would like to know if there is a way i can embed a google-chrome or firefox browser in a tab or on a form from delphi

for-loop	loops
you should probably interrupt in the for-loop instead of the while loops

7448865
google-chrome	safari
i tested with google-chrome and it doesn t cause the same tab reload behavior so i m sure it s a safari 5.1 problem

7448874

why if i create a local repository then create a github repository and then add that as remote i commit to local and then i push to remote but i have no ability to pull from remote to local

7448976
pull	push
if i add remote using git bash all is well remote is properly configured and i can pull and push and fetch to upstream but if i do it thru the egit wizard it never works for local repositories that get pushed and then get fetched and merged.

7448999
width	height
where x y width height are the rect and mx my are the mouse

7449038

but the way i add my tooltips makes it so they don t get put on the text until the first mouseover

7449181

7449192
children	parent
where total_weight is the weight sum of all children in the parent layout

7449197

the problem is that you are pushing chars onto a stack as an int so you are unintentionally working with the ascii representations of numbers which is not the actual value of the number

7449247
udp	tcp
this looks like a duplicate of how do i abort a socket.recv from another thread in python but it s not since i want to abort recvfrom in a thread which is udp not tcp

rss	feed
possibly with extra xmlns attributes then you have an rss 1.0 feed

7449600
rss	feed
again with possible xmlns attributes then you have an rss 2.0 feed

7449626
shadowing	named
my assumption is that you have defined a local mworkout that s shadowing your instance variable with the same named

7449654
min	max
these examples assume you want to use the and operators although oftentimes i would use and to include the min val and exclude the max val

7449682

of course if one put real effort he could get the key and try to find where the password is located and decrypt it and get the key but it requires more effort to do

7449702
ffmpeg	libav
freeimage is similar to ffmpeg and libav but for images

7449707
hide	show
you could hide the uiwebview until the new page had loaded then show it to the user

7449769
put	get
if you put that in your analysis chain ie apply it it incoming documents when you index them and then compute facets for the resulting field with a query restricted to the fruit cluster you will be able to get a list of all distinct shingles along with their occurrence frequencies - i think you can even retrieve them sorted by frequency - which you can use easily i think to derive the title you want

7449773
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

lxml and elementtree are quite similar

7449795

for example lxml maintains parent relationships for every element and elementtree does not

7449801
jar	war	folder	directory
so the dist directory would typically have a single artifact like a war ear or jar while the deploy folder would have the contents exploded in a directory structure where the app server can use them

rss	feed
unfortunately when it s being embedded in your rss feed as the feed source the ampersands in the url aren t being escaped -- i d guess this is a bug in the plugin

7449911

either way the solution will be to disable the analytics plugin or at least the bit that alters the feed url or update it to a version that escapes the url properly for use in the rss feed xml

7450155
hash	salt
whereas in fact it stores a salt hash of the password so you might need to implement all that functionality yourself

you don t have to turn your button into a square definitely not but if you re trying to use a size like 50 px and 75 px for a particular height you might as well use 48 px and 72 px instead for both the mdpi and hdpi versions respectively

7454181

make the member private again create the getter and setter methods and rewrite the program to use them

7455665

another pro point for getter setter is if in rome do like the romans.

7455677
getter	setter
which means in this case many generic frameworks expect getter setter

for example java classes do have a lot attributes and getter that just get the values and setter that just set the values

7456865
getter	setter
also in practice you just write this lot of code to get one public field since you can change its value using the getter and setter

7456865
getter	setter
so in java and other languages the default is to use getter and setter anyway because they can be annoying to write but can spare you a lot of time if you find yourself in the situation i ve described

google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome and ie all seem to cooperate pretty well with the following

7457919
for-loop	loops
the double for-loop is a well-established idiom that programmers know how to read and if you collapse the two loops into one you sacrifice readability

7457923
width	height
you could also get the difference between an element s width and scrollwidth or height and scrollheight properties

7457924

7458138
pull	push
here s how i got my developers and integrators to use bare git push and git pull

7458167
int	double
since floating-point values like float s and double s are usually represented internally in the computer using a completely different encoding than int often as ieee-754 values rather than signed two s complement the results of trying to take bits of a float or double and representing them as an int are usually meaningless

7458172
put	get
i think i have some scope issues.when i want to console.log ext.getstore adminsettings which adminsettings is one of the created stores inside ext.ajax.request s callback function adminsettings store is returned but if i put console.log ext.getstore adminsettings everywhere outside callback function i get undefined message in firebug and my store is not instantiated

7458183
equals	gethashcode
if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

7458184

7458902
postgresql	mysql
the only difference between the environments is locally i m using mysql and heroku uses postgresql

7459080
allocator	stl
my question is what would be the least painful method of forcing sfml to use my custom small-objects thread-safe allocator for stl containers instead of the default

7459080
allocator	stl
my goal is to change the default allocator that all stl containers use essentially

7459092

7459217
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven then you control all your dependencies via the pom.xml file

7459217
maven	m2e
you can either use the maven eclipse plugin to generate the eclipse artifacts or my preferred approach which is to use the m2e plugin

7459238
devise	cancan
devise will not do this but cancan will as someone mentioned

7459277

7459483
children	parent
i have a dataset that pulls names from a sql database the data is of children parent

7459536
strtok	strcmp
a dictionary could be something as simple as a max sized array containing unique words and an index that starts at 0 when array is empty whenever strtok returns a word go through the array and look for the word using your strcmp if it doesn t exist add it at the end of the array then increment then index

7459537
move	drag
now when i move around my list items draggable s of a sortable the css keeps these delimiters updated when i drag an element to the beginning of the list it gains fisrt-child pseudo-class so it appears without the delimiter

if you can recreate nsurl using an nsstring only then save the nsstring instead

7459732
boost	stl
if you don t want to use boost have a look at what iterators must provide stl documentation

7459745
width	height
you must have fixed width and height of table cell to achieve this

7459751
boost	stl
also you can use boost iterator_facade - it will not help to implement algorithm of the iteration but will minimize your effort on making your iterator compatible to stl expectations.

7459766

7459871
int	chars
read a chars instead of an int or better yet a key press

7459871
int	chars
then if the so read chars is between 0 and 9 turn it into an int and use it as option

in case of min heap when you insert the element which is less than some nodes in the tree the data structure now doesn t follow heap condition in case of min heap value of parent should be less than its children so you have to shift up and up

7460216
division	multiplication
on most processors division is slower than multiplication for the same data types

7460216
width	height
in your example your multiplication is a floating point operation if width and height are integer types the result may be very different and may depend on both your processor and your compiler

7460225
std	ostream
std ostream provides one unformatted output function called write with the following signature

7460246
int	chars
in your provided example you cast a float to an unsigned chars before outputing actually casting the real value to a small int

7461028
width	height
fluid width is only for canvas apps apps.facebook.com app-name that s why these settings are prefixed with canvas canvas width canvas height

7461041
x86	64bit
for people who compile 64bit x86 code by default and are unable to reproduce it you can try with gcc -m32 instead of just gcc

7461041
int	double
at the call site because t1 did not have a prototype the argument f was promoted to double and it was a double that was written on the stack c99 6.5.2.2 6 â œif the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

7461234
width	height
i am trying to get a image to fill up the viewport and auto resize when the browser gets resized which is working the only problem is that for some reason i can t get the image to not extend outside of the #wrapper element even though it has overflow set to hidden i am assuming it is because i am using percentages instead of a fixed width and height

7461234
move	drag
on the body element it works but then when you select text anywhere on the page and drag down it scrolls down to the bottom of the image which is problematic as i have a footer menu that is absolutely positioned to the bottom of the screen which then move up with the image as it is dragged down and ruins the whole effect

width	height
if the container of the image has height and width the image should have it as well

7461496
division	multiplication
how am i supposed to find x if i can t even use division and multiplication

7461497
switching	screens
uinavigationcontroller inserts it s navbar above your view controller for you or you can turn it off and then uinavigationcontroller just provides a great way to handle screens switching by calling push and pop

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
try adding a uinavigationcontroller directly to window as rootviewcontroller then push your uiviewcontroller onto the stack to display your first screen

7461536
hash	md5
i wonder if it is safe to hash a bunch of md5 hash values together to create a new hash or whether this will in any way increase the probability of collisions

7461536
hash	md5
so the question is can i just take all the single-file md5 hash values of the dependent files concatenate them and then calculate an md5 over the concatenated values to get the multi-file hash value

7461536
hash	md5
or will this result in an md5 hash that is more likely to collide than if i would concatenate the content of all dependent files together

7461540
google-chrome	safari
it only happens in webkit browsers google-chrome and safari

7461560
fadein	fadeout
it basically calls fadeout on all the elements and then calls fadein on all elements one time for each element etc etc

7461568
uiview	subviews
if you want a child view subclass uiview and add it as a subviews

7461572
hash	md5
however if you use md5 not for security but as a unique marker to check dependencies even hashing contatenated hash should be pretty safe

7461575
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
and in the proper jmenuitem s from jpopupmenu just jframe#setvisible true

7461598
google-chrome	firefox
this function opens up a page with parameter as undefined in firefox where as in google-chrome i get proper value

7461770
comparator	comparable
you did not tell us what is the actual datatype of the chartdata but from the error you are describing it looks like the problem is that whatever this datatype is it does not implement the comparator interface which is a required interface if you want instances of the datatype to be comparable

7461912
width	height
so for example if my parent div has a width of 400px and the button-container div takes up 100px of that then i should be able to specify something like height 100 for the list-container div and have that equal to a width of 300px

7461917

width	height
ideally you should manually set width and height of the images as well as the container div

7462303
width	height
i m not sure why you re using left and top instead of width and height since you re trying to make a thumbnail

7462303
width	height
another way is to calculate the maximum of the width and height and scale it down to a desired width or height

7462310

7462539
spaces	delimiter
the old version treated repeated spaces as a single delimiter by default

7462547
stdio	fflush
the reason the return value of rarely meaningful is because stdio files are buffered and a write error usually due to exhausting disk space but it could also be due to hardware failure which there s really no way to handle gracefully will not be reported until the buffer is fflush

7462603

equals	gethashcode
i have never overridden gethashcode but i was reading around and people say you only need to when overriding equals and providing custom equality checking to your application so i guess i m fine

7462965
equals	gethashcode
object s implementations of equals and gethashcode which you re inheriting compare by reference

7462979
equals	gethashcode
if you have a different definition for equality you should override equals gethashcode to get the appropriate behavior

7463097
equals	gethashcode
if you re using value types the default implementation of equals and gethashcode are okay equals checks if the fields are equals and gethashcode is based on the fields not necessarily all of them

7463097
equals	gethashcode
if you re using reference types the default implementation of equals and gethashcode use reference equality which may or may not be okay

7463097
equals	gethashcode
i have never overridden gethashcode but i was reading around and people say you only need to when overriding equals and providing custom equality checking to your application so i guess i m fine

7463097

it is possible to do this by combining read.table with and then to apply strsplit on each row of data

7463275
comparator	comparable
the type class should again not necessarily implement the comparable interface and override the comparator method so as to decide the ordering within the treemap

7463281
comparator	comparable
unless a comparator which mutually compares the keys is provided in the treemap s constructor the keys must implement comparable

7463281
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals

7463987
int	double
a template vector is basically a vector that can assume any of one defined type either all int or all double or all floats but not int and double and floats

7463987
int	chars
the reason there isn t a class like this conventionally is because each item takes up a different block size in memory a chars is a byte an int could be 4 bytes etc etc and it would take additional resources on look-up to know what to expect normal storage is contiguous.

7472399
width	height
since you want 100 height - which is a pain in the ass most of the time - and all your columns and rows seem to be of a fixed width height this becomes really easy with fixed positioning which allows you to specify how far every edge of every container should be from the sides of the browser page

7472422
google-chrome	safari
please please please do not resolve this problem without first learning to use a client side browser debugger firebug or google-chrome dev tools or even safari such as walking the stack on break on error break on xhr inspect the xhr headers and response etc

try setting the height and width using css like this

7472859
width	height
not using the height and width attribute of the img tag

7472859
width	height
setting only one of the height or width with css should scale the image proportionally

7472859
width	height
if you have no height and width attributes set on the img tag and you have only one of a height or width set with css then the image will scale proportionally in ie

7472859
width	height
i can get your code to work if i specifically remove the height and width attributes from the image and change your height and width settings to use css like this

7472859
width	height
fyi it s also possible to just set both css height and width calculating one from the other to maintain the proper aspect ratio

one solution is to have additional overload s to the ambiguous function or operator in your case they are operator + const testable int and operator + const testable double

7473011
width	height
the following will create 4 new bindable properties to return the actual scaled x y width and height of the image displayed inside the spark image component

7473038

7473233
width	height
i d like to have each of these components all be exactly the same size so that when laying out the ui i know exactly how much space i have to work with - preferably without having to copy paste the width and height attributes into every darn mxml file and having to worry about updating each one if the w h ever change

7473233
width	height
do i really need to hard code width height in every component page within the application

7473235

touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
you could also use touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended then add an image behind and detect when touch is less than half image s width left or when it s greater than half right

7474388
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t work in firefox and google-chrome

7474388
google-chrome	firefox
then it works on firefox and google-chrome the as function is called and works properly - it doesn t work in ie though

7474398
post	get
http get should be used for data retrieval only and http post can be used for updating content

7474411

another idea was after im done all the inserts then just delete the rows where the schedule_time is greater than the min value in the schedule_time column and the schedule_time is less than the max value in the schedule_time column

7474417

much better if you re targeting a servlet 3.0 el 2.2 capable container tomcat 7 glassfish 3 etc wherein invoking methods with additional arguments is supported or can install jboss el which adds the same enhancement for el 2.1 then you should be able to just pass that object as action method argument

7474781
dictionary	map
it has several different names including map dictionary table association table and more

7474815
std	ostream
you need to return a reference to std ostream object so that you can chain stream operations

7474827
width	height
it strikes me that you may not need to instanciate the ui elements themselves- you can very easily have a collection of dependencyobject-derived viewmodels each of which has the widthproperty and heightproperty set and possibly bound to the equivalent width and height properties of the visible cell ui element once those are created

7474848
daemons	launchd
i ve got a launchd daemons that runs as root outside of the user context

7474848
daemons	launchd
obviously i can t do this from a launchd daemons since it s not running in a windowsserver environment - so the other option is to spawn a separate process for each user that has access to be able to display a gui

7474848
daemons	launchd
the launchd agent could then communicate with the launchd daemons to determine when something needs to be displayed

7474848
daemons	launchd
so the server would send the launchd daemons a series of files which it is expected to copy out on top of the existing files

7474863
qobject	qwidget
you need to inherit from qobject or probably qwidget if you want to draw on the screen and then include the statement q_object which instantiates a few needed things

7474870

there is no web server involved like apache or nginx

7474889

7474977
mouseout	mouseleave
try mouseleave instead of mouseout

7474977
mouseout	mouseleave
now jquery s interpretation of mouseleave works slightly different than their version of mouseout

7474977
mouseout	mouseleave
i don t see why you would ever want to detect mouseout of descendant elements so this is the reason why i use jquery mouseleave for everything and never bother with mouseout

7474998
typedef	struct
in the first case your struct has two equivalent names struct element where element is a struct tag and element where element is a typedef an alias for an existing type

7474998
typedef	struct
you might consider just omitting the typedef and consistently referring to the type as struct element

7474998
typedef	struct
note that you need to refer to the type as struct element not element within the definition itself since the typedef name element isn t visible yet

7474998
typedef	struct
the fact that the struct tag and the typedef have the same name may seem confusing but it s perfectly legititimate

7474998
typedef	struct
struct tags and typedef are in separate namespaces in the c sense not the c++ sense

7474998
typedef	struct
another alternative is to separate the typedef from the struct definition

7475001
google-chrome	safari
why i get row index -1 result in safari and google-chrome when i try to access a dynamic created table row

7475004
width	height
however i need to be able to get the width and height between the points

7475004
width	height
this is easy when the rectangle is not rotated but once i rotate it my math returns the width and height shown by the red outline here

7475004
width	height
assuming i know the order of the points clockwise from top-left for example how do i retrieve the width and the height of the rectangle they represent

7475016
width	height
similar to the other answers but if you prefer not to define the width and height you can use float

7475042

7475099
width	height
if by width and height you just mean the edge lengths and you have your 4 pointf structures in a list or array you can do

7475135
typedef	struct
the struct definition in your typedef is an anonymous struct so you ll be able to refer to it with element without the struct keyword only

7475143

put	get
first thing that came to mind was that it was caused of too many entries in the hashmap which caused every put and every get to be slower every time

7475566

7475765

both approaches in the form above will submit the form causing submission selected values

7476513
put	get
my advise would be to focus more on the .net framework and c# language itself as these are the basis and most of the .net framework is available in both so you should know it and get familiar to it then if your windows derive from a class called form or another called window as long as you know what to put inside and how to approach certain common issues everything else is a detail a big detail once you plan to make a huge application of a certain level bust still a detail

safari and opera and others have their own name for that attribute until it becomes an endorsed standard

7477665
width	height
you can also extend this by getting browser height this example includes width

7477685
superclass	subclassing
the above code can easily be solved by imposing stricter interpretation of a class handles it s responsibilities. it s not the superclass s responsibility to initialize the subclassing so it shouldn t be the superclass s prerogative to call subclassing code before such initialization might be complete

7477693
free	malloc
so the question is should i free this location explicitly- besides freeing the location created by original malloc

7477724
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
even if the memory is reallocated in a new address space if realloc succeeds previous allocated memory with malloc is automatically free

7477766
free	realloc
if realloc resized it then realloc returns it if it allocated a new space in memory and copied the previous content of it it will free the old pointer and return a new one

7477766
free	realloc
but never overwrite the old pointer with the result of a call to realloc as you re doing in your code in facts when realloc fails it returns null and does not free the old pointer so if you are overwriting the only variable where you stored it you are losing the only way you have to free that memory and thus you have a memory leak

7477770
boost	allocator
another alternative would be to use a boost intrusive_set which will prevent the need for allocator when storing the items in the set

7477774
hash	md5
i want to generate an md5 hash for each line and write it to the same file overwriting the previous data

7477813
pop-up	dialog
i need the client process to run in the context of the unprivileged user and having a uac dialog pop-up is not an option

7477858
children	parent
by setting the weightsum on the parent you re saying that the weights of the children should equal that amount

7477878
cabal-dev	hackage
were on hackage with cabal-dev add-source

7477908
width	height
whatever function you have that loads the image should give you two things one is the image info such as width and height

7477908
width	height
and let s say b1_w b1_h b2_w and b2_h are the width and height of b1 and b2 which should be provided to you by the bitmap load function

7477908
width	height
for example if you want to stretch an image from width and height w1 and h1 to w2 and h2 here s the transformation

7477908
width	height
so your code would look like this all the width height and x y values are float unless otherwise specified

7477908
ceil	floor
to linearize the value for position xs ys you could either get the linearized value of floor xs ys and ceil xs ys and again linearize for that or do the same first over y then x which is the same

7477908
width	height
well in the stretching section h2 and w2 were the height and width of the stretched target image remember

7477916
slideup	slidedown
i read on the jquery docs that the slidedown slideup basicaly uncovers the content what can i use to reverse uncover the sub menu

7477925
google-chrome	firefox
a difference in behavior between browsers is that when ie9 uses the reload method it clears the visible page and seemingly rebuilds it from scratch where firefox and google-chrome wait till they get the new assets and rebuild them if they are different

7477973
button	checkbox
how do i change this script so it will not only check the checked checkbox but also the checked radio button

7478008
dictionary	map
in python the map is instantiated with a dictionary like this

7478053
fcntl	fork
if this isn t what you want to happen you will need to either manually close the file descriptors after fork or set the fds as close-on-exec using fcntl fd f_setfd fd_cloexec

7478055
ssl	https
your site doesn t need to use ssl but all calls it makes to the google+ api must use https

7478085
hash	md5
i am using the following to create an nsdata object from an alassetrepresentation to both export an image file as well as create an md5 hash from

7478085
hash	md5
when i re-add the exported file and perform the same operation the file s md5 hash is different

7478085
hash	md5
when i create the nsdata objects using uiimagepngrepresentation and perform the above operations the md5 hash match

7478122
nsurl	nsstring
you can just pass in the nsurl without having to convert it into a nsstring

7478141
cpu	hyperthreading
disable hyperthreading turbo boost and cpu c-states

7478151
textmate	sublimetext
recently i decided to try out sublimetext 2 as a textmate alternative which it is

7478176
width	margin
the div must be given an defined width in order for the margin trick to work link

7478182
stdout	fflush
adding a fflush stdout to the c application + previous approach success

7478182
cout	cin
interestingly this probably wouldn t happen in a c++ application using the standard iostreams since cin is tied to cout and before any input operation on cin happens cout is automatically flushed

7478206
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	png
the image file format is irrelevant as long as imageio can read it jpeg gif png tiff even bmp if really really necessary

7478269
folder	directory
lastly most larger projects have a common folder in either a high level directory or in the location where their message interfaces are defined

7478270
ant	maven
i never worked on ant or maven i always built my projects with two folders ear and war

7478287
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome though as of yet i haven t been able to figure out how to get it to work in firefox

7478290
std	ostream
when printing a float or double value to a std ostream the class template is used c++03 â 22.2.2.2

7478338
hide	show
it would get you the same result and you can use javascript to show and hide the text

7478365
portrait	landscape
i m building application on skd 11+ android 3.x and when i m doing in-app billing request the checkout popup is always displaying in landscape mode - causing that my whole app rotates to landscape mode even though the app is locked to portrait

7478373
post	get
...to get the description i just added a custom field in my post and read it with this function here

7478379
flatmap	concatmap
this combination of a mapping followed by a concatenation is called concatmap in haskell and flatmap in scala and i m sure it has other names elsewhere

7478381
daemons	launchd
off the cuff i would say that you should arrange a way for your daemons to request the launchd agent to exit on demand the same way you would arrange for it to launchd on demand

7478381
daemons	launchd
instead you should rig it up so that when the daemons tries to connect to the agent launchd launchd the agent

7478381
daemons	launchd
you could do this by having the daemons connect to a unix domain socket registered on behalf of the agent by launchd for example

7478381
daemons	launchd
i believe it too has a launchd daemons perform the app updates

7478392
hide	show
when the button is pressed hide the label and show the text field - focus on the text field becomefirstresponder

7478392
hide	show
you are in editing mode now track for return key being pressed and once that happens set your label text to what has been entered resign first responder from the text field and hide it then show the label

7478403
pylons	turbogears
what is the the right way to accomplish this considering that i might throw something like pylons or turbogears on top of this

7478422
setcontentview	findviewbyid
when you use findviewbyid you are actually trying to find a view inside the layout you specified by the setcontentview

7478430
hide	show
by show and hide i believe you are referring to the jquery functions

7478430
hide	show
i hide and show using

7478465
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve found a config param to change on firefox that disabled this functionality but i havent found a similar command for safari webkit google-chrome

7478498
icmp	udp
in udp land one way this can occur is when you send a udp packet to a host and the remote host doesn t have a listener on that port and bounces an icmp host unreachable message in response

7478501
put	get	mouseup	mousedown
i was initially thinking of checking mousedown and mouseup then put something in my game update loop to make it draw pixels to the screen but that didnt work out when i found i couldn t directly get the mouse x and mouse y without the events firing

7478508
hide	show
the following will show it for 600 ms and then hide the item

7478528
nsstring	nsdata
this method recursively validates that all the contained objects are property list objects instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary before writing out the file and returns no if all the objects are not property list objects since the resultant file would not be a valid property list

7478562
min	max
what i am trying to do is retrieve open close min and max price days from a single table sample data below

7478562
min	max
min and max are easy

7478588
strcpy	malloc
malloc and strcpy are just slow period and copying a string is always going to be an o n operation

7478658
put	get
what i really need to know is what format do i put the data in to get the access db to accept the input

7478660

7478673
getter	setter
i tried some getter and setter but that did not work since i assume i have to use a syncronized function in order for that to work right

7478701
put	get
if i put the console.log inside of the .getjson then i get the appropriate value

7478727
width	margin
obviously if you don t set a width then the margin will have no effect because it will expand to the full width thus no margin area

7478727
width	margin
like stated above even if you don t specify the width the auto is still applied and is merely calculated as 0 as the division expands to the entire width and thus there is no margin to fill

7478769
carrierwave	paperclip
you can of course use one of the existing ready-made file-attachment libraries such as paperclip and carrierwave

7478774
textmate	notepad++
not sure about notepad++ but annoyingly textmate matches to any start of line

7478774
post	get
edit after re-reading op s post i get that it should have the beginning tag and closing tag

7478824
hide	show
although there s nothing wrong with your inside-out hash approach the multiple arrays with shared keys it s quite possible you could filter the rows based on classes and use jquery to show hide them

7478824
sorting	filtering
personally i don t see what you re doing with jquery as not being behaviour - sorting and filtering is classic user interaction

7478891
zoo	xts
as dwin pointed out the index must be ordered zoo stands for z s ordered objects so you can t un-order xts zoo objects

7478922
serializable	deserialization
the way you explain it - it is serializable deserialization of a graph issue

7478929
folder	directory
you can add this folder to the additional include directory in the properties of your c++ project

7478934
serializable	deserialization
the show and read classes are meant to provide really basic serializable deserialization which usually produce valid haskell code

7478935
activemq	rabbitmq
if it s important consider using a real message queue server rabbitmq openamq activemq zeromq beanstalkd etc

7478969
onfocus	onblur
there is no straightforward way to do this by dynamically adjusting the textarea s readonly attribute onfocus onblur onselect etc

move	drag
when i click and drag then mouse_out it detects the direction of the mouse and move the panels by 200 either left or right depending on the direction

7478990
multiplying	add
when calculating this type of complexity you should add inline or sequential functions and multiplying nested functions

7479010
versioning	upgrade
the other one that was not working was created years ago and has been upgrade over the years to the current versioning i am working with

7479010

submit	submission
however if i add a hidden text input box it resolves the issue and i can only submit the form by selecting a suggestion from the autocomplete submission via this mechanism is handled by some jquery

7479119
pascal	delphi
it is constructed on the same base language delphi was object pascal but as rruz has already said is not the same

7479153
post	get
alternatively is there a way for me to manipulate internet explorer to get and post values to different urls from a c# windows service

7479154
submit	submission
in your form submit handler check for that attribute before deciding to allow form submission or use .preventdefault to stop it from submission to server

7479162
width	height
the default state is set to height and width of 100

7479177
children	parent
the catch is each class in the hierarchy needs a chance to configure itself and it needs to cascade from the parent to all of the children

7479204
superclass	subclassing
if i subclassing this myclass class and i initialise only a few of these objects defined in the superclass header what happens to all the other unallocated definitions in terms of memory

pull	push
push this and pull this from your staging with

7479433
downcasting	upcasting	superclass	subclassing
you can only cast a referece to one of its superclass ie upcasting in which case the cast operator is not needed or its subclassing downcasting

7479433
superclass	subclassing
integer is neither a subclassing nor a superclass of string so you can t do that

7479437
daemon	cron
then a cron job or some other daemon process running on the server periodically checks that database table for emails to be sent or whatever it is you are offloading

7479473
mouse	keyboard
just put the mouse down and step away from the keyboard

7479529
hash	salt
the salt is then stored unencrypted alongside each hash password and gets concatenated with the user s plaintext password in order to check the hash every time the password gets entered

7479529
hash	salt
what the is the point of a salt if it s stored unencrypted next to the hash password

7479529
hash	salt
adding a hash means the rainbow table needs to not only include the values having any possible combination of alphanumeric characters a person might use but also the random binary salt which is fairly impractical at this point in time

7479529
hash	salt
so basically adding a salt means that a brute force attacker who has access to both the hash password and the salt needs to both figure how how the salt was concatenated to the password before or after normally and brute force each password individually since readily available rainbow tables don t include any random binary data

7479531
pascal	delphi
yet another delphi language is delphi prism which is an object pascal variant which targets .net

7479569
ncover	partcover	partcover	opencover
interfaces have no code to instrument and as such you will not get any coverage data for them this applies to ncover partcover and opencover afaik

7479570
hide	show
so it doesn t seem like a show hide scenario

7479585
getter	setter
for instance if i have a person table and a corresponding person entity with getter and setter for first last name email phone etc .

7479589
post	get
what i originally had in mind to do was user logs in with license on app - app post license to my server - server sends a response via a http get request - app evaluates response and if license is valid sets a value in a session variable a if invalid returns to login screen with an error

7479598
superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
if your compiler is set to gcc there s a bug a subclassing that defines a property without a corresponding ivar definition which is perfectly legal hides any superclass ivars

7479614
int	chars
you can typecast chars to int and in fact you are

7479617
public	protected
third how does overwrite by using new public void display only adds output instead of completely modifying original protected void display

7479622
int	chars
when you cast one to int you get the unicode value of the chars

7479662
partcover	opencover
you may also find partcover and opencover of use

typically the relationship of a subclassing to it s superclass is called is a

7479750
maya	blender	autodesk	3ds
however if you want to create something like this i believe you re probably going to have better luck using a true 3d application autodesk maya or 3ds max come to mind as well as maxon cinema4d or my personal favorite blender whichever suits your taste

7479754
hash	md5
that password would take 2.5e+03 cpu-years to crack on my inexpensive celeron e1200 from 2008 assuming an offline attack on a ms-cache hash which is the worst password hashing algorithm in common use slightly worse than even simple md5

7479756
client-side	server-side
php is server-side not client-side

7479760
int	chars
yes you could use assign both an int ascii value or a chars itself to a chars variable

7479767
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
notice that it is a uiviewcontroller subclass. you can also have multiple uinavigationcontroller in your app which is common for example if you have a tab bar

7479772
int	chars
however it is not a good idea to use int literals as chars values because it obscures the meaning of your program

7479773
int	chars
chars to int conversion is called widening conversions

7479773
int	chars
in widening conversions values do not lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value where as int to chars conversion is called narrowing conversions

7479835
post	get
i m trying to get the first image from each of my post

7479903
int	chars
you can use a matrix of int s or enum s and draw the matrix as a bunch of chars

7480175
for-loop	arrays
you iterate arrays for a for-loop like this

7480244

7480267
int	chars
the c standard says each enumerated type shall be compatible with chars a signed int type or an unsigned int type

7480271
prng	random
then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker

filtering	grouping
a workaround could be to create a link to the grouping which will call the same report and filtering it to show only the clicked grouping with the rest of parameters remaining the same

7480431
filtering	grouping
then the user can use document map to go to the grouping click it to trigger the filtering and print or export it to a file

get the height and width from canvas.getheight canvas.getwidth respectively and then make a new bitmap with same size and set it to the canvas

7480525
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
also whereever possible make use of the layout manager margin flexibility settings and width height flexibility settings to minimise the need to hard code values

7480548
setcontentview	findviewbyid
using setcontentview will be trouble some when you use findviewbyid for a old layout

7480548

subtract	add
you can t do pointer arithmetic in java you can t add or subtract from a java reference you can only dereferencere it or compare it with another one

7480858
subtract	add
what it means is that in java you can t add or subtract to a pointer since memory management is done by the jvm itself

7480871

so even though i m a bit late with this advice for this question do yourself a favor and use the autotools and automake

one way to solve this is to have your class implements an interface or extends a base class and then declare your list as list of thatinterface

7483150
ant	maven
i guessed itâ s a maven thing have mostly been using ant

7483151
implements	extends
you can only export use as remote objects instances of classes that explicitly implements an interface which extends remote

apache	nginx
i am currently testing moving from apache mod_wsgi to nginx and fastcgi

7484615

min	max
note that spline method gives you an approximation polynom that is both smooth - so it is easy to find local min maxs and both as close as possible to the original function and thus the local min max should be very close to the true value in the original function

7484974
min	max
to improve accuracy after finding the local mins max in the generated polynom for each x0 which represent a local min max you should look in all x such that to find the real min max this point represents

7485010
emacs	sublimetext
the only editor i ve ever used that supports this i m sure lots do however is sublimetext 2 but hopefully emacs has a trick up its sleeve too
