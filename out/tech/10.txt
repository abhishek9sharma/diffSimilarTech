put	get
the following code shows how to get at the pixels inside of a bitmap change them and put them back into the bitmap

91672
int	chars
another method was to use a unicode string where each chars is the int denoting a group and this makes searching easy but is a bit of a fudge

91695
addslashes	multibyte
if you re using some form of multibyte character set it s possible although probably only through poor design of the character set that one or both halves of a sixteen or thirty-two bit character representation is identical to the eight bits of a character addslashes would add a slash to

the only difference in c is that it s common to add and subtract from pointers - and if you get the logic wrong you can end up messing with data you shouldn t be touching

92247
metaphone	soundex
metaphone and double metaphone are similar to soundex except they may be tuned more toward your goal than soundex

if you are familiar with struts then stripes will make sense to you but it s so much better

92566
struts	stripes
they have a stripes vs struts section on their website

92566
struts	stripes
it allows you to work with any ajax framework you want and i don t think it would take long to migrate from struts to stripes

when you only need to update simple variables 32 or 64 bit int or pointers perform simply addition or subtraction operations on them or just swap the values of two variables most platforms offer atomic operations for that further gcc offers these as well

92639
rss	feed
for rss feed check out feeds.adobe.com

92664
inline	inlining

folder	directory
and then add a folder named vb_code and another folder named cs_code in your app_code directory

92971

i guess this is a big ask for the general case so to narrow things down a bit i m most interested in gnu emacs 22 on windows and debian linux

92992
serializable	deserialization
structs are particularly useful in file serializable deserialization as the structure can often be written to the file verbatim

93080

for example you could tokenize your document into a list of words by stripping out punctuation capitalization and stemming words running runs both - run to increase semantic matches

93673
dictionary	map
then just build a hash map such as hash_map in c++ a dictionary in python etc of each adjacent pair of words to its number of occurrences so far

in any other cases you can use alternatives such as queue + cron jobs or else

93944
ant	maven
do you use separate files ant maven resource filtering or other approaches

93947
ant	maven
you will need to generate a war file or the folder of files that would comprise the war file a project would typically include an ant or maven build script to do this or if the project used eclipse s dynamic web project type there might be a generate war option somewhere

94070
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

94099
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord is very heavy datamapper and domain object are separating those concerns out so you have a more defined set of code doing various aspects for you domain or entity objects

94113
ssl	https
https ssl tls options for wget

94119

94195
easymock	jmock
easymock or jmock are definitely the winners

94195

a method in a subclassing that used to override the superclass method will no longer do so due the changed method signature

94458
prng	random
sometimes the openssl command line utility does not abort with a prng not seeded error message but complains that it is unable to write random state

94511
getter	setter

94627
wxpython	pythoncard
pythoncard uses wxpython

range	minimum
note that in python 3.0 there is only range and it behaves like the 2.x xrange but without the limitations on minimum and maximum end points

95200
telerik	componentart
my only note is that currently 3rd party control vendors like telerik componentart etc don t really work well with mvc

95208
instances	transient
that being said if you have instances variables that are themselves not serializeable the only way i know of to get around it is to declare those fields transient

95210
udp	tcp
udp and tcp ip

95213
post	get
to save which items a user clicks on with no server-side post backs i was thinking a cookie would be a simple way to get this done

95224
serializable	deserialization
you will need to implement writeobject and readobject and do manual serializable deserialization of those fields

95242
persistent	transient
you can start by looking into the transient keyword which marks fields as not part of the persistent state of an object

95317
put	get
you ll have to put up with remembering to get it right

95346
rss	feed
i want to track how much traffic i m getting on an rss feed that is set up using .net 2.0 sql server

rss	feed
even if you don t want to use a 3rd party service it will give you an idea of what other people track for rss feed

95586

if you know which folder has the damaged .svn directory you can just delete that one directory and run an svn update again

96372
folder	directory
of course if the folder with the damaged .svn directory is the one containing a gigabyte then you re back where you started

96401
persistent	transient
you can tie the cart to some form of credentials rather than a transient session and persistent the cart long after the user has cleared their cookies

96419
getter	setter
other times you need to generate code using the # and ## concatenation operators like generating getter and setter for a property this is for quite a limited cases through

96486
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
ie firefox opera safari compatible

96490
vbscript	jscript
any comparison to jscript vbscript or dynamic typing is total bunk

96528
svg	vml
raphael is pretty cool for that and works across browsers since it uses vml for msie and svg for everything else

96569
vmware	esx
we use vmware esx 3.5.x exclusively

96574
svg	vml
however native vml can do text on a path and such things much like svg

96574
svg	vml
i think theoretically if you want complex text handling you d want svg and vml like the raphael library that dan mentioned

96641
width	height
so the basic technique is to update the top and left values as the user drags use these together with the defined width and height of the view onto the image to create the appropriate rect string and update the top left and clip properties of the img element s style property

96690
xpand	xtend
but despise those limitations the generation itself is quite easy with oaw you can navigate your models like a charm in xtend and xpand and by combining several workflows into bigger workflows you can also do very complex things

96711
post	get
encapsulate the session array in a session object that allows you to get variables from session get and post with a similar yet dissociable way including automatic security filters flash variables var that are used once then distroyed and default value setters

96765
maven	pom.xml
one of the goals for maven t project object model pom.xml is to capture all information needed to reliably reproduce an artifact thus passing settings impacting the artifact creation is strongly discouraged

96835
opera	safari
then move on to the other standards-based browsers namely safari and opera

96837
pop-up	dialog
it uses a custom control that simply adds code before and after the content to format it as a pop-up dialog

96837
hide	show
the yes button is a hyperlink because it executes javascript to hide the dialog and show a different one

96873
put	get
9 25 08 edit -- i just put up a blog posting on how to patch monodevelop 1.0 and get it working with astyle

96877
punctuation	words
or you can add various punctuation so that you no longer have a simple words in front of the

96982
freebsd	debian	freebsd	centos	debian	centos
runs on centos although debian fedora core freebsd are options if necessary

97027
post	get
i ve developed an open source oauth library for .net and posted an article on beginning to use oauth that might help to get you started - i tried to find a developers page api specification to brightkite - but because it s a beta service i don t have access - so perhaps post me a invite to this service via my blog and i can have a go at developing an example brightkite client at which point this answer can be revisited with some concrete example code useful to others

97096
sorting	grouping
without experiencing any speed penalties as the sorting will be performed on the grouping field anyway

97142
ubuntu	debian
others on debian or ubuntu seem to be able to get rid of this by installing libopenssl-ruby which is not available for redhat

97211
feedback	review
this provides you with even more immediate feedback you review code as you write it

97220
post	put	disk	ram
the proxy starts buffering in ram or in disk the request including headers and post put bodies

97259
vmware	esx
vmware s esx has a similar tool i believe its called esxtop

97276
unix	bsd
if i ve got a time_t value from gettimeofday or compatible in a unix environment linux bsd is there a compact algorithm available that would be able to tell me the corresponding week number within the month

97373
getter	setter
both languages provide it but c# properties provides a better design for it in regards to setter and getter

97431
google-chrome	safari
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control

97440
getter	setter
instead consider creating an class that has public setter and getter that populate a hash visible only to the object

97528
httphandler	httpmodule
i do not have access to iis 6.0 so i cannot map requests to asp.net and handle with a httphandler httpmodule

97613
single-quotes	backslash
if it s going into an html attribute you ll need to both html-encode as a minimum to to and to it and escape single-quotes with a backslash so they don t interfere with your javascript quoting

97630
getter	setter
assuming you want to serialize the state of the non-serializable field in myclass2 that field must be accessible to myclass either directly or through getter and setter

97630
implements	extends
per item 74 of effective java myclass2 must have a no-arg constructor accessible to myclass otherwise it is impossible for myclass to extends myclass2 and implements serializable

97761
width	margin
then the negative margin is used to move the left hand edge to the left a distance equal to half the element s width thus centering it

97811
many-to-one	one-to-many
if working with byte values you can have many-to-one and one-to-many mappings between the spaces

97850
put	get
i have a 2gb drive to put this on but i can get a bigger one if necessary

97885
bazaar	git
the best answer for you is some sort of dvcs popular ones being git mercurial darcs bazaar ...

97922
pull	push
once you set this up you can use git pull to fetch the changes only you don t need to clone anymore just the first time and git push to push the changes the other way

97937
subtract	add
convert your system.drawing.color to an hslcolor add subtract values against the luminosity and convert back to system.drawing.color for use in your app

97979
disk	ram
if you re doing the work in memory on one machine then ehcache will work perfectly assuming you have enough ram or a fast enough hard disk so that the overflow doesn t cause disk paging thrashing

97994
vim	emacs
an editor like emacs or vim can really focus on being a good editor first and foremost

98030
min	max
i prefer if statements over case statements because they are more readable and more flexible -- you can add other conditions not based on numeric equality like || max min

98044
webmethods	websphere
would it be using a websphere adaptor for sap or webmethods or something else

98048
put	get
obfuscate the password even rot13 will do it won t put up much defense if some does get access to the file but at least it will prevent casual viewing of it

98109
wxpython	pythoncard
later if you wish to make the transition to an event-driven gui paradigm you can do so with a more powerful gui package such as anygui pythoncard tkinter wxpython etc

98127
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
on every browser firefox opera camino safari etc... except for internet explorer i can access my own cookie

98143
cvs	rcs
inside the rcs directory are a bunch of v files which are compatible with cvs should you wish to upgrade to that one day and from there to any of the other vcs systems other posters mentioned

98151
getter	setter
there s also a nice bag of tricks directly available in the menus like generating getter setter extracting interfaces and the like

98225
vim	emacs
addendum the main reason i don t just use vim is that i love how emacs lets you open a file in two different frames added sorry this was confusing i mean separate windows which emacs calls frames

98230
extjs	mootools
jquery prototype extjs dojo mootools yui mochikit the list goes on

98244
getter	setter
i m fairly surprised at how unanimous the sentiment is that getter and setter are fine and good

98244
getter	setter
i suggest the incendiary article by allen holub getter and setter are evil

98244
getter	setter
essentially if you have getter and setter for each and every private field you are making those fields as good as public

98244
getter	setter
the vast majority of getter and setter don t make sense for their constituent objects

98244
getter	setter
getter and setter also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data perform a calculation and then set some other value in the object better known as procedural programming

98244
getter	setter
getter and setter however are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- ui persistence and so forth

98244
getter	setter
restricted access to a class s internals such as c++ s friend keyword java s package protected access .net s internal access and the friend class pattern can help you reduce the visibility of getter and setter to only those who need them

98270
gif	bmp
it is in c++ not c but you should be able to easily extract the bmp and gif load code

98288
jquery	scriptaculous	extjs	qooxdoo	extjs	mootools
a good place to start is with wikipedia s comparison of javascript frameworks which covers dojo extjs jquery midori mochikit mootools prototype scriptaculous qooxdoo yui and sweetdev ria

98427
avr	microcontroller
the arduino is also great because once you get familiar with it you can expand to writing raw c on any of the avr line of microcontroller with ease

98476
cldc	midp
i ve made sure to build it using the correct cldc and midp versions

98480
jobs	cron
this allowed them to notice and fix bugs in cron jobs that had problems

98489
cvs	svn
i m pretty used to how to do cvs merges in eclipse and i m otherwise happy with the way that both subclipse and subversive work with the svn repository but i m not quite sure how to do merges properly

98547
mouse	keyboard
it s great for allowing you to keep your hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse

98586
perl	tcl
our current best is derived from the best of perl + tcl s atof implementation and outperforms msvcrt.dll s atof by an order of magnitude

98586
perl	tcl
the bcd related x86 instructions seemed promising but i couldn t get it to outperform the perl tcl c code

98606
mouse	keyboard
i m always up for leaving my hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse

98653
tetris	pong
i ve been quite used to working on small projects which i coded with 1 000 lines or less pong tetris simple 3d games etc

98657
concave	convex
it depends whether you use sprites concave polygons convex polygons rectangles squares circles points.

98669
versioning	upgrade
however when i upgrade to prototype 1.6.0.2 the latest versioning from prototypejs.org everything breaks

98710
ocp	principles
ocp the open closed principles you

98751
lisp	scheme
i would never want to program in scheme or lisp again if i didn t have to but i am glad that i at least did a little in them just to learn the different way to program

98869
uniq	csplit
commands like head tail split csplit cat shuf shred uniq really help a lot in text manipulation

98869
put	get
for example if you need to put some chars in a 2gb file you can use split -b bytecount put the ouptut in to a file append the new text to it and get the rest of the content and add to it

98872
multiplying	add
the simplest is to loop for each digit character in the string keep a running total multiplying the total by 10 then add the value of the next digit

98872
multiplying	add
multiplier 0.1 multiplying by 4 get 0.4 add to running total makes 123.4

98872
multiplying	add
multiplier 0.1 10 0.01 multiplying by 5 get 0.05 add to running total makes 123.45

98872
multiplying	add
multipiler 0.01 10 0.001 multiplying by 6 get 0.006 add to running total makes 123.456

98918
ocp	lsp	ocp	principles	lsp	principles
as mentioned above some of the fundamental object oriented design principles are ocp lsp dip and isp

98934
integer	unsigned
for standard notation convert the aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd netmask into an unsigned 4 byte integer many networking libraries have this function and subtract that from 2 32 - 2

98938
getter	setter
it seems that many people understand information hiding in principle but then also think that getter and setter for everything properties for everything is an example of it

98938
getter	setter
the incendiary article by allen holub called why getter and setter are evil can be an eye-opener on the topic

98938
getter	setter
in short private members with direct getter and setter are little more than dressed-up public members

98938
getter	setter
it is true that getter and setter are needed at layer boundaries ui persistence etc but their visibility should be restricted to those classes that have a legitimate need to call them

98939
accessor	properties
you may ask why are you making accessor that just provided the exact same access that making the original properties public

98952
put	get
i haven t used this code for a put so i m not exactly sure if it s right for you but it might get you close

98977
integer	fractions
you will do better accuracy-wise to compute the integer and fractions parts separately and compute the fractions at the end for 12345.6789 compute it as 12345 + 6789 10000.0 rather than 6 .1 + 7 .01 + 8 .001 + 9 0.0001 since 0.1 is an irrational binary fractions and error will accumulate rapidly as you compute 0.1 n

99014
getter	setter
if everything is done with getter and setter and no other behavior you re writing procedural code

99014
getter	setter
there are plenty of patterns to deal with this problem and they don t involve reducing everything to bags of getter and setter

99086
getter	setter
this is why getter and setter are common .

99086
getter	setter
i think you re usually better off maintaining state in private variables and providing getter and setter as a public interface to them when outside objects need to access them mostly because you ll always have the option to provide some kind of validation or transformation if it becomes necessary down the line without breaking your interface

99121
lisp	scheme
languages like lisp and the very closely related scheme are to programming what latin is to english

99127
google-chrome	firefox
other than that i would suggest running your tests in firefox using google-chrome as it produces much more reliable results but sometimes it is simply not possible due to business requirements

99166
post	put
yes i am repeating some but i think the idea was to put one in each post and let the good ones float up

99228
for-loop	loops
i agree that the for-loop should be used whenever possible but sometimes there s more complex logic that controls the iterator in the body of loops

99239
lisp	scheme
though it s not blazingly fast like a compiled language nor is it particularly useful at serving websites or parsing text i ve found that scheme and other lisp by extension has no parallel when it comes to simplicity elegance and powerful functional manipulation of complex data structures

99260
tax	shipping
it may require things like sales tax shipping costs customer discounts

99337
accessor	properties	getter	setter
this is somewhat more nuanced than simply not exposing internal data - merely placing accessor methods or properties getter setter between internal data and the cold outside world is no more information hiding than launching into a conversation about this friend of mine and his herpes problem.

99386
pull	push
if you have control over the content or can gain control through mirroring or scraping you should consider using ajax or server-side includes to pull external data onto and push it off of the page - it ll end up being more flexible more robust and easier to manage in the end

99395
folder	directory
how to check if a folder directory exists in cocoa using objective-c

99485
printf	strtok	strtok	malloc
this library contains your printf your malloc your strtok etcetera

99508
bazaar	git
it integrate with your source countrol system including git subversion mercurial bazaar tla and monotone so all your docs track with your project

99520
put	get
so although i can put together a test project that exercises the interop layer i can t get a sense for how many of those methods and properties i m actually calling

99549
selecteditem	selectedindex
instead of trying to bind the selectedindex why don t you just bind the selecteditem in the combobox to the value in the record

99565
stateless	stateful
connection pools are simply a bridge between the post-web era of stateless applications http protocol and the pre-web era of stateful long-lived batch processing applications

99568
put	get
now for a rectangle vertex put the x value in the line equation get the y value and see if the y value lies in the rectangle bounds shown below

99616
folder	directory
with weborb you can simply deploy your dlls into the bin folder of the virtual directory and it will take care of enabling your classes as flex remoting services

99659
mouseup	mousedown
the action of clicking is broken into its two parts mousedown and mouseup

99702
int	double
say you want two hashtables one that maps objects of type string to type int and one that maps objects of type string to type double

99724
put	get
if you are developing a site that accepts passwords don t put a silly password limit unless you want to get tarred with the same brush

99729
getter	setter
i could have getter and setter for the x and y coordinates or i could just make them both public and allow free read write access to the data

99745
getter	setter
working with dependency injection a lot you often have setter but no getter as clients should be able to configure the object but others not get to know what s acutally configured as this is an implementation detail

99751
getter	setter
public getter and setter is pretty much equivalent to public fields.

99756
internationalization	localization
use errorcodes when you need localization internationalization -- in .net you could use these errorcodes to reference a resource file which will then display the error in the appropriate language

99796
octree	quadtree
i have also briefly perused material relating to quadtree and octree

99817
octree	quadtree
i don t have much experience with bsps but i can say that you should go with octree over quadtree when you the scene you re rendering is tall

99817
width	height
that is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumb

99817
octree	quadtree
generally octree won t bring a huge cost over quadtree and they have the potential to speed things up a decent bit

99848
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but it works in firefox safari and google-chrome

99926
octree	quadtree
two dimensions means a quadtree four an octree

99926
octree	quadtree
as stated as quadtree can work in three-space but if you want each dimension given a proper treatment an octree is the way to go

99954
yacc	bison
lex flex and yacc bison provide easy-to-use well-understood lexer- and parser-generators and i d really recommend doing something like that as opposed to doing it procedurally in perl

99954
verilog	vhdl
also if you re lazy check out the eclipse plugins that do syntax highlighting and basic refactoring for verilog and vhdl

99999
hex	binary
the methods you are allowed to use might be restricted by the author - no patching no disassembling - or involve anything you can do with a binary objdump and a hex editor
