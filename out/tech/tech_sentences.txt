the version of subclipse 1.2.4 currently available through aptana s automatic plugins manager does not work with the newest version of subversion
89
i m not sure how aptana is different but try either upgrading javahl or switching to the pure-java svnkit implementation within the subclipse config
111
is it possible the problem could lie within the configuration of tortoisesvn or even the installation of vista
123
is there an existing application or library in java which will allow me to convert a csv data file to xml file
126
what is the purist or correct way to access an object s properties from within an object method that is not a getter setter method
126
i know that from outside of the object you should use a getter setter but from within would you just do
127
this has religious war potential but it seems to me that if you re using a getter setter you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road somebody adds code to a setter that needs to run every time that property is set and the property is being set internally w o that setter being called
133
this may be too basic or limited of a solution but couldn t you do a string.split on each line of the file remembering the result array of the first line to generate the xml and just spit each line s array data out with the proper xml elements padding each iteration of a loop
139
another approach would be to utilize a private protected method to actually do the getting caching db etc and a public wrapper for it that increments the count
143
if your getter setter does something you need use it
143
the opposite case could be made that if you use the getter setter and somebody changes the getter setter they have to analyze all the places the getter and setter is used internally to see if it messes something up
159
of course if you have an interprocess communication mechanism memory allocated in the other process would not be freed until that process frees it or terminates

you can read csv file with this tool and serialize it to xml
190
converting a csv file to xml doesn t add any value
190
your program is already reading the csv file so arguing that you need xml doesn t work
190
on the other hand reading the csv file doing something with the values and then serializing to xml does make sense well as much as using xml can make sense.
210
i don t know the asp.net side of the problem but .net has a pretty powerful class system.globalization.cultureinfo
263
the app using sdl opengl so this isn t a gtk app
264
my application is pretty simple i ll be doing gets and puts of records that are about 1kb each
307
a different approach would be to consider a language that is specifically built for scripting such as ironruby ironpython or lua
307
ironpython and ironruby are both available today
344
then you could have a reference in the db to the assembly and class and use reflection to load the proper assemblies at runtime
367
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processor was booted
375
you can tell your users to add your from address to their contacts when they complete their order which if they do so will help a lot
388
the resulting set for any moderately large values of x and y will be huge and will grow exponentially as x and or y get bigger
396
use email authentication methods such as spf and dkim to prove that your emails and your domain name belong together and to prevent spoofing of your domain name
397
it also treats lines that are indented at the same column number as part of the same paragraph until there is an empty line which signifies a new paragraph
430
if you supply an expected range where max 1000 min you can easily guess
471
it s in pure python and as i say pretty nice but if you wind up needing more performance then lxml exposes the same api and uses libxml2 under the hood
538
it s written in java but there s integration with python projects
540
as far as i know there s no ready-made library to do this for you but producing a tool capable of translating from csv to xml should only require you to write a crude csv parser and hook up jdom or your xml java library of choice with some glue code
541
but we run the tests on different environments osx linux win and it sends emails --and it s written in python

in java the int type is a primitive whereas the integer type is an object
568
well in java an int is a primitive while an integer is an object
568
int primitive comparison

sign up for an account on as many major email providers as possible gmail yahoo hotmail aol etc
583
in c# int is just an alias for system.int32 string for system.string double for system.double etc.
583
personally i prefer int string double etc
650
i m also using a settings file and in earlier attempts when the assembly version changed my settings got reset to the default since the application looked for the settings file in another directory
742
one way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class
766
i can get python to work with postgresql but i cannot get it to work with mysql
798
mbunit is worth alook it has a set of features comparable to nunit it has its own gui or can be integrated into vs if you have resharper
875
subversion has problems but so does git mercurial cvs tfs or whatever
885
by default function arguments are passed by value so that if the value of the argument within the function is changed it does not get changed outside of the function
886
if you need a change from someone else though she has to commit to her local repo and then she must push that changeset to you or you must pull it from her
886
someone has to be responsible for doing that push pull from everyone else s repository resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before then doing the build and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos
893
if it were just 2 people i d say git is also easier because you can just push and pull from eachother
894
obviously this is less then ideal but it will get the job done and let you use scp sftp in classic asp
939
the xml serialization framework should be something that can scale in case you want to transform large or huge csv file to xml my recommendation is the sun java streaming xml parser framework see here which allows pull-parsing and serialization
943
it is your responsibility that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the server character set encoding. any other character following a backslash is taken literally
1043
w2k edit binary select data format hex click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok

1070
what is the correct way to get the process size on solaris hp-ux and aix
1130
also since the data is sorted given a non-key field the rest of the table doesn t need to be searched for duplicate values once a higher value is found
1130
creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value and pointer to the record it relates to
1130
a linear search on the id field would require an average of block accesses to find a value given that the id field is a key field
1145
if i try to use realloc i get an error that tells me i am doing a double free - which i don t see how i am since i am only using realloc
1149
just a shot in the dark because i haven t tried it yet but when you realloc it returns the pointer much like malloc
1154
as a general rule you should never do a free or realloc on a user provided buffer
1154
then you could create another function to do the multiple replacements but you will have to allocate the whole space for the resulting string and copy the user input string
1160
edit i m not using nant - only msbuild
1169
svn revision labeller is a plugin for
1189
firefox ie and opera all load successfully in the same scenario
1226
the downside with using signed numbers is that there s a temptation to overload them so that for example the values 0- n are the menu selection and -1 means nothing s selected - rather than creating a class that has two variables one to indicate if something is selected and another to store what that selection is
1232
with apache you can set up a similar catch-all for your vhosts
1235
i use this target combined with the svn revision labeller mentioned by lubos hasko with great results
1236
you may need to add it to your application s browscap in order to make use of some asp.net features
1241
as i currently have it set up so the client is only in receive mode after it sends data to the server this doesn t allow for the server to send a request at any time
1272
cvs only tracks modification on a file-by-file basis while svn tracks a whole commit as a new revision which means that it is easier to follow the history of your project
1272
add the fact that all modern source control software use the concept of revision so it is far easier to migrate from svn than it is from cvs
1300
now ccnet refers nant a lot but it looks as if ccnet can do most of the stuff nant could do through the project configuration and msbuild
1300
in short i am actually quite happy with msbuild especially since it s the official compiler front end and a bit uncomfortable with nant but i do not want to judge prematurely
1300
what would be reasons to use nant over msbuild
1320
nant is a great framework and msbuild is almost as capable
1348
also a shift in saturation from a small amount to zero is the difference between grey and pink elsewhere the shift would be the difference between two shades of red
1364
if you ve already got a bunch of custom tasks you use with nant stick with it - you don t gain much with msbuild
1364
that said there doesn t seem to be anything that nant can do that msbuild can t at its core
1375
on windows curses works out of the box ncurses doesn t and for a progress bar curses should be sufficient
1375
so use curses instead of ncurses
1375
also both curses and ncurses are wafer-thin wrappers around the c library - that means you don t really need ruby-specific tutorials
1380
here is a solution that works in xp vista but is definitely expandable to osx linux i d still be interested in another way
1413
you can set apache to serve pages from anywhere with any restrictions but it s normally distributed in a more secure form
1413
editing your apache files http.conf is one of the more common names will allow you to set any folder so it appears in your webroot

1453
i don t want to put a magic number in there for weight since the object i am using has a defaultweight parameter that all new shipments get if you don t specify a weight
1488
in addition to john downey and jdecuyper s solutions i ve also added an explicit deny bit at the end beginning of the bitfield so that you can perform additive permissions by group role membership and then subtract permissions based upon explicit deny entries much like ntfs works permission-wise
1496
for those of us that like to use the graphical version of vim or emacs instead of the console version which version do you recommend
1496
for vim there s mac os x vim macvim vim-cocoa
1496
for emacs carbonemacs xemacs and aquamacs
1517
macvim works well and certainly looks more mature than vim-cocoa moreover there is a cocoa plugin architecture in the pipeline for macvim and someone is already working on a textmate style file browser tray plugin which is a huge ++ imho
1528
these classes are all controls that are written to be compiled for either wpf or silverlight 2.0

this started with junit in the java world and has become a best practice in php as well with simpletest and phpunit
1724
i can only speak about .net but if you have an asp.net webservice you should be able to add an enumeration directly to it
1762
i am trying to set a flag to show or hide a page element but it always displays even when the expression is false
1793
you have to be careful between servers as security credentials don t come with the restored database
1820
i like testdriven.net even though i use resharper and i m pretty happy with xunit.net
1821
for the microsoft-types mstest is adequate but slow and clunky compared to nunit
1821
oh and testdriven.net will give you ide integration for both nunit and mbunit
1894
i create folders named after the build versions and put upgrade and downgrade scripts in there
1894
each one contains the script that allows you to upgrade or downgrade your database between versions
1894
then writing a program that can upgrade or downgrade your database for you is easy
1971
when i wrote my first trigger it was in perl because that was the language used in the example i found but the last triggers i wrote where in python because i m more comfortable with that
1971
i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported
1992
it s possible to use ruby and python in a very lisp like way which is one of the main reasons they have gained acceptance so quickly
1995
i have values stored as strings in a datatable where each value could really represent an int double or string they were all converted to strings during an import process from an external data source
1995
try to convert to int and then double
1995
regular expressions designed to match the pattern of an int or double

the bind element there specifies what to map to in this example it will apply that styling to any buttons whose name property has been set to dirt
2222
i m aware of flexunit but what i d really like is a unit test runner for ant nant and a runner that integrates with the flex builder ide aka eclipse
2277
you would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data
2308
i see in the stack overflow footer that the svn revision number is displayed
2360
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

first note that when ruby calls out to a shell it typically calls bin sh not bash
2400
this is like many other languages including bash php and perl

you can add a mouse click event to the treeview then select the correct node using getnodeat given the mouse coordinates provided by the mouseeventargs
2554
c# passes its arguments by value by default
2554
c# also has a out keyword and the difference between ref and out is a subtle one
2562
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv
2665
any future revision system will have an import from svn feature so it isn t like you can t change down the road if your needs grow
2668
git has some nice features but you won t be able to appreciate them unless you ve already used something more standard like cvs or subversion

unfortunately i also need to handle mouse click events on the picture box and need to be able to translate from screen-space coordinates to image-space coordinates
2810
you can add a timestamp field to that table and update that timestamp value with an update trigger
2818
might help a little but it might be easier to use something like mechanize in perl or python to mimic a browser more fully to get a good spider
2862

if you also need to track when a record has been deleted then you ll want to use an audit table and populate it from triggers with a row when a record has been added edited or deleted
2898
i ll mostly use it for coding python ruby
2905
if you keep at it you can use exclusively the keyboard and never touch the mouse which increases your editing speed by a significant margin
2905
update i think gedit is exclusively gui based though so it would be useful to learn emacs in case you are stuck with just a shell it is fully featured in both shell and graphical mode
2905
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
2905
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for
2913
do people usually make a separate development system with a frozen database so that any given function should always return the exact same result set
2915
if indeed you are able to insert using the same connection calls your problem most likely lies in the user apache not having select permissions on the database
2941
as for a gui library that works cross platform python s tk tcl widget library works very well and i believe is sufficiently cross platform
2941
tkinter is the python interface to tk tcl

personally i ran mine through a freshly installed spam assassin a trained spam assassin and multiple hotmail gmail and aol accounts
3026
if you are using visual studio 2005 and up you can create a setter getter real fast using the insert snippet command
3032
this will create a getter setter property for a variable
3054
in unix linux you can get ahold of minicom to play with the serial port directly
3060
just create a serialport object set its baudrate port and any other odd settings call open on it and write out your byte s
3075
i have a simple page with my scriptmanager and my updatepanel and my contenttemplate has one listbox and one label
3090
also we have a hardware splitter with a switch so we can monitor traffic to our application via a cable back to another port
3092
the classic hi-lo number guessing game can be simply implemented from the command line in 20-30 lines of code depending on language of course and gives you variables conditions loops and user input
3093
in the majority of major imperative language implementations every major implementation of c c++ basic python ruby java and c# iteration is vastly preferable to recursion
3095
after hello world move on to creating some basic variables arithmetic then onto boolean logic and if else statements

how can i set up my crontab to execute x script at 11 59pm every day without emailing me or creating any logs
3143
i m compiling a nant project on linux with teamcity continuous integration server
3143
update take a look at mbunittask its a nant task that uses sends messages that teamcity expects from nunit so it lets you use all of teamcity s features for tests
3162
also the example tutorial is now more agnostic - doesn t go into any configuration or project set up at all

i m wondering if there s a way to do what i can do below with python in ruby
3281
i have two arrays of equal sizes with the weights and data but i can t seem to find a function similar to map in ruby reduce i have working
3285
int is a primitive type and integer is a class type which is kind of reference type
3315
but of course the compiler spits its dummy because foreach expects an ienumerable rather than an ienumerator
3345
if you return ienumerator it will be a different enumerator object each time call that method acting as though you reset the enumerator on each iteration
3404
i use firebug and the mozilla js console heavily but every now and then i run into an ie-only javascript bug which are really hard to locate ex error on line 724 when the source html only has 200 lines
3437
will the maps api work over ssl https
3454
longer term i would probably use pl perl or pl python as i use perl for quick scripting and have been looking at python for a while now
3455
another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows xp + sql server management studio
3485
i can be wrong because i m autodidact but i never user public properties in my java clases they are allways private or protected so that outside code must access by getters setters
3485
if getter method is trivial i use the property directly but i allways use the setter methods because i could easily add code to fire events if i wish
3486
i implemented a rewrite rule in the .htaccess file that says
3492
all of that said to answer your specific question it s probably not worthwhile to use one of the xhtml doctypes unless you plan to produce valid or at least well-formed markup

according to bodmas multiplication should always be done before addition therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to bodmas and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5

the only possible solution here seems to be to run the timer service under its usual networkservice windows account and to run stsadm as a local administrator by storing the administrator credentials somewhere and passing them to system.diagnostics.process.run trough the starinfo s username domain and password
3776
once they are added they could be flipped through using hide show or bringtofront sendtoback methods
3777
well if you don t want to do it using ajax or any other way and just want a normal asp.net postback to happen here is how you do it without using any other libraries
3790
what i want to know is if there s some kind of redistributable that can be packaged with our software to allow 64-bit users to get the wmi installer provider put onto their machines
3795
why not just show hide the proper container when a node is selected in the grid
3862
distributed vcs let everyone have their own server where you can pull changes from other people and push changes to a server
3869
my recommendation you re safest with either git svn or perforce since a lot of people use them they are cross platform have good guis you can buy books about them etc
3881
i have always been torn in this situation should i throw an illegalargumentexception or a nullpointerexception
3886
it seems like an illegalargumentexception is called for if you don t want null to be an allowed value and the nullpointerexception would be thrown if you were trying to use a variable that turns out to be null
3902
does it apply only to the last select in the union

i used to use nunit but i switched to mbunit since it has more features

i am using the .net httplistener class but i m won t be running on iis and am not using asp.net
4004
created a working httplistener in c# that works for http connections
4004
debugging in visual studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the https connection starts - i don t see any place that i could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier
4004
netstat shows that listening ports are open for both https and http
4052
the problem i am having is that when i have my table open in design view and select manage fulltext index

i don t need anything as feature-rich or fancy as drupal or joomla
4177
i would expect tools that need this simply walk the tree in a depth-first manner and when they hit a leaf just process it compile and remove it from the graph or mark it as processed and treat nodes with all leaves processed as leaves
4221
i m going to use the linqdatasource with the listview control not a gridview or repeater
4231
i know that if you use a paging repeater or gridview with the linqdatasource it will automatically optimize the number of results returned but i m also pretty sure in the datasource wizard you can go to advanced options and limit it to
4249
there s no point in recommending a perl or php framework if your language of choice is ruby
4249
what s wrong with joomla or drupal
4312
i like php so phpunit or simpletest work well
4318
you don t really need a mock object framework just extend the class of the functionality you don t want to worry about in your test and make sure the class you are testing can use your mock instead of the real thing pass it in via a constructor or setter or something

it works for c++ c java objective-c python idl corba and microsoft flavors fortran vhdl php c# and to some extent d.
4391
in a dynamically-typed language such as python ruby or javascript you can generally just attach the methods onto arbitrary object or class and pass that as the parameter -- so a framework would add much less value
4404
i added a union to the select and wiped out some views as well
4408
another solution would be to set an include path in your httpd.conf or an .htaccess file
4455
i get that you re mocking the ianimals seeing as apparently you don t yet have any concrete animals to play with but why not just make them stubs because obviously you re not expecting anything else to happen to them apart from being put into the list
4505
in my case i d done computer science at uni learned pascal and cobol there and learned basic at home before that but i never really got anywhere with it until i became a self-employed web designer back in the 90s and my clients needed functionality on their web sites and were willing to pay about 10x more for functionality than for design
4505
so i learned perl then asp vbscript then javascript then flash actionscript then php - all in order to make the stuff i wanted to happen
4586

i am currently aware that asp.net 2.0 is out and about and that there are 3.x versions of the .net framework
4627
is it possible to upgrade my asp.net web server to version 3.x of the .net framework

4703
we have checkout folders from our repo as the staging and live sites so once you ve committed the changes from your working copy you can be 100 sure that the files you test push to staging and then live are the same because you just run svn update on each box and check the revision number
4703
oh and if you need to roll back in a hurry it happens to us all sometime or another you just run svn update again with the -r switch and go back to a previous revision virtually instantly
4706
it works with vmware server and workstation but afaik it s not available for esx server
4706
com visual basic vbscript c#
4725
also i want to add even if you find places where lisp will make sense you will probably not convince anyone else that it should be used over java c++ c# python ruby etc
4755
two semesters ago i used scheme a language based on lisp to write an interactive program that simulated abbott and costello s who s on first routine
4755
in summary learning lisp or scheme may not yield many practical applications beyond ai but it is an extremely valuable learning experience as many others have stated
4768
x11 forwarding with ssh is secure and uses the existing ssh connection to tunnel so working through a vpn should be no problem
4849
i have a winforms program written on .net 2 which hosts a webbrowser control and renders asp.net pages from a known server
4897
each time keyup or keydown is fired update the reference to the active selected item in the data structure
4911
one option i like is to use the email address of the user as login but how to i make asp.net authentication system use an email address instead of a user name
4924
one method you can used to obtain this option is by placing a checkbox object and changing its appearance from normal to button this will give you the same functionality that i believe you are looking for
4937
vim or emacs varying on religion will always be my first answer to this question over any point-and-click ide
4942
when asked to create system xyz and you ask to do it in python over php or ruby what are the main features you can mention when they require you to explain it
5014
i m only talking about web development because it appears that s what you are going to be working on seeing ruby python and php in the same list
5036
if you are taking your time switching to linux i d switch to emacs or vim at some point as well
5036
the key with either vim or emacs is knowing it could probably take you the better part of the day just to figure out what you want them to do let alone how to get them to do that
5071
do you guys know any way to recursively add everything in a given directory to the current cvs project or if svn or git makes this notably easier
5078
i d like to set up a cheap linux box as a web server to host a variety of web technologies php java ee come to mind but i d like to experiment with ruby or python in the future as well
5087
should i just skip ror and focus on learning grails that i ll be needing for work soon and work on learning ror django ruby python later
5087
and this while trying to avoid the centennial discussion of python vs ruby on rails
5091
so you see the compiler has created the instruction integer.valueof int to box the primitive inside the wrapper
5103
but watch for any horizontal margins on the floated elements in case you get the ie double margin float bug
5129
the simplest would be to use cgi and write normal python scripts while the second is using a web framework like django or pylons
5132
just a bit of a question is the reason they are choosing grails because groovy is closer in syntax to java than ruby or because they want access to java
5301
i am specifically thinking of ruby but i m sure they borrowed it from elsewhere probably perl
5320
there s a particularly good port for python wxpython as well as versions for different languages -- c# c++ perl and ruby come to mind -- and for various guis win32 mac os x gtk+ x11 motif wince
5343
bindings exist for ada qtada 4 c # qyoto kimono 5 java qt jambi 6 pascal perl php php-qt ruby rubyqt and python pyqt
5357
it would be impossible to call the tostring or equals methods for example since they are inherited in most cases
5360
when you try to do something in the subclass constructor before the base class constructor you are basically asking the compiler to extend a base object instance that doesn t exist yet
5423
in addition to your normal stylesheet definition you can add the following tag
5488
if you are using a button or hyperlink or something to trigger the popup to show could you also add an additional handler to the onclick event of the trigger which should still fire the modal popup and run the javascript at the same time
5494
external incoming requests will be using the host header portal.mycompany.com and be forced to use ssl
5494
any recommendations for how to set this up
5607
with identity page fill factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100 - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one
5619
the calling procedure can target outside sites both http https
5635
if by wss application you mean a sharepoint or moss site there are no free full-featured ajax libraries that are specifically designed for moss
5695
open your csproj file in notepad or notepad++
5703
will not execute any of the code you wrote in the enumerator
5712
the disadvantage is that you can t leverage things like databinding which is really powerful in frameworks like wpf and silverlight
5721
however after doing more and more silverlight and wpf stuff leveraging data binding i don t even name all my controls anymore since i don t have to reference them from code-behind since there really isn t any codebehind anymore
5726
its clipboard handling isn t that much of an improvement - mark with the mouse enter to copy or right mouse click to paste
5736
a drill is to ask them to implement a simple bytecode based virtual machine in any language they chose python works great for this with an instruction set focussed on pointer operations load store direct indirect addressing
5754
when you initialize the house object the name given to the constructor is copied into the private field fname
5756
another thing to keep in mind is that the system call interface on mac os x is different from what you might be used to on dos windows linux or the other bsd flavors
5810
if you download visualsvn server which is free you get a http server for your source code and can thus use the fogbugz scripts for integrating the two
5820
another if you re on linux bsd etc
5823
take command does support copy cut paste from the keyboard and the mouse
5863
i m just getting into creating some wcf services but i have a requirement to make them backward compatible for legacy .net 1.1 and 2.0 client applications
5887
right click the root project folder tortoisesvn export and tell it where you want the .svn free directory
5958
sometimes there is a need to do bulk inserts and having a uuid makes this very difficult usually requiring writing a cursor instead of a simple select into statement
5997
in order to do the right thing should i wrap such vs designer components or objects in a getter and or setter
6014
the general idea i have in mind is create one that before the commit will put the new revision number in the file get it using svnlook or maybe change a bogus property on the file it has to change or svn will ignore it
6018
a form could have forty or fifty controls it d be somewhat unnecessary and unwieldy to provide a getter setter for every control on the form
6079
all the source control systems i ve used cvs subversion git will handle binary files as well as text
6095
public methods or properties are behavior show hide position or data-oriented set data get data update data
6100
languages like python ruby and php make it easier to work with rest
6109
in wpf and silverlight the binding infrastructure takes care of the switching to the ui thread
6113
the data dll is used by both asp.net webforms and vb.net winforms
6120
set a threshold score such that any matchscore threshold will not be considered a match for a given companyname
6135
i ll often split these up into component boolean variables
6159
if you happen to be programming in python it s a cinch with the built-in all function applied over the list of your variables i ll just use boolean literals here
6188
standards based and works in ie6 safari firefox opera etc
6189
just use this simple coding model in all your callback methods and you can be sure that things are going to be okay
6192
the inefficient malloc free backend
6199
use the export command to export to a folder called export in the same directory as a file called deploy.bat then i run the deploy script v1 stands for version 1 which is what version i am currently on in this project this script utilizes 7-zip which i have placed on my system path so i can use it as a command line utility
6285
if safari and firefox support is good enough for you there is a css solution
6309
typically integer values are signed unless you explicitly need an unsigned value
6344
also it won t work if your min and max are greater than 10000
6378
i m starting to get the feeling that each of these client implement different parts of the standard and i m unsure of what pieces of information we should be trying to export from the application so that someone can put it on their calendar especially around recurrence
6405
just malloc a new buffer return that and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text
6424
method will be slower due to the need to create the this object for the constructor
6441
however if you don t use your mouse to move between the 2 options enable... and disable... then the radio buttons do not appear to be disabled or enabled correctly until you click anywhere else on the page not on the radio buttons themselves
6456
in firefox and safari document.frm in your code evaluates to undefined
6467
i m using a function to increment a day and another to decrement
6471
at least it didn t worked in aix and solaris
6474
why not write your scripts using a language like perl or python instead which more naturally supports complex date processing
6474
sure you can do it all in bash but i think you will also get more consistency across platforms using python for example so long as you can ensure that perl or python is installed
6474
i should add that it is quite easy to wire in python and perl scripts into a containing shell script
6531
however this latter technique is useful if you want each copy to have it s own copy the main use of that being to do private privileges methods which have access to private variables declared inside the constructor and inherited via the closure mechanism
6566
maybe it should be a tunable runtime parameter in the interpreter
6573
i noticed that a few people mentioned flot but nobody mentioned flotr
6578
i m reasonably comfortable with c s malloc and free concept but cocoa s references counting scheme has me rather confused
6614
the basic way this differs from malloc and free is that any given object doesn t need to worry about other parts of the system crashing because you ve freed memory they were using
6629
if index is a number for example 10 the first line will evaluate to array 10 and the other two lines will evaluate to array 10 which is a different element than array 10
6646
i ve done some more tests and found that if an array index or key is made up of only digits it s always converted to an integer otherwise it s a string
6658
we have been considering switching over to junit 4 for new tests being written but i have been keeping an eye on testng for a while now
6658
what experiences have you all had with either junit 4 or testng and which seems to work better for very large numbers of tests
6659
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take
6660
if you re looking for client-side check out flotr which is based on prototype javascript library or flot which is based on jquery
6661
i m aware of things like onchange onmousedown and onmouseup but is there a good reference somewhere that lists all of them complete with possibly a list of the elements that they cover
6662
w3schools seems to have a good javascript events reference html dom events
6671
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well
6683
i ve used jfreechart in a rather complex application that needed to visualize data streams and calculations based on the data
6765
i am really fond of technologies that java offers - particularly spring framework and wicket and i am quite familiar with java from others projects and assignments before
6778
the background renders correctly in firefox and safari however as soon as you use the browser s scroll bar then mouse over the flash control you must click once to activate the control
6824
string.format uses a stringbuilder internally
6824
but it s a guess try benchmarking and or profiling the two to get a proper comparison
6824
if you suspect a perf bottleneck then stick a profiler on your code and see where it really is
6854
i like the free silk icons at famfamfam but they re png s and when i convert them to ico format they look pretty crappy
6866
it s much easier to go back later and introduce methods attributes and properties for which are asked versus anticipating something that may never come
6916
it is much better to have readable code with easy debugging capabilities ie not hiding the stack trace rather than make something run a nanosecond faster
6932
i d like to do something like youtube or google video where users can upload whatever format they want and i encode it to flv mp3 and or mp4
6940
basically i can right-click on any window and set always on top
6943
furthermore as matt acknowledges he uses an int as a lock rather than an os primitive
6947
jvm has scala which has actors very much like erlang and is functional hybrid language
6950
the left monitor is actually a separate computer running linux and keyboard mouse shared with synergy so i have multiple ebooks or documentation pages open one on each virtual desktop.
6955
edit chris s suggestion to use an atomic compare-and-swap would certainly work
6969
ffmpeg can do it its a command-line tool that uses the libavcodec
7015
my next thoughts are to have some sort of controller that will read in a line and assign it a thread to parse but i m not sure if the controller will end up being a bottleneck if the threads are processing the lines faster than it can read and assign them
7031
using javascript to show and hide buttons and php to check to see which buttons to show
7035
i m writing a few little bash scripts under ubuntu linux
7035
so far the only input required is a password for sudo - and gksudo handles that fine
7076
unwinding that assumption can be tedious. emma is a classloader that does byte-code re-writing for code-coverage collection in java
7080
the following will silence both stdout and stderr
7080
the following silences stdout but stderr will still appear via stdout
7087
if you don t intend to show the buttons it s not useful to send the html and images to the browser and then hide them with javascript
7090
imagemagick delegates the pdf- bitmap conversion to ghostscript anyway so here s a command you can use it s based on the actual command listed by the ps alpha delegate in imagemagick just adjusted to use jpeg as output
7098
if you are using a browser that doesn t implement border-radius chrome pre-v4 firefox pre-v4 ie8 opera pre-v10.5 safari pre-v5 then the links below detail a whole bunch of different approaches
7099
although this works ok in the latest versions of safari and firefox but not at all in ie7 and i don t think in ie8 or opera
7101
if you just need all of the work started in the loop to finish before the code continues but you don t care about the order the work within the loop finishes then calling join is the answer
7138
i am not any sort of networking expert so the solution would need to be really easy to set up maintain and use
7151
unlike rails url_for anchor urlhelper.generateurl and actionlink redirecttoaction and so on which use it don t have a magic property name that lets you encode an anchor
7156
watchguards use a fairly standard ipsec vpn so there s a number of ways of getting linux mac to connect to them - openswan is one you can also use openvpn or racoon iirc although i wouldn t promise that any of these will be entirely straightforward
7190
we are currently looking at configuring cruise control to work with nant nunit ncover and trac as a test case
7192
using coalesce or isnull for that matter as shown in the link in lance s post uses a similar method but doesn t leave you with an extra comma to remove
7206
there is now a firebug lite that works on other browsers such as internet explorer safari and opera built
7217
using .net s codedom we compile the scripts from the database using the vb codedomprovider annoyingly it defaults to .net 2 if you want to support 3.5 features you need to pass a dictionary with compilerversion v3.5 to its constructor
7221
we use cruisecontrol with nunit ncover fxcop svn and some custom tools we wrote ourselves to produce the reports
7222
this is the firebug lite that john was referring to that works on ie safari and opera
7225
you can adjust the scrollbar width in display properties and it will affect all windows on the terminal
7257
as you have a string i d look at whether you need to know that it s an int rather than a double
7257
if int.tryparse passes then so will double.tryparse so you could half the number of checks - return either double or string and floor the doubles when you expect an int
7281
if the remainder is zero for any number in the list then the integer is not prime
7343
i m not in a position to modify the permissions on folders especially outside of the virtual directory home folder and don t already have an app_data folder so am a bit hesitant to go with that
7345
i m not in a position to modify the permissions on folders especially outside of the virtual directory home folder and don t already have an app_data folder so am a bit hesitant to go with that
7398
i haven t seen any questions relating to gnu autoconf automake builds but i m hoping at least some of you out there are familiar with it
7477
now i can reduce the size of the text area but then i have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 one takes 5 lines
7540
i would like to be able to see what tabs are using what percent of my processor via the javascript on that page or anything in the page that is causing cpu memory usage
7551
when designing a rest api or service are there any established best practices for dealing with security authentication authorization identity management
7551
if it matters we would be using wcf with pox json serialized messages for our rest api s services built using v3.5 of the .net framework
7558
unfortunately after i add the new nodes and items to the tree the folder is automatically collapsing again requiring a second click to view the sub-nodes
7561
you can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output
7562
the simpler approach is http basic auth over ssl
7566
make sure you aren t returning any references or pointers to objects on the stack
7642
in c# you could call the private field foo the property foo and refer to the private field as this.foo in the constructor
7644
at the end of the day being consistent will make your code much more readable and maintainable than using any set of right conventions
7669
it opens a console then shoves the right handles into stdout and stdin so the debug function which was designed as a stdio interactive function can interact with the newly created console
7678
i don t think there s one set of absolute guidelines on any of these
7682
msvcrt tries to emulate the unix handle numbers where stdin 0 stdout 1 stderr 2 and so on
7715
naming conventions allow the development team to design discovereability and maintainability at the heart of the project
7715
so what are the basic tenets of a good naming convention and standards -
7719
a click or move on the screen is still considered a mouse event
7724
the adventureworks sample uses a very clear and consistent naming convention that uses schema names for the organization of database objects
7729
the server-side part of this http pseudo-streaming method is fairly simple to implement for example in php as an apache httpd module or a lighttpd module
7748
my favourite start learning to code project is the game snakes or tron because it allows you to start slow variables to store the current worm position arrays to store the worm positions if the worm is longer than one piece loops to make the worm move if switch to allow the user to change the worm s direction ...
7756
the problem is that the op s data seems to be comma delimited and solaris 8 s uniq doesn t allow you any way specify the record separator so there wasn t a super clean way to do the preprocessing using standard unix tools
7756
you could probably massage the uniq output into a single regexp to feed to grep but the benefit would only be known if the op posts expected ratio of lines containing suspected duplicate keys to total lines in the file
7761
i would say that normally this is not a big problem but in this case i think the line tag is most correct since it explicitly shows that you don t actually interpret what the lines may mean in different cultures
7829
when you think the words unique or duplicated think
7833
however in firefox 3.0.1 and safari 3.1.2 you must click the play button twice to see the animation
7842
for the iteration and s log s for the sorting where s is the size of the set
7844
hmm there might be a substantial difference between wpf en silverlight on this point
7846
i would like to use a language that i am familiar with - java c# ruby php c c++ although examples in any language or pseudocode are more than welcome
7873
is there a way to hide this on the loginview as the contentplaceholder does an excellent job for this
7886
you could use the old-school c way and call fopen fread fclose or you could use the c++ fstream facilities ifstream ofstream or if you re using mfc use the cfile class which provides functions to accomplish actual file operations
7888
you need to use an ifstream if you just want to read use an ofstream to write or an fstream for both
7949
classic menubar-based editors like winedit gedit or bbedit
7949
emacs and its brethren xemacs aquamacs etc
7949
emacs and textmate are also easily extensible by user-created scripts in lisp emacs or any other command-line-language textmate
7958
you can use javascript to hide the elements just before displaying an overlay then show them again once you re done
8087
in java for example common usages are jdbc calls of raw sql object relational mappers jdbctemplate spring stored procedures etc
8092
using this pattern you won t have any naming conflicts with the private field and your constructor parameter in c# or vb.net
8099
i ve used this pattern for sql server mysql and oracle
8109
you can define the ui in xul+js and use back-end components written in c++ though there are python and java bridges available too
8135
foreach of these rows you want to do the following regex substitution s d+ d+ 1 2 and then update the field with the new value
8196
both python and lua are excellent languages that are used to script a large number of applications civ4 and blender use python supreme commander uses lua etc
8196
if you are using c++ check out the boost python library
8216
well if it s a csv and it this is a one time process open up the file in excel and then write formulas to populate your data in any way you desire and then write a simple concat formula to construct your sql and then copy that formula for every row
8249
change the definition to int so that error messages can be transmitted and then use fseek and ftell to determine the file size
8250
a quick search in google found a method using fseek and ftell and a thread with this question with answers that it can t be done in just c in another way
8273
iirc the standard library defines off_t as an unsigned 64 bit integer which is what everyone should be using
8355
how do i set it up so that the rewrite rule will rewrite dbadmin.example.com to secure.example.com dbadmin but without displaying the rewrite on the client s address bar the client will still just see dbadmin.example.com all over https
8371
how do you redirect https to http
8371
i have a server on https for which i paid an ssl certification for and a mirror for which i haven t and keep around for just for emergencies so it doesn t merit getting a certification for
8381
ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology -
8439
if i set the rectangle with the pagebreakatend property and the table with the visibility condition then i still get a page break even when the table isn t shown
8454
for an example my documentroot is var www but there is this section in the default available site
8480
however you can perform a logical not a bitwise comparison between the numeric value and the none enumerated constant to determine whether any bits in the numeric value are set
8574
you can use this public property to hide or show the control or to ask the control current visibility property
8584
i have been informed that similar support are being planned or have been implemented in oracle and mysql out of interest
8591
for example to have a short cut you can use at any time say f1 to open help that input binding must be set on the window object since that always has focus when your app is active
8602
you could get visual c++ express and put together the startup program pretty easily
8637
a method that i have developed and which seems to work perfectly although i probably don t get as much comment spam as you is to have a hidden field and fill it with a bogus value
8669
isn t there some way of storing the result set and having both the main report and the subreport reference the same data
8726
however i ve recently found that the script fails on ftp servers and probably anything that s not http or https
8730
if a query is more then just a simple select on a single table i always run it through explain if i am on mysql or postgresql
8748
based on the brief information provided would a language such as python provide the required functionality and performance as well as addressing the memory allocation and various other c++ related problems which arise
8756
edit to avoid people reading only the question and answering before reading my other reply i ll add my clarification for gpl licensing and similar issues here
8760
your only problem would be the performance part as python will likely never be as fast as a compiled c++ program
8771
you could try to use python and extending it with your current c++ modules for the performance heavy parts
8780
of the imperative languages perl is an obvious option python is popular and ruby has a high profile and probably cleaner oo features than the first two
8891
another alternative is to embed python in your c++ program
8891
in python rather than c or c++
8894
the instructions describe how to set it up but do not really give any indication of what its purpose is and the phppgadmin site was not very helpful either
8918
i am trying to make it my single scripting language replacing the things i did in perl python vbscript .bat .cmd and one off little utility conversion programs that i would create
8920
to move the installation you will need to uninstall all editions of 2008 you have installed including any express editions and then the choose installation location option should enable
8950
edit browsing a sharepoint wss site on a mac whether using firefox or safari has a very similar look and feel as it does on windows ie
9030
enabling ssl https for iis in windows xp
9040
even if you do get it to switch drives it still is going to put a lot of stuff on the system drive
9045
as part of that buffer class i actually run the html through html tidy and a few scrub-n-replace bits to get valid xhtml
9081
i would like to grep for a string but also show the preceding five lines and the following five lines as well as the matched line
9142
i ve been looking at the ntag project as well which handles mp3 wma ogg
9144
honestly i doubt that you ve got a lot of incoming developers who suck with c++ but would be awesome with python anyway
9193
linux freebsd and mac os x this final one on different hardware all degrade much more gracefully in terms of aggregate bandwidth when moving from one thread to two
9193
my home unbranded pc amd athlon64 running windows xp 32-bit freebsd 64-bit and linux 64-bit with single drive
9218
let the nice package maintainers from linux distros such as debian or ubuntu do the work for you
9222
i d like to add the caveat that i ll assume the column that you don t want contains hardly any data
9279
i basically just need a tool that works in osx or linux and keeps a remote directory in sync mirrored with a local directory while i make changes to the local directory
9288
this takes all of the files in my home directory and uses rsync s archive mode -a verbosly -v lists all of the changes made -i while deleting any files that don t exist anymore --delete and puts the in the folder home me school on my remote server
9304
but when i want to actually implement some getter setter logic i have to use the private public pair anyway
9304
i see the benefit that i save a lot of code one vs six lines without losing the ability to change the getter setter logic later but then again i can already do that by simply declaring a public field public string title without the need of the get
9308
also the properties allow you to set different access levels for the getter and setter which you can t do with a field
9340
is the addition of the extra textbox possibly changing the tab order of your elements perhaps making the button the default control in that case
9341
if they then click the back button the second drop-down will no longer be enabled although it should be since there s something selected in the first drop-down
9345
the assembly that contains myapp.controls.sortablelistview isn t installed in the gac by any chance is it
9382
using asp.net mvc just whipped up a quick bit of code using the .net xml generation library and then just passed that to a view page that had an xml control on it
9391
the number on the webpage is most likely i m assuming here the svn revision number for the whole project
9391
any ci solution should be able to do this set this up myself with ccnet and teamcity although not webpages but automatic versioning of deployment assembly versions
9391
in order for you to do this use a ci solution that supports it or use your build process msbuild nant to store that version and write it to the files before deploying it
9472
i have a wcf service that i have to reference from a .net 2.0 project
9472
so i was wondering if anyone has any pointers or resources on how i can setup a .net 2.0 project to reference a wcf service
9596
but then again i prefer my private public pair to be together because that allows for easier debugging of getter setter logic as you see the private and public property next to each other
9615
ie handles vml though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser svg vs
9615
are there any cross-browser javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup not obligatory svg and offer availability to attach to dom events
9615
the level of interactivity i need is ability to detect dom events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover mouseout click etc
9639
results in a null if t is a reference type and 0 if it is an int false if it is a boolean
9641
it certainly helped me test out the webservice but it didn t much help with using the wcf service in my .net 2.0 application
9650
just like i can run perl or python
9654
safari opera and firefox all support svg natively eg
9654
unfortunately any standards based approach is kind of destroyed by ie s willful disregard of what is happening outside its own ecosystem however there are a number of libraries that try to convert canvas svg into vml ie s proprietary vector language such as iecanvas
9687
if i really try to support the requested ability to query any combination of any field in any table this is going to be one massive set of if statements
9698
we re looking at drools guvnor possibly integrated with jbpm as in this presentation to add a workflow engine to our spring java ee app but we re still in the very early phases of trying it out
9711
i m not sure what the case is for assignment to 64 bit variables it depends on the processor i would assume that it is not atomic but it probably is on modern 32 bit processors and certainly on all 64 bit processors
9749
vmware esx vmware server xen installations..
9788
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten
9801
if you really want a free alternative that is similar to ms sql and supports growth should you need it you could have a look at mysql or postgresql
9810
take into consideration the fact that for globalization localization purposes some parts of the world use different calendars methods of organization of the year
9826
while linux and others can choose between different policies before vista windows was locked in a single policy a fifo queue where all requests where splitted in 64 kb blocks
9844
then from here you can use the number of days in the month datetime.daysinmonth in order to determine how many weeks when you divide by seven and then add the number of days from 1 that your first day falls on
9870
the cool thing about doing it this way is that i also have an export link that allows you to get all rows from the report returned as csv above every grid in my application
9950
my experience is with the .net platform and my favoured logging tool would be log4net since it s free has extensive configuration options and if you re sensible in how you implement your logging it won t noticeably hinder your application s performance
9950
alternatively there is .net s built in debug or trace class in the system.diagnostics namespace
9958
assuming strict mode the default compiler mode it is not possible to modify the prototype of non-dynamic class types in actionscript 3
10048
interestingly enough you program silverlight with javascript and that would be the major benefit to simply upgrading to a faster and more dynamic dom that is implemented in silverlight but still writing the same code
10048
for simple js animations look at jquery or scriptaculous
10061
i d like to be able to do this with the gps hooked up to a laptop by bluetooth or even just a usb cable
10061
bonus points if you can show me some examples of using an api to push and pull data to and from the gps
10062
so you might want to learn haskell ocaml or another functional language
10083
for these last ones i could always put .bat files on my path but that s going to get old fast.
10101
for example if you wanted to drop the left-most bit of an unsigned integer then you might try this as your mask
10106
unxutils for ls rm grep uniq sort .
10139
it s licensed under the gpl rather than lgpl
10149
also i m comfortable with lisp but not super familiar with elisp
10178
i ve done a bit of integration between asp.net and dynamics ax4 - it has a .net api called business connector that gives you access to ax s full internal object model - if ax does it your web app can do it too
10232
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant
10232
that being said if you re already using ant it can be a little tricky to transition over to maven
10282
filter your rows and use the row_number function to add row numbers in the order you want
10293
has anyone used jaxer in a production environment i am curious as to how it holds up compared to something like php ruby etc
10324
in c what is the most efficient way to convert a string of hex digits into a binary unsigned int or unsigned long
10346
allows for auto width and auto height elements
10366
this works great in ie7 not at all in every other browser i ve tried ff2 ff3 opera 9.5 safari
10412
i have a project where i would like to generate a report export in ms word format
10416
textmate is a great editor and there is a way to replicate some of the functionality in gedit
10416
check the article out here to modify gedit to behave like textmate
10478
ideally i d like some function that can return the currently selected text in the browser window that works in ie7 and 6 if possible firefox 2 3 and safari 2
10485
try setting the height and width of the div and make sure it is on top by setting its z-index higher than everything else
10513
it means that your domain model is pure and contains zero references to any type of persistance file i o database etc
10528
it s also available through macports and fink
10532
i ve been using php mysql for ages and am about to start using postgresql instead
10536
however common lisp is very different from scheme
10536
as you mentioned sicp is for learning scheme not lisp or at least not common lisp and not emacs lisp
10558
the easiest to get started with according to most people are python and ruby
10586
obviously i could write a big switch statement with a case for every possible type of element which can occur in an xml document and just write it back out again but it seems like a lot of trouble for something which seems like it should be simple
10587
the short answer is that early or static binding refers to compile time binding and late or dynamic binding refers to runtime binding for example when you use reflection
10589
is 35f a decimal number and an f or is it the hex value 0x35f
10625
notepad++ works just fine although i choose to stick with notepad -m or even sometimes the built-in edit.
10634
update any compelling features that would cause me to shift from nant to msbuild
10639
i feel that msbuild and nant are fairly comparable
10645
i use msbuild alongside nant because the current version of nant can t as yet compile .net 3.5 applications same was true when .net 2.0 first came out
10684
it no longer occurs in solaris sunos 5
10714
the asp.net worked thread afaik doesn t come from the thread pool and shouldn t get affected by your call to the remoting service unless this is a very slow processor and your remoting function is very cpu intensive - in which case everything on your computer will be affected
10748
i ve used rcs cvs sccs sourcesafe vault perforce subversion and git
10779
you cannot completely protect a stored password against a determined sysadmin with root access so there s not really any need to try
10809
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html
10904
wpf is the future of smart clients in .net and the skills you pick up you ll be able to reuse if you want to make browser-hosted silverlight applications
10926
filtering and sorting are the main reason
10933
most of the tools i ve seen are based on php java python etc
10990
i have been told that this folder needs to be owned by the webserver user for the upload process to work so i created the folder and then set permissions as such
10990
is there a permission setting that will allow me to still upload files and then modify them later as a user other than the webserver user
10996
then create a second class that inherits from the basedetail class that has the additional parent plan object so you can create a basedetail class when you want to just create a detail row and assign the planid to it but if you need to populate a full detail record with the parent plan object you can use the inherited detail class
11014
if the object is on the stack then you might be able to assert within the constructor that the value of this is always close to stack pointer
11060
i have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our c++ code generated via swig and generates code needed to expose this as webservices
11119
now someone comes along who isn t really paying enough attention and decides that something extra needs to happen if var 1 so they do this
11163
nunit mstest ect all do pretty mutch the same thing
11197
since setting the properties with javascript never seemed to work but setting using firebug s inspect did i started to suspect that the javascript id selector was broken - maybe there were multiple items in the dom with the same id
11201
what i d probably do is just prepare several queries and execute the right one depending on what i ended up needing
11288
so wpf doesn t support standard sorting or filtering behavior for views of compositecollections so what would be a best practice for solving this problem
11288
i d get all the default view sorting and filtering behavior on my new composite object collection and i d be able to put a data template on it to display my list items properly depending on which type is actually stored in that composite item
11301
if you can t predict at this moment how people will sort and filter your object collection then you should look at system.linq.expressions namespace to build your lambda expressions on demand during runtime first you let user to build expression then compile run and at the end you use reflection namespace to enumerate through results
11305
i m a newbie when it comes to xml since i m stuck in vb6 and vba because of the field i work in
11312
note that this is an inherited nsresponder method not a nstextview method
11358
asp.net mvc should ultimately become part of the core .net framework
11373
tns_admin is an environment variable that points to the directory where the sql net configuration files like sqlnet.ora and tnsnames.ora are located
11443
it s certainly more work but you probably need to bite the bullet and set up an end-to-end regression test suite fixed c++ files - swig interfaces - python modules - known output
11443
you really want to check the known input fixed c++ code against expected output what comes out of the final python program
11471
i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections

there is no way you can have a moss 2007 wss 3.0 development for free but a microsoft action pact is so cheap to get
11714
static code analysis ndepend fxcop others
11770
it s not really an issue if you re using asp.net stack webforms mvc or rolling your own because all your aspx files get compiled and therefore not touched by webserver
11819
i have warehouse installed on a linux machine running the ubuntu server edition nginx for the http server and mongrel cluster
11820
are the bytes stored in base 10 hex or binary characters
11857
i would like to gauge what solutions other people put in place to get team system functionality
11873
despite this you should be able to avoid doing any session management on the server avoid any explicit caching of the result set and just rely on the backing store s caching to keep your life simple
11902
for example we have a server written in pure python which is replacing a server written in c a client written in c++ gsoap and a client written in cocoa objective-c
11937
here is my controller which is located in the controllers folder
11970
i ve only had experience with vmware esx and while it s a fairly expensive product it is also very powerful
11973
it s free open source and it runs on windows linux macintosh and opensolaris
11994
all properties do is give you a concise syntax for specifying both the getter and setter in a single line and allow you to synthesize their implementation
11994
that s generally a good pattern with properties only ever touch the underlying instance variable for a property in initializers in -dealloc and in the getter and setter for the property
12011
it s pretty customizable and has a pretty good interface for updating your web.config for the configuration of the logging
12047
if your on windows platform with .net 3 take look at wwf wcf as this can help in webservice to webservice - lots more in the acutal platform now for all these concerns without the overhead of biztalk and others
12087
there are various workarounds at the moment but they re different between ie and fx i don t know about safari opera etc
12093
every time you use yield you get a whole new class that implements both ienumerable and ienumerator clever optimisation unreadable code
12140
this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects
12144
at the moment every application we distribute is using it s own ad-hoc configuration files whether it s property files ini style xml or json internal use only at the moment
12144
edit really needs to be a cross platform solution linux windows solaris etc
12167
i m not sure that this is the best way to do it but when i m deploying ruby gui apps not python but has the same problem as far as .exe s are concerned on windows i just write a short launcher in c# that calls on my main script
12176
is there any way to include the svn repository revision number in the version string of a .net assembly
12184
there s nothing wrong with xml it s reasonably human readable as much as yaml or json or ini files are but remember its intent is to be read by machines
12225
how can i have the mee field pre-populate with the database value when the data is shown on the page
12248
and with the now very small amount of application specfic code they get put into company.applications.applicationname this helps me really think about business objects a lot more since i dont want too much within this namespace so i come up with more flexible designs
12280
lesson learned use transaction commit and rollback
12287
xml json ini
12313
we ve gone through so much pain with tfs msbuild using tfsdeployer custom powershell scripts etc to get it to do what we were able to do with nant out of the box
12317
the main reason i still use nant over msbuild for my automated builds is that i have more granular control on my builds
12317
however i do use both nant and msbuild in conjunction for some build tasks like building wpf applications
12317
it is just a lot easier to compile a wpf application with the msbuild target within nant
12349
i didn t reinstall php i just copied all of the dlls in the ext folder to my php extensions folder as specified in the extension_dir variable in php.ini and i copied the versions of libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll from the php download into my system32 directory
12351
i can permit things like width height 1+1 3
12353
it is also responsible of calling any code that should run after main like atexit
12408
as others have said this entry point will not be main but will instead be a part of the runtime library - it will do things like initialising static objects setting up the argc argv parameters setting up stdin stdout stderr etc
12412
bash is the better interactive shell in my opinion.
12513
under linux osx use the opendir readdir closedir functions
12537
i m looking for software such ms word wiki tex latex lyx and for automated tools
12538
the polymorphism way might involve an abstract arithmetic class with an evaluate a b function which is overridden for each of the operators involved addition subtraction etc to return the appropriate value and the tree contains integers and arithmetic operators which can be evaluated by a post
12543
for development documentation specifically api docs tools like javadoc and doxygen are used a lot
12543
i don t see tex or latex used much outside of academic or research communities
12553
but more importantly it s plain text which means it s really easy to manage with our vcs cvs svn git etc. and it can easily live right there with the code -- so there s no excuse for not updating the documentation as you develop
12557
lastly lists are not hashable so the type of mapping done with dictionaries hash tables in perl associative arrays in php must be done with tuples
12559
now we keep local copies of the installation and configuration files
12561
though they re mostly targeted at automating administration tasks or shortcuts for users autohotkey and autoit let you automate nearly anything you want as far as mouse keyboard interaction
12561
some of the mouse stuff can get tricky when the only way to really tell it what you want to click is an x y coordinate but for automating entirely arbitrary tasks on a windows machine it does the trick
12575
as well as hashes the general style is that curly braces are often used for blocks that can fit all onto one line instead of using do end across several lines
12642
i have tried both webclient and webrequest both have their problems
12669
asp.net lets you add functionality using .net
12671
when the button is clicked the modal popup opens but the button_click event is never fired so the modal doesn t get its session data
12671
since the two pages are separate i can t call the modalpopupextender from the aspx.cs code i can t reach the list of checkboxes from the ascx.cs code and i don t see a way to populate my session variable and then programmatically activate some other hidden button or control which will then open my modal popup
12700
the modalpopupextender uses javascript and dhtml to show and hide the controls in the usercontrol client-side
12703
but for something more complex like server configuration an ini file would be a huge pain to maintain and something more structural like xml or yaml would be better
12715
if you want something with more flexibility in appearance the datalist and listview controls also have built-in support for editing inserting or deleting fields as well
12716
some google research indicates i could #import mscorlib.tlb or put it in path but i can t get that to compile either
12731
pick with windows nt authentication using the network login id
12732
phpthumb uses imagemagick whenever possible for speed falling back to gd if necessary and seems to cache pretty well to reduce the load on the server
12762
contains the details of how to set it up
12762
but as others have said there are now more friendly packages containing the svn stuff - visualsvn server so badly named it makes me weep and the collabnet distribution - the later is apache only and is hand rolled on the thighs of virgins which means that it always seems to appear about three weeks later than everyone else
12774
i have svn running right now through apache but i d like to try out visualsvn server mostly for the active directory integration
12789
we used asp.net webforms on the microsoft pdc site and have kept the html pretty clean - the viewstate could probably be disabled on most pages although in reality it s only a few dozen bytes
12820
linq in .net also greatly simplifies updates by keeping a datacontext of any changes you have made and only updating the fields which you change
12821
i would be creating each and every instance of an event in a table and this table would be regenerated every month so any event that was set to reoccurr forever would be regenerated one month in advance using a windows service or maybe at the sql server level
12826
if the gnu version of date works for you why don t you grab the source and compile it on aix and solaris
12854
if i recall correctly you cannot insert a null value to a field only dbnull
12893
the binary nodes add minus mul div these have two children a left and right side
12893
a node to hold a value val no children nodes just a numeric value
12896
and before i get pointed at pear pecl i need actual code
12910
for instance if you change enter and leave to mouseover and mouseout your events fire with no problem
12918
please use any map implementation instead like hashmap or treemap
12928
in pascal delphi
12937
imperative languages like java and c# solve a certain set of problems pretty well but it also helps to think in a functional manner sometimes such as with haskell and lisp
12961
it s also worth noting that starting with jdk 1.6 update 7 there is now a bundled profiler called visualvm which can be launched with jvisualvm
13002
the only other time i consume webservices outside of .net was in javascript but now i only use json responses instead of xml webservice responses
13050
for simplicity tortoise svn gives a basic revision graph
13100
using out or ref passes a reference to the variable specified in the call to the function
13100
any changes to the value of an out or ref parameter will be passed back to the caller
13100
both out and ref behave identically except for one slight difference ref parameters are required to be initialised before calling while out parameters can be uninitialised
13100
by extension ref parameters are guaranteed to be initialised at the start of the method while out parameters are treated as uninitialised
13100
edit as dp points out the difference between out and ref is only enforced by the c# compiler not by the clr
13100
as far as i know vb has no equivalent for out and implements ref as byref only matching the support of the clr
13105
the clr does not distinguish between between out and ref
13105
this means that you cannot have two methods whose signatures differ only by an out or ref
13111
if i were starting a new asp.net project right now i d stick with .net 3.5 and probably the new mvc previews
13123
i think you can do this with the row test attribute available in mbunit and later versions of nunit where you could specify several sets to populate one unit test
13130
even if you capture the keydown keyup event those are the only events that the tab key fires you still need some way to prevent the default action moving to the next item in the tab order from occurring
13140
check out or lookup the man pages on any linux box or through google e.g unix man ar
13208
you should upgrade the .net framework on the server to .net 3.5 sp1 but you re still going to be running asp.net 2.0
13210
.net 3.0 and .net 3.5 did not change the version of the clr so using asp.net 3.5 is a more complicated thing that it sounds like it should be at first
13258
the msbuild task that we run for continuous integration automatically changes the build number for us so the resulting build zip file contains a properly versioned set of dlls and exes
13271
facing the same problem i used yourkit profiler
13275
the general difference is that a reference type lives on the heap and a value type lives inline that is wherever it is your variable or field is defined
13277
testing - junit testng
13277
there are also bamboo plugins for findbugs pmd and checkstyle but as noted the free hudson ci server has those too
13352
you get easy versioning - if one client wants to stay on software version 1.0 and another wants 2.0 where 1.0 and 2.0 use different database schemas there s no problem - you can migrate one without having to pull them out of one database
13352
there is never any complexity from the but the database also contains other clients issue
13358
we made the enter key function like the tab key where the enter key would save the value in a text field and advance the cursor to the next field
13359
there is no way you should be doing this and i see this as a fault in your translation process i am an ex-localization engineer and ex-developer of localization tools
13376
all of the winforms focus events gotfocus lostfocus enter leave are called with empty eventargs parameters which will not give you any additional information
13430
a quick google did not turn up any instructions for getting it running on iis 7.0 so i was wondering if anyone had experience getting this set up
13433
remember that .net 1.1 is going out of general support in october of this year and that includes asp.net 1.1
13454
i wrote a piece of code to convert php s striplashes into valid python backslash escapes
13460
no trunk branch or any of that. if there is a recommended way to set up source control systems what are they
13488
the final character class makes sure that if an url is part of some text punctuation such as a comma or full stop after the url is not interpreted as part of the url
13495
of course wcf can do async messaging using msmq bindings but a tool like nservicebus or masstransit will give you a very simple send receive or pub sub api that will make your requirement a very straightforward job
13550
i think its good to use these kind of solutions to speed up things but i wonder why aren t these programs as popular as vs.net j2ee ruby python etc
13561
i need to display list of categories on every page and to be able to choose items from a specific category to be displayed
13562
if the path came from the stock mac os x frameworks for example an open panel whether carbon or cocoa you won t need to do any conversion on it and will be able to use it as-is
13582
one was written in cakephp and the other was written using drupal
13590
if all you need is a sortable list then a simple scriptaculous list or jquery list with a quick webmethod callback should fit the bill quite nicely and you can obviously stick this into your own user control
13594
firefox and opera ignore the o and set the max length to 2 while internet explorer ignores the field altogether
13605
for example the first thing python does when it sees source code is compile it into a bytecode representation essentially the same as what java does when compiling class files
13605
there s no reason why somebody couldn t write a just-in-time jit compiler for python along the lines of what java and .net already do to further increase the performance
13627
so from jython and jruby you can easily access java code and from ironpython and ironruby you can easily access .net code
13643
the last twenty years of evolution in interpreters can be seen as going the other way - polymorphism eg naive smalltalk metacircular interpreters to function pointers naive lisp implementations threaded code c++ to switch naive byte code interpreters and then onwards to jits and so on - which either require very big classes or in singly polymorphic languages double-dispatch which reduces the polymorphism to a type-case and you re back at stage one
13703
it specifically looks at labview versus matlab as opposed to c
13704
i m about to do a large migration of several websites from classic asp asp.net webforms to asp.net mvc and was wondering what kind of advice those of you with experience in both technologies have
13725
are nsinteger and int the same width on 32-bit 64-bit platforms
13779
you have to remove any event handlers you ve set on the node before you remove it to avoid memory leaks in ie
13848
however i would like to undelete it from svn visualsvn so that i can get the history back
13851
in opera and firefox the header and the menu are neatly attached to eachother
13851
i have tried explicitly defining padding and margin on the img however it does not work
13858
i particularly like bool bool ebool boolean bool int conversions
13860
rather than hunting down the specific behavior try sanity checking by explicity setting padding and margin properties for img div etc selectors to 0 set border-style none border-width 0px border 0 etc
13918
you can do this by adding onkeyup onkeydown etc
13944
i don t have an environment setup to test right now but i m guessing something went wrong with the configuration
13981
i understand that the ruby 1.8 ast is traversed at runtime using a big switch statement and many things like calling a method in a class or parent module involve the interpreter looking up and down the tree as it goes
14006
need to attach logic to a getter setter
14033
the problem with unit testing any kind of data-related programming is that you have to have a reliable set of test data to start with
14135
i want to want the checked in files to be uploaded into the server via ftp and as they get use to subversion via sftp
14159
when you add new nodes to the tree model set the flag itemsincom to x
14165
i m seeing strange errors when my c++ code has min or max calls
14167
i like to break each condition into descriptive variables
14169
check if your code is including the windows.h header file and either your code or other third-party headers have their own min max definitions
14177
scope it dude std min std max
14192
when serving as text html whether you use xhtml markup or html markup it s treated by browsers as html
14192
of course if you want to use xhtml 1.0 markup and conform to xhtml 1.0 then you shouldn t use
14194
i would launch with it working in firefox ie7 and safari and look at who goes to your site
14195
i haven t used it in years but from memory boost assigns min and max too possibly

i ve gathered that you can t have it both ways -- that is to say have the class functionality in a separate actionscript class file but have the contained elements declared in mxml
14261
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better
14261
this is what makes manual bindings in actionscript a little less convenient than those in mxml
14261
the currentemployee could be made into a getter setter pair and implemented like this only showing the setter
14308
for our first year we ve been using a server for sharing project files a plain windows machine with a network share
14314
to access the contents of a zip file you have to unzip it although the zipfile package makes this fairly easy as you can unzip each file within an archive individually
14346
this links your program with the glut glu and opengl libraries
14375
i m using repository pattern with linq have irepository.deleteonsubmit t entity
14379
but later implementations of glut like freeglut do
14410
pretty much every other editor that isn t a vi descendant vim cream vi-emu seems to use the emacs shortcuts ctrl + w to delete back a word and so on
14424
i ve used it a couple of times to get some decent looking class diagrams to put in presentations blogposts etc
14479
nsthread is part of the cocoa api and as such documented over at apple including the particular method + detachnewthreadselector totarget withobject i d link there but apparently stackoverflow has bugs with parsing it
14515
we use nunitlite although i think we did have had to add some code to it in order for it to work
14582
i understand that subversion has it origins in the case-sensitive world of nix but is there any way to control this behavior in either subversion or tortoisesvn to be file name case-insensitive when used with windows
14597
i edit a lot of documents in latex so i use svn to store the tex files and images and so on
14617
i m trying to retrieve a file from a server using sftp as opposed to ftps using java
14630
this is due to the fact that files from subversion can be checked out on both case-sensitive file systems nix and case-insensitive file systems windows mac
14640
to set a default value just add the item to the combobox s collection and set the selectedindex or selecteditem to that item
14640
depending on how many options you are looking at you can use a listbox with the selectionmode property set to multisimple if it will be multiple choice or you could use the checkbox control
14718
i personally use rcs for this type of thing - whilst it s got a manual aspect it s unlikely i want to push something to even the test server from my dev machine without testing it first
14796
a good start point could be this maven pluggin not for use it or maybe yes but this maven is build over ant task
14819
use the listview - it gives you the features of the gridview combined with the styling flexibility of a repeater
14873
i ve noticed that a few wordpress blogs have query statistics present in their footer that simply state the number of queries and the total time required to process them for the particular page reading something like
14874
i can draw a single view just be setting the context and explicitly calling drawrect but this does not deal with all of the subviews
14893
get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents images and reports that are associated with the project and put into directory from step 5
14909
anyone who writes client-side javascript is familiar with the dom - the tree structure that your browser references in memory generated from the html it got from the server
14909
javascript can add remove and modify nodes on the dom tree to make changes to the page
14909
my question is what server-side frameworks languages build a page by treating it as a dom tree from the beginning - inserting nodes instead of echoing strings
14910
i have a real problem with coupling my build to the ide it ends up making it a real pain to set up build servers down the road since you have to go do a full vs install on any box that you want to build from in the future
14919
i ll second eridius suggestion of git but i d expand it to the other drcs distributed revision control system such as mercurial and bazaar
14963
i have a problem with iis 6.0 ceasing to work for an asp.net application after installing service pack 1 for .net 3.5
14980
private fields with public or protected properties
15007
there are lots of widgets provided by sites that are effectively bits of javascript that generate html through dom manipulation or document.write
15011
first get your code compiling with one step using an automated build program nant msbuild
15026
visualsvn is excellent for svn integration
15028
2 ant maven
15028
4 bugzilla trac
15035
build automation nant msbuild rake maven
15035
issue tracking trac bugzilla gemini if it must be .net and free-ish
15048
let users add functionality to your .net applications with macros and plug-ins
15050
msbuild beats nant for .net 2 or 3.5
15072
it s got trac redmine and subversion as well as several other unrelated ones
15091
technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities
15091
technically ruby on rails can scale just as well as java .net or php etc
15093
if you have a sql statement like the one above that may change data in more than one row you might want to include a cursor to update all records affected by the trigger
15095
i d say check the vba in the macros to see how it is doing it
15132
if you re doing web development asp.net mvc and silverlight n e wpf e come to mind as relatively recent trends
15161
check out these articles on continuous integration using msbuild cruisecontrol.net fxcop nunit ncover and subversion.
15177
if you re talking about scripts created by a user that will be run from that users crontab i typically put those in either a bin or scripts folder in the home directory or if they re intended to be shared between users a usr local scripts directory
15187
this could either take the form of bindings to the emacs extension api in some other language making ocaml a first-class emacs extension language or an emacs interaction mode where for example the extension has a pipe into which it can write emacs lisp expressions and read out result values
15217
if you were to build a new editor that fits this paradigm how would you improve on vi vim emacs
15217
getting it right is hard enough competing agains the likes of vi vim emacs would be extremely tough -- most people who use these editors are die hard fans and you d have to give them a compelling reason to move to another editor
15234
performance even though great progress has been made with firefox and safari
15261
on debian and ubuntu the defaults are 28800 mysql kills connections after 8 hours but maybe the default for your platform is different or whoever administrates the server has configured things differently
15270
point to note visualsvn the one that integrates with vstudio is not a server technology at all it is simply a integrated gui front end to svn and in fact works through tortoisesvn which is required to be installed
15277
you can then put the re-usable sql code inside one of these or if you want to get really high tech you can use a library which does it for you
15296
they are working on a ruby implementation as well but the python version is way ahead and is actually ready for primetime
15310
the odd thing is that this report will run render export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager
15316
basically you ll do a tree search to find the spot x minutes ago then count the number of children on the nodes with newer times
15316
if you keep the number of children under the nodes up to date this sum can be done quickly
15323
i feel there are other technologies better suited to building applications in that environment
15362
any of bugzilla trac or fogbugz will help you with your bug tracking and each offer an export feature so you can always change your mind later on
15401
the last 4 chapters also gives a dedicated chapter to each of php .net perl and java
15427
maven is a joy to use when it s working but as an old ant hacker i find maven to be hard to follow once things go wrong
15448
i use eclipse for java visual studio for c++ c# and vb.net jellyfish pro for powerbasic i still use visual studio 6 for classic vb and i use textpad for perl python powershell vbscript sql html and batch files
15514
so for example if the user starts to enter asdf into the date the field turns yellow and a popup error message appears saying the value entered is not valid
15583
all of my visio experience is with lan wan documentation
15633
when you want to mark a particular revision a release version then simply svn copy the project into the tags directory
15635
our company has about 20 developers all running windows xp vista and developing primarily for linux solaris
15660
if you re interested in the design of word processors i found an article that doesn t address patterns but does look at some of the data structures underlying word processor design and design considerations
15672
public protected private and static properties of classes all work roughly as expected
15674
when using subversion svn for source control with multiple projects i ve noticed that the revision number increases across all of my projects directories
15683
this is my install scrpt i use it on debian servers but it will work in ubuntu ubuntu is built on debian
15712
there were some excellent suggestions already but i just wanted to mention that perl can also be called can call to c c++
15732
i m generating some xml files that needs to conform to an xsd file that was given to me
15737
you can write cocoa apps with python or ruby right in the ide
15741
but then again validating xml against xsd files is a rather heavy weight problem
15746
rv 1.9.0.1 gecko 2008070208 firefox 3.0.1 .net clr 3.5.30729
15808
all sorts of background agents - skype messenger winamp etc
15821
just use it to stop code but right click on the red circle and there are a lot more options such as break on condition run code on break
15838
the practice of programming be improved using any of c s native utilities if i set the i variable to be a register variable
15897
those from liquidicity are specially useful for wpf or silverlight you can make an interface that even zoomed looks great
15902
i like the free silk icons at famfamfam but they re png s and when i convert them to ico format they look pretty crappy
15928
either a library like jquery that has been mentioned or by modifying the suckerfish code to use onclick instead of onmouseover out
15947
there s a swiss company called railo who are currently in the process of releasing an open source coldfusion engine that is affiliated with jboss
16105
i would recommend you migrate from cvs to a proper distributed version control system such as git which will provide this sort of functionality very naturally
16110
i have a user that want to be able to select a textbox and have the current text selected so that he doesn t have to highlight it all in order to change the contents
16186
one of the fastest ways is to use python with a gui binding like pyqt pyfltk tkinter wxpython or even via pygame which uses sdl
16245
all shippers ups fedex etc now implement ishipper which extends ivendor and extend the abstract class shipper which has all common non-abstract methods for shippers defined in it getname getzip etc
16255
safari and to a lesser extent firefox 3 have support for font-face in css which lets you use custom fonts
16276
then set svn keywords id revision property on the file
16381
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique
16408
the md5 hash you re using has 128 bits with billions and billions of possible hashes
16409
what i think you want to do is make an abstract class that implements vendor and one that implements shipper
16449
string.format uses a stringbuilder under the covers i believe so multiple concatenations are avoided
16480
if it contains numbers or any other non-string things dates i d use string.format because it gives me more control over the formatting
16483
but when i request the same resource from the same server using https instead simply changing the http in the url to then firefox does not send an if-modified-since header at all
16483
here are some example http and https request response pairs pulled using the live http headers firefox extension with some differences in bold
16483
user-agent mozilla 5.0 ... gecko 2008070206 firefox 3.0.1
16483
user-agent mozilla 5.0 ... gecko 2008070206 firefox 3.0.1
16515
by breaking down each part into subvis we are able to reconfigure the tests with the click and drag of the mouse
16528
and it supports lots of interesting and useful languages jython jruby scala groovy
16534
update firefox behavior was changed for gecko 2.0 firefox 4 -- https content is now cached
16550
nant or msbuild which one to choose and when
16550
i currently use nant but only because i have experience with ant
16551
this would probably be the best solution if didn t want to deal with json xml at all
16558
generally speaking i get the impression that nant offers more flexibility compared to msbuild whereas with my relatively simple needs i ve been fine with the latter so far
16563
so i m using php and looping through this block of text line by line and on lines like this
16564
we actually use a combination of nant and msbuild with cruisecontrol
16564
nant is used for script flow control and calls msbuild to compile projects
16573
overriding the equals method is necessary if you want to test equivalence in standard library classes for example ensuring a java.util.set contains unique elements or using objects as keys in java.util.map objects
16581
i have used both msbuild and nant and i much prefer msbuild mainly because it requires a lot less configuration by default
16601
you should never override equals gethashcode for mutable objects - this goes for .net and java both
16611
i thought it would be a good idea to provide some form of schema document for the xml that i generate so i pasted the xml into visual studio and got it to generate an xsd
16611
the annoying thing is that my xml doesn t validate to the xsd that was generated
16630
select the radio button a redirection to a url enter the url for the new site and check the checkboxes for the exact url entered above a permanent redirection for this resource this second checkbox causes a 301 redirect instead of a 302 redirect
16674
the problems come if you want to use some other web language framework like ror or python django pylons
16727
i thied it but i think i cannot access such parameter easely in a rewrite rule
16733
it works better than the eclipse tptp plugin last checked 3 months ago and for us it removes any need for a commercial profiler such as jprofiler which is excellent but fast becoming unnecessary
16737
if you are referring to the folder the ide has as the current folder then you can just change the shortcut that launches delphi to set the current directory where ever you want it to be
16746
thus when debugging you can get the debugging feed when you want to see completed transactions you go to the transactions feeds etc
16757
won t work if you have the form on the content page itself like you do now but you could show hide the link to the special submission page based on noscript
16777
basically postgresql and mysql supports the non-standard
16836
svn with smartsvn or tortoisesvn
16843
i use visualsvn server free and tortoise svn free for school work hobbies everything
16850
i like mercurial other folks swear by git and bazaar
16853
try the sharpziplib a c# based library for compressing and uncompressing files using gzip zip
16856
as for downloading it you can use the standard webrequest or webclient classes in .net
16876
on one project we simply rolled the svn revision number into the product version number for all our releases and we never even tagged
16897
additionaly the midl tool provided by microsoft didn t parse correctly the idl files that we exported from delphi
16948
if you want to be able to pull a specific revision out from the past usually an older tag i like being able to have everything i need come from the svn checkout
16963
to me controls such as datagrid gridview formview etc
16971
how do i reset an increment identity s starting value in sql server
16991
it should also be available on linux and optionally solaris
17024
you don t want to use a webforms button in asp.net mvc
17042
jeff wrote a post on this saying he favors var
17043
sometimes it is way easier to use var instead of typing out some hugely long class name or if you re unsure of the return type of a given function
17056
currently the query is using containstable but i have switched that with freetexttable contains and freetext without any noticeable differences in the results
17120
before leveraging cruisecontrol to it s fullest extent you need to create an automated build script that can be run by msbuild or nant
17210
as it is silverlight only plays wmv and mp3 neither of which is simple legal
17233
yeah it s bloatware but you get a lot of functionality that wouldn t be much fun to re-invent sorting paging grouping column reordering inline editing templating server-side and client-side
17249
kdevelop is a kde project but run on gnome
17249
anjuta is an equivalent project on gnome but i find it unusable for real work
17260
good code is good and bad code is bad - whether it is written as a bash script a windows cmd file in python ruby perl basic forth ada pascal common lisp cobol or compiled c
17269
to click on the link i have to move the mouse to the right till the cursor turns into a hand
17276
also once you want to get more advanced most cheap hosting services have tools that can be installed with one click and provide things like blogs photo galleries bulletin boards phpbb and even content management tools like joomla
17292
most php and ruby cms s are free and web hosting is free extremely cheap if you re not demanding
17295
so when writing a function or method that takes a collection write it not to take a list but an ilist t an icollection t or ienumerable t
17313
there s a really good msdn article on this topic an it outlines some cases where you can t use var
17313
i would recommend checking it out to understand the full implications of using var in your code
17316
then there are the targets which most people familiar with make nant or msbuild should be able to follow
17331
it looks to me like mk and daniel fone interpreted it as wanting to see manipulate the stdout of the command neither of their solutions capture stderr fwiw
17342
if you re familiar with html javascript basics i d look into a cms - wordpress drupal joomla nuke etc
17350
mainly i like the form view and listview the gridview still needs some work
17354
for the web apps it s the good ole gridview with custom sorting for the winform apps we use janus grid
17374
for example the default paging in a gridview doesn t support paging in the database itself you have to load all the rows before it will page them so once you start feeling that pinch in performance you may need to think about rolling your own or perhaps better find a more capable grid control
17377
.net rocks for when you want to hear the billionth interview about databinding controls in the trenches during the transition from vb6 to vb.net
17396
instead of running visual c and visual basic side-by-side run vb6 under vc
17451
you control the access rights for members and functions using private protected public right
17475
we used gdb extensively with the occasional use of valgrind and gprof
17475
i went from perl to python to the current ruby
17603
for current text size font display size window size margins etc determine how many characters can fit on a line if fixed-type or how many pixels can fit on a line if not fixed-type
17603
go through line character by character calculating how many characters or pixels have been recorded since the beginning of the line
17603
when you go over the max chars pixels for the line move back to the last space punctuation mark move all text to next line
17645
you ll need to use chown chmod to make sure the correct users have access to them
17645
note that these may be on your linux unix system as fromdos or tofrodos or perhaps even as the general purpose toolbox recode
17675
note that these may be on your linux unix system as fromdos or tofrodos or perhaps even as the general purpose toolbox recode

you ll need to use chown chmod to make sure the correct users have access to them
17703
javascript has survived and become popular purely because developers have very little choice in the matter - it s the only language that can interact with a dom
17709
if you re truly interested in programming stuff for unix download one of the many linux distributions ie
17717
we are currently using mysql for a product we are building and are keen to move to postgresql as soon as possible primarily for licensing reasons
17735
when i first started using revision control systems like cvs and svn i didn t really understand the concepts of the trunk branching merging and tagging
17757
charles can act as a man-in-the-middle for http ssl communication enabling you to debug the content of your https sessions
17796
the putty telnet ssh client download putty.exe for free from
17865
my challenge is that the queue is not a fifo meaning that new items are prioritized and can be inserted somewhere in the middle of the queue
17906
is it possible in wpf to set up a style trigger to enable or disable the move buttons depending on anything being selected in either listbox
17906
selecteditems is on the left side so the button will move the selected availableitems to that list
17906
however if no items are selected i want this button to be disabled - and the other way around for the other list button
17951
from the looks of the stack trace are you using unsafe code pointers and the like
17978
happens a lot with directx gdi and others
17986
assembla runs over https but shows the svn url as http you must be sure to change the http to https yourself in the urls or you get a 401 not implemented error from tortoisesvn and ankhsvn
18056
a nant build script will do it but i think the most commonly accepted method now is to use msbuild
18086
now this class is a monster as in frankenstein it has 167 field members all of them of type string 167 getter setter pairs 1 for each field a constructor that receives all 167 fields as parameters an equals method that compares all 167 fields in a strange way
18132
finally what are thoughts on using nhibernate which has been around for a long time and may be more mature than the ado.net entity framework
18148
a single zero or one or more digits not starting with 0 or nothing so long as a period follows
18215
not an answer but i find the whole fopen fread fclose thing very dull to peruse when looking at code
18216
since cards do not have the same properties and often multiple values for the same property i decided to use the union table approach to store data instead of having a really big column structure in my card table
18226
i needed to add to the string and break it up on spaces in order to work
18241
take a look at putty psftp and pscp or winscp for windows or rsync and openssh for unixes
18249
this one takes most of what has already been mentioned into consideration but includes hex and octal numbers negative scientific infinity and has removed decimal scientific 4e3.2 is not valid
18267
neall i d add a set -e on the second line because you don t want the live site being replaced if the rsync fails for any reason
18267
set -e causes the script to exit if any of its commands fail
18295
jsp for java rails for ruby django for python etc
18307
the ones i have most experience with and therefore will be talking about here are php eruby and ruby on rails
18307
using php and eruby you have to do most things yourself - whereas ruby on rails will do lots of stuff for you useful but can also be dangerous if you don t know what you re doing
18307
php is more well known and used than eruby but i like the ruby language so i tend to like using eruby
18307
php or ruby and some don t
18359
i can t imagine that people switch back to 16-bit mode from 32-bit mode very often anymore
18364
in bits 32 mode the reverse is true 32-bit instructions require no prefixes whereas instructions using 16-bit data need an 0x66 and those working on 16-bit addresses need an 0x67.
18370
plus if you use their client tunnelier you get some bonus features like mapping shares port forwarding setup up server side etc. if you don t use their client it will still work with the open source ssh clients
18397
look at the intel ia-32 software developer s guide volume 3 chapter 16 mixing 16-bit and 32-bit code
18406
if you are on systems with the bsd backtrace functionality available linux osx 1.5 bsd of course you can do this programmatically in your signal handler
18413
i ve tried a bunch of variations on substring charindex convert and replace but i still can t seem to get something that works in all combinations
18448
it seems wcf could ve been an option but i prefer not to upgrade from .net 2.0
18492
for security we use a saml token based system built on the cryptography classes in system.security
18505
what i would like to do instead is send simulate a mouse click the window s button on the taskbar which i am hoping will bring the window to the front
18521
global mouse and keyboard library
18655
one thing i have to put up here at the top in response to several similar answers orthogonality and separation of concerns often get cited as reasons to go entity orm
18672
if you do use windows you can get a whole slew of unix command line tools from here - unzip them and put them somewhere in your path
18675
the program writes to settings files to its directory in the program files dir
18772
windows authentication is not enabled so i cannot login
18807
if the argument column contains the ordered clause the query processor has requested that the rows output be returned in the order in which the clustered index has sorted them
18837
another possibility is that usr or one of its subdirectories is a symlink
18856
after logo move to python or ruby
18856
you can move to c# or java after that though they don t offer much that python doesn t already have
18856
this is where you teach the really advanced algorithms like mergesort and quicksort
18877
all the results msbuild ncover nunit fxcop etc are in xml so you can build relativity simple report pages out of xslt
18879
my read of the question was that the server is set up to use sql authentication only and perhaps you don t know the sa password or any other sql login credentials
18908
then again i m in the client app space wpf and silverlight
18925
it s set up so it only works on localhost and i couldn t find any workarounds to make it work
18943
i realise that with apt.conf that you could set chmod 600 which it isn t by default on ubuntu debian
18949
assuming no nulls you group by the unique columns and select the min or max rowid as the row to keep
18965
unroll any cursor loops and convert into set based update insert statements
19069
which makes sure the javascript is loaded and the dom is ready before doing your stuff
19079
terrapin there are a few other differences between isnull and coalesce that are worth mentioning besides ansi compliance which is a big one for me
19122
of course you re using a pipe and of course you re using stdin and stdout of the respective parts of the command
19127
i have a page using lists for navigation javascript changes the styling to display or not on mouseover
19138
function call expressions can also be considered statements of course but unless the execution environment has a special built-in variable to hold the returned value there is no way to retrieve it
19185
there is some documentation on the internet that shows that windows changes the behavior of the notifyicon.balloontipshown command if the user is currently idle and this is detected by checking for keyboard and mouse events
19187
if there are new messages for user hold on to them until you detect any move with the mouse
19187
see detecting idle time with mouse and keyboard hooks
19210
there were 30 c++ projects which needed compiling and various .net java things and the odd perl script
19224
the only reason it wasn t called a line was because sometimes it spanned multiple lines
19224
this blurring of expressions and statements occurs in all the c-derivatives c c++ c# and java which still have some statements like while but which allow almost any expression to be used as a statement in c# only assignment call increment and decrement expressions may be used as statements
19224
haskell icon lisp and ml are all languages that don t have syntactic statements mdash
19229
plus is jsonp really considered ajax since it doesn t actually use the xmlhttprequest object
19236
i wanted to limit access to this internal application by setting up forms authentication on it and having a login form in the root application
19236
however the forms authentication does not appear to be working it does not redirect back to the login page when i access that application directly
19307
i would like to recommend this jquery plugin though jqmodal
19308
i ve done this in oracle and mysql before
19326
i set the value to an instance field
19329
i tested it in firefox 3 true and false in safari ie7 and opera
19366
moving changes between stream is really easy just select the change send it to the change palette and select the destination stream
19370
you are on vista iis got better 7 cassini stayed crappy
19383
when the buffer is empty at some point tail will have to wait for cat to output more data
19383
the operating system will signal tail when their is no more incoming data with an eof
19383
on a system with multiple processors the two programs will not just be sharing alternating time slices on the same processor core but likely running at the same time on separate cores
19387
my specific background is in smalltalk java but i currently work mostly in dhtml .net asp.net c#
19395
aside from interface builder which is included as part of the xcode tools you can also use qt gtk+ awt swing for your java background tk squeak for your smalltalk background shoes very cool little ruby gui toolkit fxruby more ruby wxwidgets xulrunner and others i m sure i ve forgotten
19398
you can put in a conditional statement or several and when conditions are met properly you can use a goto statement to get out of all the loops instead of having a break statement at each level of nesting with a conditional statement for each
19419
it goes through methods for doing this in mysql postgresql microsoft sql server ibm db2 and oracle the following is copied from that link
19433
re-encoding audio file from flac - mp3 or vice versa
19437
i m using a custom font for report headers and when deployed to the server it does not render correctly when i print or export to pdf tiff
19466
how can i check file permissions without having to run operating system specific command via passthru or exec
19467
just about every language has bindings to c so you ll probably want to get the applicable c libraries for encoding decoding mp3 s and flac files
19555
i m currently a fan of postgresql which is also freely available and i think if you read the licensing of mysql actually turns out to have a more amenable license for commercial use
19589
using c# .net 3.5 and wcf i m trying to write out some of the wcf configuration in a client application the name of the server the client is connecting to
19590
if you really want to require the user to retrieve the result of myfunction you might want to void it instead and use an out or ref variable
19654
but currently one of the developers has seen the light of django the company has only developed in php to date while the other developer is concerned that introducing a new language python is a bad idea right now
19660
visualvm should be the profiler from netbeans as standalone
19700
how will this move fragment the maintenance between php and python code
19715
also none of my co-workers were really perl or php gurus
19715
so if you re talking about new projects with people who currently use php but aren t super-experts and don t love that language then i think switching to python is a no-brainer
19760
any chance you can set up your server as a vpn endpoint
19767
as mentioned both jprofiler and yourkit are both fairly good and not prohibitively expensive
19793
the best thing to do is create public print ostream and read istream functions
19796
i d probably be looking to use a jtable rather than a jlist and since the default rendering of a checkbox is rather ugly i d probably be looking to drop in a custom tablemodel cellrenderer and celleditor to represent a boolean value
19804
for example show it ticked when the row is selected parameter isselected but this way the check status will no be mantained if the selection changes
19909
i usually encode the binary data with mime base64 or url encoding
19943
it s far easier to find php programmers than python programmers
19963
ladoucep i don t seem to be able to export the report without data
20021
i m currently looking at the python framework django for future db-based web apps as well as for a port of some apps currently written in php
20049
if you are querying a sql server database version 7 and up you should replace the oledb classes with corresponding classes in the system.data.sqlclient namespace sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader as those classes have been optimized to work with sql server
20058
higher-reaching concepts would probably include wpf maybe silverlight as well linq or your orm of choice as well as the vista bridge and related bridging code if your project includes desktop apps at all
20068
i ve also heard good things about scripting languages ruby and python especially for getting kids to learn how to program
20083
what i think the future is for teaching children to program is some sort of dsl built on top of a language with friendly syntax these would include arguably ruby python and scheme whose purpose is to provide an intuitive environment for constructing simple games say tic-tac toe or hangman
20097
what i normally do is make sure all the xml serialization attributes are on the concrete class and just have the properties on that class call through to the base classes where required to retrieve information that will be de serialized when the serializer calls on those properties
20114
click the validation button and uncheck the checkbox for checking validity
20133
i had one bit flipped wrong so instead of going to 16-bit mode i was going to 32-bit mode with segments that happened to have a limit of one meg
20148
i ve read a bunch of stuff on the web about the differences between myisam and innodb and myisam seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database tables that i ll be using for this task
20165
take the big jump to lisp haskell or similarly abstracted languages or should there be some simple object oriented languages maybe even c++ be thrown in or would that more hurt than help
20170
one of the things that got me started with programming as a kid in bbc basic and then qbasic was the ease of writing graphical programs
20170
i could write a couple of lines of code and see my program draw a line on the screen straight away
20170
the closest i ve seen to that sort of simplicity recently are the pygame library for python and processing a set of java libraries with an ide
20192
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier
20195
boolean fields are compared using is and is not operators however mysql-compatible int 1 with and is still possible
20227
does anyone have a simple code snippet that can just encode and then decode the string back to the original string
20262
this product has been around for 5 years or so and uses asp.net webforms
20304
vbscript isn t visual basic
20354
php s system logger using the operating system s system logging mechanism or a file depending on what the error_log configuration directive is set to
20368
this early execution environment is highly implementation defined meaning the implementation of your particular bios
20408
svnadmin dump c svnrepositorio repositorio backups bktmpsubversion subversiontemp.dump
20426
for interior nodes items.tot needs to be the sum of it s children
20426
it can be assumed that leaf nodes will stay as leaf nodes interior nodes will stay as interior nodes and the whole thing will remain as a proper tree
20426
set a trigger on the items table to update the parent of any row that is updated
20426
set a trigger to schedule an update of the parent of any row that is updated
20444
svnadmin dump c svnrepositorio repositorio backups bktmpsubversion subversiontemp.dump
20482
in most cases you will use reflection at runtime to alter behavior based on the presence of an attribute or its properties
20483
are you applying the interface to an abstract class or the class that extends it
20501
maybe theres some milage in parsing text lines against the bnf for say sql92 and scoring each line on how closely the fragments match the grammar
20508
the editor mentioned above also looks for custom attributes on properties that describe the property and how to edit it
20513
because you want to query a set of keywords against the card description and find any hits
20533
aquamacs and closer to the original emacs
20568
aquamacs - emacs for os x emacs in a shell window is also an option
20607
strtotime and getdate are two functions that can be used to get dates from strings and timestamps
20612
to enable it you simple need to change the script reference from http to https and append s 1 to the url
20641
a cryptographic hash such as sh1 or md5 allows you to verify that file you have has been downloaded correctly and has not been tampered with
20646
xml schema defines base 64 binary as a primitive datatype which you can use in your xsd
20654
with a has md5 sha-1 one input matches only with one output and then if you down load the file and calculate the hash again should obtain the same output
20665
so for example visual studio can query the attributes on a 3rd party control to figure out which properties of the control should appear in the properties pane at design time
20688
i don t remember the right name we were able to use this as a debugging tool selecting only functions that we wanted to trace at a given time
20752
of course shells do more than that like piping input and output but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork execve and waitpid
20771
in particular only assignment call increment and decrement expressions may be used as statements
20795
if you ever plan on making a serious effort at learning emacs immediately forget about aquamacs
20795
that might sound well and all but once you realize that it completely breaks nearly every standard keybinding and behavior of emacs you begin to wonder why you aren t just using textedit or textmate
20795
alternatively if you want to use vim on os x i ve heard good things about macvim
20811
what is the best way to automate copying the needed tables from oracle to mysql
20828
i ve used nant to run the overall build strategy but pass parameters into msbuild to compile and create the deployment package
20828
basically nant calls into msbuild for each environment you need to deploy to and generates a separate deployment output for each
20845
i believe perl s stat and readlink and python s os.stat and os.readlink are both wrappers for the system calls so this should translate reasonable well as proof of concept code
20859
you may try using realpath to get what the symlink points to then trying to determine if it s a valid file using is file
20861
i would like to do some integration testing of a web service from within nunit or mbunit
20873
having a tags table and a map table makes it pretty trivial to generate tag clouds such since you can easily put together sql to get a list of tags with counts of how often each tag is used
20966
on the other hand most people would love to get 5-10 pages of simple class diagrams with some basic descriptions of how the system is put together
21030
all cocoa development is best done with objective-c or one of the many automatically generated bridges to dynamic languages such as python or ruby
21137
i would have thought that templates be readily available for nunit xunit mbunit et
21143
mbunit and later versions of nunit also contain project templates for unit tests
21149
the ironruby guys have got some internal builds of mvc to work with ironruby and ironpython 2 and ironruby have a lot of code in common with the dlr
21149
i m not sure if they ll support ironpython ironruby when mvc is released but it s definitely worth keeping your eye on anyway - the old asp.net forms-based development model is old busted and the sooner it goes away the better
21221
there are also a lot of little libraries that you might not get in other languages and would have to write yourself how a c++ developer writes python
21285
well it depends what platform you are on if you are looking for server-side functionality as well but the defacto badass wysiwyg in my opinion is fckeditor
21302
two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order
21372
if you re licensing a technology i say gpl
21377
i think it might be for asp.net only so it might not work for you but if you are using .net it s great
21413
this solution does not need any csv or xml libraries and i know it does not handle any illegal characters and encoding issues but you might be interested in it as well provided your csv input does not break the above mentioned rules
21442
you could use some javascript to catch the right mouse button click but that s really about it
21584
if you are running on the desktop then using the active user s security credentials should not be a problem
21621
pack and unpack
21636
you need some form of identifier to see the structure of the tree and grab all of a nodes children and a list of the parents path to a leaf to update
21644
you can avoid stating the same file repeatedly by caching the results via memcached apc or some other in-memory caching system
21668
in much the way that aquamacs makes an os x-friendly version of emacs the emacsw32 project makes emacs out-of-the-box work just like a windows text editor
21825
i would suggest if you are going for a php and mysql install to instead use wamp
21983
i don t think there s a technical limitation as such on shipping system.web as part of your app though it s slightly odd that they ve put that notice in on the .net 3.5 page
22002
json works best for me i like to keep oo in js and don t know how to parse xml well
22005
you could write a proxy to provide the information in json or html too but having xml as the main source is definitly worth the time and effort while building the app
22015
anyway have anyone tried to implement his own openid solution within the context of an intranet where there are many different applications wordpress elgg media wiki ..
22133
these nodes are organised into a tree
22135
i am using coldfusion but a solution to this problem can be in any language java python php etc
22140
we tell our clients to install the binaries on their unix servers under the same directory structure that we compiled it under
22140
is there a way of compiling apache http server so its installation location s can be specified dynamically using environment variables
22185
if that is cleared then your web application users will see a pop-up ntlm dialog
22191
if you are trying to do the intranet no zero login thing with iis integrated authentication
22210
i think the way to do get around this problem is to develop a . configure make script that your client uses to install specify and compile the binaries
22212
i just want to have an aggregated field and fire an event everything it s value change
22219
however one big difference between the java and python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case no circular references objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date
22219
of course if i run jython or ironpython or possibly pypy then the garbage collector won t necessarily run until much later
22226
but i would not call scala intentionally similar to erlang
22257
check out the dbdeploy there are java and .net tools already available you could follow their standards for the sql file layouts and schema version table and write your python version
22259
i want to allow users to upload avatar-type images in a variety of formats gif jpeg and png at least but to save them all as png database blobs
22271
it uses imagecreatefrom jpeg gif png and resize and converts the image and then outputs to the browser
22318
i m developing a website which will be used in the corporate intranet which uses jcifs and ntlm to automatically authenticate the users without asking them to log on
22318
we ve had some success by getting the users to change their logon option to automatic logon using current username and password tools internet options securty tab select local intranet custom level all the way at the bottom user authentication logon but we are still having a few users who are getting username password prompts
22429
is it possible to embed an inline search box into a web page which provides similar functionality to the ie7pro inline search or similar plugins for firefox safari
22459
as you can see i m not trying to use memset with a size larger that what s originally allocated with malloc
22509
i have an asp.net webforms application 3.5 sp1 that i m working on and attempting to enable gzip fpr html and css that comes down the pipe
22556
is amazon web services a realistic platform for enterprise development
22559
i would get a framework like prototype or extjs that has alot of data loading functions built in for xml and json plus you ll get more predictable results as the frameworks have event handlers to make sure your xmlhttprequest succeeded or failed
22596
the best solution for this is usually to provide the shared area on some form of san which will be accessible from all servers and contain failover
22641
a shared san with failover is a great solution with a great high cost
22658
one of the things about subversion that irks me is that it puts its own folder in each directory of a project whereas git only puts one in the root directory
22660
in the general tab ensure the topmost checkbox is selected then click ok
22660
now any .net assemblies that are loaded from a location beneath the url you specified will have the internet permission set applied to them
22784
for .net i m successfully using an old build of nprof currently abandoned but it still works for me for profiling my asp.net applications
22785
you can read the excel files using ado ado.net with the right connection string
22816
i know the following libraries for drawing charts in an swt eclipse rcp application
22829
allowing multi-tag search such that the user can put subversion svn or subversion svn well from programmers to programmers in the search box and get both
22873
lisp scheme
22880
is the best answer to use ssl https encryption for the entire web site and you have the best guarantee that no man in the middle attacks will be able to sniff an existing client session cookie
22892
switching between myisam and innodb is trivial so load some test data and fire jmeter against your site and see what happens
22912
we ve had pretty good luck by writing our own malloc and free functions
22912
in production they just call the standard malloc and free but in debug they can do whatever you want
22912
if you have a ton of code it may be a big job to replace calls to malloc and free to the new malloc and free don t forget realloc
22912
memset the memory with a marker on allocation to find usage of uninitialized memory and on free to find usage of free d memory
22912
another good idea is to never use things like strcpy strcat or sprintf -- always use strncpy strncat and snprintf
22931
if you want to learn lisp scheme read sicp
22966
you will need to learn the asp.net http pipeline and how to implement the ihttpmodule and the ihttphandler interfaces to create your own httpmodule or httphandler class to handle your routing
23048
when i tried learning about jmock and easymock i found the learning curve to be a bit steep though maybe that s just me
23080
if the original file is modified outside an xml application or if no xsd schema is applied there could be the case where you have an uneven number of students and classes
23091
on data form he would display a form in cells and on each data entry cell he would comment on what valid values are what validation should it perform etc
23096
what do you do if you are given a pile of crap and seem like you are stuck in a perpetual state of cleanup that you know with the addition of any new feature or code can break the current set because the current software is like a house of cards
23109
c# - performance wise its far better than either of the big three p s in lamp perl php and python
23120
imho there are very few licenses that are worth knowing and using among them gpl which i personally don t like lgpl bsd and ms-pl and of course the creative commons licenses but these aren t suitable for software
23177
it supports html css javascript php xml ruby ruby on rails and more..
23185
it includes examples in lisp haskell and other languages
23193
i posted a bunch of links to haskell and ocaml references that are books with examples et cetera that seem right up your alley
23203
i really like thompson s haskell the craft of functional programming because it s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme
23206
owasp keeps a list of the top 10 web attacks to watch our for in addition to a ton of other useful security information for web development
23216
i can never remember the differences in regular expression syntax used by tools like grep and awk or languages like python and php
23219
sounds like maybe if it s a keyboard or mouse windows grabs it exclusively
23220
for each of those urls try running a get post put or delete http methods with different parameters so that you can ensure that you re only giving access to what you want to give access to
23229
mastering regular expressions devotes the last four chapters to java php perl and .net
23232
for my own future reference i ll offer the regexp syntax summary page which contrasts the syntax for grep egrep emacs perl python and tcl
23232
as expected perl supports the greatest variety of operators but python looks equally capable if not more so
23241
i think that what makes pointers tricky to learn is that until pointers you re comfortable with the idea that at this memory location is a set of bits that represent an int a double a character whatever
23269
but while practical common lisp is pretty example-heavy it doesn t really have challenges to work through although the examples are mostly designed to let you continue to work and build on them
23273
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular
23287
edit i ve now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 prime factors in play since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primes therefore a recursive algorithm is needed
23322
i think that using cvs with tortoisecvs and eclipse s would be nice as well though i prefer the way svn handles revisioning
23335
okay most early languages are procedural not only asm like c pascal and fortran i heard
23335
in functional school we would have nearly functional some considered them to be impure lisp family and ml family and many purely functional haskell erlang etc
23335
by the way there are many general languages such as perl python ruby
23376
we tried zip in the past but once the database files crossed the 4gb boundary we had to use rar zip is 32-bit only
23385
in lazy evaluation you would say add 2 + 2 but if the result is never used it never does the addition
23445
each set contains less than 100 items most likely max out at 20
23457
try prolog or lisp and see what you can do with those
23481
the zip file produced can not be updated via winzip or win-rar -- each indicates the archive is corrupt
23489
i don t think it is enough like capistrano for ruby or fabric for python
23511
i understand that it uses a function referred to as md5crypt but i can t seem to find a description of the algorithm beyond that at some point it uses md5 to create a hash
23605
hype be damned i ve yet to be as productive writing a web app than i am with ruby on rails though pylons in python land is nice
23613
it has multiple line select lines that are not continuous and a birds eye view navigation
23634
for example perhaps the developer has a lot of nested for loops that could be replaced with some simple list comprehensions or higher order functions
23658
a fast loading text editor for when your ide is too much vim notepad++
23658
requisite tools for working with text gnu textutils via cygwin or gnuwin32.sf.net
23658
scripting tools perl python zsh all those gnu base packages in cygwin
23669
crystal microsoft reporting services will give you out of the box handling of things like report scheduling export to excel and pdf and separation between application and report design
23676
ignoring ruby python and all the other stuff for a moment
23703
for example for all the people who dislike the stop-the-world approach of the default sun java vm gc behaviour there are vm such as ibm s websphere real time which allows real-time application to run on java
23777
in the past i have used triggers to construct db update insert delete logging
23785
the proxy could be implemented to generate a new cert for each new ssl host it is asked to deal with and sign it with a common root cert
23809
i think you should just use ssl and rely on an http client library that does caching ex wininet on windows
23811
update the svn external to refer to a specific revision of the library
23816
svn export latest revision of the remote path
23816
attach metadata in the form of svn properties about the remote path and revision
23933
i found that due to reflection the specific type stored in obj1 is resolved at runtime and the type specific datatemplate is applied as expected
23939
for python stuff a good text editor textmate on os x g vim on linux programmers notepad on windows vcs i m mainly using git currently
24035
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46
24046
in ie and firefox you see the alert box again in safari you do not
24053
i think it is because firefox and ie when going back are retrieving the page from the server again and safari is not
24061
a key idea here is that the function object returned from foo retains a hook to the local var x even though x has gone out of scope and should be defunct
24061
this hook is to the var itself not just the value that var had at the time so when bar is called it prints 5 not 3
24065
people seem to get the concept better you put it in those terms
24073
i have used asp.net mvc for a few projects recently and its like a breath of fresh air compared to webforms
24119
once that s done the shell is your command interface to interact with the various tools debuggers gdb profilers gprof valgrind etc
24119
you set up your project build environment using make cmake snakemake or any of the various alternatives
24142
likewise if you re going to display any user-inputted information onto a webpage make sure you ve stripped any script tags or anything else that might result in javascript execution such as onload onmouseover etc
24148
your application isn t going to take any real-world performance hit either way but using a class lets you use getter and setter methods and is generally going to be better for code encapsulation and code reuse
24148
and when later on you need to add other methods to manipulate these you won t have an architecture to extend
24150
most min max macros will include the parameters multiple times and may not do what you expect
24156
you should however know all the important parameters for g++ and ld the gcc linker tool that s invoked automatically except when explicitly prevented
24174
i hear anjuta is pretty slick for gnome users
24226
your super powerful box with 32 processors uses a single thread to execute the query because it doesn t know how to do anything else so you waste processor time on the database server which generally there is only one of as opposed to multiple application servers so back to reason 1 you run into resource contentions with other things needing to run on the database server
24270
few people use oop in any rigorous sense few people adhere to or understand principles such as lsp
24299
you can also access the .net framework through ironpython a microsoft implementation of cpython
24313
it worked great in every browser i tested it in ie6 7 firefox safari opera
24322
telnet onto an irc server and witness the simplicity of the protocol first hand
24362
here are some very simple examples ado.net hibernate nhibernate logging frameworks various language collection types the asp.net stack the jsp stack etc.
24414
anyone know of a way to capture keyboard events keyup keydown in portable ie under window mobile
24454
i heavily prefer cakephp for php django for python rails for ruby
24460
asp.net mvc for .net
24495
i have a struts + velocity structure like for example a person class whose one property is a car object with its own getter setter methods and it is mapped to a velocity form that submits to an action using modeldriven and getmodel structure
24516
i m trying to parse a grammar in ocamlyacc pretty much the same as regular yacc which supports function application with no operators like in ocaml or haskell and the normal assortment of binary and unary operators
24542
i also sometimes want all parts of a condition to be evaluated whether the result is true or not rather than short-circuiting so i use and |
24549
it s supposedly being ported to firefox and safari but that s been happening for a while now
24558
prefer initialization in declaration if you don t have a constructor parameter that changes the value of the field
24558
if the value of the field changes because of a constructor parameter put the initialization in the constructors
24564
i have found that visualsvn is about 50 slower than running svn as a native service
24564
installed visualsvn on port 8080 side-by-side with my existing svn install
24577
with a nonclustered index you ll add the records in whatever order they come in and then build a separate index indicating their desired order
24578
our monorail stuff uses the brail view engine while asp.net mvc comes stock with a webforms like view engine
24581
look into build tool nant or msbuild
24591
nant and msbuild are the most popular tools to automate your build in .net and you can find a discussion on there of the pros cons of each in the stack overflow question best .net build tool
24595
i have really tried to use emacs and vim but i don t have the time to learn them
24613
kate kde syntax-highlighing
24648
i was thinking of learning by getting to know either linux or bsd kernel
24682
it is a microkernel while linux and bsd are a monolithic kernel so what you learn may not be 100 translatable to be able to work with linux or bsd but you can still gain a lot out of it without having to process quite as much information
24682
as a side note if you ve read just for fun linus actually was playing with minix before he wrote linux but it just wasn t enough for his purposes
24707
i ve used tapestry 3 wicket echo and jsf fairly extensively
24707
that goes doubly so if you are using your own db code instead of hibernate or some other framework i was never completely happy with wicket hibernate or spring integration
24707
in the end i d recommend just taking a look at tapestry wicket and jsf and just picking the one that feels the best to you
24732
aside from the good books already mentioned opeating system design implementation is particularly good get a hold of a 1.x release linux kernel load it into vmware or virtualbox and start playing around from there
24745
your query was looking for rows where the tag was both fruit and food which is impossible seeing as the field can only have one value not both at the same time
24813
does anyone have a good way to build msi vdproj projects using msbuild or nant
24820
we use wix to automate msi builds for ironpython and ironruby
24845
if a user fails to provide proper credentials more than 3 times the ip address is blocked or the account is locked
24860
if you re just re- starting out in sharepoint development there s a lot of value in just using wss 3.0 and not yet using moss 2007
24876
when one assigns a value to an object s value-type field the clr copies the value to the space allocated within the object for that particluar field
24876
notice the clr is being told to stfld the loaded value of 20 in the stack to the loaded embeddvalues numberfield field location directly into the managed heap
24908
to fix you need to call free for everything that is obtained with malloc after you finish using it
24910
for primitive types int double ... the operators are built in so the compiler will probably be able to optimize your code
24941
tips on gui s for phpunit would also be appreciated but my main focus is simpletest for this project
24995
java has scala and .net has f#
24995
classes can be written in scala then extended in java for example
24999
since scala compiles into java bytecode and f# compiles into .net bytecode made to run on their respective virtual machines
25011
i ve heard great things about memcached through irc but have never heard of apc - what are your opinions on them
25035
were they in vb6 i think i would consider upgrading them to vb.net just for maintainability
25041
i tried setting the css style attribute of display inline for the div but firefox seems to then revert to span behaviour anyway and ignores the height attribute once again
25049
you can only change the height and width of a span element when it is set to display block
25051
the problem is that display inline can t get a height associated because being inline it gets its height from its the content
25077
but i am confused as to how both files came out to the same md5 hash
25079
i ve heard great things about memcached through irc but have never heard of apc - what are your opinions on them
25079
actually many do use apc and memcached together .
25092
it s not entirely correct to say that the compiler can t optimize away the temporary variable copy in the postfix case
25092
so while it s certainly the case that the postfix version could be slower it may well be that the optimizer will be good enough to get rid of the temporary copy if you re not using it
25100
depending on how your host is set up you may be permitted to place a php.ini file in the root of your home directory with extra configuration directives
25105
unix and bsd courses courses and videos
25105
and of course the bsd man pages which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average linux man-page
25105
not quite related but i ll also recommend the video history of the berkeley software distributions as it gives a nice introduction to the bsd parts of the unix history and culture as well as plenty of hilarious anectodes from back when
25110
you can set any element to display inline-block to allow it to receive a height or width
25111
i got the gui to come up bit it refused to recognize any projects that i had set up
25116
does python have a file object that is intended for binary data and is memory only equivalent to java s bytearrayoutputstream
25124
we provide the plugins for many of the more commonly used libraries including yui jquery prototype dojo and ext js
25158
use one form and hide and show controls
25170
the method i often use is actually to pre-setup all my controls on individual panel controls and then show and hide these panels as i need them
25170
and if you show or hide the panel the controls on it do the same
25171
i also install safari and opera but mostly just use them for testing and benchmarking since their dev tools aren t as robust as firefox and they aren t as buggy as ie
25187
for the same reason document.write isn t allowed in xhtml you shouldn t write your xml markup as a string
25196
flashdevelop hooks up nicely with the flex compiler which is available for free it compiles both mxml the language flex applications are written in and actionscript 3
25203
when you introduce mocking into your arsenal for tdd it dramatically makes testing easier to abstract away the parts that are not part of the system under test
25213
come to think of it though it feels more like lua than python
25241
how do you unit test a httpmodule in asp.net given that httpapplication and httpcontext do no implement an interface
25248
one possible solution would be to have the time field empty until it was replaced by a newer value when you insert the deprecation date instead
25256
essentially you need to remove the httpmodule s reliance on httpapplication and httpcontext replacing them with an interface
25259
the development environment i am using is ruby on rails but if there are some other platform-specific solutions .net php django i would love to see those too
25275
i am not familiar with ruby on rails but the following is untested php code
25279
i don t much about ruby or rails but in perl this is what i would do
25303
if what you are trying to do is allow searches for a tag say vb also find things tagged as vb6 visual basic visualbasic and vb.net wouldn t those values be set as synonyms in the db s thesaurus rather than query parameters
25324
for what it s worth python ruby and javascript all have exclusively boxed values
25343
does one exist or are all products based on recording mouse and keyboard presses
25367
i would like to be in control of updating the textbox so i know when there has been a true change in the event the same date was selected
25371
that is the correct approach in wpf but not in silverlight
25422
steve can you please paste in your forms authentication web.config section also any relevant code to the asp.net login control you were using
25451
i looked in iis 7 and in the authentication section it says anonymous authentication enabled asp.net impersonation disabled basic authentication disabled forms authentication disabled
25469
show and hide these panels as i need
25475
numeric integer | float | infinity | pi
25516
if you want to do some more complicated operations to the records like filtering or joins you could consider using an etl tool pentaho mapforce and talend come to mind
25540
master pages are a feature of asp.net the .net web framework so you are looking for a feature similar to master pages in a java web framework
25540
its templating functionality involves creating a component and putting all common markup in that
25546
any possibility of using the sync framework over sftp scp ssh
25552
i m currently building a java app that could end up being run on many different platforms but primarily variants of solaris linux and windows
25574
after you ve processed each element in the set then do a full traversal to determine if the array is sorted or not
25581
if you learn css to the point where you can code most things without having to look up the reference if you re still looking up reference regularly you don t really know it and can t claim to complain i think and then develop for firefox safari it s a pretty nice place to be in
25614
i ve used jdom in the past and have looked briefly at xom and dom4j
25646
the width and height are correct and 800x600 buffer and m_pixelbuffer is correctly filled with 0xaa00aa00
25652
how can i determine the correct frame height so that the view displays one line of text in the current default font
25657
taking a leaf from scott meyers more effective c++ item 6 distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and decrement operations
25661
i m searching for a method that allows me to have a drawing area in the gtk window and at the same time being able to manage both gtk and sdl events
25673
get the font used by your text view create a string that serves as a reasonable example of what will be in the text view and use that to inform your frame height
25673
the frame height will need to be some number of points larger than the actual rectangle the string would be displayed in.
25701
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom
25784
they become part of the method signature available from the runtime which do can look at to determine how to best serialize a transaction. there are also the attributes within property declarations copy retain assign readonly readwrite nonatomic getter and setter
25820
in runtime meaning you ll have to use reflection to read every class get its attributes and inject the appropiate call and for that matter i think you couldn t use the reflection.emit method as i think reflection.emit wouldn t allow you to insert new code inside an already existing method
25844
i don t think so i really like json but the tooling is still not up to xml so i guess we have to wait and see
25853
note that this ip packet can be fragmented to fit in smaller packets eg
25855
for linux according to the udp man page the kernel will use mtu discovery it will check what the maximum udp packet size is between here and the destination and pick that or if mtu discovery is off it ll set the maximum size to the interface mtu and fragment anything larger
25892
several new data types including long long int optional extended integer types an explicit boolean data type and a complex type to represent complex numbers
25921
i m not remaining willfully ignorant of it but over the years when i ve dipped into other things i ve spent my time playing around with javascript php and a lot of python
25929
asp.net is the framework just like .net

several server side languages were developed php perl asp... which allowed the server to process the web page before sending it back to the client
25969
although this is entirely feasible for many database engines i always seem to struggle to remember the correct syntax for the sql engine of the day mysql oracle sql server informix and db2
25983
if you want to benefit from an xsl transformation engine like xalan or an xpath engine like jaxen or saxon i would recommend sticking to the more popular framework available like apache xerces jdom
26041
i have some experience in php and c# but i don t mind and i would even like to use this as an excuse learning some new thing like python or ruby
26047
obfuscator for delphi c++
26059
i don t mind and i would even like to use this as an excuse learning some new thing like python or ruby
26061
scale to something small like 64x64 or 32x32 disregard aspect ratio use a combining scaling algorithm instead of nearest pixel
26068
i haven t used ubuntu as a server but had a good experience with mod_wsgi on solaris
26068
you may not want to server all files using apache and use lighttpd lighty to server static files
26079
all of the docs i ve read say to make the class constructor private so the class can t be directly instantiated
26080
edit i should mention that i ve only used this syntax with access sql 2000 2005 express mysql and postgresql so those should be covered
26097
__construct would only be called if you called it from within a method for the class containing the private constructor
26111
application is written in .net 1.1 but the server runs asp.net 2.0
26116
java has biginteger and bigdecimal and python automagicaly switches to an object similar to java s if a number gets out of the range of an integer or whatnot
26127
if you size your elements and space the content within using padding you can make many layouts work great in ie6 7 ff safari and opera without any hacks
26133
design your own class structure containing multiple higher order datatypes like double or int64 variables and define basic math operations for them using operator overloading in c++ or via methods named add subtract multiply shift etc
26148
at the moment the services are being restarted daily with an option to input any number of hours of the day for them to shutdown and restart which patches the problem but cannot be a long-term solution once they go onto the production machine and start to become busy
26162
this is also used in the stl and in many libraries including boost
26162
edit i ve amended the code to reflect boost stl conventions as pointed out by daniel in his comment.
26350
for lisp and scheme hell functional programming in general there are few things that provide a more solid foundation than the little schemer and the seasoned schemer
26364
msbuild is responsible for updating from svn on every commit compiling and running fxcop and ncover nunit
26365
additionally if you find yourself using gtk instead of windows.forms there is a tarball of webkit-sharp available that allows for easy embedding of webviews into gtk# applications
26378
one negative to add is that pointers to the stack are no longer valid when the function returns so you cannot return a pointer to a stack variable from a function
26392
he wants a framework that pushes the model-view-controller design pattern davidg mvc isn t just the name of an asp.net framework in a winforms project using the .net compact framework
26394
then you have built in support for using the settings designer if you want at design-time or at runtime to use
26397
dijkstra and ford-fulkerson algorithms on graphs i like the fact that the second one has many applications
26397
the number field sieve for integer factorization very complicated but quite a nice theoretical result this also goes for the aks algorithm which proved that primes is in p
26418
a selector engine is a javascript library that lets you select elements in the dom tree using some kind of string for identifying them think regular expressions for dom elements
26468
this is basically the catch-all method as it converts a transient object into a persistent one save updates the object if it is existing update or even handles if the entity is a copy of an already existing object copy
26579
some blogs provide a generator meta tag - wordpress - you could find out if there s any exceptions to this
26602
which code decides to show hide the button that leads to the action is irrelevant
26602
that leaves us with only one drawback of doing show hide logic in javascript - the html sent to user is bigger than necessary
26602
having show hide logic in php does have a minus though
26602
so if you already have a script that runs when your document load for other reasons i would seriously consider having show hide logic there
26836
i can see this working fine if you ve only got 1 or 2 devs but what happens if the people who are creating new projects don t have shell access on the svn server to be able to create directories under var www
26845
what are you using mercurial darcs git bazaar
26851
contrary to perforce visualsvn does not work with the ms scc interface but rather directly with the svn client which i personally see as an advantage
26856
there s a guide on apple s web site porting unix linux applications to mac os x that talks specifically about how to make autoconf and make and other similar build systems fit into the mac os x universal binary scheme

deleting the visual studio 9.0 folder in my application settings directory
26879
however when the content gets larger opera and firefox show a scrollbar at the left so you can scroll to the content not on the screen
26910
this will by default parse the standard arguments passed to the script sys.argv 1
26912
i have ran into issues using the ajaxcontroltoolkit on repeated fields and usually side with using a lighter weight client-side option up to and including rolling your own show hide method that can be reused just by passing in an dom understood id
26929
perhaps after years of using a centralized model in one format or another perforce subversion cvs i just found distributed source control difficult to use
26942
don t know if it works with swt as well because i used only swing in my apps
26965
if you look into stl boost mfc atl and many open source projects you can see there are so many assertion statements and that makes project going further more safely
26967
i think you should just use ssl and rely on an http client library that does caching ex wininet on windows
26968
in the asp.net work for me the easiest way i do it which allows me to hit either msbuild or nant depending upon the project was to roll my own exe that takes an argument which i pass in with a bat file fired by cc.net
26973
at my workplace we switched to git from cvs about two months ago the majority of my experience is with subversion
27000
on the other hand nullpointerexception s and indexoutofboundsexception s might actually often be appropriate
27001
the external libraries should be not be built into the system root as they may cause conflicts
27032
rather than just dropping controls on the form you ll have to play a bit with panels padding min max sizing and docking
27035
this is supported in opera and firefox and i recon in safari but haven t tested
27069
so maybe if you merge the cells of the data more data even more data into one cell you can more easily deal with classic each row is a row case
27090
it doesn t really apply to any managed or interpreted environments such as .net java python perl php etc which web apps are typically written in so your only risk is the web server itself which is probably written in c or c++
27132
last in first out lifo means that the last thing you put in is always the first thing you get back out - if you push 2 items on the stack a and then b then the first thing you pop off the stack will be b and the next thing is a
27132
don t break your programs up too far into smaller and smaller functions - even without counting local variables each function call consumes as much as 64 bytes on the stack 32 bit processor saving half the cpu registers flags etc
27134
my concern is that a dvcs makes it easier to not share your work since you don t have the drawbacks of not sharing your work you get with svn
27140
do you put the contents first so that the user has to listen to them every time or do you put them at the end so that they can get to the content first
27148
i want to merge multiple rss feeds into a single feed removing any duplicates
27160
from my experience even just excel makes a pretty good tool for quickly whipping up graphs of perfmon if you relog the data to csv or tsv
27163
in order to intercept it you would need to add another httphandler in front of it that intercepts all uncaught exceptions
27222
i am wonder if there is any good php libraries that handle dom manipulation similar to how javascript deals with dom manipulation
27244
simplepie is a php library that supports merging rss feeds into one combined feed
27254
it could be that prototype or mootools or extjs are as good as jquery
27256
to put some names out there prototype script.aculo.us jquery dojo yui ...those all seem to have active users and contributers so they are probably worth reading up on to see if they meet your needs
27292
i implemented svn for a while which was great as a semi-solution for backup as well as revision control easy reversion of temporary or breaking changes etc
27303
binding transforms is possible in wpf - but i m getting an error when setting up my binding in silverlight through xaml
27304
your best bet is probably just to export the data to a csv file which is plain text and reasonably easy to generate
27337
wpf silverlight can t convert between those two types
27391
and why expect a certain minimum width or height
27430
it support many servers not only weblogic including tomcat jboss resin jetty and websphere
27435
i am working on a web application using python django and would like to know whether mysql or postgresql would be more suitable when deploying for production
27439
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster
27440
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas
27443
if you are writing an application which may get distributed quite a bit on different servers mysql carries a lot of weight over postgresql because of the portability
27443
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end
27445
i haven t used django but i have used both mysql and postgresql
27445
postgresql is a little more scalable it doesn t hit the brick wall as fast as mysql as data size client count increases
27454
but since b s parameterless constructor is private instantiating b with your process will fail at runtime
27463
443 when used for https relies on ssl not ssh for its encryption
27481
multiplying by 3 can be done by simple shifts adds if no multiply instruction exists or if multiplication only works with 8 bit operands
27503
you should be able to take this and do some mild pruning of it to put in your username password dbname to get it up and working for you

on the unix bash shell specifically mac os x leopard what would be the simplest way to copy every file having a specific extension from a folder hierarchy including subdirectories to the same destination folder without subfolders
27622
the trace macro can be used to output diagnostic messages to the debugger when the code is compiled in debug mode
27630
public dispose calls protected dispose true - deals with both managed and unmanaged resources
27638
additionally the aforementioned parsing process can be extended through reader macros that let you customize the way your compiler turns text into s-exps
27642
so no stl or boost
27644
i think the way to do get around this problem is to develop a . configure make script that your client uses to install specify and compile the binaries
27649
the open web application security project owasp have a few suggestion for sanitizing your input
27674
in our project sharpwired we re trying to create a download component similar to the download windows in firefox or safari
27707
look up svn ignore and .gitignore - these features allow you to have extra files in your checkout that are ignored by your rcs when doing a status operation or whatever
27711
i m having a problem obtaining the total row count for items displayed in a gridview using paging and with a linqdatasource as the source of data
27735
perform an svnadmin dump filter out the revision where you accidentally committed the file and perform an svnadmin load
27749
due to annoying backwards compatibility concerns dos applications being single-tasking assume that nothing can delete a file out from under them that they can fclose and then fopen without anything going amiss
27764
since obsolete warnings occur at compile time and since the reflection needed for serialization occurs at runtime marking that method obsolete won t break serialization but will warn developers that the method is not there to be used
27782
there s john resig s project bringing the browser to the server browser dom environment written in javascript that runs on top of rhino
27785
just as a small small note hometoast s expression doesn t need to put brackets around the s for https since he only has one character in there
27785
would match http or https just fine
27786
i started using mocks through jmock but eventually transitioned to use easymock
27796
you also need default constructors for nhibernate but i want to force people to not use c# 3.0 object initializers so that classes go through constructor code
27902
switch to the install directory opt apache2 and tar and gzip up the binaries and config files
27968
we just couldn t find anything commercially available to do this and so charlie sat down and wrote this in bash shell scripts and it was running on hp-ux
28059
i used the update url and i installed the javahl adapter the subclipse project itself and the svnkit adapter beta
28130
if it will be used frequently and if it will be extended in the future i would almost recommend adding either python or lua into your code
28132
the real power of arrayformula comes when you take the result from one of those computations and wrap it inside a formula that does take array or range arguments sum max min concatenate
28220
if this is for xml serialization and nhibernate where you want the parameterless constructor to be accessible as is the case in the example you referenced then use a private or protected parameterless constructor for serialization or a protected constructor for nhibernate
28226
however since it looks like you have 16-bit vs 32-bit fields you re probably stuck converting on each call or writing wrappers for all functions of one of the libraries
28241
the head version has the traditional singleton pattern private constructor getinstance etc
28241
the branch version has no constructor is a public abstract class and modified all the methods on the object to be static
28241
the code that used to exist in the private constructor is moved into a static block
28254
create an fxcop rule and add fxcop to your integration build in order to check for this
28256
it s simple enough that i don t see the need for yacc or bison
28272
note that using a grammar does not at all imply using a specific tool a la yacc bison ...
28276
vmware is beefer and sucks more of the system s performance away by default also seems to perform somewhat better than parallels but can have serious graphical problems depending on your setup particularly if you try to use unity mode
28283
if you have any trouble you can natively boot into your virtual machine if you have set it up as a bootcamp partition on the mac
28286
if you want it to be really really general such as be able to parse mathematical functions as well like sin 4+5 cos 7 3 you will probably need a parse tree
28317
i also made sure that some of the mac os keyboard and mouse shortcuts were not registered in vmware fusion to stop strange things happening
28319
decryption support for many protocols including ipsec isakmp kerberos snmpv3 ssl tls wep and wpa wpa2
28319
output can be exported to xml postscript csv or plain text
28354
just to mention an alternative to vmware fusion i m using parallels als a vm
28354
i am quite happy with parallels but i m not sure i wouldn t use vmware fusion the next time
28467
i m not clear on what your requirements are for passing types between c c++ and python but you can do that easily by either exposing a c++ type to python or by using a generic boost python object argument to your c++ api
28467
you can also register converters to automatically convert python types to c++ types and vice versa
28467
in this case image is a c++ object exposed to python an image with float pixels and op is a python defined function or really any python object with a #95
28505
forgive me if the compiler catches the overriding of a private constructor but i don t think it does
28551
in a day or two i ll be ready to submit my iphone app to the appstore and i m curious whether people who have gone through this process have any tips suggestions for a smooth submission process
28564
basically only the gpl requires that the whole product is gpl and lgpl implies that the parts specific to that library be open sourced
28634
you might want to try learning c using the gnu gcc compiler from within the cygwin environment in windows
28664
i m thinking ruby or python see a related question specifically for python would be best for this but i m open to using any language really and would actually probably prefer an application language like c c++ java c# in case this project goes off
28668
it s not my first choice but i d use perl instead of python if there was a perl-y solution at hand
28672
the gnu gcc compiler from within the cygwin environment in windows
28692
it has been a really long time since i did anything with filemaker pro but i know that it does have capabilities for an odbc and jdbc connection to be made to it however i don t know how or if that translates to the linux perl python world though
28700
it stands as much of a chance to be installed as python or ruby
28758
in his book on patterns martin fowler points out that activerecord tends to break down under conditions where your model is fairly complex and suggests a datamapper as the alternative
28758
whether your datamapper classes contain raw custom sql or calls to a data abstraction layer api or even access an activerecord pattern themselves doesn t really matter to the controller code that is receiving a nice populated user object
28820
i d like this to be a little more friendly for the admins who are familiar with scripting in vbscript jscript etc
28833
these are tools that bridge the developer designer gap for building rich internet applications with silverlight and wpf
28838
there is definitely not a vbscript engine i ve ever heard of nor jscript

what steve says is right but i guess that if your code had to support several languages you could have a factory method that encapsulates a set of methods that do the relevant toupper or tolower based on that language
28857
the box width is given by the sum of the left and right margins border and padding and the content width
28878
in php i m using domdocument and domxpath which closely corresponds to c# xmldocument
28885
however having done a lot of development on ancient versions of solaris aix and hp-ux just recently - yes these platforms are still alive in the fortune 50 i can tell you that if you really care about portability you should use templates as little as possible
28933
the closest thing to a scripting environment on windows mobile is the configuration service provider interface
28934
i believe that system.diagnostics.debug.write will always output to an attached debugger even if you ve built in release mode
28947
when you compile without the debug flag set any call to writedebug will be removed as was assumed was happening with debug.write
29004
sometimes i need to quickly extract some arbitrary data from xml files to put into a csv format
29023
use a command-line xslt processor such as xsltproc saxon or xalan to parse the xml and generate csv
29042
as lassevk pointed out vbscript is not visual basic
29042
the wscript object is the root object of the windows script host
29044
mysql + writing custom db code in c++ or python or whatever seems like a rather heavy-handed solution
29046
if you want to build a web site you really need a database server engine like ms sql postgresql mysql oracle or their brethren
29053
most people say that ie is correct but then safari is also doing the same thing as firefox
29124
if you use a gpl tool like bison you probably don t need to worry about licensing issues since the c code generated by bison is not covered by the gpl ianal but i m pretty sure gpl tools don t force the gpl on generated code binaries
29124
my only warning against skipping the parsing tools or just using the shunting yard algorithm or a hand rolled recursive decent parser is that little toy languages 1 may someday turn into big actual languages with functions sin cos log and variables conditions and for loops
29130
another option for perl would be web scraper which is based on ruby s scrapi
29163
secure programming for linux and unix
29174
i m using jquery and simplemodal in an asp.net project to make some nice dialogs for a web app
29205
sqlite mysql and firebird are free database back ends
29235
if you don t declare your own constructor in the subclass trying to instantiate it will throw a fatal error because it tries to call the superclass constructor
29242
edit clarification i am looking for code that i can easily drop in to my own programs to write to stderr stdout log files or other such output streams
29319
if you put .tostring to a var query variable you get the sql
29346
if i can do that i ll be able to ask the use up front for their credentials and then dynamically apply the security and give them meaningful error messages if access is denied.
29358
for something that s not crazy expensive go with either a nvidia geforce 8000 series card or an ati 3000 series card
29406
i think of all of the various wrappers and helpers i ve seen for nhibernate log4net and code i ve read from projects like nlog and nettopologysuite and i see so many good approaches but honestly i m at a loss where to start
29461
i m working on getting an introduction to groovy presentation ready for my local java user s group and i ve pretty much got it together
29461
most of the people are experienced java developers but i m pretty sure they have little to no groovy knowledge
29461
what are the best things i can cover in a 1 hour time frame that will help me effectively communicate to these java developers how useful groovy could be to them
29491
also a possible value for the dwflags field is flashw_stop to cause the flashing to stop
29507
create a perl python php script to do the job for you
29524
edit lubos hasko suggests having a little java program to deserialize the objects in front of python but the problem is that for this to work your little java program needs to load the same versions of all the same classes that it might deserialize
29524
on the other hand it s possible to log arbitrary exceptions and if they get put in the stream as well my point stands.
29529
for example json scroll down for libs has libraries for python and java so you could in theory use java library to serialize your objects and python equivalent library to deserialize it
29529
send output stream to your python application and deserialize it
29531
i can seem to figure out how to declare a static field and i can set its value later but i can t seem to get the above effect
29532
typically you should maintain the two-element buffer but handle a machine word 32 64 bit unsigned integer at a time
29545
once you get the count to 0 via the attribute you then put in a rule that new checkins may not introduce fxcop violations
29557
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.
29562
my main goal is to create a .deb package for debian ubuntu users but i don t understand make configure files
29562
this one has some interesting discussion it s also how i found the ubuntu guide about concatenating a zip-file and a shell script to create some kind of universal executable anything with python and bash that is
29563
we are in fact moving away from nunit to mstest
29564
libraries that implement json yaml asn.1 and xml are available for both java and python and pretty much every programming language known to man
29567
if you want to work with other languages it also has bindings for java and python
29573
why not ruby python or whatever which are all runnable on the jvm
29582
well i am not python expert so i can t comment on how to solve your problem but if you have program in .net you may use ikvm.net to deserialize java objects easily
29622
you also have to get your game rated by the esrb which will put you back another 2500
29630
if i put the template file in the office startup folder it will launch everytime i start word
29640
it allows you to design user interfaces for swing swt and even the google web toolkit gwt
29654
i m developing a winforms application .net 3.5 no wpf where i want to be able to display foreign key lookups in a databound datagridview
29654
i d like to have a databound datagridview where each row represents an orderline displaying the line s product and producttype
29654
users can add or edit orderlines direct to the grid and choose the product for the order line from a comboboxcolumn - this should then update the producttype column showing the producttype for the selected product in the same row
29680
whenever the user provides invalid credentials the ntlm dialog box pops up in internet explorer
29680
i don t want the ntlm dialog box to be displayed when the user provides invalid credentials
29680
instead the postback by the login button in the authentication form should be executed
29681
files xml files and csv files as
29690
however i do now have a working solution in one cell using the choose function and explicitly listing the result cells one by one in the arguments like this
29694
i keep mysql s auto_increment as unsigned integer fields of various sizes in order to make use of the full range as i know there will never be negative values
29694
ms sql does not support the unsigned attribute on all integer types so i have to choose between ditching half the value range or creating some workaround
29705
basically you get data from somewhere your outgoing articles do something to it aggregate and put it somewhere else your aggregates table data warehouse etc
29733
however i would very much like to use several components written in either python or ruby either pygments or coderay as a source code formatter
29733
does anyone know a good implementation in either ruby or python
29752
you can use either a sortedlist or sorteddictionary both sort by the key or a dataview
29760
installation upgrade runs.
29769
are you sure you aren t mixing up ssas analysis services and ssis integration services
29769
ssas is not an etl it is an olap tool
29770
the first is rope a python refactoring library that comes with a vim and emacs plug-in
29770
also plugs into vim and emacs
29775
all in all we are looking for a way to ease the deployment installation and configuration pain
29784
but if you want to understand ssas olap and reporting using this framework it s a good start
29792
i have worked with oracle ms sql server mysql postresql sqlite and sybase that i can think of
29802
i notice that here in the beta there is an svn revision number in the footer and that s ideal for an application that uses svn over one repository
29822
i cant find any debug settings set anywhere
29831
and if after all this your profiling and benchmarking reveals that the lexical_casts are an unacceptable bottleneck that s when you should consider doing some macro horror
29836
as already mentioned networkx is very good with another option being igraph
29852
with that setup the svn revision number of the metarepository could possibly be used for versioning the complete system
29852
in another case i include the svn revision via svn keywords in a class file that serves no other purpose to avoid the risk of keyword substitution breaking my code
29855
my understanding is that wxwidgets is for a number of programming languages c++ python perl and c# .net but that does not include c
29862
the basic way of handling this is to group by your fixed fields and select a max or min for some unqiue value a datetime usually works well
29900
you ll probably need to be able to run python scripts on your webserver to host either of them
29923
at the place where i work we decided to move from svn to bazaar after evaluating git and mercurial
29923
bazaar was easy to start off with simple commands not like the 140 commands that git has
29972
i use teamcity with an nant build script
29972
teamcity makes it easy to setup the ci server part and nant build script makes it easy to do a number of tasks as far as report generation is concerned
29989
doxygen is really excellent for this although you will need to install graphviz to get the the graphs to draw
30005
ideally i would like to have a loading animated gif which is replaced once the pdf has loaded
30031
include an example of how making java code more groovy takes away soooo much code
30031
scott davis has a simple example at the beginning of groovy recipes that takes 35 lines of java or 3 lines of groovy
30049
breaks this text node into two text nodes at the specified offset keeping both in the tree as siblings
30049
it seems to be to be a conforment behaviour to remove all the adjacent text nodes and then recreate a new node with the concatenation of the values leaving textnode pointing to something that is no longer part of the tree
30066
by default these stderr streams are redirected to the stdout of an interactive bash
30066
i would like to get them on the stderr of this interactive bash process in order to prevent my stdout to be polluted by error messages and be able to treat them separatly
30114
some people also use artistic style command line tool although it requires perl and works better with c c++ code than with c#
30139
it is essential that the destructor frees all resources allocated by the object and its constructor returns an object which has been fully initialized and ready for use
30139
the usage of such class should be similar to how primitive int float etc
30145
we will read it and transmit it within another packet let s say http post not depending on getting it somehow from ethernet frames
30147
feel free to try it out on a new project but a lot of people familiar with asp.net webforms aren t loving it yet due to having to muck around with raw html + lots of different concepts + pretty slim pickings on documentation tutorials
30160
i m giving a presentation to a java user s group on groovy and i m going to be doing some coding during the presentation to show some side-by-side java groovy
30187
this event fires when the keyboard or mouse state changes after dodragdrop has been called on that control
30187
just a note though as i call dodragdrop from within the mousedown event handler in my example this code should never actually get a direct mouseup event to fire
30188
i am using monorail on the server to perform the binding to a .net type that aside i need to know what to set the form hidden field value to to get properly sent to .net code
30243
for very simple linux support if you like textmate try just gedit loaded with the right plugins
30243
gedit how to set up like textmate
30244
asp.net mvc will probably be the de facto standard on the .net platform
30248
are you handling the textchanged event for the textbox
30261
i created a sample page with a textbox and a button and it worked fine for me
30261
edit textchanged event is only triggered when the textbox loses focus so that can t be the issue
30361
powershell also lets you pipe data from commands into xml csv and other formats that are understood by gui programs
30397
it is trivial to modify this example to check the users group and show or hide the menu based on membership
30428
terracotta jgroups etc
30428
at the moment i am doing some poc proof of concept work on terracotta and jgroups to see if its worth the effort for our app which is stand alone outside of a web container
30436
hotwire is cross platform linux bsd windows mac though it is at an early stage of development
30446
it is built for transcoding and since it is a licensed sdk it doesn t have any of the legal issues surrounding ffmpeg libavcodec
30471
you can avoid having to use strtotime or getdate in php by using mysql s unix_timestamp function
30522
both javascript s regex and php s preg_match are based on perl so there shouldn t be any porting problems
30564
you can target x64 and it will generate dll s specifically for 64-bit systems or you can do x86 which will run on 32-bit and 64-bit but will have the same restrictions as 32-bit on a 64-bit system
30598
likewise baraccount extends from account but is not a user subclass but implements editable listable and also versionable
30620
it s a shame it uses pygtk i d have preferred pyqt perhaps a licensing issue
30620
i use windows at work and windows linux ubuntu osx at home
30627
i ve decided to explore the option having the same program that currently recieves a single format xml document receive two additional xml document formats with various xml element changes
30627
following is a mockup of some various xml documents that i would like to have a single sax stax or
30673
basically you create an xsd defining your xml layout i believe you could also use a dtd
30673
then you pass the xsd to the jaxb compiler and the compiler creates java classes to marshal and unmarshal your xml document into java objects
30677
there are several xml frameworks that simplify marshalling and unmarshalling java objects to from xml
30677
but if you are want to deal with java objects then you should look at castor jibx jaxb xmlbeans xstream or something similar
30699
manipulate with the keyboard and or mouse
30710
i m using php and python but i think it s a question that applies to most all languages that use database access
30715
another option would be to use mocking stubs
30723
i don t know if php python got some but for typed languages c# java etc. there are plenty of choices
30724
i chose to use a custom form rather than a custom formtemplate simply because i m doing a lot of stuff that s not very sharepoint list-like making ajax calls to get info from a third-party app then generating some dynamic form elements based on that ajax result then subsequent processing of that data on postback
30731
i ve never done this in php and i ve never used python but what you want to do is mock out the calls to the database
30731
this requires some kind of object orientation going on in your code so it may not apply to what your doing i say that since all i have to go on is your mention of php and python
30739
sorry i don t have any specific code examples for php python but if you want to see a .net example i have a post that describes a technique i used to do this very same testing
30772
also if build time is a concern you can change the build process to have multiple builds one for building src another that fires up afterwards that handles unit tests code analysis packaging etc.
30776
you aren t stuck with perl as there is a python runner as well
30819
this gives the bare minimum that is required - if you later wanted some other form of storage like a bag or set or tree or whatnot your contract would remain intact
30841
in field to summarize select value in type of summary select sum under evaluate select for each record
30841
you cannot use this running total field in the page header too however because crystal will add the value in the first row on the page to it first so in your example it would show 9 rather than 4 at the top of page 2
30841
to work around this create a formula field which subtracts the current value of the value field from the running total #rtotal - tablename.value and put this formula field in your page header
30856
output can be csv xml html etc
30869
then i would set the build action to embedded resource. within wrapper.dll i would use the assembly object to access api.dll just like any other embedded resource
30882
you could also consider grails groovy on rails which gives you the benefits of a rails framework and the use of the java vm
30931
i m looking for a way that is standard works with gnome and kde based systems and can be done automatic when my program is installed or run for the first time
30939
2 gnome and kde have different methods to accomplish this
30949
md5 or sha1 + salt
30952
if you use md5 or sha1 use a salt to avoid rainbow table hacks
30957
the options are csv html xml excel and plist
30964
we have an external service that is currently accessible via the http port 80 non-ssl and https port 443 ssl addresses
30967
i second the vote for md5 or sha with a salt
30967
any of the major web development languages have functions built-in for computing the hash in php for example the mcrypt package contains the necessary functions
30976
in a custom error page for the 403 redirect the browser to the incoming url changing http to https along the way
30995
occasionally while attempting to save a crystal report that i m working on in vs2008 a dialog titled file save failed pops up saying the document could not be saved in c users phillip appdata local temp xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx .rpt
30995
it has been saved in c users phillip appdata local temp zzz yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy .tmp.
31059
in vs .net when you are selecting a folder for a project a dialog that looks like an openfiledialog or savefiledialog is displayed but is set up to accept only folders
31094
btw if you have a class that consists only of static data and functions you should declare the constructor to be private so nobody tries to instantiate it
31153
any code that you want to execute with the value of studentid set by the getjson call needs to happen either within that callback function or after the callback executes
31249
using wpf i have a treeview control that i want to set its itemtemplate dynamically through procedural code
31285
i am using vmware tools for ubuntu hardy but for some reason vmware-install.pl finds fault with my linux headers
31293
it has things like replace with parallel.for or foreach with parallel.foreach
31295
are there any good libraries that don t create this problem in safari but are also good for internet explorer and firefox and hopefully opera
31313
i usually create a repository and use that to save my entity then retrieve a fresh one
31318
remember javascript is a slow language and dom is not designed for animation so try to limit yourself with respect to the number of animations at the same time
31332
sbcl ext saveinitmem in clisp and ccl save-application in
31372
edit i should also point out that you can put some of the code in c c++ if you want to get around the gil as well
31405
redgate sqlcompare is a way to go in my opinion
31412
the distinction between fork exec and dynamic linking besides being kind of artificial doesn t carry over to interpreted languages what about a python perl ruby plugin which gets loaded via import or execfile
31420
daniel the distinction between fork exec and dynamic linking besides being kind of artificial doesn t carry over to interpreted languages what about a python perl ruby plugin which gets loaded via import or execfile
31425
the long answer expanding on what the op said is to be more compatible with apache and mysql postgresql
31425
they are all 64bit apache is a fat binary with ppc ppc64 x86 and x86 and x86_64 the others just straight 64bit
31446
in my program i eventually have to call flush on the entitymanager which would persist all changes from attached entities to the underyling database but i want to exclude specific objects
31459
for the code i assume boo compiles to standard .net assemblies so simply properly following the naming conventions using by asp.net mvc should allow you to write controllers
31490
if you set your to check uid the php process will only have access to any file owned by the user apache
31507
add a const value assign to a value that designate the configuration you are in
31529
iconvertible is implemented by boolean sbyte byte int16 uint16 int32 uint32 int64 uint64 single double decimal datetime char and string so you can check for primitive types using this
31572
is there a way that we can broadcast out messages like this like udp will let you do while keeping guaranteed delivery like tcp
31627
i have cs degree so i ve done x86 assembly c c++ on dec unix and slackware linux in a time out of mind .
31648
i used to use nunit but now tend to use mbunit for two key features
31648
another nice aspect of mbunit is that its syntax is nearly identical to nunit so if you have a whole test bed already in place under nunit you can just switch out the references without the need to change any very much
31652
svn solved both those is easy to set up i use collabnet server and tortoisesvn client although there are two good visual studio plugins visualsvn - commercial and ankhsvn - open source easy to use and administer and well documented
31768
almost all games have a need for the fast-reacting properties and to a lesser extent the connectionless properties of udp and the reliability of tcp
31783
take a look at sctp which has a combination of tcp and udp features
31799
i ran into problems with a couple of classes i have that implement ienumerable and icollection t
31813
i m not sure whether you re asking for a shell as in bash csh or a shell as in ipython
31826
in an article in ieee computer magazine vol 41 nr 9 sept 2008 the authors survey four popular xml parsing models dom sax stax and vtd
31827
i thought that both gnome and kde maybe only 4+
31835
the distributed nature of git and the option of private temporary checkins assuming i ve understood what i ve read is attractive - hence my looking at bazaar
31859
another system not mentioned in the accepted answer yet is pyinstaller which worked for a pyqt project of mine when py2exe would not
31862
there are a lot of alternatives out there the most popular being nhibernate with the new kid ado.net entity framework on the block
31865
what if a website or any kind of malware just puts another site in the trust list
31885
however in my work i deal with oracle db and sqlite and my hobby projects use mysql because they are hosted on linux
31921
why haven t anyone talked about turbogears web.py and pylons
31929
there s no casting or any other stuff and because the dll contains the information that this is a list of person other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains person objects so you get intellisense and so on
32010
assuming that this applies to php python perl ruby etc as well as c# which is what i assume jeff was using how much of a slowdown is it and will i incur a similar penalty with as i will with
32019
the next step is to create a file that contains a set of macros which you can then import by using the macrofile switch
32027
i m new to nant but have some experience with ant and cruisecontrol
32102
how about installing a windows version of python perl or your favorite language
32106
i have cygwin installed so i can run bash shell scripts for my automatization needs
32145
i see a lot of debate about getter setter class methods and is it better to just access simple property variables directly or should every class have explicit get set methods defined blah blah blah
32145
any methods that come through __call that start with get or set are then routed to functions that set or retrieve values into an associative array
32198
i am looking for any strategies people use when implementing server applications that service client tcp or udp requests design patterns implementation techniques best practices etc
32203
off the top of my head i think you have to check the type attribute of the checkbox to determine if it s a radio button
32219
my problem with this is that adding more logic later requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which property you re accessing so that you can apply specific logic
32281
also i think clonenode doesn t clone events registered with addeventlistener
32286
is probably the most absurdly complete site dedicated to a single .net namespace...but it has everything you could ever want to know about sending mail via .net be it asp.net or desktop
32290
- supports php and perl pcre posix python javascript and node.js
32310
i have a rule that i only use assertions in public and protected methods
32343
ordinarily i would encode the files one at a time but let s say i wanted the program to figure out how many cpu cores i had and spin up an encoding thread on each core
32356
my problem with this is that adding more logic later requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which property you re accessing so that you can apply specific logic
32386
joseph if it s a strict requirement to pass xhtml validation with the actual markup don t know why it would be though you could theoretically add this attribute with javascript afterwards but then users with js disabled probably a neglectable amount of your userbase or zero if your site requires js will still have their passwords saved
32390
one way i know is to use for instance javascript to copy the value out of the password field before submitting the form
32477
at that point you could experiment with using native api s to give the underlying native thread processor affinity
32484
another possibility is to put the if statement within your logging function you get less code this way but at the expense of some extra function calls
32494
notepad++ my preferred notepad replacement also does this
32507
simply adding the getter setter explicitly will add more complex functionality
32522
whitelist or blacklist photos to filter them in step 1
32537
added clarification i am thinking more along the lines of ruby python boo etc
32552
it honestly depends on the language because managed languages like c# and java or scripting languages like javascript python or php are locked in to their current methodology and to get started and to do anything beyond the advanced stuff there is not much to worry about
32560
ok so the key difference between this and kristof s answer is that you only want a count of 1 to show against page 1 because it has been tagged only with one tag from the set even though two separate users both tagged it
32631
scala or java
32633
i can easily set breakpoints in embedded js functions but i don t see any way of accessing external js scripts via firebug unless i happen to enter them during a debug session
32643
i would prefer to use c c++ but java perl or php would be acceptable too
32667
create a custom nant msbuild task
32667
use a scripting technology robocopy batch file etc. to create a script file and run an executable task for cc.net or an exec task for nant msbuild
32668
i don t edit css very often and almost every time i need to go and google the css box model to check whether padding is inside the border and margin outside or vice versa
32675
to me padding just sounds more inner than margin
32675
within those margins the content could be padded to provide an extra barrier between the content and the margin
32694
i had to change one of the user id numbers for a user account on the nis server i changed the userid for username from 500 to 509 to avoid a conflict with a local user account with id 500 on the clients
32696
however this isn t the case - body s padding is the same as margin
32703
what i did was load a linq object via one datacontext and then tried to submitchanges for the object via a different datacontext - gave this exact same error
32744
first server gmail to second server hotmail
32744
however i don t understand how gmail server transfers the message to the hotmail server
32744
so the big question is when i click send mail sends my message to my gmail server how does my gmail server forward the message to say a hotmail server so my friend can recieve it
32754
the domain name system dns associates a mail server to a domain with mail exchanger mx resource records containing the domain name of a host providing mta services
32765
step 2 to 3 gmail to hotmail would normally happen through smtp or esmtp - extended smtp
32775
knowing ip address of hotmail server gmail server will sent the message using smtp protocol and will wait for an answer
32775
if hotmail server goes down gmail server wiil try to resend the message it will depend on server software configuration
32780
it is set up so that we can access it from any computer
32792
linux bsd
32797
you should be able to block wan connections to the server on the router and still leave it open to accepting lan connection
32807
the only additional step i would do is set a short timer after the tabindexchanged event to track that a new tab has been selected and ignore any double-clicks that happen outside the timer
32813
also it would be possible to send the message without using gmail server by sending it directly from your pc to hotmail using smtp
32827
the bottom line is that you need to use a build scripting language like nant or msbuild there are others but these are the mainstream ones right now if you want to have any real control over your build process
32866
manageofflinestatus.aspx contains an offline online checkbox textarea for offline message and an update button
32867
you might also be interested to know why the gmail to hotmail link uses smtp just like your thunderbird client
32867
the historical aspect is that in the old days the link between gmail and hotmail was likely to be intermittent

so you know instantly when looking at dpvarname that it s a pointer to a double and that lvarname is a long int
32982
in eclipse you can highlight the part of the source code you want to comment out and use the ctrl+ to single-line comment every line in the highlighted section - puts a at the beginning of the lines
32991
i typically share the root drive on my machines across my network and tie login authorization to the machines nt id so there is at least some form of protection
33010
if your class is also comparable the equals and compareto methods should be consistent too
33019
i halfway looked at swffit but the height and width sometimes but mainly height would be dynamic - swffit let s you declare a maxheight but that number would be constantly changing...maybe i could figure out how to set it dynamically
33031
the design guidelines that you linked specifically state that they only apply to static public and protected fields
33031
i m not positive but i m relatively confident that private members are not considered when the compiler checks for cls compliance because only public protected members come in to play there the idea is what if someone who uses a language that doesn t allow the _ character tries to use your library
33036
the save method will serialize the object and all of its children in the logical tree
33068
you can create a repository backup dump with svnadmin dump
33071
cross platform support win32 unix and embedded supports linux gcc compilers and msvc6
33071
perhaps this can be easily accomplished with some virtualization software like vmware or virtualbox
33088
with the older berkleydb system the repository is not platform independent and you would generally want to use svnadmin dump
33089
i m using the asp.net login controls and forms authentication for membership credentials for an asp.net web application
33104
at the moment website a opens a modal window containing website b using a jquery plug-in called jqmodal
33117
i was able to create a minimal livecd and edit the boot sequence so that it booted directly into the firmware updater instead of a bash shell
33123
this would let you avoid the hackiness that s inherent in any scheme that involves one site opening windows on the other
33133
creating your own custom ubuntu 7.10 or linux mint 4.0 live-cd with remastersys
33159
now to get the output path to refer to it - unfortunately when you add a string like myspecialpath debug to the output path field and save the project the and chars are converted to hex and your file get s put in a debug directory under a directory named myspecialpath
33166
i m using the asp.net login controls and forms authentication for membership credentials for an asp.net web application
33198
you do get to look at the types though if you call the stored procedure via ado ado.net odbc or the likes the resulting recordsets have the type information you are looking for
33223
i know microsoft has made efforts in the direction of semantic and cross-browser compliant xhtml and css but it still seems like a pita to pull off elegant markup
33236
xcode includes xctest which is similar to ocunit an objective-c unit testing framework and has full support for running xctest-based unit tests as part of your project s build process
33236
despite using ocunit rather than xctest the concepts are largely the same
33263
i m using the asp.net login controls and forms authentication for membership credentials for an asp.net web application
33269
i would look into the vmware fusion 2 beta to get around the quirks with the key bindings experienced by those using parallels
33337
it appears from the msdn article you linked to it was provided to allow for nullable boolean types prior to the nullable int
33382
check out the html css on microsoftpdc.com a site i m working on - it uses asp.net webforms but we re designing with clean markup as a priority
33395
i m using the asp.net login controls and forms authentication for membership credentials for an asp.net web application
33429
might be nice if it was better on windows we do .net development mostly asp.net but for the price.
33438
but some of the data i have to show on some forms has to come from text files and by text files i mean human-readable files they can be csv tab-delimited or even a key value pair per line since my data is as simple as this but my preference of course is xml files
33451
mysql or firebird for databases and open office for a ms office replacement
33471
i ve also noticed that svn doesn t seem too unhappy about conflicts - it still says updated to revision blah and exits zero regardless of conflicts
33483
or write a script to do the update that redirects the output to a file and does a cat svnupdate.log | grep c at the end to show you any conflicts
33485
i would tend toward silverlight since i m quite experienced .net developer while i have just a basic knowledge of asp.net controls
33486
when you log in interactively stdin stdout and stderr are set up for you and so your script works
33497
given my cto s propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in inc. i need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that i can throw out hibernate and use kodo or whatever without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code
33502
and it only fully works in safari 3 and partly in firefox 3 although there is an experimental port to internet explorer as well
33502
it uses only javascript dom and css and no svg or or flash or whatever
33503
like i said before this was released as part of a commercial application our interpretation of the gpl was that you can call external binaries from your program without a problem as long as your program can run without the external binaries if cdrecord wasn t found we popped up a dialog informing the user that burning capabilities were not available and we also had to host the source for cdrkit and cygwin and include a copy of the gpl with our distributed program
33510
ditto desktop apps written python and ruby which are excellent languages
33530
i think the technology behind it is good but considering nowadays you could get equal visibility functionality with a nice webforms mvc ajax jquery combination mix and match to your liking i d say stick with asp.net
33533
even after years of this i find it far faster to whip out a web app with php or python than to do it with .net
33534
is it possible to extend a class this way or should i define a class property with the base type and map all the needed methods to this property
33567
if your totally opposed to java i would look into wxwidgets with either python or c++
33587
python and ruby are in the same boat
33587
you might be able to accept its limitations but it s still not the same as having identical multiplatform environments that java python and ruby have
33587
if you don t like the java language and as a c# dev i m guessing that s not the case then you at least have options like jython jruby and scala
33592
it has a task for building the app calling msbuild to do the heavy lifting in compiling and then uses ruby to zip the build output and copy to a specified location create a folder in virtual directory and copy the build output to see the build results in action
33602
it works in saffari and firefox 3 opera 9 and people are developing support for ie
33618
when you call string.getbytes the platform default encoding is used to encode unicode characters to bytes
33668
there is maybe xlsql csv xml and excel driver which could fit the task
33679
should never go outside the testing phase then leave the system throw it or if there are side-effects reaching that point check for null at the beginning and throw either illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception
33681
they are set for the current process and by default inherited by any process that it creates
33684
all the better if it s a simple or simplifiable scripting environment applescript ruby any shell ksh bash or even .bat files
33690
a database operation at login and logout won t cause a performance problem
33727
i would like to use something like clr profiles on .net 2.0 to see what objects are taking more space in the heap at any given time of an asp.net worker process
33728
i m already planning to make it versioned version 1 can only control certain aspects of the system version 2 could control more but this may need a change in the way authentication is performed that would be incompatible with version 1 and the authentication will be distinct from the standard username password people use to log in if someone does use a malicious tool it won t open them up to full impersonation just whatever the api allows
33746
after the long winded explanation sorry how do you determine what is meta data and when designing the structure of an xml document how should you decide when to use an attribute or an element
33791
if you want 0 entries of your password you can set up public key authentication for ssh scp
33808
so a modified question would now be how can i find the revision history of the file that was deleted and then resubmitted to svn
33814
currently the script analyzes the page line by line but it breaks if there is a tag that spans multiple lines like
33815
the tutorial wordpress bbpress mediawiki should get you on the right track to integrating mediawiki into your wordpress install
33820
this behavior may be acceptable in perl but c c++ are very explicit languages
33821
it s nice and lightweight and has all of the macros built-in for ruby and let s you run ruby code or any other code for that matter just with a keystroke
33836
this is a follow on question to how do i delete 1 file from a revision in svn
33836
the previous question was answered and i discovered that it is not possible to remove a revision from svn
33836
so i am hoping that the answer to the question how can i find the revision history of the file that was deleted and then resubmitted to svn
33846
i would have said you can t - you have created a new file and thus revision tree in the eyes of svn
33846
it may be possible to recover the old tree independently not sure if you managed an actual delete or just svn delete but there is no link between the old revision tree and the new one
33847
use a source control system subversion perforce git mercurial bazaar etc
33854
one potential way to solve it is to hide and show the div whenever you change the content that in turn changes the height
33862
svn log won t show the file svn diff will pretend that the old revision does not exist but a svn checkout targeting the old revision will happily give you the old file
33891
cifs is really geared towards lan with a reasonably calm trafic so you have zero chance to not suffer intermittent lag accessing a share through a vpn
33911
set your vmware to not allow the os to swap any of the virtual machine
33942
what if you put the ellipses in a div with a low z-index so that when it moves to the left for shorter lines they get covered up by a background image or something
33952
there are very few things i could do in nant that i can t also do in msbuild so it really comes down to which one you are more comfortable with
33967
it has to be called on the machine you are interested in - the mac is not transferred across network boundaries lan and wan
33972
also after looking at some nhibernate source it appears that it s using that value to set the timeout for the underlying ado.net query which uses seconds
33995
in addition multiple bitwise operators chained together in a single statement -- even with explicit parentheses -- can be reordered by optimizing compilers because all 3 operations are normally commutative
34018
since the apache user is typically forbidden from logging in you only have to worry about web users writing to your secure file using through the http daemon
34027
enumerate the hits in the filter s bitset and for each hit you get the value of the field from the field cache and add it to a sortedset
34054
unfortunately in shared hosts that use mod_php there is no way to restrict access to secure files to your web app and login user
34061
interestingly oracle sql developer supports browsing and converting to oracle several databases including sql server and mysql
34080
so the scale would align this way reach asp.net ajax silverlight wpf rich
34104
flex and bison are the new lex and yacc though
34104
if you re not doing much translation you may one to pull a one-off using multiline regexes with perl or ruby
34115
but you get lucky in firefox ie and safari with their corresponding blocking of 3rd party cookies because they violate rfc2965 in multiple situations
34147
it is also easier for debugging purposes because you as well get a better idea about what went wrong when you see a stack trace
34149
i d recommend hpricot for ruby or beautiful soup for python which are both excellent parsers for html
34150
xml document and then tie that with an xsd
34184
i think there are versions of toad for mysql and maybe one or two others however the oracle version is by far the best
34195
by the way it s a little buggy in some versions of safari and opera - check out this quirksmode page for more
34227
on the search results page there are a ton of ui controls for filtering sorting the search results to find what you are looking for
34227
this latency is fine in case where the user is initially filtering sorting their results.
34239
the bbp formula allows you to compute the nth digit - in base 2 or 16 - without having to even bother with the previous n-1 digits first
34280
if you re behind a proxy server and want to try out some of the goodness that is rubygems easy-to-download libraries very cool you may need extra authentication help from rubysspi without which the gem library can struggle to get to the interwebs
34294
i ve been asked to create a delphi compatible dll in c++ to do simple 64bit memory management
34295
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like
34334
so a 32 bits delphi exe can not load your 64 bit c++ dll
34338
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up
34387
when we use exit it will go back to the state before the execution emptying the call-stack and return the value you gave it
34398
that value field could be either numeric or a character string in nature
34420
with mixed data like you re describing you ll have to test the value when you pull the field out of the db and perform the appropriate cast or convert based on the data type
34442
all encoding objects have an overridden method getmaxcharcount which will give you the maximum number of characters produced by decoding the specified number of bytes. you should be able to use this value to trim your string and properly encode it
34443
you could also use a background image on the li elements with a padding to keep the text from overlapping it
34454
it is the renderer s job to get any submitted value and set it via setsubmittedvalue
34474
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line
34474
simpletest is nice but the only thing it really has over phpunit in my opinion is the web runner
34474
the reasons i like phpunit are that it integrates with other php developer tools such as phing as does simpletest phpundercontrol and xinc
34484
if you set it in the constructor it is actually being set twice first to the default value then reset in the ctor
34499
i believe the limit is something done after the data set is found and the result set is being built up so i wouldn t expect it to make any difference at all
34523
the trick is to use some simple javascript to resize the flash dom node
34540
this excerpt from the book programming in lua shows how to make a proper tail recursion in lua but should apply to lisp too and why it s better
34561
keep them display blocked give them a width and float left
34566
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method
34566
in other words the default implementation of object.gethashcode is going to be based on reference equality since there are no real instance fields to use and therefore does not guarantee unique return values for different objects
34581
if i set the width of the class span.right to 49 they display next to each other
34581
i am not able to figure out why the right span is pushed down like the right span has some invisible padding margin which makes it take more than 50
34583
better choices to try would be -incremental which only recompiles the parts that have changed and -keep-generated-actionscript which stops the compiler from deleting the actionscript files it has generated from your application s mxml files
34626
note that you might consider maintaining the numeric and string values using a set of insert and update triggers
34638
we are using hibernate for our persistence
34640
a book you may be interested in is game programming with python lua and ruby
34640
not only does it cover python and i believe the pygame module but it also gives you exposure to lua and ruby
34641
the intellij ide java scala ruby ... has a locate duplicate.
34645
soft limits could be set by any user while hard limits are changeable only by root
34717
is it possible to embed an audio object mp3 wma whatever in a web-enabled infopath form
34738
basically you route matched urls to the controller .mvc variety then in asp.net you rewrite this url to remove .mvc -- doing this you don t have to define any extra routes or expose .mvc to your users
34758
you can use the nm -g tool from the binutils toolchain
34798
i have a gridview that is within an updatepanel for a modal popup i have on a page
34828
gethashcode should always be in sync with equals and equals isn t necessarily guaranteed to check for all of the fields in your object there s certain situations where you want that to not be the case
34837
if you want to abstract your search from your application and be able to query it in a language neutral way with xml http and json apis have a look at solr
34882
at the end of the object s constructor you could serialize the object to a base 64 string just like the cookie stores it and store this in a member variable
34936
you could load your list of words as chakrit suggested into a data table or xml file with a unique sequential key
34941
for perl at least the first option is sufficient i m not familiar with php
34942
if you know the html is well-formed enough you could if you make sure it has a root node convert the data in that field into a system.xml.xmldocument and then get the innertext value from it
34962
i d suggest routing your mail through an established mx rather than having a webserver do it directly there are some security implications there too
35016
the reason i asked is that perforce provides a completely different way to create branches from svn or cvs
35018
if you re simply looking to expose a collection on your instance then using a getter setter to a private member variable seems like the most sensible solution to me your first proposed option
35063
it is really much easier to install ubuntu on an old junk computer with postgresql or mysql
35085
use prefix form ++i of the increment and decrement operators with
35096
basically any expression that contains tainted values will output a tainted result
35103
i d like to do this by storing an md5 hash of the file inside the executable
35103
so that i can tie the hash to the configuration file as the configuration changes
35108
you can call the subclass s values method and obtain a sorted thread safe set of string s without having to down cast to the concurrentskiplistset
35116
you should retain the services of a security and cryptography consultant
35126
generally people store the last value of the two inputs and then compare it to the new value of the two inputs and use a small function to increment or decrement based on that
35126
i combine the two readings into a four bit number and use a simple array to tell me whether i increment or decrement the counter but there are solutions that are even more advanced and optimize for code size speed or ease of code maintenance
35154
i never expose a private collection property because other parts of the program can change it without parent noticing so that in the getter method i return an array with the objects of the collection and in the setter method i call a clearall over the collection and then an addall
35177
but i found that while mochikit has very expressive syntax it didn t feel nearly as comfortable to me as prototype scriptaculous or jquery did for me
35211
how can i parse the expression object from the constructor in order to attach to the myeventtowatch event of target
35218
tfs is dog-slow over a wan and it s really only usable if i vpn into my work computer which makes my dev experience really slow overall
35243
a tool like javadoc or doxygen if not already in use can also help improve code documentation and comprehensibility
35248
firefox does not have this problem haven t tested safari yet
35302
if i were starting afresh i d definitely look at both nhibernate and the ado.net entity framework
35322
usually when a user tries to access a resource without proper authorization i want them to be redirected to a login page
35327
i describes the foundation for almost any linux distribution and is officially endorsed by debian and the linux standards base lsb
35333
same goes for using the typedef of the struct
35363
behavior because the xml document doesn t have any mention of bar in it so the deserializer should not even be attempting to set it
35409
the second since it basically says that for given z and first-order property p you can construct x z p x but to generate the russell set you would need z v the class of all sets which is not a set cannot be generated from any of the given axioms
35417
because you ve already made a typedef for the struct because you used the s1 version you should write
35419
for reference the unixutils i downloaded was dated march 1 2007 and uses gnu sed version 3.02 my cygwin install has gnu sed version 4.1.5

the below code is my comet js file that contains the general concepts required to get a party chat setup
35599
i have heard that in a unix system the number of files in a given directory will not slow file access while on windows direct file access will degrade as the # of files increase in the given folder true
35634
is there a ruby equivalent for python s is
35636
the only thing that changes this is if a property has a getter and or setter attribute specified
35647
both approaches are equally valid depending on your comfort in programming in c# vb.net or vba
35676
subversion is complicated to set up -- if you have no experience with version control at all i d recommend using a distributed vcs because they don t require any server configuration
35683
while nifty the revision keyword trick only updates the file when it s changed in that revision - if you don t change the file then it will continue to reflect the old revision
35683
if you want the software to always reflect the overall revision number then you ll have to delve into the relevant svn entries file and extract it which isn t too difficult it s an xml file
35704
however if you re looking for true multi-platform deployment you should probably switch to a language like java or python that s capable of running the same program on multiple systems with little or no change
35704
if your concern is in how to write apps that can be moved from machine to machine without losing settings you should probably write all your configuration to a file in the same directory as the executable and not touch the windows registry or create any dot directories in the home folder of the user that s running the program on linux or mac
35746
meanwhile linkedin created a facebook app using rails that is handling 1b page views month
35753
right now i m developing mostly in c c++ but i wrote some small utilities in python to automatize some tasks and i really love it as language especially the productivity
35758
you can sort of imagine this getting nasty in c# or c++ but in haskell ml and ocaml this is central to the language design and syntax so coding style supports it in a much more convenient manner via pattern matching
35759
however for some larger python projects i ve tackled i m finding that it s not quite the same as programming in say c++
35762
are frameworks such as kde gnome usable for this objective or is better to use something more generic other than x
35762
i feel like if i chose one of gnome or kde i m closing the market out for a chunk of the linux market who have chosen one over the other
35768
gnome apps work on kde desktops and vice versa
35770
it s also important to make the distinction between gnome libraries and gtk and likewise kde libraries and qt
35776
by writing high-level and significantly slower python code one can optimize the bottlenecks out using c c++ bindings when your application is nearing completion
35776
most graphics libraries in python wxpython are just python wrappers around c++ libraries anyway so you re pretty much writing to a c++ backend
35777
and it is easy to end up with messy code that has methods returning either int or boolean or object or some sort under unknown circumstances
35786
for example the os module basically determines what operating system you re using on import and then adjusts its implementation accordingly by importing another module corresponding to linux osx windows etc.
35831
my command shell could be anything from bash emacs ruby or even quake3
35848
in my vb6.0 application some of the mdi child form s height is 17000 and width is 13000
35848
now i want to set the same form size in vb.net forms but it allows maximum form width 1036 height 780 for resolution 1024x768
35852
i think the vb6 units are not the same with the vb.net one
35867
for persistence.xml specifically you can put a persistence unit in a separate jar which you can deploy separately from your web application war or both together in an ear archive depending on what your application server supports
35908
despite the fact that you probably will not be able to accomplish that without using undocumented apis and or a device driver i do not think that a process should be spelunking around in the handle table of another process just to find out the names of some kernel objects
35911
thanks to the fact it doesn t need to communicate with a central server constantly pretty much every command runs in less than a second obviously git push pull fetch are slower simply because they have to initalise ssh connections
35922
i ve played around with gtk tk wxpython cocoa curses and others
35922
gtk tk wx curses all seem to basically be direct-ports of the appropriate c libraries and cocoa basically mandates using both pyobjc and interface builder both of which i dislike
35925
or if you re using kubuntu kde
35933
in a client-server setting if you care about security you should always program on the assumption that the client may have been compromised
35934
depending on requirements you use the mapped value to point at the result directly or to short list of the candidates which would allow a smaller map but requires greater subsequent processing - you re not in o 1 lookup territory any more
35935
there are were several other attempts to create a very pythonic gui as a layer on top of pygtk or wxpython such as wax and pygui which seem to be stuck at various degrees of being complete
35939
being an admin i really appreciate apps that log to the event log preferably their own otherwise the application log for all logging but trace logs
35939
by logging to the event log you make it much more likely that warnings or errors can be found and addressed by the admin staff before they become a major problem if it is a issue they can address or allows them to get in contact with the devs who can use the trace logs to further troubleshoot the issue
35946
that gave me a min and max lat and a min and max long
35967
if you have spare physical resources and have the technical skills and experience to maintain production machines running different operating systems i d recommend going running lighttpd on either linux or freebsd
35998
if your enumerated values are dense enough you can define an array to hold the strings and just look them up use null for any skipped value and add a special case handler on your lookup routine
36010
one way to separate the mxml and actionscript for a component into separate files is by doing something similar to the asp.net 1.x code behind model
36010
in this model the declarative part the mxml in this case is a subclass of the imperative part the actionscript
36015
by default the data is in json format but other options such as xml are available
36048
you can set up vs.net to break as soon as any exception occurs
36068
i agree with the others -- set a default value of getdate on the lastupdate column and then use a trigger to handle any updates
36080
the c++ spec permits a compiler to be able to see the entire template declaration and definition at the point of instantiation and due to the complexities of any implementation most compilers retain this requirement
36108
and some like the ones i need to use right now the multiline textbox and the listbox seem more worried about just taking the space necessary to fit their contents and no more
36108
a resizable gui would be quite horrible if you had to play with height width minheight minwidth etc
36108
can you bind your height and width properties to the grid cell you occupy
36144
rv 1.9.0.1 gecko 2008070206 firefox 3.0.1
36155
if b were an object rather than an int its constructor and destructor would get called each iteration
36184
if the textbox or listbox is the only docked item without an alignment or if they are the last added they will fill the remaining space as wanted
36197
now i ve got controller methods responsible for multiple logical routes throughout the application - say it checks for which button was clicked on the form and acts accordingly
36219
it seems that lxml does not expose this libxml2 feature grepping the source only turns up some #defines for the error handling
36219
from the catalog implementation in libxml2 page it seems possible that the transparent handling through installation in etc xml catalog may still work in lxml but if you need more than that you can always abandon lxml and use the default python bindings which do expose the catalog functions
36274
say you just use a asp ado recordset and load it with data or ado.net datasource for a gridview
36291
if it doesn t then the property code queries the database and computes it then stores the value in the _total field so that it need not be recomputed the next time it s requested
36307
for example and simplifying slightly when an element is clicked on that element gets the first opportunity to handle the event and then each ancestor in tern until the top level document is reached or one of them explicitly stops the event bubbling any further
36344
this is on a mac 10.4.11 my googling turned up some hints that this can happen if gcc is called instead of g++ but i believe that is set up correctly
36364
java s generics help with type-safety of course
36398
since hbase and hypertable are all about performance being modeled on google s bigtable they sound like they would certainly be much faster than hive at the cost of functionality and a higher learning curve they don t have joins or the sql-like syntax
36447
embedded ruby is just like embedding php into a document and this is an interpreter for that kind of document
36455
older k r 2nd ed. and other c-language texts i have read that discuss the implementation of a dynamic memory allocator in the style of malloc and free usually also mention in passing something about data type alignment restrictions
36470
if you aren t using one the .net based languages there are other tools like doxygen or javadoc that provide comments and functionality similar to xml comments
36498
i m looking for a simple way to do this from a linux terminal likely a bash shell but anything should do and an alternative way to do this on windows
36500
you can also pipe your email in from stdin and it will be sent as the text of an email
36501
to allow the capture of window events keyboard mouse window creating drawing etc
36512
i prefix every public or protected method or property with the following comment structure
36512
having said that i hate xml comments with a vengeance because of the visual clutter of the angle bracket tax and i wish that microsoft had settled for something more along the lines of javadoc or phpdoc
36526
c# java and python have a standard implementation of the iterator pattern
36548
exim qmail and postfix are all popular alternatives that are a bit more modern
36589
it is fairly easy to extend with custom tasks if needed works with both nant and msbuild out of the box and is very actively maintained
36642
i like the clean urls that mvc tends to have but use asp.net webforms for my primary development
36695
the static bit holds all the property metadata - its default value its owner type handy if it s an attached property etc its callback methods for when it changes - that sort of thing
36709
is there a good yacc bison type lalr parser generator for .net
36718
the javaworld article why getter and setter methods are evil article also might be of interest to you in thinking about when not to implement accessor and mutator methods
36734
other jvm languages like groovy scala etc do support this feature now
36761
i think wxpython is nice but it s too limited and pyqt is well qt
36778
after hours of debugging it appears to me that in firefox the innerhtml of a dom reflects what is actually in the markup but in ie the innerhtml reflects what s in the markup plus any changes made by the user or dynamically via javascript
36816
my point being in conversations with colleagues since i have several times pointed out that their use of reflection could be to autogenerate code to compile rather than perform runtime operations and this is often worth considering
36832
i think everyone who encountered for the first time was surprised but on second thought it makes sense if the derived constructor hasn t yet run the object is not yet a derived so how can a derived function be called
36856
i haven t settled on an ide but if i m not using gedit i ll use emacs as my editor
36873
the reason why you should supply a default value for any dp you register is because wpf will take care not to allocate extra memory for your property when it s set to its default value no matter how many objects containing that property you create
36931
if you want to display some kind of asynchronous communication between two different users say from two different sessions without a lot of refreshing like chat you can have the ajax page constantly poll the database for new messages and display them when they come in
36935
there are a number of other arguments you can also pass to override default behaviors
36945
however scheme common lisp and many other languages have what s called lexical scoping - in addition to storing the operation + x y we also store the namespace at that particular point
36964
i m sure you don t need to add all paths listed there but probably some in order to make it run
36972
i remember doing this as a first-year undergraduate exercise - i think we wrote the simulator in c++ and simulated 6800 assembly but really any language instruction set will do
36972
modern processors are stuffed full of features designed to be used by compilers to help optimise code for speed concurrent execution power consumption etc. and trying to write assembly by hand for a modern processor would be a nightmare
37024
also some tools some o r mappers expect object data to be represented by properties and do not recognize public or protected member variables
37041
the features provided by the xmms2 daemon are things like track searching meta-data retrieval and manipulation change playback state load playlists and so on and so forth
37048
there are no gdi+ system.drawing or wpf system.windows.media.imaging libraries available in silverlight
37071
this introduction to oracle advanced queuing states that you can interface to it through internet access using http https and smtp so it should be straightforward to do that using a perl script
37103
i have a container div with a fixed width and height with overflow hidden
37114
modern browsers also support png and gif images
37132
firstly you can - and should - use a revision control system most will handle binary files although unlike text files you can t merge two different set of changes so you may want to set the system up to lock these files whilst they are being changed assuming that that s not the default mode of operation for you rcs in the first place
37134
the only way i can think of doing this is by doing something like alert you have a new message when the message is received
37142
even though python and ruby have one kernel thread per interpreter thread they have a global interpreter lock gil that is used to protect potentially shared data structures so this inhibits multi-processor execution
37204
lots of documentation and very easy to set up nunit ncover fxcop etc
37227
we use cruisecontrol.net with both nant and msbuild for our build server
37235
for example on the solaris operating system this directory is var opt oracle
37267
by replacing the command pick with the command edit you can tell git-rebase to stop after applying that commit so that you can edit the files and or the commit message amend the commit and continue rebasing
37278
xml serialization deserialization largely without coding
37283
you could change the title of the web page with each new message to alert the user
37343
i have my wordpress install and mediawiki sharing the same login information
37343
what i would like to do is cause a successful log in on the wordpress blog to also cause a log in for mediawiki ideally both directions
37355
be careful using hibernate if you re working with a small persistence problem
37364
you don t need to call getimagesize to get the width height for imagecopyresmapled
37391
what i m trying to do though is create a class that could represent an arbitrarily large binary number and be able to perform simple arithmetic operations on two of them add subtract multiply divide
37400
i d recommend basing your system on debian - the apt system has become the de-facto way to quickly install and update programs on linux
37400
ubuntu is debian based with an emphasis on usability and compatibility
37400
if it were my decision i would set up a pxe boot server to easily install ubuntu server edition to any computer on the network
37409
if a different answer is given later it should expose another set of sub-questions if any related to that answer
37409
when a parent question s answer changed it would raise an event to the children questions and they would automatically show hide their rows in the grid according to the parent s answer
37410
it s debian based and is the first linux distro i have tried that actually worked with my laptop on first install
37415
it s based on ubuntu debian and optimized for small footprint with the xfce desktop environment
37425
i want to use perfmon not a tool like ants profiler etc but how do i accurately interpret the observations
37443
sqlite just picks the first non-null integer mysql requires auto increment postgresql uses sequences etc
37450
the primary problem you are going to run into is that you ll have two login forms and two logout methods
37450
i ve been able to successfully integrate bbpress + mediawiki + wordpress + wordpress mu but i wrote a lot of custom code to do it
37450
i m using the bbpress login page as the default and .htaccess rewrite to login and then i created my own mediawiki authentication plugin which looks a lot like the one you are using except my plugin checks the wordpress bbpress cookie for the login information and automatically logs the user in
37450
then the last step was to redirect all of the other logout login links for bbpress mediawiki etc over to my consolidated one
37500
basically this detects the presence of silverlight and if its available it records the version as the value of the user-defined field
37602
fantastic for batch converting images including ico to png
37606
when you need to change the logic of the queue to not fifo but something like the oldest red message or the oldest blue message you can t do it
37614
i also tried connecting with https or http using the server name and the project name
37624
a byte is at least large enough to contain any member of the basic execution character set and is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits the number of which is implementation-defined
37632
reflection is then the ability to make modifications at runtime by making use of introspection
37634
reflection is a set of functions which allows you to access the runtime information of your program and modify it behavior with some limitations
37636
the project i m currently on required a lot of argument to get the older programmers to use xml schemas data sets instead of just csv files the previous version of the software used csv s
37638
reflection is important since it lets you write programs that do not have to know everything at compile time making them more dynamic since they can be tied together at runtime
37658
open ico bmp png psd exe dll icl convert into ico bmp png icl
37660
update table set x y y x will do precisely what you want edit in postgresql not mysql see below
37675
lots of documentation and very easy to set up nunit ncover fxcop etc
37683
you can communicate with the backend process by way of stdin stdout stderr
37715
use dia for windows and dia vdx plug-in to convert visio xml into dia
37716
random bit strings are obtained by taking a md5 hash of the contents of this pool
37740
use visual studio or xsd.exe to generate dataset or classes from xsd then use system.xml.serialization.xmlserializer if needed to turn your xml into objects dataset
37751
google has an ico to png converter i saw it on reddit the other day
37756
however it is often the case that the view and data are very tightly linked with both part dictating how the other should be eg in a simple e-commerce site you may decide you want to start showing stock levels next to each product which would obviously involve changing the view to add appropriate html for this and the business logic to go and figure out a value for the stock
37764
i m customizing a sugarcrm 5 and in my sugarcrm database i have all invoices which were imported from our erp
37774
text based languages python ruby basic c# or even c are dependent on external libraries and tools editors compilers while something like alice or scratch is all inclusive and will teach kids not aimed at teens programming concepts
37804
first off if you re unaware samba or smb windows file sharing computer share etc
37804
the computers used to access this website are a mixture of windows xp and linux ubuntu with a mixture of browsers opera and firefox
37804
it doesn t work in firefox or opera firefox does nothing opera complains the url is invalid
37804
i don t have a windows box handy atm so i m unsure if computer share works in anything apart from ie firefox opera
37846
you set up a dfs root and tell it about all the other smb samba shares you have in your environment
37851
oh and as an added complication it should be able to run on a solaris 10 or linux box without installing any new binaries
37851
on the boxes i ve seen recently that means shell scripts and perl but not python
37852
xml or json files on disk
37854
oracle goes way back and i m not sure where mysql came in
37858
excel files can be useful too particularly if users need to be able to manipulate the data in a familiar environment and building a full application to do that isn t feasible
37862
however since random numbers from a given generator are deterministically in a known sequence your procedure might be exposed by someone searching through the generator and finding an aligning sequence
37934
try jprofiler or netbeans profiler
37973
i find that a little annoying to use because they need a few more clicks or keypresses to get to but at least you can get the job done they tend to put things like input masks in here - regex numerical etc
37973
one think that took a bit of getting used to is with the xtragrid and treelist which if you want to do some custom display for specific cells you have to hook up an event that fires before the cell is displayed
37973
edit one thing i meant to add is that dev express are rolling out silverlight and wpf controls too
37973
currently they have a silverlight datagrid a wpf datagrid and wpf charts but they re doing more eventually
37985
after that the progression went to macros in ms office followed by basic vba followed by visual basic
38000
gitty will essentially be bazzarx with the bazaar backend ripped out and a git backend put in instead and any ui tweaks made for git differences from bazaar ie hashes instead of version# s etc
38001
i m not sure i d store anything like json or xml unless you had significant relationship requirements
38017
ffmpeg more precisely libavcodec and libavformat that comes with ffmpeg open- source multimedia utility
38017
the default framework for win32 opencv is using vfw and thus able only to open some avi files if you want to use the others you must download the cvs instead of the official release and still do some hacking on the code and it s anyway not too complete for example ffmpeg backend doesn t allow to seek in the stream
38083
flinn has a post about why it is not possible in php because in ruby everything is an object
38097
this is more of a how-to-implement tip but i started dabbling with creating an activerecord datamapper implementation in php and quickly ran into many hurdles with array-like access
38097
eventually i found the spl extensions to php and particularly arrayobject and arrayiterator
38114
you can use asp.net s healthmonitoring configuration section to configure .net to send all asp.net-related events directly to a sql database
38135
i cannot afford to build my next project in wpf it will cost me a lot more to do it in manpower and time with nothing to show for in return
38160
do-something is cpu bound and i have a nice shiny 4 core processor
38209
the traditional unix linux way would be to write the pid to a file typically in var run and check to see if that file exists on startup
38238
i m teaching myself python and my most recent lesson was that python is not java and so i ve just spent a while turning all my class methods into functions
38258
i d suspect gnome kde etc
38266
use almost anything tcl tk used to be big and i ve been seeing more perl tk and python tk lately including a number of packages that exist mostly inside the particle physics community
38276
the most interesting thing about them is that they can be overridden by subclasses something that s simply not possible in java s static methods or python s module-level functions
38287
it would be different if python used private and protected members more like java does
38302
the objects in the scenes which the ray-tracer renders are stored in a kdtree structure and the tree s nodes are in turn stored in an array
38302
the optimization i m having problems with is while trying to fit as many tree nodes as possible into a cache line
38302
the nodes are structs and during tree construction they are succesfully put into the array by a static memory manager class
38332
vmware virtual machines are portable across different vmware products although you may need to use their converter tool to go from some hosted virtual machines to esx or esxi
38335
things are in category a if they are in b but not in c nodes connected to nodes in z are also in z every category in m is connected to a node n and has child categories also in m for every node connected to n
38336
because linux and its variants have a completely different set of fonts than windows and mac os x is there anyone with any experience of creating cross-platform font families - ideally finding equivalents to the common fonts found on the aforementioned operating systems
38345
haskell has zip in the prelude and perl 6 has a zip operator built in but how do you do it in an elegant way in perl 5
38346
if you re having problems like ora-12519 tns no appropriate service handler found or ora-12560 tns protocol adapter error from time to time then try to change your processes parameter logon to oracle using sys as sysdba and execute the following
38384
i guess they put compatability first and are now trying to get the performance up to par with other ruby implementations out there
38386
so my guess is that you have checked out an svn+ssh checkout not an svn or http or https checkout
38386
iirc all the options you re trying only work for the svn http https checkouts
38392
as microsoft has at some point made the core fonts available for redistribution many unix linux systems do have those fonts available
38426
they all come bundled with osx and i m reasonably sure they ll work or have near-identical variants on most any linux distro
38445
since i expect that all nodes for a single tree are stored in the same array you won t need a separate reference to the array
38445
the basic lesson here is that unsafe pointers and managed memory do not mix outside of fixed blocks which of course have stack frame affinity when the function returns the pinned behaviour goes away
38449
at the basic database level you can track changes by having a separate table that gets an entry added to it via triggers on insert update delete statements
38470
in the distant past before i started working for codegear i gave up on the odd delphi-ized idl language that the ide presented and wrote my own idl and compiled it using ms midl
38497
for example an nserror in the cocoa domain that you get from a method in the foundation framework will have its code property described in the header
38543
there are layers on top of it like audio toolbox audio queue services quicktime and qtkit that you can use if you want a simplified api for common tasks
38556

there is also ncache as another tool in addition to velocity and memcached ports
38575
here s a small script i wrote for finding the total numbers of occurrence for different source code elements in actionscript 3 code this is written in python simply because i m familiar with it while perl would probably be better suited for a regex-heavy script like this

the application can be written in perl vb6 vb.net or c# but must be easily scheduled from a windows based server
38809
graeme s suggestion of custom malloc free is a good idea
38809
for example if it is always in a block of the same size say 64 bytes then change your malloc free pair to always allocate 64 byte chunks in their own page
38839
common lisp code can be converted into scheme code with relative ease
38839

tallpdf.net comes with a hefty price tag allows you to serve dynamic pdf from any .net application including asp.net pages and web services
39148
the owasp guide to building secure web applications and web services should be compulsory reading for any web developer that wishes to take security seriously which should be all web developers
39158
i then wrote a handler for the selectionchanged event that checked the state of the shift control keys to determine if the selected node was being added to removed from the selection or creating a new selection
39158
there was also a of the nodes that were currently selected to eliminate any tree searches
39160
using xhtml makes automated error detection easy every change can be automatically checked for invalid markup
39161
and the staging table has all the errors that you can export and report out
39169
add that code to the complile item group of a csproj file then replace the paths with your actual paths to the resx files and you sould be able to open them
39175
the traditional secure replacement for ftp is sftp but if you have enough control over both endpoints you might consider rsync instead it is highly configurable secure just by telling it to use ssh and far more efficient for keeping two locations in sync
39189
if you want to look at ftp servers that can also do ftp-ssl which is not the same as sftp good ftp servers like pure-ftpd or vsftp will do that
39228
i needed more advanced stuff like stdout and stderr so i used the open4 gem
39232
or you can just use notepad or notepad++

monodevelop - link text this is based on sharpdevelop 0.9 if i remember it correctly
39267
the container itself is allocated where you decide it can be the stack the heap an object s member etc but the memory it uses is by default as others described taken on the free store managed through new and delete which is not the same as the heap managed through malloc free
39282
usually flex is more suited for application that need a lot of access to data but for simple things in flash you should use some xml data sources and write the xml source yourself in something like php asp python perl etc
39300
we use the recordid field to store the value of the key field of the table being updated
39316
you can then add remove case statements from the order by clause to improve the list based on your data

this is a blunt tool - meaning you can check parse the value to make sure a date field contains a date
39441
actually on 32-bit computers a word is 32-bit but the dword type is a leftover from the good old days of 16-bit
39496
in earlier versions you had to create your own ienumerable and ienumerator objects to do stuff like this
39503
also you can write to the bootsector at least as administrator on xp by call createfile with the device name of the drive that contains the mbr
39503
also you can write to this drive by simply calling writefile and passing the handle of the device created by calling createfile
39525
it all needs to be cross-platform linux windows osx

i guess there are more or less easy ways to identify specific vm systems especially if the vm has the provider s extensions installed such as for virtualbox or vmware
39536
i have a fairly small mysql database a textpattern install on a server that i do not have ssh access to i have ftp access only
39564
in my host i currently have installed 2 wordpress applications 1 phpbb forum and one mediawiki
39573
tools - options - text editor - c# - formatting - new lines - new line options for braces - uncheck all boxes
39576
the following works in mysql but doesn t seem to be supported in oracle
39579
so your first opportunity to explore recursion is to code that horizontal computation as the width parameter increases for height of zero
39595
in the mediawiki file localsettings.php you can tell it to use a different wordpress database for authentication
39597
have matlab with simulink
39601
i can t quite remember but i believe that i big problem i had was that mediawiki requires usernames formatted a certain that conflicted with phpbb
39607
otherwise you can list a bunch of single row insert statements and submit several queries in bulk to save the time for something that works in both oracle and mysql
39607
espo s solution is also a good one that will work in both oracle and mysql if your data isn t already in a table
39608
i once did a phpbb mediawiki login integration from the phpbb end
39609
quick and dirty cron to restart your daemon
39614
in the scenario you posted you re using control arrays to pair a button up with a textbox
39614
the custom control would consist of a button a textbox and maybe a shared static timer
39614
you also don t have to worry about making sure the command button index matches up with the textbox index
39615
i don t have any way to list the set of base filenames other than to search for .in or .out for example
39616
i like tools that will perform more than one task notepad++ is a great notepad replacement and has a document monitor plugin installs with standard msi that works great
39640
i ve also used a mediawiki extension for phpbb integration
39659
also note where possible it s probably advisable to use pkg_resources.resource_stream or pkg_resources.resource_string because if the package is part of an egg resource_filename will copy the file to a temporary directory
39666
if the collection is protected or public then a client of your class can take its own lock on your syncroot potentially deadlocking with code in your class
39723
i liked javascript the good parts by douglas crockford although it s focused entirely on the language and ignores the dom altogether
39748
there are also cases where you can t acheive certain document structures with nested types - an example of this is using two complextypes in a sequence that can contain 0 to unbounded instances of each type in any mixed order
39858
note this has become a popular answer but it is important to point out that if y has any non-string keys the fact that this works at all is an abuse of a cpython implementation detail and it does not work in python 3 or in pypy ironpython or jython
39867
if i run this as cron job works fine i see encrypting file in the log but the file doesn t get encrypted and gpg silent fails with no stdout stderr output
39868
it may be best to subclass jdialog so that you can just add the doannimation logic to the setvisible .. or show method before calling the superclass implementation
39916
is there a programmatic way to build htpasswd files without depending on os specific functions exec passthru
39917
redirect the stderr to stdout for gpg and then redirect stdout to a file to inspect any error messages which might get printed you can do this a command line
39918
it takes any object as a parameter and uses the java reflection api print out every field name and value
39945
to get right unless you put in extra restrictions like using only immutable data
39963
that s the login a colon apr1 the salt and 1000 times md5 encoded as base64
40003
svn will internally create a pointer to the source location at that revision
40025
for example if you are writing an open source web application chances are that you need to support mysql and postgresql at least if not mssql and oracle
40034
i haven t tried it myself but huagati dbml edmx tools is recommended by other people
40034
huagati dbml edmx tools is an add-in
40090
is it true that the only way to handle default function arguments is through function overloading
40095
default arguments are part of c++ but as of c# 3.5 default arguments are still not supported-- you ll have to overload
40122
my group is developing a service-based .net wcf application and we re trying to decide how to handle exceptions in our internal services
40238
the most common but nonetheless incorrect answer to the question posed at the top is that mutexes and semaphores are very similar with the only significant difference being that semaphores can count higher than one
40259
is there any ui library that can be to build both a text user interface ncurses and graphical user interface gtk
40284
just use default arguments
40284
in a language that supports default method arguments php for example you could do this in the method signature
40289
then make getter and setter functions for each property so that the default values could be changed
40311
i added a custom install action to my installer to add one of my installation directories to the system path environment variable
40328
says that for system environment variables which path is one of requires a restart although i have a feeling that logging off and on may be enough
40344
however this is slow for very large tables and sorting and filtering is cumbersome
40344
opening a large table is much faster this way and access has easy-to-use right-click filtering and sorting
40367
replacing tools that quickly in a live environment is all too likely to result in lengthy and confusing downtime if anything goes wrong in writing and building the tools--especially when subtle cross-platform issues creep in
40378
it can export to xml or csv files that can be imported in another browser or computer
40410
a semaphore is an object containing a natural number a integer greater or equal to zero on which two modifying operations are defined
40439
this exports to xml or csv format
40499
for primitive arguments int long etc. the pass by value is the actual value of the primitive for example 3
40509
since you only ever need to check cells that are occupied or adjacent to an occupied cell perhaps you could keep a buffer of all such cells updating it at each step as you process each cell
40526
there are some super-fast implementations that from memory represent cells of 8 or more adjacent squares as bit patterns and use that as an index into a large array of precalculated values to determine in a single machine instruction if a cell is live or dead
40548
also note that hashtable extends the dictionary class which as the javadocs state is obsolete and has been replaced by the map interface
40564
instead of iterating through the entire cell grid each time keep a copy of all the cells that you change
40630
in general java has primitive types int bool char double etc that are passed directly by value
40663
i m trying to find a way to validate a large xml file against an xsd
40678
instead of using a domparser use a saxparser
40705
maybe some distribution utility is required to prevent the manual tweaks
40726
you can certainly create restful web services in asp.net 2.0 for example but there are no high-level apis to do all the donkey work for you as provided by wcf in .net 3.5
40757
unlike lisp or perl or ruby c cannot preserve elements of a stack frame once you exited that frame
40782
use this if var is not a string already
40782
this is the same as string var in c#
40782
this is the same as var as string in c#
40783
however just as arabic hebrew etc right-to-left language users will expect left-to-right progression in some contexts embedded english fragments and so on there are situations even on the web where top-to-bottom layout is preferred
40785
you can reduce the problem of needing the user to accept macros each time by digitaly signing the template in vba ide tools | digital signature... and select a digital certificate however you will need to get a certificate from a commercial certification authority see
40852
i think when it comes to excel .net development vb.net is the way to go especially if you re not that familiar with the object model you can record vba in excel and easily convert it to vb.net instead of poring through the lackluster documentation
40863
so basically have you rethought the design of your business apps as you move to web wpf silverlight designs because for us at least - in winforms we kept things fairly functional and uniform or are you trying to keep that known ui
40865
unfortunately the constructor does not take a securestring or a credential object
40894
hashmap an implementation of the map interface that uses hash codes to index an array
40923
i have a framework written in perl that sets a bunch of environment variables to support interprocess typically it is sub process communication
40934
i recall there being a scheme or lisp too
40940
ticketdesk is an asp.net web application written in c# targeting the .net 3.5 framework
40945
the correct type to use in this situation is application octet-stream and using anything else is merely relying on the fact that clients are supposed to ignore unrecognised mime types and use application octet-stream instead reference sections 4.1.4 and 4.5.1 of rfc 2046
40964
in any case you should never rely on something like that even more so if you are asking your users to set up the variables just imagine how much aggravation and confusion a simple misspelt variable would produce
40966
i have a javascript function that manipulates the dom when it is called adds css classes etc
40967
which can interpret and run javascript and one presumes other scripting languages such as groovy interactively sort of like the python shell or irb in ruby
41033
this way any code contained in external classes can be isolated from the options themselves -- no need to worry about the naming of the variables in the main routine from within the thingy class if your options are set with a attr_writer or thingy.process true call
41069
here the first argument is the window that owns the dialog box the second is the title of the window and the third is the default path to start at you need the at the end otherwise it ll start a directory higher with the user s home folder selected
41160
if it s something to do with your rubygems or the net rather than mysql specifically then the gem update --system should reveal it too
41228
later edit note that standard encryption algorithms from the same category for example 3des and aes - both being symmetric block cyphers are of comparable strength
41283
if you absolutely can t rename the folder because other software depends on it another technique is to go ahead and rename the directory to end in .noindex but then create a symlink in the same location pointing to the real location using the original name
41396
i didn t actually understand your question completely but i store my connection settings in a configuration files usually one for each environment like dev production etc
41411
refers to past vbulletin and phpmyadmin exploits which were caused by improper eval usage
41446
although i usually prefer to use rest services with json or xml there are some tools i am currently integrating that works only using soap
41447
you can submit your site to search engines using their site submission forms - this will get you into their system
41448
concretely to solve the problem of word query similarity i have had good results with using edit distance a mathematical measure of string similarity that works surprisingly well
41454
even iterating over a hashtable s entries or a hashmap obtained by collections.synchronizedmap is not thread safe unless you also guard the map from being modified through additional synchronization
41459
reflection like you re thinking about -- fully descriptive metadata available at runtime -- just doesn t exist for c++ by default
41479
this is no better than the equivilent foreach var item in somelist .
41479
there is a real concern about type safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded method that accepted ienumerable int and ienumerable double the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type
41486
i have no problem using var in a foreach statement provided it s not like this
41499
the problem i hit is that i added a new static field that was initialized with a system property value getproperty
41502
considering just parsers and ignoring the question of whether they perform validation there are two main flavors tree-based think dom and streaming event-based think sax push and stax pull
41502
tree-based parsers are generally considered easier to use although stax has been heralded as a huge improvement in ease-of-use over sax
41514
var takes this much further true but i think that the argument remains the same from a readability point of view the programmer shouldn t actually be interested in the type of the variable but rather in what a variable does
41515
if i read the spec correctly the automatic serialversionuid shouldn t change if you change the value of a static of transient field
41521
one is the usual click button and the other is a toggle button that acts similar to a checkbox
41524
it will be duplicated for each branch tag in your revision control system remember in most svn system copies are cheap
41533
they also provide a free and open source java client for geonames webservices library library for other language also provided ruby python perl lisp...
41541
however i m not entirely sure that the bmp file format supports transparency - so you would have to save the file as perhaps a png file instead
41545
there are quite a few vi clones vim and also various emacs implementations gnu emacs vs
41547
i have imagined a very simple authentication mechanism where people just enter their email address and gets sent a unique login url that sets a cookie that will always identify them for future requests
41589
in .net threadpool threads won t return without setting up manualresetevent s or autoresetevent s
41632
if we cannot be sure about the correctness of the input set sorting and counting or using a hashtable counting occurances with the integer itself being the hash key would both be feasible
41634
that isn t quite true - if a method is overloaded to both ienumerable int and ienumerable double then it may silently pass the unexpected inferred type due to some other change in the program to the wrong overload hence causing incorrect behaviour
41643
the os is a several-year old 32-bit fedora distro not possible to upgradable to 64bit for the foreseeable future
41660
there are often already many binary functions like + min max concatenation and in my case make_and and make_or
41665
is there any way to convert a bmp image to jpg png without losing the quality in c#
41668
imagemagick can manipulate about anything and has interfaces for a dozen of languages including the magick++ api for c++
41676
i am using the carbon framework but not cocoa
41682
i ve used c++ namespaces the same way i do in c# perl etc
41726
asp.net webforms is a completely different abstraction over the base framework than asp.net mvc
41726
with mvc you ve got more control over what happens under the covers than with asp.net webforms
41774
right click on the trunk folder and choose either checkout if you want to update from svn later or export if you just want your own copy of that revision
41804
and lock this object in the constructor
41805
re lex yacc bison
41820
make the constructor private
41847
nvl replaces isnull
41931
i ve used simple sine wave generators mixed together with some phase and amplitude noise thrown in to get signals that sound and look interesting to humans when put through speakers or lights but i don t know what you mean by interesting
41951
you can add pointers to the elements of the array to a tlist then call tlist.sort with a comparison function and finally create a new array and copy the values out of the tlist in the desired order
41961
in a sense constructors can be considered to be thread safe because the reference to the object being constructed is not visible until the constructor has completed but this doesn t do any good for protecting a static variable
41969
what about unix linux
41969
is there a standard way to do this or do i have to special case gnome kde etc and manually run the appropriate application nautilus konqueror etc
41986
don t be put off by the in java part if you don t know java as the concepts and their implementation are well enough explained that you get the gist without needing a detailed understanding of java
41999
there might be an function that launches the defaults for kde or gnome in their respective toolkits but i haven t had reason to look for them
42007
the synchronization is going to be a little messy perhaps but it can be simplified if each app has its own framebuffer and the sync program points the video controller to the correct framebuffer inbetween frames when switching to the next app
42021
and the package includes three implementations python ruby and javascript
42025
levenshtein distance looks at two values and produces a value based on their similarity
42039
i know gnome does and it s important to do this in kde since there are two possible file managers konqueror dolphin that may be in use
42047
i would suggest using metaphone not soundex
42126
i don t see any defines in odbcss.h that i could set to avoid this
42144
i believe that you can also select the xsd with the data definition for your xml file
42225
the down side is it may increase overhead for all other network traffic that wants only a few kb for a network packet but is now forced to send recv in 64kb packets
42246
the question is how to get just the updated files out of subversion so that they can be physically transported through the firewall and put on the deployment server
42283
you can use .net codedom to generate code to execute and use the web service described by the wsdl
42300
you could try playing around with the svnadmin dump command that ships with the subversion binaries
42314
you will then need to add a padding or margin to the bottom of your #sidebar and #content to match the height of #footer or when they overlap the #footer will cover them
42315
you could use position absolute following to put the footer at the bottom of the page but then make sure your 2 columns have the appropriate margin-bottom so that they never get occluded by the footer
42329
i tend to give the label a fixed width or display it on the line above
42383
and since it is immutable if i make a change to a node on the n th level of the tree i need to allocate at least n new nodes in order to return the new tree
42383
my question is would it be dramatically faster to pre-allocate nodes rather than create new ones every time the tree is modified
42405
understand for c++ should be able to help you it builds a database that you can access from perl
42470
i d just use commons io then you could just do an ioutils.copy inputstream outputstream
42499
i m stuck with asp.net ajax 1.0 and .net 3.0 if that makes a difference
42507
could you write an svn hook script that uses some method maybe scp or ftp to send the files over to the remote location at the time they re committed
42513
if you have access to gcc g++ then the -m option will output the dependency list
42536
i d also add a protected constructor to myclass to prevent the compiler from generating a public default constructor
42537
the structure of the dom tree resides in the nodes itself having a node pointing to its children
42537
you have an immutable tree that is basically a set of nodes pointing to its children
42552
also if the jms broker supports jmx like activemq does you can use jconsole to post message and do a lot more
42558
it seems impossible to declare the constructor private or protected as is normally done with the singleton pattern.
42582
the default aspx view engine seems to make the most sense to me coming from an asp.net webforms background
42583
if your exe happens to be a console app you might be interested in reading the stdout and stderr -- for that i ll humbly refer you to this example
42610
i am looking for a powerful meta-language to describa behaviour for an application i intend to use in offline mode google-gears + javascript and server side sqlite + php ruby java etc and looking for a good format to describe the model s behaviour which can be easily converted to the target languages
42672
what would be the best way to do an scp or sftp copy in a unix environment using c
42681
for example we use a third party sqlite dll which actually contains native code in it which we have to swap out if we want to run on osx linux
42690
any opinions on which of the two iron ruby or iron python would be more useful in the long run
42697
i would personally learn ironruby because i prefer the way ruby works over python and since it s one of the same then choose which language you prefer
42698
while john sheehan s approach works you run into the jquery fadein fadeout cleartype glitch in ie7
42701
i don t see them on my default install of osx but it does exist on my freebsd build server
42702
without getting into the relative merits of the languages which would be an entire pissing contest in itself ironpython stable 1.1.1 beta 2.0 is further along in development than ironruby alpha
42724
also if it s okay to let someone else do the distributing for you google appengine and amazon simpledb are extremely cheap distributed database services though they re both in beta right now so strict limitations are imposed
42743
wcf is microsoft s new .net do-all extensible communications framework meant to replace functionality previously available in dcom .net remoting and asmx web services
42747
i would recommend you take a look at nant + nunit + ncover + teamcity with svn for your build system
42782
i m one of the people who regularly compiles nunit on mono on linux or osx
42801
ie8 seems to me to be more of the same from microsoft who just can t seem to grasp the ui goodness and overall speed of safari firefox and now chrome
42802
wm_lbuttondown would be a mouse click what i want is a button click button as in a hwnd button not a mouse button
42839
i have used a combination of cruise control.net nant and msbuild to compile and swap out configuration files for specific environments and copy the files to a build output directory
42843
to do this i try to find layers of usefulness and add subtract from the layers until it seems clean
42854
you can then set this function as a handler for onload and onresize events
42888
you have an immutable tree that is basically a set of nodes pointing to its children
42888
if you choose to implement the tree as a set of nodes pointing to the children then you would have to create new nodes along the path of the changed node to the root
42888
so you need to create a partial new tree which usually would mean depth of edited node parent nodes
42888
an xpath style api might be better than a dom api in that case - it might you decouple the nodes from the tree a bit more and treat the mutated tree more intelligently
42902
you can use sqlite mysql postgresql or any other dbms with a c language binding
42918
editor s note the above works with gnu readlink and freebsd pc-bsd openbsd readlink but not on os x as of 10.11
42924
products like oracle ms sql server and mysql are vast ecosystems that rarely cross-pollinate in practice
42924
at my workplace we use oracle and mysql but we could probably switch over to 100 oracle in about a day if needed or desired
42924
so i care a lot about the shiny toys oracle gives us with each release but i don t even know what version of mysql we are using
42941
sorted or hashed collections could be used to improve the lookup time of the contains call though it should not make much difference for a moderate number of items
42949
languages like python and php let you develop in less time and get a functional codebase faster most of the time
42951
dynamic languages are generally less verbose and more readable have you ever looked at a given algorithm or program implemented in a static language then compared it to the ruby or python equivalent
42955
there s the scala interpreter the ghci and hugs interpreters for haskell and of course sql has been both statically typed and interpreted for longer than i ve been alive
42957
for example if you design a door well you should never have to add labels that say push and pull. if you want them to pull put a handle
42961
python s list comprehensions ruby s closures and javascript s prototyped objects are all very appealing facets of those languages
42984
i ve got it down to my proxy interferring but i can t see any advanced settings or anything i can set up to go through my proxy to get to my service
42998
from the ide this can be set from the property page of any cpp file
43037
if your core requirement is a data-interchange format lighter than xml then you might want to consider using json instead of yaml
43043
i am way more productive in python than in c or java and not just because you have to do the edit-compile-link-run dance
43043
hell i d rather code in scheme or prolog than php
43111
and each category can have any number of sub categories and each of those sub categories can have any number of sub categories and so and and so forth
43112
i have not used birt or jgraph however i use jfreechart in my swt application
43112
i have found the best way to use jfreechart in swt is by making a composite an awt frame and using the awt functionality for jfreechart
43112
gilbert does not know swt well and it is made for awt
43112
my two biggest problems are as awt events bubble up through swt there are some erroneous events fired and due to wrapping the awt frame jfreechart becomes substantially slower
43117
for me the advantage of dynamic languages is how much more readable the code becomes due to less code and functional techniques like ruby s block and python s list comprehension
43122
this should also work in unix linux
43157
i was surprised to find today that i couldn t track down any simple way to write the contents of an inputstream to an outputstream in java
43157
so given an inputstream in and an outputstream out is there a simpler way to write the following
43161
service handler
43180
i know lots of people will probably recommend i look at linux or bsd
43209
a closer equivelent to haskell would be python
43244
on further reflection i ve realised that in my xpc system i get a compilation warning telling me that the blocks i m using don t support sample time changes during runtime
43267
i m interested in making console apps like vim or emacs
43267
well not exactly like vim or emacs but one that takes over the entire command prompt while it is in use and then after you exit it leaves no trace behind
43320
i know i need to use commit when i have a transaction or a unit of work with several creates updates deletes so that i can choose to rollback if an error occurs
43321
the default shell in mac os x is bash which i m generally happy to be using
43321
give two good reasons to respectively stick to bash and switch to zsh
43331
that said objective-c and swift really are not too scary.
43332
the is to redirect stdout to stdin for the pipe sequence as a whole it redirects the output of p n-1 to the input of p0
43356
then you can feed that into a hidden field maybe and then access that value through yui
43360
you could chuck file redirection onto either the command shown or the actual command in the crontab for both stdout and stderr - like
43368
with web application framework i mean products project such as pyhons django turbogears web2py etc
43470
i have a wordpress and a mediawiki installation on the same server and they are both authenticating against the same active directory just fine
43472
if you append a span containing ellipses to the end of each query a simple logical test in javascript with a bit of css manipulation could be used to hide show them as needed
43497
there is turbo delphi pascal based or turbo c++ both free editions
43503
is there a way to detect if a flash movie contains any sound or is playing any music
43544
you can use panels with automatic layout such as flowlayoutpanel and tablelayoutpanel
43548
+1 for visualsvn being better than ankhsvn having tried both and +1 for the fogbugz add-in
43557
as developers will extend these classes with extra partial files they couldn t use abstract methods here
43557
if you don t extend these methods they get optimised right out
43623
this will be where you put your custom logic for creating the controller based on the route since you will have multiple controllers with the same name but in different folders
43623
then you will need to register your custom controller factory in the application startup just like your routes
43632
the big ones that i was wondering about perl php .net all support inline mode changes
43643
given the code bellow how do i style the radio buttons to be next to the labels and style the label of the selected radio button differently than the other labels
43658
i was able to create a minimal livecd and edit the boot sequence so that it booted directly into the firmware updater instead of a bash shell
43694
ruby the language needs some getting used to but it is quite elegant compared to php
43702
.net and java put more information about the original program in the executables method names variable names etc. so you get more of your original information back
43709
and a huge lot of stuff in between like web.py pyroxide and django
43710
this would imply a windows server which has a lot of baked in authentication authorization schemes
43733
they can be written in almost anything shell script perl python ruby etc c anything that can be execute and produce an output
43733
once i got it installed currently slightly difficult on os x but it s trivial on linux freebsd i had written a plugin in a few minutes and it worked first time
43733
some alternatives are nagios and cacti
43733
munin mrtg and cacti are basically all far-nicer-to-use systems based around this graphing tool
43743
i found some wild remarks that asp.net mvc is 30x faster than asp.net webforms
43743
this is to help me consider moving from asp.net webforms to asp.net mvc
43773
you can go with an all singing all dancing framework like django or pylons
43780
one stupid way of calculating a modulus is to subtract or add the modulus until the resulting value is between 0 and modulus 1
43825
you can add a beginrequest listener and endrequest listener to show and hide the element you want to display inline
43830
each nextval gives you 100 sequence numbers to work with
43835
i personally use a mix of web frameworks by using cherrypy for my web server stuff form parameters session handling url mapping etc and django for my object-relational mapping and templates
43838
you could accomplish this by puting a noindex nofollow meta tag in the html every page but the home page
43845
if you already have an excel sheet that has the formatting you want just export the data from access into excel for the report
43856
the control library would then somehow render the form in html without me having to create an html table select the appropriate standard web controls and all that
43874
i have a multiple selection select field which i don t want the end user to be able to change the value of
43874
i ve tried using onmousedown onfocus onclick and setting each to blur or return false but with no success

i have connected to a server via sftp using filezilla and accepted adding the server s ssh key to the key cache in filezilla
44130
there are only 2 places where you could mess up typing mykey in the getter and setter and this would be very easy to spot
44143
i would prefer a solution in .net python or php but can t find anything
44161
i need to encode in wmv and don t mind if the actual encoding is made in c++ as long as the library has a .net assembly available
44189
you can use a union select
44190
i am looking for a simple javascript example that updates dom
44225
they don t boil down to the same code in any way really which you d see if you wrote your own enumerator
44226
if you want to use this on a sub-directory of the repository you will need to use svn log to discern the first revision in which that directory existed and use that revision instead of 0

standalone apps may use swing the java ui toolkit or in the future javafx which is supposed to make swing obsolete and may do so in a few years

in addition to the other answers there s a nice powertoy for xp called open command window here. it adds an option to your right-click context menu when you click inside a folder to open a command window using that directory as the starting path

i want to provide a button that the user can click so that the password which is masked will appear in a popup when the user clicks the button
44436
i would assume that the browser has some issue with the script attempting to set the value of a password field
44436
edit actually i just did a quick test and firefox has no problem setting the password field s value with code such as
44443
i guess i was wondering if postgresql or mysql have any obvious advantages in these areas i am primarily familiar with oracle
44461
double nextdouble random rng double min double max
44461
return min + rng.nextdouble max - min
44523
to get around this you could put a wrapper around the dll and use it to delegate the calls to the ui thread by using the invoke method of the form
44524
if you use active directory you could have each app use ad for authentication login could then be seamless
44560
well if you know the current page it s pretty trivial to just subtract the number by 1 and add it by 1 then check those numbers against the bounds and display the first and last page always then if they aren t in sequence add the ellipses
44575
it s useful for the chmod and mkdir functions in unix land but aside from that i can t think of any other common uses
44582
i think always always always add logging when there is an exception including the message and full stack trace
44607
of course using paralles vmware virtualbox or any other virtual machine with a windows guest as you describe will also work fine
44614
pc p3 - so show p1 p2 p3 pn next if pc 1 show a prev link before p1

i was having a heck of a time figuring out how to login and logout using response objects from rails
44635
you can try wmicodecreator it generates vbscript jscript vb.net and c# code
44638
i d say compared to django that pylons allows you to interchange ints internal parts easier than django does
44638
harder to replace parts not that much of an issue in pylons more so with django
44700
other systems exist git mercurial accurev perforce that let you make queries of the type what changes on branch a have not been merged into branch b
44710
then i needed to give a vm to a colleague and had to go through a few hoops getting it out of parallels and into vmware
44714
so if i simply wish to push only to the one outside and will never pull from it what is the best git way to do this
44750
parallels desktop for mac for virtualization
44809
if sharepoint is setup using integrated authentication and the site is listed as a trusted site in ie the browser will use there network cred for auto login
44836
i.e your server-side code will have credentials to connect to the ntlm site and it passes through the requests from your users
44864
where there are no widths set on any elements and what i want is #inner1 #inner2 and #inner3 to appear next to each other horizontally inside #outer but what is happening is that #inner1 and #inner2 are appearing next to each other and then #inner3 is wrapping on to the next line
44872
specifically the information - display block size and outline - outline block level elements options
44916
method references in delphi object pascal
44926
what would be perfect in this case for example would be something in firebug that when hovering over an element s size in the layout panel would display a tool tip that says something like width constrained by outer element x
44926
height constrained by style z on element q or width contributed to by inner elements a b and c
44966
a properties file listing all the modify and create triggers on each entity calculated attributes validators and other business logic

having worked on a lot of waterfall projects in the past and a lot of adhoc and agile projects more recently there s a number of design artifacts i like to create although i can t state enough that it really depends on the details of the project methodology team structure timescale tools etc
45011
for when you don t want a fixed size increment sequences aren t really what you are after all they really guarantee is that you will be getting a unique number always bigger than the last one you got
45035
not coincidentally it is also the format of the unix date command at least on linux and i believe in other implementations too - though to be pedantic date.tostring pads one-digit day numbers with a zero while unix date does not
45040
so using system.security.cryptography aes or 3des in cbc mode without rolling your own checksum can be dangerous
45045
when executing submitchanges to the datacontext after updating a couple properties with a linq to sql connection against sql server compact edition i get a row not found or changed. changeconflictexception
45066
you can do this in one line using the conditional operator and the fact that you can cast null to a nullable type two lines if you don t have a pre-existing int you can reuse for the output of tryparse
45076
using this you can have the controllers of the same name under any part of the namespace so long as you qualify which routes belong to which namespaces you can have multiple namespaces per routes if you need be
45101
i have found that generally the most performant and stable way to push pull large amounts of data of a device over activesync is to use a socket
45158
this is a total hack but you could use an iframe inside the noscript tag to trigger an http get on a url to tell the server that a user doesn t have javascript enabled
45185
one advantage to asp.net is that you have the option of coding your site exactly as you did with classic asp along with access to the richness of the .net framework
45188
if you like asp and want to move to asp.net skip webforms and learn mvc
45213
at work our code base is c++ and perl and we talk to a mysql database
45213
for our interface we have some fairly thin custom classes wrapped around the basic mysql client libraries for our c++ code and the dbi module for our perl scripts
45236
this started as an attempt to break out of the norm at work to use ado.net datareaders datasets and we now have a few projects using hibernate nhibernate
45237
there may be something you have to do on myoutsideserver to allow forwarding of the ssh port
45254
also i m pretty sure you are fine to use a regular user as long as the port you are forwarding in this case the 8022 port is not below the restricted range which i think is 1024 but i could be mistaken because those are the reserved ports
45254
it doesn t matter that you are forwarding it to a restricted port because that port is not being opened the machine is just having traffic sent to it through the tunnel it has no knowledge of the tunnel the 8022 port is being open and so is restricted as such
45278
using ssh to establish temporary port forwarding
45278
check out the section called forward anything simple port forwarding for info
45287
however it is much more efficient if you create lets say 500 buttons because you know that only 500 buttons will be visible on the screen at any one time and introduce a mapping layer between the buttons and the items which dynamically reassigns the buttons to different items every time the user does something which would result in changing the set of buttons which should be visible like moving a scrollbar for example
45291
if that file contains any class module definitions then your other code will now be able to use them
45291
if the file just contains code which is not in any modules it will get run as if it were in the same place as your require call like php include
45291
there s also extend which works like include does but instead of adding the methods as instance methods adds them as class methods like this
45310
however i have used asp.net strategically and have found it very powerful and your do end up writing must less code as so much is built into the .net framework as long as you can find it in documentation
45347
also check out asp.net mvc or if you re set on webforms the new system.web.routing namespace in asp.net 3.5 sp1
45387
in my last job we ended up rewriting the complete asp.net stack forms controls validation postback handling ajax library etc... - the reason i was given was that the asp.net controls were not accessible enough not were any of the third party controls that were assessed for the project
45401
what i mean with lightweigt is that it doesn t need shading lighting advanced camera s
45403
it s fast to set up and dont require that you yourself do or know any server issues
45405
the fact that you never connect your repository to anyone else s to push and pull changes doesn t mean that tool won t be right
45415
of course the assembly contains tests that i can run from any runner like nunit one testdriven or resharper
45419
tortoisesvn is a free client and integrates into your explorer- in right mouse click menu
45431
has anyone got ncover typemock and mstest to work together
45431
i m using mstest 9 ncover 2.1 and typemock 4.1
45440
can integrate with most of ides visual studio ankhsvn or visualsvn -- more info or eclipse subclipse -- here someone asked about that
45483
the way they achieve default visuals is often different as well such as whether or not they use padding or margin to achieve the indentation in bulleted lists
45499
that code sample tries to turn xmlreader style code into sax style code - if you re writing code from scratch i d just use xmlreader as it was intended - pull not push
45518
therefore if your method wants to explicitly disallow null as opposed to just happening to have a null value raise a nullpointerexception you should throw an illegalargumentexception
45519
convert the image to .ico format using the python interface to imagemagick pythonmagick
45520
just change the extension to ico from bmp and you re ready to go
45528
i m trying to find a simple way to change the colour of the text and background in listview and treeview controls in wtl or plain win32 code
45533
be aware that proc is not easily available on unix based systems though freebsd osx
45553
the browsers don t have any proxies set or anything like that
45554
in page_load function you need to define the width and height of the list box properly so that it won t overflow with the div
45557
regarding untrusted languages i heard a podcast from josh berkus a postgres advocate who discussed an application of postgresql that brought in data from mysql as part of its processing so that the communication itself was handled by the postgres server
45596
by the way vb having the same underlying architecture allows much more flexible select case statements the above code would work in vb and still produces efficient code where this is possible so the argument by techical constraint has to be considered carefully
45606
for the rest i think spring.net castle windsor ninject and structuremap aren t that far apart anymore
45607
for some reason joomla does not suit you try drupal
45627
we have used a bit of a silly way in the past having a counter increment for every memory allocation call and decrement while freeing
45631
you can then either have a field which stores a type value or you can imply what type of person you re dealing with by what fields are filled in
45671
it s a build and assembly framework which takes care of the resolution of dependencies the fetching from various repositories building and packaging of the product
45681
if a to implement a website with user profiles logins extensions gallery s etc s a newbi then a cms like joomla etc are good but else if you presently have only static content then its good to go with good old html about jpeg i though presently its better to use png or gif as its less bulky
45732
i m interested in any object that implements the same interface which has a public collection called thecollection that contains types of ipolymorphiclol
45740
in order to change the position you will have to remove the dom nodes and add them all again at the right position
45747
i am using the gacinstall to publish my assemblies however once installed into the gac i sometimes delete my temporary copy of the assemblies
45748
i would say the first step in the solution will be to define how characters and numbers interact and form a sequence
45775
this form returns a result set just like a select statement and is also handy for returning any kind of calculated default value
45783
we have been trying to use msbuild and nant deployment scripts with limited success
45799
written in python since ruby is a no-no why
45835
of course you could go the other way and only count requests from things you know are web browsers covering ie firefox safari opera and this newfangled chrome thing would get you 99 of the way there
45886
of course asp.net provides much better ways of accomplishing the same thing but it s still a bit of a loss and can make migrating an old site to .net a pain
45887
for those out there using the .net framework and asp.net 2.0 or above its trivial

delete from table where field value will delete only one row in memory tables even though they where multiple rows
45945
hopefully we ll get all the features of the quicktime c apis in the next version of qtkit whenever that may be
45954
i m working on a utility which needs to resolve hex addresses to a symbolic function name and source code line number within a binary
45954
the mips binaries are in elf format using dwarf for the symbolic debugging information
45954
i have compiled an objdump with support for mips binaries and it is working
45963
are you using new delete or malloc free or both
45963
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility
45983
assuming it s svn revision xxxx
45990
it s been a long time since i used oxygen but in the latest builds of eclipse gannymede there is a built in xml editor that works for about 90 of my use cases xsd dtd validation auto-complete etc.
45997
my make setup allows me to build rpm s for everything php libs php websites perl modules c apps etc that make up my app
46005
under the covers of boost iostreams i implemented a source which is more or less another view of the interaction between std streambuf and std istream
46008
write the process as a server-side script in whatever language php bash perl etc is handy and then call it from the process control functions in your php script
46014
a put request could be used when creating a new record put the data at a url which doesn t currently exist but in practice just posting is probably a better approach to get started with
46017
there is also a perl module and a php project to do this
46053
i like the sound of combinatorial tests in mbunit i ve tried the abstract base class interface test technique with nunit and although it does work you d need to have a seperate test fixture for every interface a class implements since in c# there is no multiple inheritance - although inner classes can be used which is pretty cool
46061
i also found that you can paste text into the text box using the mouse - it just won t accept keyboard input
46079
asp.net webforms .net 1.1
46127
that will hold the lock until you either commit or rollback the transaction
46158
this technique is used in cody lindley s thickbox written for jquery
46165
you can then have ssrs export the report to about 10 different formats and send to the client including pdf excel html etc
46204
it would seem that an md5 hash would work fine
46210
if they are very short then a unique id can be generated by considering the characters as digits in base 36 26 + 10 that form a n -digits number where n is the length of the string
46219
tag and a submit button how do i determine in ie6 and above if a file has been selected by the user
46241
using a credit card number you could perform a hash on it md5 or sha1 or something similar
46247
cast the pointer of the string to a 32 bit unsigned integer array and compare the string 4 bytes at a time or 64 bits 8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor
46255
extract an interface from the helper class add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class used through its interface and then inject a mock version of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exceptions from the helper
46294
i ve used both phpunit simpletest and i found simpletest to be easier to use
46296
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames
46314
for an iis-hosted service that is an .svc file just set the address of the endpoint to a relative uri and make sure that your visual studio or wsdl.exe generated client specifies the endpoint s name in its constructor
46347
is there a clean way to redirect all attempts to going to an http version of a site to its https equivalent
46357
nsunknownkeyexception is a common error when using key-value coding to access a key that the object doesn t have
46410
although it is not the best solution and hitting the right session across multiple browser windows is rough we put a countdown timer on our page included a button that just went back and hit the server to restart the session and also provided the user with a javascript popup the user s favorite part of the solution with a message saying that the session was say five minutes from timing out and to hit the ok button to restart
46410
then the button would hit the server to restart the session restart the timer on the base page close the popup and the base page didn t need to be refreshed at all
46444
it apparently handles c++ c java objective-c python idl corba and microsoft flavors fortran vhdl php c# and to some extent d

you normally don t want to use public key encryption rsa dsa for the bulk data encryption due to its large computational time
46492
once your oledb connection is made you can easily create your datareader dataadapter and process as needed
46504
put 3 digits at the front and 2 at the back of the sequence zero pad so the length of the crc is consistent
46508
the only way i know of to get a reasonably accurate estimate that is it to break the project into individual tasks and get the developer who will be doing the actual work to put an estimate on each task
46522
converting to html entity syntax would be a decent encoding process to keep out prying humans but bots could easily decode it
46523
because there isn t any need to generate html entities for all the applicable characters that is what htmlentities does according to the documentation if it s already in your character set
46537
to kind of piggy-back on what mike stone was suggesting what i would do is encrypt it on the server-side and have something on the server-side that will decrypt it and return it back as json jsonresult in mvc framework web service http handler whatever
46544
in a dvcs like bazaar or git the merged revision ends up with two parent revisions
46558
what i ve done is obfuscate it when it s rendered and hide it then use javascript to fix the obfuscation and show the link
46582
we have the requirement to take a form submission and save some data then redirect the user to a page offsite but in redirecting we need to submit a form with post not get
46583
first i highly recommend using source control like subversion cvs or git
46655
rails utilizes post get put and delete but it apparently has to do some fakery for put
46663
answers with any of using hotmail yahoo or gmail are acceptable
46667
if that s the case building them and ensuring that they are versioned will give you an easily reproducible environment
46727
i have info on my migration from junit to testng here and here
46784
if you went this way you might want to look at a more pure mapping solution like ibatis or ibatis.net
46804
there would be some configuration involved and its hard to know if this would work in your particuar environment but thats the only solution that i know of which is even reasonably cross-server compatible
46821
i ve used yourkit java profiler 7.5 and was reasonably happy with it
46824
i like to use bind instead of directly wiring the event handler because you can pass additional data to the event hander not shown here but the data is a third bind argument and because you can easily unbind it and you can bind and unbind by group--see the jquery docs
46853
if you want the last duplicate e-mail a single result you simply add a top 1 and order by
46855
i plan to use tcp packets for strategic data and udp packets for tactical data
46855
edit i forgot to mention that i am leaning away from wcf and .net 3+ for a couple of reasons
46860
i have a search field on a form and rather than have a label next to the search field i d like to show some grey text in the background of the search field itself search terms for example
46866
look for the win32 api sendmessage function and the em_setcuebanner message
46874
also if you already have some kind of authentication mechanism in place you could trace who is using a particular service based on login
46884
.net 3.0 or 3.5 contains wcf and is a solid performant communications subsystem with good security
46884
.net 3.0 is just .net 2.0 with additional libraries wcf wf wpf
46912
the official way to do this is to call map.entryset which returns a set of map.entry each of which contains a key and a value entry.getkey and entry.getvalue
46926
hashmap is the canonical map implementation and doesn t make guarantees or though it should not change order if no mutating operation are performed on it
46926
sortedmap will return entries based on the natural ordering of the keys or a comparator if provided
46932
i could put a spy on this webpage and if you have it open i get to see what other websites you have open
46948
i imagine you d want something like a tree with a list of children as described here
46976
but agreed splunk would work pretty well as would an over-long and unmaintainable perl script or a series of awk s sort s uniq -c s etc
46978
your execution environment may be bizarre or corrupt when you enter these functions of course so be careful of how much you presume a sane environment
46988
my company uses wordpress and mediawiki internally and we use http_auth access control to create a single sign on
46988
then install the httpauth extension for mediawiki and the http authentication plugin for wordpress and configure
47000
as long as it s a hash function be it string.hashcode md5 or sha1 collision is unavoidable unless you have a fixed limit on the string s length
47018
any dynamic languages of course -- python ruby smalltalk javascript etc
47033
if you want to take the next step of identifying the functions and data structures to focus on for footprint reduction the --size-sort argument to nm can show you
47042
the easy way to fix many svn errors is to move the whole directory away via the os update to get another clean copy of it and then merge in anything you changed with some other tool winmerge or the like
47078
we are currently using the extjs tree view in an application - a requirement has arisen requiring a user to select multiple nodes which the tree view supports currently through a pluggable selection model - but you can not then drag the multiple selections to another part of the tree
47083
in addition since it s fairly common to make the wcf service code stateless it s pretty easy to scale out the actual wcf code by adding additional boxes which means the overall performance of your system is much more likely to be limited by your business logic and persistence layer than it is by wcf
47086
you will still have to pick some magic numbers for the initial sleep time and the increment decrement amount but i think this algorithm could be tuned to keep a thread running at fairly close to a determined percent of cpu
47113
today most languages platforms java .net php perl etc. can work with almost any dbms sql server firebird mysql oracle postgressql etc. so i wouldn t worry for one second
47116
do a reverse google lookup meaning put their answer into google as soon as they click submit and see if you get exact matches
47120
sometimes reversing the order that you join the tables will also help things
47209
i ve used extjs and mootools as frameworks in this kind of area
47209
if you don t need all the extjs widgets i d say well away from it in future and look at something like the mootools dynamic sortables demo
47236
cscope does this in a standalone xterm and also can be used inside your favorite editor - it has great emacs and vi vim support
47309
i m trying to install godi on linux ubuntu
47346
oh and we have this method too that allows you to put in a whole url string without having to get the querystring out of it
47362
it s leaps ahead of cvs and subversion and very similar to git although somewhat simpler to use
47393
triggers allow you to perform a function in the database as certain events happen eg an insert into a table
47413
unfortunately the last keyword in a grouping gives you the last physical record in the database not the last record by any sorting
47519
the system in question is ubuntu 7.04 but that is irrelevant as i m looking to fix it for at least the majority of if not all linux users
47537
does anyone know if there is a c# console app similar to the python or ruby console
47559
c# may have the reflective power to have a python or ruby style console but the .net framework libraries are geared toward compiling c# not dynamically interpreting it
47591
cgrect cgpoint cgsize and cgaffinetransform structures
47617
all objects with a finaliser get put on a special finalise queue by the garbage collector where the finalise method is invoked on them so it s technically a performance hit to declare empty finalisers
47644
it s not python but it teaches c java style programming in a fun robot-programming kind of game
47659
once you associate your project to maven and update the dependencies using m2eclipse any change to pom.xml are reflected to entire project even java version definition causes it to be compiled in right jre if you have it installed and properly configured into eclipse.
47674
in other words m2eclipse is more friendly to the maven way
47676
for development localhost we might be running tomcat and when declared in the context section of server.xml tomcat will hang jndi datasources on java comp env jdbc in the jndi tree
47676
problem in weblogic the jndi lookup is appds whilst in tomcat it seems that that i must provide the formal java comp env jdbc appds
47710
you should be using illegalargumentexception iae not nullpointerexception npe for the following reasons
47712
itextsharp and itext are opensource and free pdf generation libraries for .net and java respectively
47721
we re using spring for dependency injection and stripes has excellent support for that
47733
out of these tools resharper and picking a good mocking framework are critical for doing tdd
47735
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs
47816
this may sound like insanity but if you are using nant or ant or some other automated build system you can use nant properties as css variables in a hacky way
47864
basically i got an updatepanel with a textbox and a button and when the user types in html into the textbox a javascript popup with a error message saying not to modify the response pops up

how much more efficient is udp over tcp
47929
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt
47932
we re still in the early stages of this but it s looking good so far however we do have to make sure we create any tables that are required and populate them with test data - however we ve reduced the workload somewhat here by creating a generic set of helper functions that can do a lot of all this for us
47932
obviously our experiences have centred around a c++ development environment however i m sure you could perhaps get something similar working under php python
47965
account credentials and session tokens are often not properly protected
47972
i m researching and experimenting more with groovy and i m trying to wrap my mind around the pros and cons of implementing things in groovy that i can t don t do in java
47989
is there a risk of legal trouble if you include gpl or lgpl licensed icons in a closed source software
47990
to make this independent of 2 s complement negation behaviour where -1 has all bits set unlike on a 1 s complement or sign magnitude c++ implementation use unsigned negation
48001
simple superclass name qualified subclass name
48012
i decide the new fancy stuff is whack and go find something else to learn php and ruby and python were all fun to play with but i couldn t use it much with my existing asp stuff
48015
i came from emacs to vim when i realized how organized vim s documentation is and how chordable many of the features are
48015
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris
48053
i read somewhere once that the modulus operator is inefficient on small embedded devices like 8 bit micro-controllers that do not have integer division instruction
48065
for background i m also a long-time vim user but i learned emacs about 2 years ago and now use them interchangeably
48065
there are still some things that i find easier in vim block-select mode simple macro recording diff mode and things that are easier in emacs line alignment file buffer management window screen management
48078
have you considered doing a division multiplication and subtraction to simulated the mod
48103
processors with multipliers have interesting division routines using the multiplier but you can get from division result to modulus with just another two steps multiply and subtract so it s still comparable
48128
if i come up with a good solution i ll remove any ip protected code and put it out for public use
48184
ibm s websphere mq site
48210
while the performance packs offer the ability to use the native platform s media library they re only offered for linux solaris and windows
48215
trying to make a make generic select control that i can dynamically add elements to but i am having trouble getting functions to work right
48223
it may be just me but the way i d get into this is by creating a code generator - using reflection at runtime is a bit costly and untyped
48236
gcc g++ 4.2
48248
it works with many operating systems win32 posix linux bsd
48257
i applied the moss infrastructure upgrade w o applying the wss one before it -- uh help
48282
look at unit tests - they re loaded by reflection at least in nunit and mstest
48297
so that maintenance service it just runs you know it s like you know a half page of code that runs that maintenance service and it never has to change and it doesn t have any of the logic in there it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency
48305
it s c++ language support is not 100 but it more than makes up for it by having a great two-way rad ide and the ability to use a huge library of existing delphi components
48365
i m not interested in php or perl or web development
48369
static void main string args
48405
i haven t tried it - but i would advise clients who have a large investment or who have a strong preference for it over the mstest tool in nunit who are interested in implementing tfs to continue with nunit as opposed to trying convert all their existing tests
48451
use map if you need something like a dictionary
48462
map the performance and behavior of hashmap and treemap are parallel to the set implementations
48515
build it yourself running something like linux or bsd
48515
the benefit of this is that it makes it easy to do the dynamic part of your question it s just a matter of a few well-placed shell python perl whatever scripts
48515
buy a dedicated firewall device - possible drawbacks of doing this is that doing the dynamic part of what you re trying to accomplish is somewhat more difficult - depending on the device this could be easy net telnet net ssh come to mind or not
48520
for map and set the hash variants will be faster than tree sorted
48525
always start with arraylist and hashset and hashmap not linkedlist or treemap
48533
the html width and height attributes do not allow for units
48533
you re likely thinking of the css width and height properties
48533
in the width and height attributes might cause a rendering engine to balk
48540
i have used this both in linux and also in osx
48550
i am trying to publish an asp.net mvc web application locally using the nant and msbuild
48660
and myisam works differently from innodb
48704
createfile - the createfile function creates or opens a file file stream directory physical disk volume console buffer tape drive communications resource mailslot or named pipe
48742
my application controller needs to instantiate a sub-controller based on the request and it would be simply ridiculous to use a gigantic ever-changing switch statement to manage the loading of those controllers
48745
for things like video streaming and multiplayer gaming where it is better to miss a packet than to delay all the other packets behind it this is the obvious choice
48745
think of it this way if a packet goes missing would you rather just get the next packet as quickly as possible and continue use udp or do you actually need that missing data use tcp
48760
if you had a math class you might have a few static methods to deal with addition and subtraction because these are concepts associated with math
48761
ff ie and opera probably safari too all send the if-modified-since header when they receive content with a last-modified header attached so this works fine
48804
static methods should deal entirely with abstract properties and concepts of a class - they should in no way relate to instance specific attributes and most compilers will yell if they do
48857
dbi is great but the quality of the dbd modules can vary
48903
flex actionscript 3 and mxml for ui definition
48908
how can you tell when packets arrive and how big the packet is do you have to do all the heavy lifting yourself
48922
in some cases the third-party software may just be an implementation of an standard api java does this a lot with jdbc jms jndi ...
48929
in most ip protocols that use variable length packets there will be a header with a known fixed length prepended to the packet
48974
ruby and c# both easily let you create accessors by specifying getter setter methods for an attribute much like in python
49011
i have a rest data service where i want to allow the users to create new items with http put using different formats like json xml csv
49060
to explain why historically typed constants in early delphi and its predecessor turbo pascal are writable and thus essentially initialized global variables we need to go back to the days of dos
49060
a lot of people took advantage of this since turbo pascal and delphi did not at that time have initialized global variables as a feature
49063
if you can get away with using python ruby groovy or perl vs
49122
you can also add grails groovy to an existing java jsp project so it doesn t require a huge commitment or paradigm change
49122
groovy grails is simply ruby rails for java people
49122
finally if you can find a good diagram that shows how grails is built on top of spring hibernate quartz sitemesh and groovy i think people will understand that there is a treasure chest waiting to be unlocked
49131
so the answer to your question depends a fair bit on whether you are using udp or tcp as your transport
49131
for udp life gets a lot simpler in that you can call recv recvfrom recvmsg with the packet size you need you d likely send fixed-length packets from the source anyway and make the assumption that if data is available it s there in multiples of packet-length sizes
49131
this applies to both udp and tcp
49133
the reason for this is that daos should only be responsible for holding properties of the real world objects they are modeling and only have getter and setter methods or just direct property access
49135
interaction between groovy and java code basically a non-issue
49135
compiling groovy code to java .class files
49135
one thing i like doing with groovy is implementing an interface defined in java as a map from method names to closures
49137
i would like to call python script files from my c++ program
49138
in sql server would a varbinary 16 be the most efficient way of storing an md5 hash
49142
scott hanselman did a post on how to use the .net openid project inside of asp.net mvc
49152
since you didn t specify if you are trying to do this in a webpage you should look at triggering the javascript alert my message
49163
wcf 3.5 pre-sp1 was a fairly weak restful platform with sp1 things have improved in both uri templates and with the availability of atompub support such that it s becoming more capable but they don t really provide any elegant solution for supporting say json xml atom or even something more esoteric like payload like csv simultaneously short of having to make use of url rewriting and different extension method name munging etc
49168
i would like to call perl script files from my c++ program
49172
c++ wrapper around perl c api
49182
based on the documentation on msdn and my experience binary is better since the md5 hash does not vary in size
49185
without knowing what your tag is actually doing presumably its its outputting something in the body section then there is no way that it will be able to get at the head to put the declaration there
49195
the first language i learnt was php but i have more recently picked up python
49197
if you use a plain form with a select and a submit your urls will end up having
49197
if you want the user to be able to select something from the dropdown and that changes the submission url then you re going to have to use javascript to achieve this by intercepting the form submit and formulating the correct url
49217
i m feeling your pain i also learned php first and i m trying to learn c++ it s not easy and i am really struggling it s been 2 years since i started on c++ and still the extent of what i can do is cout cin and math
49220
i ve consulted the nhibernate reference material but i can t seem to figure when to use set bag and the other nhibernate collections
49227
you will recognise a lot of things from php and you will be surprised how much php and perl python etc do for you
49232
ok forget the last answer i can t read you are working with 3des keys not rsa keys
49233
in this case you can indicate the format of your put request s content by setting the content-type header to application json or application xml
49236
if you need data you can copy it in the ondrop store it in some temporary location then in the wm_app range message pass the index to the data in temporary location
49237
the benefit is you can learn the lower level syntax without having to learn pointers since memory is managed for you just like in python and php
49281
thamir khason presented a excellent session about wpf xna silverlight at tech-ed.
49281
on his desktop using wpf to host xna and ons his mobile phone using silverlight all playing against each other
49282
as noted in answer by joseph pecoraro you might want to watch for strings that are valid non-decimal numbers such as those starting with 0x for hex and 0b for binary and potentially more tricky numbers starting with zero that will be parsed as octal
49315
you can go with a tripple des implementation which will give you 112 bits key often referred to as 128 bit but only 112 of them are actually secure or as previously stated you can use aes
49319
embeding the python interpreter inside your c++ app will let you run python programs using your application run python scripts
49319
in the past i have used swig to generate python interfaces to c++ code
49319
it was not clear from your question whether you wanted the python scripts to call your c++ program or whether you just wanted the c++ to call python
49377
did you enable trace logging in sharepoint
49377
you can activate it by going to the central administration website operations diagnostic logging trace logging
49431
user holds the mouse a second or two over the item rather than mouse click but i cannot find a way to do this
49443
also they allow for concurrency an asterisk box - a free pbx some custom made flash client and a custom made sip client on the server
49447
probably the trickiest thing that may also provide the most stable experience to the end user is to replicate the database locally and use some sort of synchronization schema to keep your copy of the database in sync with remote db
49454
this creates an onchange event on the select box that redirects you to the url stored in the value field of the selected option
49455
what i would like is either an explanation of how to do this or any code that i can read ideally python c or c++ but anything readable will do that does this so that i can understand what i m meant to be doing
49458
in order to stop writing code to explicitly remove or add controls etc i turned to visual inheritance to solve the problem - in what i thought was a neat clean and logical oo style - turns out that half the time inherited forms have a hard time rendering themeselves in vs for no good reason etc - and i get the feeling that developers and to some extent microsoft have shunned the practice of visual inheritance - can you confirm this am i missing something here
49459
assuming you have the necessary privileges to run svnadmin you need to use the dump and load commands
49465
the other problem is that most of the routers in china just drop the packets and don t respond to ping etc so you can t find out their ip addresses
49483
if you have a berkley db backend if you re not sure of what your backend is or if you re changing svn version numbers you re going to want to use svnadmin to dump your old repository and load it into your new repository
49483
using svnadmin dump will give you a single file backup that you can copy to the new system
49483
if you don t have filesystem access there may be other third party options out there or you can write something to help you migrate essentially you d have to use the svn log to replay each revision on the new repository and then fix up the metadata afterwards
49492
the two lines of code are much more readable - more pythonic - than the single line creation with .items + .items
49500
i dont know how to get the subdomain name to use in the rewrite rule
49510
i want to create an application that is launched by default when the user clicks on an http or https link in other applications mail ichat etc.
49511
this was done using extensions that pull information from svn using svnkit and by linking to bugzilla to extract work assigned to a developer or work remaining for a release
49512
the first three steps allow your app to act as a role handler for the relevant url schemes http and https and the final step makes it the default role handler for those schemes
49512
to add support for http and https you d need to add the following to your application s info.plist file
49512
in this case we re setting our app to be the default role handler for http and https links
49521
i m currently writing a library for embedding perl in c++ but it s not finished yet
49539
you could try setting an asyncpostbacktrigger on the updatepanel to watch the value of a hidden field
49576
at the time i was programming windows 3.0 using borland s turbo pascal 1.0 for windows which later became delphi
49604
limit 10 works for mysql and others ingres uses
49630
i m using javascript to hide an image and show some text thats hidden under it
49666
i d suggest you take the pieces of information you want in the key and hash it with md5 and then just take the first x characters where x is a key length you think is manageable
49672
for enterprise software sold to technical people you can use a fairly complex licensing system and they ll figure it out
49674
we keep it simple store every license data to an xml easy to read and manage create a hash of the whole xml and then crypt it with a utility also own and simple
49687
and catch the mouseover and mouseout events on this div instead
49687
because it has no child elements you shouldn t get spurious mouseover and mouseout events propagating to it
49687
what i believe happens is that when the cursor moves from a parent element onto a child element a mouseout event occurs on the parent element and a mouseover event occurs on the child element
49698
i m not sure if this would fit with the rest of your styling but perhaps if you changed the css on the text div so it was the same size as the image or fixed the size of the outer div then when the mouseover event fired the size of the outer div wouldn t change so much as to cause the mouseout event
49702
with an array i d use either quicksort or possibly heapsort and just change the comparison to use texample.sortorder the swap part is still going to just act on the array and swap pointers
49726
you ll see why in a second. the value of this field is a checksum of the packed bytes from the other fields
49731
for a number of reasons many of the dynamic languages ruby python perl don t have static analysis tools that are as strong as those available in static languages
49737
when using python s __getattr__ function which is sort of like method_missing in ruby smalltalk i was working with a class with a whole lot of statistics such as late_total
49747
i ve found the enterprise application block updater a bit too complex for my needs and i ve found click once frustrating when it comes to publishing
49767
if you can limit your code to one cpu setthreadaffinity you can use rdtsc assembler instruction to query performance counter directly from the processor
49778
if you stick with this rule i don t see the problem of having select permission
49806
if i have several of these windows open at once and i click one with my mouse when they disappear they cause my application to lose focus it switches focus to the app behind the current one
49809
i already know php python java and some c pointers and memory management are not so good so i m going to be able to do it if i can find a good tutorial to cover the key parts of it does anybody have a link to a good tutorial for it or better yet for someone switching from one of those languages to .net
49821
in the php world it s even worse because an attacker could upload a malicious php script and later access it via the webserver
49824
besides the dynamic nature of python and the syntax what are some of the major features of the python language that java doesn t have and vice versa
49828
python is not java
49828
java is not python either
49837
from a personal perspective python has the following benefits over java
49862
in reply to the update in the question i would say that the label option should be selectable but either make it do nothing on submission or via javascript don t allow the form to be submitted without a value being selected assuming it s a required field
49879
when the build is run from the command line we have placed colored highlighting on various output lines
49887
it is important to set the data-type number because else the position will be sorted as a string end therefor the 10th node would ge considered before the 2nd one
49911
it s only at python 2.2 but still very useful if you need an embedded interpreter that has access to the java runtime
49943
i have tried pretty much every .net profiler on the market ants vtune optimizeit devpartner yourkit and in my opinion dottrace is the best of the lot
49953
java has basic types which aren t objects which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions for boolean byte char double float int long object short
49953
default and keyword arguments
49953
in python you have tuple assignment so you can say but in java you d need to either resort to mutable out parameters or have a custom class with 2 fields and then have two additional lines of code to extract those fields
49953
java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support
49953
sometimes those things matter a lot and java is the better language than python for a task
49953
i continue to use java for some new projects despite liking python a lot more
49954
you could also use code coverage tools like cobertura or emma for java analysis
50011
if it doesn t go away it s currently locked waiting on some kernel resource probably a buggy driver and there is nothing short of a reboot you could do to make the process go away
50011
unix based systems like linux also have that problem where processes could survive a kill -9 if they are in what s known as uninterruptible sleep shown by top and ps as state d at which point the processes sleep so well that they can t process incoming signals which is what kill does - sending signals

also checking whether a hash set contains some element is very fast
50182
is there a good library to use for gathering user input in linux from the mouse keyboard joystick that doesn t force you to create a visible window to do so
50206
since you are limited to .net 2.0 wcf is perhaps not an option
50220
i m not sure off the top of my head for keyboard or joystick
50245
you might want to add sort -g at the end to get the libraries in order of usage
50307
i tried floating that content right and additionally tried floating it left and setting the position with the thinking that both divs would start out at left 0 where setting the margin of the right would move it over

really though this is probably more a perl ruby python job than a pure shell script
50371
i use winmerge for diffs but it doesn t work with the three way merge maybe a better question would be is there a way to force tortoisesvn to merge like tortoisecvs
50378
you need to put the burden of proof back on him- get him to convince you otherwise- and that will force him to do the research and discover the answer for himself

how do you capture the mouse events move and click over top of a shockwave director object not flash in firefox via javascript
50595
flotr ++even prettier charts than flot +-uses prototype which i ve never worked with -no pie charts either
50595
in a nutshell for tiny little simple graphs i d use the google charts api but for my current project an internal reporting tool it ll likely be flot though if it was client-facing code i d probably either look further or give flotr prototype a try

your i will be converted to an unsigned integer by adding uint_max + 1 then the addition will be carried out with the unsigned values resulting in a large result depending on the values of u and i
50632
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank
50632
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
50632
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type
50632
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type
50632
referring to 3 above since both operands have the same rank your i will need to be converted to an unsigned integer
50632
a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type
50693
if you are using a http endpoint you can use a secure transport such as https
50798
i m not sure what you mean about recognizing a path - if any of the above paths are passed as a parameter to a program the shell will put the entire string in one variable - you don t have to parse multiple arguments to get the entire path
50842
first you have to provide the entrypoints for malloc and free and friends
50848
since you re worried about memory leaks and talking about malloc free i assume you re in c
50853
i have a relationship between two entities e1 and e2 and e1 has a collection of e2 however i have a similar relationship set up between e2 and e3 yet e2 does not contain a collection of e3 s any reason why this would happen
50861
you can set __malloc_hook __free_hook and __realloc_hook to point to functions which will be called from malloc realloc and free respectively
50909
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users
50931
how can i rewrite the above rule so that subdomains do not get redirected
50942
i have found that to get this to work i can use an environment variable configuration to set the connection string of the connection manager that i am reading my package config from
50942
although i had to restart the sql server agent before it could find the new environment variable
50960
also by applying tdd you typically end up writing your code in a way where you can supply test mocks and stubs
50965
encryption processing by 8 byte blocks i don t want to save pre-encrypted file size so append 0x00 to input data and leave them there after decoding

51014
languages with type inference like ocaml and haskell will probably make this easier on you although their error messages can be confusing as well
51021
ruby has two different exceptions mechanisms throw catch and raise rescue
51036
db4o as mentioned by eric is an object-oriented database management system oodbms
51037
catch throw are not the same as raise rescue
51037
catch throw allows you to quickly exit blocks back to a point where a catch is defined for a specific symbol raise rescue is the real exception handling stuff involving the exception object
51047
you can embed your data in the xmp tag within a jpeg or exif or iptc fields for that matter
51054
i ve searched around the web and found some examples with hundreds of lines of code and others that required installing extra command line utilities to accomplish the task
51056
i agree that haskell s type classes are really well done but it s a bit different in that haskell has no oo semantics but ocaml does support oo

css3 will have last-child too this is currently supported by firefox safari but not ie 6 7 beta 8
51178
or you can use a commercial profiler like yourkit or any number of other profilers
51199
if you have to concatenate large strings put the string parts into an array and use the array.join method to get the overall string
51210
salt for additional logic where we want different controller logic routes etc
51218
your cursor will still blink but it ll blink after the percent sign rather than under the first digit and with one control character instead of three you may get less flicker
51242
this is probably overkill for such a simple task but if you plan to do more than that then it s saner to start from these tools mechanize beautifulsoup because they are much easier to use than the alternatives urllib to get content and regexen or some other parser to parse html
51255
doxygen generates javadoc style documentation although it looks like it s primarily intended to generate documentation from custom markup within your comments
51256
the front-end consists of a page with swfupload which is handling the upload on the client side
51302
the img tag lets you embed external image files jpeg gif png swf files and movie clips inside text fields
51307
this utility method combines prepare execute and fetchall_arrayref into a single call
51360
put the spinner in a div the same size as the chart you know the height and width so you can use relative positioning to center it correctly
51385
postgresql sqlite and mysql as databases

notepad++ for editing and script programming php ruby
51409
the packages that could use more than 4gb of memory on ubuntu and other linux distro s are compiled with pae support
51492
also i want it to be as close to xml as possible there must be support for attributes as well as for properties
51496
edit protocol buffers are made to be used programatically there are bindings for c++ java python ... so they may not be suited for your purpose
51512
yeah java has gotten better since 1.5 but for example you can iterate through a string in python with this same construct
51512
java has some of this but usually in java it takes half a page of code to get an instance of a class whereas in python it is about 3 lines
51521
oh i do find json far nicer to parse than xml i ve used it in javascript and the simplejson python module - about one command and it s nicely transformed into a native python dict or a javascript object thus the name
51550
soup.title finds the first title element anywhere in the html document
51553
postgres 8.3 takes 200 ms to execute this query on my macbook pro while java and python perform the same calculation in under 20 ms 350 000 rows
51553
i wrote some tests in java and python for context and they crush sql except for pure python
51553
no the python code and java code do all the work in house so to speak
51558
if you are worried about speed i d really recommend a good profiler and get evidence as to where your bottlenecks are - i use yourkit and have been very pleased
51574
to clarify i m not looking for a library that produces graphs charts i m looking for one that helps with graph algorithms eg minimum spanning tree kruskal s algorithm nodes edges etc
51580
also i don t see how xml s angle brackets are less human readable than json s square brackets curly brackets and quotes
51602
you only need to manually free strings when you manually allocate the memory yourself using the malloc function in c or the new operator in c++
51619
i want to make centralized push pull git repository available to all my team members over the internet
51619
so i should use http or https
51624
the rich presentational capabilities of wpf and silverlight mean developers like me will be working closely with graphic designers more often these days as is the case in my next project
51624
so i responded ok but what about xaml files in wpf silverlight
51640
you shouldn t be comparing the file descriptor with anything unless checking for stdin stdout stderr or doing math with it
51641
you create and interact with an swfupload object using javascript but uses a hidden flash file for file selection uploading and upload progress monitoring
51642
this may be a bit off topic i m replying specifically to your question about source control and graphics but you can put binary data images etc. into source control and in my opinion in a lot of cases should -- they just take up more disk space and you can t use a diff view to analyze what has changed in any meaningful way but what you do gain is a history of commit messages documenting each revision rollback ability and the ability to easily archive tagging a revision in svn terms all files be they visual assets documentation source code whatever belonging to a specific release version together
51664
there are also potential problems if you are passing memory between your main .exe and .dll files as if each of these static links the runtime you can end up with malloc free mismatch problems
51668
to be a little fairer your test for java and python should cover the cost of acquiring the data in the first place ideally loading it off disk
51726
i typically write a function that performs a query using sql and then puts the results into either a list or dictionary in java i d use either an arraylist or a hashmap
51753
as wmr mentioned org.apache.commons.io.ioutils from apache has a method called copy inputstream outputstream which does exactly what you re looking for
51793
mail from gets set to the from property value and if you set sender it only adds another header field in the data section
51866
to do this i m using ms vc++ .net 2003 and mappoint europe 2006 to do this but am having problems as when i select insert activex control no mappoint control appears in the list of options
51901
just last week i used regex find replace to convert a csv file to an xml file
51932
i ve used cc.net with nant and msbuild with great success would highly recommend it
51933
i still can t see why the java python tests are invalid
51934
every gis data of the same type should be a class but my user has the possibility to get new set of data and put it in the database
51936
also you may want to take a look at the windows resource kits tools which include timeit.exe similar to time on unix linux to give you elapsed and process times
51948
i m building a c++ mfc program in a multilingual environment
51953
it works out very well if you just want to display textual updates on progress and avoids the need for an updating dialog at all
51968
i used cc.net together with nant and msbuild
51968
nant was used to call msbuild to build the visual studio .sln files and do all the other build steps like running tests etc
51994
getting a big external monitor will help as will a nice mouse and keyboard
52024
so i regex to pull them all out and then drop them into a string var to remove from the database
52062
check out jgrapht for a very simple and powerful java graph library that is pretty well done and to allay any confusion is different than jgraph
52074
that means on windows it uses and on unix linux mono it uses
52098
edit apparently i can capture the keydown and keyup events on the combobox which allows me to set the focus or tab to the next control
52101
it is bad practice to use for...in loops to itterate over arrays
52116
i believe directionals are only captured on keydown and keyup not on keypress
52122
python and ruby are duck-typed
52122
because dependency injection is easier in dynamically typed languages the ruby python developers feel like their language understands the lessons of oo much better than other statically typed counterparts
52137
the duck typing comments here are more attributing to the fact that ruby and python are more dynamic than c#
52179
in the end i can probably put up with 200 ms response times but knowing that 7 ms is a possible target makes me feel unsatisfied as even 20-50 ms times would enable more users to have more up to date queries and get rid of a lots of caching and precomputed hacks
52266
if you had one controller running on the box in front of which you sit you could use keyboard and mouse input to switch it between open sockets with different renderers
52280
firebug - a myriad of productivity enhancing tools includes javascript debugger dom inspector allows you to edit the css html on the fly which is highly valuable for troubleshooing layout and display problems
52295
restful with xml json and rss outputs
52302
i don t have an answer to the tool question but i will say it is fairly easy in any text processing language perl python etc to randomly generate sentences from a bnf grammar and slightly more verbose in a bigger language java c etc but it shouldn t be too hard to roll your own
52357
usually stderr is the same as stdout so clog is the same as cout
52357
if i have log messages going out to the same place i have error messages going out to perhaps something in var log messages then i probably am not writing too much out so there isn t much lost by using non-buffered cerr
52357
is it possible to redirect clog cerr cout stdin stdout and or stderr
52365
is it possible to redirect clog cerr cout stdin stdout and or stderr
52381
if you re in a posix shell environment i m really thinking of bash you can redirect any
52382
you could check - have javascript that populates a hidden form field with a specific value after the page loads
52382
then when the page posts back to the server check that hidden form field the expected value
52390
when an exception is thrown in addition to the stack unwinding operations etc that take place which others have mentioned you should be aware that a whole bunch of runtime reflection related stuff happens in order to populate the members of the exception class such as the stack trace object and the various type members etc
52401
so the only correct way is to ask the jvm which a good profiler i use yourkit which probably isn t what you want
52414
a lot of people use vbscript for classic asp but you can use javascript jscript on the server as an alternative
52426
in iis for web app this is quite easy just go to the property of the virtual directory application and go to the asp.net tab you should see what version of .net you are actually using or rather what version of asp.net which is pretty much tied into the .net framework version
52430
is there an easier better way to calculate the date difference between the current row and the next row in my initial result set without using a cursor and temp table
52449
i am building a constructor to return an object based on its name rather than its id
52458
jvmti is the debugging and profiling protocol
52469
but i m having a little trouble separating the tools from the platform itself in regards to the licensing
52486
flash used well allows easy localization and internationalization
52541
sure there is webmail but even gmail is far away from the comfort of modern outlook or thunderbird clients
52549
addition subtraction multiplication division
52563
however if i try to do this for the textbox the effect is different and the textbox takes its default row count as width even if i set display block for the textbox
52565
really c++ templates are the enabling technology for stl and much of boost and c doesn t have them
52586
i like using intel vtune as a profiler primarily because it is non-invasive compared to instrumenting profilers which change behaviour too much
52616
i would look at a few options cvs subversion git bazaar visual sourcesafe and see which one s meet your team s desires the best
52633
your problem is that the 100 width does not include any padding or margin values
52634
i ve got a linqdatasource that points to my model and a gridview that consumes it
52634
i thought it might have to do with the linqdatasource so i added a sqldatasource and the same thing happens
52646
so i thought iframe - even though i m not a fan of frames i thought that i could create a frame that matched the width and height of the content so that it would appear native
52670
that would constitute one spot to get those resources and also the ones the asp.net mvc team put out
52678
linq queries work just as well on lists as on the linq-to-sql stuff
52691
if you were using jgraph you should give a try to jgrapht which is designed for algorithms
52702
so the real final solution will not open the entire file into a single byte array but rather will open the file as a stream and then send the file down to the client in bite size chunks perhaps roughly 10k in size
52703
machine running ubuntu linux 8.04 with php version 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.3
52725
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list
52785
in javascript i add a div to the dom
52792
the div needs to be added to an element for it to be part of the document
52795
it doesn t let you specify what monitor an app starts on but it lets you move an app to the another monitor and keep its aspect ratio intact with one mouse click
52844
if it makes a difference i am using wxpython and so far i have only tested my code on linux using the gtk backend but i do plan to make it multi-platform and using it on windows and mac using the native backends
52871
i get to launch the app in the normal way without worry about getting windbg to set the right working directory pass any command line arguments etc
52876
since you are no using webforms you cannot use any asp.net control
52893
if you are quite happy with webforms today then maybe asp.net mvc isn t for you
52896
the correct box model states that the width applies only to the content and padding and margin add on to it
52896
the original ie box model also known as quirks mode includes padding and margin in the width
52946
python c c++ weave multi-language procedural
52991
often you download a silverlight or wpf sample application from the web and open it up in blend just to have blend crash on you because the code doesn t run well inside the designer
52991
if your designer is new to xaml wpf and silverlight start by introducing them to the project team and have them do some basic designs in the tools they know
52998
this is an approach to api creation that newer libraries like ninject and moq are using
53010
the gist of it is that you assign a large amount of padding to the bottom of the column and a negative margin of the same size
53010
more or less the padding margin values allow the box to keep expanding until it reaches the end of the wrapper which is determined by the column with the most content and any extra space generated by the padding is cut off as overflow
53023
you can usually get an account with an sms service provider and send messages using an api soap resful http smpp ....
53025
i might have a view object that spawns a deleteobjectcommand instance due to some user action passing references to two of its own private member functions one for success one for failure let s say deleteobjectsuccesshandler and deleteobjectfailurehandler in this example as callback function references to the command class s constructor
53032
one way you could let users update xml-data is to write a simple .net based program winforms or asp.net and then select update the data from there
53056
if you do this just keep in mind that the hashtable s size needs to be set bigger than your dataset when you start otherwise you are going to rehash the data which will trigger reinserts and more equals evaluations though possibly more realistic
53056
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for
53106
get the value of assemblyqualifiedname and paste it into the typename field
53112
to give a concrete and representative example suppose i would like to use subversion and eclipse to develop plugins for wordpress
53162
i have a long line of code that i want to break up among multiple lines
53172
i want to be able to index against any word break within a line to the end of the line though lines can be several mbs long
53181
the problem is that any user can read those but only an administrator or by extension your setup install program can set them
53200
the preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using python s implied line continuation inside parentheses brackets and braces
53217
if done right the user should get the best experince out of the game without having to go into the settings screen and tweak themselves and you should have to worry less as a level designer about keeping the polygon count the same across difference scenes
53246
python developer fredrik lundh author of elementtree among other things has a function to unsecape html entities on his website which works with decimal hex and named entities beautifulsoup will not work with the hex ones
53308
you can do web service clients in .net php ruby or pretty much any modern web technology out there
53339
if you opt for the second route and need to put some of the original gui code into a controller the controller and service can communicate via wcf .net remoting or plain socket connections with a protocol you define yourself
53347
it works on my machine but when deployed to the web server the icons export print etc on the crystal report toolbar do not display or work
53359
also be aware of the affects that the current accepted solution may have on parsing hex octal and binary numbers
53359
in ruby numbers that start with 0x or 0x are hex 0b or 0b are binary and just 0 are octal
53390
1 require the rubygems package before using a gem
53464
so obviously iis is configured for asp.net automatically for .net 3.5
53471
if you are in a network you can also try debugging by getting a network trace
53475
attributes are just properties usually
53486
at university when i was doing most things under unix solaris i used gdb
53507
this is true because it uses the new abstractions classes for httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc
53519
i don t know rails specifically but i m pretty sure it has nothing to do with whether you host it via http or https
53548
we had a requirement to overload the equals operator and therefore the gethashcode function of our objects as they had become volatile and stateless and sourcing themselves directly from data so in one place of the application we needed to ensure that an object would be viewed as equal to another object if it was sourced from the same data not just if it was the same reference
53562
what are the steps required to enable hibernate s second-level cache when using the java persistence api annotated entities
53616
using a dynamic scripting language like python boo ruby etc
53639
your backend could be php or python but you want to use the controls from the asp.net toolkit is there a successful way to do this
53652
i m thinking on padding each cell with empty spaces but i also need to split some cells into multiple lines and this makes the stringbuilder approach a bit messy because the second line of text from the first column comes after the first line of text in the last column etc.
53692
as a final note the script for starting the build should always examine the environment and tell the user if any tools are missing or any machine configuration needs to be tweaked to successfully complete the build
53695
can t you live with postgresql or mysql
53715
tbaseform has oncreate and ondestroy procedures with the code to do this but if someone ie me forgot to add inherited to the oncreate on tanyotherform would delphi call it for me
53716
i use a mac therefore my windows vista and xp is virtualized in a vmware or parallels virtual machine
53753
i use a great piece of software called synergy this allows me to use one keyboard and mouse across 3 machines and use the copy paste buffer between machines including images
53766
we have perl scripts wrapping our pipeline which includes clearcase vs2005 c++ intel fortran inno setup
53787
in the end you should use the nicer build tools msbuild ant maven make ... where you can and fill the gaps for the odder tools with custom scripts
53800
it s the capability to keep running through login logout cycles i need
53802
i m currently working on a javascript tool that during the course of its execution will ultimately traverse each node in the dom
53816
one common way to do this is to use a markup language like textile markdown or bbcode
53822
since you say you have no control over it might i recommend extracting an interface from it of the methods that you do care about and making a mydbconnection extends db_connection class that implements your interface
53835
i d define building as something like preparing packaging and deploying all artifacts of a software system
53835
thus automated testcases like unit-tests - see phpunit or simpletest - and frontend-tests - see selenium are all the more important for big php projects to ensure the good health of the code
53835
there s a great build-tool like ant for java or rake for ruby for php too phing

i m trying to produce sheets of photographs with captions arranged in a grid using xslt and xsl-fo
53967
i have a class that map objects to objects but unlike dictionary it maps them both ways
53988
you ll need to escape them for php too unless you change your double-quotes to single-quotes
53989
however if you link directly to a swf file it will open in the browser window and without looking in the address bar you can t tell that it wasn t embedded in html with the size set to 100 width and height
53989
update don t get hung up on the 100+ lines i simply mean that the the amount of code needed to embed a swf is quite a lot and i mean including libraries like swfobject and it s just for displaying the swf which can be done without a single line by linking to it directly
53999
just implement the ienumerable interface no need to implement the ienumerator unless you want to do some special things in the enumerator which for your case doesn t seem to be needed

thanks to the wonders of javascript though you can just assign your own function to the write method of the document object which uses innerhtml on an element of your choosing to append the supplied content
54159
why do you want to use the asp.net ajax toolkit with php python
54159
have you considered other non asp.net specific ajax libraries like jquery dojo mootools yui
54159
asp.net ajax and the asp.net ajax toolkit is asp.net centric you ll gain more flexibility using other ajax libraries with php python
54162
note that if the user pushes a button focus on the textbox will be lost and there will be no caret position
54188
or put another way can part of the write be complete and get interrupted and then the read happen
54219
our editor works by loading a set of files deserializing them working out the relationships between them and keeping track of any bad states it can find

the standard design usually follows what getopt does there are getopt libraries for many languages .net python c perl php etc
54503
when executed via the shell script i get the following error looks like there is some problem with the process execution of svn that i use to get the log data for the revision
54527
in regards to code chunks i have found and started using a vim plug-in called snipmate which mimics textmate s snippets feature
54557
you could also use max or avg instead of min it is only important to use a function that returns the value of the column if there is only one matching row
54578
bonus for technical explanation of why the app normally writes output to the cmd shell but when stdout and or stderr are redirected then the app writes nothing to the console or to stdout stderr
54674
i m wondering if there is any nice and neat tool to replace the gnu autotools or make to build a very large c++ project which are such a complicated thing to use
54708
i can t seem to get at the data the way i would in say a datalist or a gridview and i can t seem to come up with anything else on google or quickly leverage this one to do what i want
54717
there are however languages like perl and python that are particularly suited to quickly solving problems
54717
i would suggest learning either perl or python and then use your judgement on when to use it
54720
because you re a java developer and you mention that you have java everywhere you might look at groovy
54750
perl for quick text processing php for small internal web applications .net for our main product cygwin for filesystem stuff
54782
but if i were you i would pick a scripting language like python ruby or perl and start trying to solve some of these small problems with this language
54817
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life
54819
however as this post suggests if you prefer separating your expectations from your verifications assertions you should opt for the fluent syntax
54827
since you already know java you can try jvm languages like groovy jruby beanshell etc
54827
scala has much lighter syntax than java has a repl is statically typed and runs on the jvm - you might give that a shot as well
54872
however you should really specify whether you are talking about a .net winforms application or asp.net as well as other relevant factors
55012
sql server mysql oracle and their brethren are servers
55029
i d suggest looking at the request in the code that renders the form and if it is not using ssl issue a redirect to the https url
55029
or you could just not serve up the page via http and keep it only in the document root of your https site
55041
you write your backend code in python and the frontend code in java and possibly some javascript which is then compiled to javascript
55041
you can just use json or xml interfaces just like with other ajax frameworks
55048
when i do a rename in resharper there s a checkbox below the textbox where you type the new name that says synchronise file name with class name
55093
as it turns out i can t even find an unsafe way to cast between the things

is there an easy way when the insert is executed to get what the id was set to without having to do a select statement right after the insert
55206
what is the operator precedence order in visual basic 6.0 vb6
55215
+ - binary addition subtraction
55225
when you create a cmdlet you define properties and use attributes to determine command line options
55309
svn info will tell you which revision the working copy currently is at so you know where to start looking
55324
the work around for the single source limitation is to have numbered sources so you include the source # + seq # and then each source can generate its own sequence
55324
you can have 100 uniqueness in 8 digits for 1 099 511 627 776 numbers by using a sequence and then base32 encoding it
55334
ctrl-k and ctrl-shift-k is quite handy finding next previous occurrence of the current selection or the last find if nothing is selected
55339
as jason suggested prepare a dictionary making hashtable with key being word sorted alphabetically and value word itself you may have multiple values per key
55358
because you are converting an existing site that already uses ado an ado.net dataset might be your best updgrade path
55358
ado.net and ado are similar enough that a straight update might be easier that way

for the sake of a little background i ve been avoiding using asp.net for some time because i really hate the webforms approach but jeff s prolific praise on the podcast has almost convinced me to give it a go.
55441
i usually put the source into my project and then i can get better intellisense and a better understanding of them
55450
nlog or log4net are better solutions
55466
your question assumes that mail clients follow the rfc standards for mime encoding which they don t
55486
the trick is to make sure that the constructor is private or protected if you want to inherit and that your instances are static
55489
one of the big differences i noticed between a vb6 project and the converted vb.net project winform was with the built-in controls

you can also do it another way which will reduce your excluded files folder to just one but you won t be able to manipulate any of the files it contains because the path will be corrupt but if you just want them out of your way it doesn t matter
55521
but you can extend an enum value to have properties and methods if that s what you mean
55548
the constructor for the static object was not called until the first time the function was called

instead aquire an inputstream for the data and copy the data to the servlet outputstream in pieces
55802
get itext or itextsharp from
55813
also make sure that if you allocate any system objects memory handles file handles etc. you set their owner to 0 system if you expect them to persist after you return from your notification handler
55813
if you do any network operations in the background be sure that you set the sockets to non-blocking mode and deal correctly with that
55830
you can bind to an element using elementname so if you wanted to bind the selected tree item to the itemssource of a listbox
55849
to be even sneakier you could buy an other domain and set the fso from that domain so if the user is looking for fso s set by your domain they won t see any

i would like to hook up a command to the textchanged event of a textbox to a command that is in my viewmodel class
55855
is there an easier way than subclassing the textbox and implementing icommandsource to hook up the textchanged event to my viewmodel class
55878
when the job is done simply commit or rollback if the installation fails for some reason

use a good xsd schema to create a set of classes with xsd.exe and use an xmlserializer to create a object tree out of your xml and vice versa
55904
regarding your desire to store a hash of the password if you use pbkdf2 to generate the key you could use a standard password hashing algorithm big salt a thousand rounds of hashing for that and get different values
55910
to use it you must first activate the time zone api on your account
55914
you could change this by removing the where rownum 20 and maybe add order by module
55964
how can i make a major upgrade to an installation set msi built with wix install into the same folder as the original installation
55964
the installation is correctly detected as an upgrade but the directory selection screen is still shown and with the default value not necessarily the current installation folder
55964
do i have to do manual work like saving the installation folder in a registry key upon first installing and then read this key upon upgrade
55993
a const is a compile-time constant whereas readonly allows a value to be calculated at run-time and set in the constructor or field initializer
55999
however if you really want something even faster you could include all n-grams in your pre-process where an n-gram is any string of n words in a row
56005
if we let each object of the graph serialize itself using a deserialization constructor we get a lot switches for all the different modes of deserialization
56005
another approach would be to have some sort deserialization factory classes methods one for each mode that does the serialization and deserialization externally graphserializer.serializeobjecttypex objecttypex objecttoserialze
56017
the express purpose of those projects is to allow building and running .net code on a variety of platforms including windows linux and mac osx
56041
if your code is going to be read by people who work with c c++ or if you switch between those languages and python then using for single-character strings and for longer strings might help ease the transition
56078
however since i also want to filter out duplicates i feel like i ll end up with a foreach that calls contains on the collection
56109
we checked them all out but after careful consideration we decided to roll our own with a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild and msdeploy
56109
versions the dlls with the current major minor version and svn revision 1.2.0.423

wcf communication options in the .net framework 3.5
56137
there is also .net remoting which i found quite cool but i guess they are obsoleting it now that they have wcf
56164
on julian dominguez s blog you ll find an article about how to do something very similar in silverlight which should be easily adaptable to wpf
56164
if it is add a handler to the textchanged event on the textbox that will call the command specified in the property
56227
i would like to start tagging my deployed binaries with the latest svn revision number
56227
however because svn is file-based and not directory project-based i need to scan through all the directory s and subdirectory s files in order to determine the highest revision number
56241
svn info will show you the working copy s revision number see the revision line in the output from svn info
56258
here s part of our build script our c# application gets the svn revision number included
56266
since we re a .net shop the obvious traditional way would be to do that in asp.net
56269
another way is using the e factory builder from lxml available in elementtree too
56299
that means hooking into the expand event of the tree nodes
56313
anyway do you think that could be a problem regarding vcs like subversion cvs git etc
56337
the repository is in charge of mapping between the business objects and my entity framework objects

are there any methods to set a data breakpoint in the code so that it tells me where in the code the variables were actually changed but without hooking up a debugger
56366
if administration portal is part of application and will only be used from computers where your application is installed there are plenty of advantages of going fully silverlight - or even wpf
56368
i would definitely go for a full silverlight application specially if you have good experience from wpf
56368
you will be able to reuse your knowledge from wpf and should be able to pick up silverlight fairly quickly
56368
silverlight also has all the hooks needed for great accessibility support as the ui automation api from wpf is brought into silverlight
56371
if you re determined to have rich-client style development and your audience is small for admins only then i d probably recommend wpf over silverlight as it currently provides a richer set of tools and controls

there might be a perfectly good library that i can t use in my commercial application because of a viral license gpl vs lgpl
56436
let s just remember that competitive advantage is not always almost never in the big scheme of things due to software and thus many many people can use existing components without risking their business
56460
you could check that the standard deviation looks reasonable that the min is reasonable and the max value as well
56460
but we also can t just add various measurements like this ad infinitum since given enough statistics any particular shuffle will appear highly unlikely for some reason this is one of very few shuffles in which cards x y z appear in order
56463
also if you re using a shell such as bash in cygwin and you re familiar with emacs consider using eshell the emacs shell instead
56464
the only changes you would need in your mvc app would be to handle the ajax requests and return the data as json xml etc
56487
i m using fox since foxpro 2.5 to visual foxpro 9 and you are never forced in any way to hard-code a path you can use set path to syourpath you can embed the icons and bitmaps in your exe app file and therefore there s no need of including this resources externally
56498
as a more draconian approach you can always write a submit trigger which will reject submission of change-lists if they contain a certain file or files with a certain extension etc

as an aside rather than using a datatable you can set the datasource of the datagridview to a bindingsource object with the datasource of the bindingsource object set to a bindinglist your class which you populate by passing an ilist into the constructor
56632
the great thing about using the rails activerecord as a model in mvc is that it gives you an automatic orm object relational mapper and easy way to create associations between models
56632
you definitely want to strive to keep all of your business logic in your models or presenters and out of your controllers skinny controller fat model
56682
scanning an entire directory recursively will not work for me because the folder is much too large
56695
you can speed this up by using the archive bit though it may mess up your backup software so proceed carefully
56695
scan all the files - any with the archive bit set have changed

since you mentioned fork i assume you re on a unix-like system in which case posix threads usually referred to as pthreads are what you want to use
56896
the only solution i was able to find since the owner of the web service was unwilling to change anything on his end was to write a handler class that axis would plug into the pipeline which would delete the bom from the message if it existed
56900
you can use a combination of strtotime mktime and date todo the arithmetic
56904
board provides both the height and width properties and threedboard provides the z axis

i ve got a collection that implements an interface that extends both ilist t and list
57078
for microsoft sql server there is the northwind sample db and adventureworks
57091
the parent has to have a fixed width and height
57091
the header will contain a set of filtering controls like textboxes drop down lists and a filter button that should wrap to the next line if there is insufficient horizontal space so its height can change any time to accomodate line breaking
57104
btw i want to be using postgresql and or mysql as the backend database

i would like to put a link to a webpage in an alert dialog box so that i can give a more detailed description of how to fix the error that makes the dialog box get created
57226
also adding more logic to your code for a hybrid solution just isn t worth it taking into account your small data set and the high-quality of java s collection api
57227
another benefit is in code terseness you lose the need to set properties in 7 lines of code and then call a method on that object in the 8th line
57291
i was hoping there would be a similar mechanism for websphere that doesn t involve calling the ibm libraries or rely on rad to be installed on your workstation
57310
one way to do it could be using jython or jacl scripts
57310
edit especially the wsadminlib.py.zip download near the bottom of the page contains a huge set of examples and helper functions to get you started
57316
interfaces are fixed you release an interface as a contract for a set of functionality that any type can implement
57320
if you have a few spare cycles you could migrate a separate branch of your apps in your scm which is running with the 3.5 runtime and when you actually need to upgrade you have a working branch assuming that you keep it up-to-date with some bi-weekly merge
57358
my solution is to arrange my normal windows exactly like i want them then start debugging an application and once again arrange all of the windows the way i want usually making it as similar to my normal layout as possible then stopping the debugger and doing a file exit so that vs saves my settings
57392
a benefit to having a dba involved in security logic for your application is that the different app features and roles can be partitioned in the database down to views so that even if dynamic sql and generic select statements are needed the damage from an sql vulnerability can be constrained
57399
maybe you could set a cookie with a value that you associate with the email and put something up on the login registration page if you were unable to deliver the mail

a classic simple mistake homebrew output filters make is to catch only and but miss things like which can break user-controlled output out into the attribute space of an html tag where javascript can be attached to the dom
57439
my problem is that createinstance fails with a no parameterless constructor defined for this object error unless i pass true on the non-public parameter
57463
if you absolutely require that the constructor be private you can try something like this

one alternative would be to uses boolean variables in if statements but these would need to be reset after every use
57641
phped also offers great debugging and profiling and the ability to add watches breakpoints etc in php code
57720
it takes into account the fact that datediff computes the difference without considering what month or day it is so the month diff between 8 31 and 9 1 is 1 month and handles that with a case statement that decrements the result where appropriate

mef s heritage ala prism certainly shows through but i think it would be odd if it didn t given that both frameworks are about composition
57912
when the user changes the list of valid entries for a field if they remove one of the valid values they are allowed to choose a new valid value to map any rows that have this now invalid value in it so that they now have a valid value again

microsoft generally doesn t use the term virtual machine in reference to a .net managed execution environment
57936
.net s bytecode il is somewhat different from java bytecode in that it was explicitly designed to be compiled into native code prior to execution in the managed environment whereas java was designed to be interpreted but the concept of platform-independent code is similar
57936
a compiled c# .exe contains platform-independent code that can be run in any .net-compatible environment including mono
57947
i m really confused by the various configuration options for .net configuration of dll s asp.net websites etc in .net v2 - especially when considering the impact of a config file at the ui end-user end of the chain
57980
you could still use the config file s appsettings element or even roll your own configurationelementcollection configurationelement and configurationsection subclasses
58044
keep in mind any app can create its own set of registry keys and values so it s not just ms who would be necessary to such an effort
58055
i was just saying that in my limited experience with linux the segment base is always zero
58124
to me the best java - json parser is xstream yes i m really talking about json not about xml
58125
python developer fredrik lundh author of elementtree among other things has such a function on his website which works with decimal hex and named entities
58167
so difference between override and reintroduce is in polymorphism
58168
unlike java where there are exceptions that must be declared to be raised and some that don t have to be but that s another story any python code may raise any exception at any time
58175
you might take a look at free pascal as it includes a 64 bit version and is mostly delphi compatible syntax
58195
fdt enterprise also supports debugging including breakpoints and stepping through your code not just trace
58197
localsystem definitely has the privileges to install applications that s how windows update and software deployment in active directory work so it should be able to uninstall as well
58218
mxml just provides a quick way to build the ui etc but if you want to do it yourself with actionscript there s nothing stopping you this would also probably be easier if you already have that ui in as2 code
58232
the way we use it is to replace users inputs by automating mouse mouse and clicks and keyboard presses
58242
i actually wrote another post on stack overflow asking if there are other better approaches unsafe c# and pointers for 2d rendering good or bad
58248
unless you re using some really esoteric browser features in general if something works in firefox i ve found it works without modification in windows safari
58280
is it possible to use an unhandledexception handler in a windows service
58280
this component adds a handler to system.appdomain.currentdomain.unhandledexception but as far as i can tell this doesn t achieve anything win a windows service so i end up with this pattern in my 2 or 4 service entry points
58301
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

write a c# method that takes a string which contains a set of words a sentence and rotates those words x number of places to the right
58363
i would recommend memcached or apc
58369
then there s an ie way to get the cursor position that also works in opera and an easier way in firefox
58375
if its something that will take fewer lines of clr code to tackle it string manipulation complex custom sorting or filtering etc. use this approach
58398
if you plan on working off of the laptop by itself without external mouse kb monitor more than 60 of the time than the macbook pro with it s larger keyboard and monitor would be better suited
58432
i m assuming you would like to be ablt to use if globally or at least in ie firefox not just be installing safari as other have suggested
58441
in reality you would write this in a more generic way to reuse the same algorithm but abstract away the data type doesn t have to be strings and the operation doesn t have to be concatenation with a comma in the middle
58443
suppose you have a textbox in a window and a toolbar with a save button in it
58443
in that situation if you edit the textbox and click the save button with the mouse there is a problem
58443
when clicking on a button in a toolbar the textbox does not lose focus
58477
as tyler commented you can run moss wss on vista but it s not supported
58500
if you want to manipulate the camera directly from your code you must use the quicktime capture apis or the cocoa qtkit capture wrapper much better

most languages nowadays - perl mention by jon ericson php javascript - have a join function or method and this is by far the most elegant solution
58537
his widgetholder takes a reference to a value object in the constructor
58537
as soon as the constructor returns that passed-by-value object will be destroyed and so you ll hold a reference to a destroyed object

easy just set height and width to 100
58620
remark using use_cw_default for width and height results in a 0 0 size button so that s not a solution

how do i make an md5 hash of a string with delphi
58630
i ve been through the source of the e-mail and i ve broken each line longer than 76 characters into two lines with a cr+lf in between but that hasn t fixed the problem
58637
that ll paste the second-last yanked lines line 1-4
58638
how do i take a set of polygons which contain arbitrary values and create a corresponding bitmap where each pixel contains the value of the polygon at that location
58689
to get your own dialog base units you have to retrieve current text metrics with gettextmetrics and use character height and average width tmheight and tmavecharwidth of the textmetric struct respectively and translate them with muldiv by your own unless you are in a dialog then mapdialogrect will do all the job for you
58689
if buttons are the only control you want to resize automatically you can also use bcm_getidealsize message button_getidealsize macro windows xp and up only to retrieve optimal width and height that fits anything the button contains though it looks pretty ugly without any margins applied around the button s text
58701
there s no particular python output mode but you can apparently improve the results by setting optmize_output_java to yes

flex seems to be thier name for the flex builder ide based on eclipse and the general approach of building flash files using mxml and actionscript rather than the normal flash tools
59093
i think the mxml and actionscript approach flex is designed to appeal much more to programmers where as the flash side is designed more to appeal to graphic designers
59132
they all support junit and most support testng as well

ios 5 includes messaging for ipod touch and ipad devices so while i ve not yet tested this myself it may be that all ios devices will be able to send sms via mfmessagecomposeviewcontroller
59200
keep in mind that this won t work on phones without ios 4 and it won t work on the ipod touch or the ipad except perhaps under ios 5
59225
if you don t specify an encoding when you use most text i o classes you will write utf-8 with no bom and read by first checking for a bom then assuming utf-8 i know for sure streamreader and streamwriter behave this way. this is pretty safe for dumb text editors that won t understand a bom but kind of cruddy for smarter ones that could display utf-8 or the situation where you re actually writing characters outside the standard ascii range

we use a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild to generate a release version of the app
59303
as we re executing if one of the statements fail i do a rollback instead of a commit
59307
we use a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild to generate a release version of the app
59314
using these with recursion you can generate a sequence of numbers or text values fairly easily
59322
is there any difference to the results or performance if i replace the count with count x
59332
s the difference between count column and count
59345
skype uses postgresql together with python and they have improved pl python to it s current state so i would doubt that python support is far behind perl
59369
another minor difference between using and a specific column is that in the column case you can add the keyword distinct and restrict the count to distinct values
59385
the major performance difference is that count can be satisfied by examining the primary key on the table
59389
this can be done with simple on insert triggers which in turn call dblink to update another copy
59391
in the referenced question it was asked what the difference was when using count and count somecolumnname and sqlmenace s answer was spot on
59412
that may have been the case long long ago but any self-respecting query optimizer will choose some fast method to count the rows in the table - there is no performance difference between

i did the parsing of the user-agent string at the page level but of course you could do this kind of logic in the httpmodule or httphandler level also
59480
this is likely due to blocking from one of the controls wrapping it my gut feeling is that it s the popupcontrolextender - it tends to have odd behavior with updatepanels as it is intended to manage the events inside it for it s show hide purposes

i have set up 3 laptops with linux 2 ubuntu and 1 fedora 8
59644
that is how i found the linux distribution that would run on my laptop ubuntu
59652
if you combined this with an asp updateprogress control and wrapped the whole thing in an updatepanel you should get something close to what you re looking for - especially if you rigged the js function called in onload to only show one panel and call a return function that showed the next etc
59653
is there a way to get at the itemcontaner of a selected item in a listbox
59653
i m trying to resize the listbox item when it is unselected to a specific size and when selected to a variable size

would using wsdualhttpbinding for duplex callbacks work in real-world scenarios
59739
the much easier one assuming you sending back to some sort of scripting language to proces the page php perl asp cf et
59764
note that the bindingconfiguration attribute should be empty if the service is accessed via http instead of https when testing on local machine with no certs
59767
i m not sure about mysql but in oracle such a function would be similar to this one you ll have to change the table and field names
59809
the value of an autonumber field
59829
you select one of them then click a next step button and the page posts back and shows a new radio button list for step 2
59829
now if i click a previous step button i can easily get the previous list of options to display but i can not for some reason get one of the radio buttons to be selected

ie will recognize localhost as being in your local trusted zone and will automatically pass your xp login credentials through when integrated windows auth is enabled
60012
are you trying to assign the value of an identity field to a variable or something else before you have saved the record
60012
for whatever reason your app is trying to read the value of the identity field before the record has been saved which is what generates that identity field
60012
in other words no value exists for the autonumber field until the row is saved
60027
also iteration over a set isn t random
60051
another method i ve seen used is to simply pass a reference to this into the class object you are creating and just catch it with a constructor argument
60075
not sure if they keep track of the tree of process spawning i think it depends on what os you use but since when you kill bash or any shell all running children are also killed i think unix like systems do keep track of this
60078
if you re using linux or anything which implements the unix apis when a process calls fork to create a child process the parent receives the child pid as the return code or -1 if the fork failed
60094
i usually break down any project like this into a set of smaller projects like
60137
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it
60141
the trick is that on the client side this custom field shows up as a property of the document the value of which you can easily embed into the document s contents
60155
slicehost referral link if you so choose offers reverse dns multiple ips 2 month ip ubuntu debian along with others
60158
if you have access to some profiling tools such as those in the team suite edition of visual studio you can try to set up a testing server and running some synthetic requests against it and see if there s any specific part of the code taking unreasonably long to run
60232
pwd doesn t work as the current dir is not necessarily the directory with the script
60233
obviously this would create a new list which contains each member of the set so not great if your set is very large

essentially i want postgresql without all the configuration and installation
60302
however i can t find a way to seamlessly connect those streams to system.in system.out and system.err

you will then have access to cat grep find gzip tar less and hundreds of others
60316
you don t use an img tag but an element with a background-image css attribute and set the background-position on hover
60353
this is probably a combination of impersonation and a mismatch of different authentication methods occurring
60368
in addition i want to add a continuous integration server but i do not know of any continuous integration servers that are offered as a web service
60377
if you have a xsd for your xml then you can import that into your database and you can then build indexes for your xml data

i want to implement an isapi filter like feature using httpmodule in iis7 running under iis integrated request processing pipeline mode
60676
from the internet the controller s purpose is to respond to the action requested by the user take any parameters the user has set process the data interact with the model and then pass the requested data in final form off to the view.
60677
for added fun consider what happens if you have a static c++ object with constructor destructor declared in a shared data segment
60678
if cross database queries linked servers are an option you could do this with a stored procedure that copies the records from parent child in db a into temporary tables on db b and then add a column for the new primary key in the temp child table that you would update after inserting the headers
60709
or you can move the lines for instance move lines 10-15 below line 20
60717
to select the line or lines you want to move
60718
what i do is starting with the cursor at the start of the line in some editors you have to press home twice to do this hold shift and press down until all lines that i want to delete are selected
60728
i would suggest storing your custom data in httpcontext or global application object or your database from your httpmodule and then reading that shared value in the aspx page
60730
you only want to encode and decode where you actually need it not everything
60730
and you re going to need different encode decode functions anyways
60794
what happens instead now is that the li you clicked the button of gets to be the selected word and the suggestions disappear
60815
i know that postgresql and mysql have the ability to order by a random function so you can use this in sqlalchemy
60836
excessive inlining of functions can increase size of compiled executable which can have negative impact on cache performance but nowadays compiler decide about function inlining on their own depending on many criterias and ignore inline keyword
60862
there is a proposal pep 372 to add an ordered dictionary that keeps track of the order of insertion to the collections module in the standard library
60864
it is important to use a well known hash function such as md5 or sha-1 implemented in a library
60873
this is regardless of the processor as afaik even processors with modulus operators are a few cycles slower for divide as opposed to mask operations
60893
in my application i have textbox in a formview bound to a linqdatasource like so

however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change
60922
when you try to send packets to any address in your private network 192.168.50.0 - 192.168.50.255 your ip stack will look in the routing table and see a directly connected network and forward traffic via the private nic

git mercurial of bazaar are examples of source code control tools that are not intrusive because you do not need to set up a master server
60978
i m using terminals for remote connection via telnet rdc ssh ..
60983
it also adds great flexibility and functionality to the detailsview formview gridview and listview controls in the form of smart validation and the ability to easily change the display of these controls using templates
60984
i don t use windows - but surely there is something like awk or grep that you can use to find the future timestamped files and then touch them so they have the right time - even a perl script
61025
there was some ability to enable this in the .net 3.0 release of wcf but with the release of .net 3.5 it was more mature
61029
in order for the #make and #model divs to sit side by side with out the use of floats they must be displayed as inline elements so add display inline to both #make and #model note that this will lose the vertical margin on those elements so you might need to make some other changes to get the exact layout you want
61029
as select elements are displayed inline by default an alternative to the last step is to remove the #make and #model divs and and apply the show and hide classes to the model select element directly
61044
however let me be more specific assuming that you re running on a unix-based system such as linux or bsd or mac osx
61050
triggers are the best tool for annotating data when a table is changed by insert update or delete
61061
in effect you want a transient heap and a persistent heap or heaps that group things of similar lifetimes
61089
a further and perhaps subtle difference is that in some database implementations the count is computed by looking at the indexes on the table in question rather than the actual data rows
61104
while you can use the height and width attributes in the img tag this does not change the size of the images that is downloaded to the browser
61113
or if you want to branch out any of python c# java ruby would be excellent choices
61114
python and ruby seem to have the most traction in the linux unix etc space
61117
having said that python or ruby may be a better compromise between expressiveness and popularity
61124
the embedded device will use a mips powerpc or arm cpu but won t have enough cpu power memory or storage to compile its own kernel in a reasonable amount of time
61138
java c# ruby python and javascript are probably the big choices before you
61138
python and ruby take a step away from static typing into a world where you can call and method on any object and fail at runtime if it s not there
61138
performance is the main downfall with python being somewhat faster than ruby as i understand it
61138
to choose between them you d probably choose ruby if you re interesting in web development for the ruby on rails framework community and otherwise go with python
61138
smalltalk - more or less in the ruby and python camp and significantly faster as i understand it
61191
we have a simple spring-hibernate application console app where in we have set the classpath in manifest file of the executable jar file
61192
i recommend python as it s not only a sexy language but also very widely used and easy to integrate with c++ through boost.python
61196
you can also extend inherit classes and override properties methods using the prototype chain spoon16 alluded to
61196
in addition we add some other properties to the child class
61211
an example on the ui side would be asp.net mvc vs webforms vs monorail
61218
if you want to be super-modern consider a distributed versioning system such as git bazaar or mercurial
61218
trac mantis and bugzilla are widespread open-source choices
61237
i use explicit checks that throw exceptions on public and protected methods and assertions on private methods
61248
as a side bonus silverlight is based on wpf and starting with either lets you gain the know how for working with the other
61258
the closest to cross-platform i ve seen is fam which seems to work for linux bsd and irix but i m not how easy it would be to port it to windows and macos
61277
like mdbg or even windbg
61317
it seems that silverlight wpf are the long term future for user interface development with .net
61317
but looking at wpf xaml silverlight they seem very large technologies and so where is the best place to get start
61325
on the router set up port forwarding for each of the computers with vnc for example
61334
this release of enterprise library includes application blocks for caching cryptography data access exception handling logging policy injection security and validation
61336
silverlight is a stripped down version of wpf so it should have fewer things to learn inside
61336
still silverlight is pretty much a moving target much more than wpf so you ll have to keep up with some changes from time to time the joys of being an early adopter
61380
i have programmed with wpf and silverlight before
61380
but as silverlight is a subset of wpf if you go in too deep and try to switch to writing silverlight applications you ll be scratching your heads looking for that tag you learned to love in wpf but is not available in silverlight
61380
when you master the basic things in silverlight first the extra mechanism trigger whatever features in wpf will simply add to most of what you ve already known
61380
silverlight in wpf differs at the features level not just some missing controls or animations
61380
take the wpf triggers mechanism for example is not available fully in silverlight
61383
coming from a symfony php and django python background they both have excellent admin generators
61432
at the moment i click in a little cell to see what s there then i click in some other little cell that it references then i click in 3 other cells that it uses and fairly quickly i m lost in a maze of twisty little cells all alike
61438
you will tend to rely on width margin and padding to define the spacing and layout of the elements to the other elements around it be they or otherwise html is mostly semantic at this point
61446
dynamically evaluated expressions embedded code written in a concise programming language perl python ruby are preferred
61447
textmate s snippets are the most closest match but it is not a cross-platform solution and not for emacs
61448
in addition to tools- auditing- trace precedents you can use ctl+ grave accent to toggle formula display
61462
in this example var is an array and the contents can be accessed using the construct var index where index is the array index starts with 0
61503
the aim of the new automatic properties is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write when you just have a simple property that doesn t need any special logic in the get or the set
61522
so can extend this to only return data attributes and not methods by defining your props function like this
61538
this link will allow you to validate the link against the rss atom specifications using the w3c specs but does require you to manually enter the url
61546
theres also a find feed function that searches for rss feeds based on a keyword
61612
for example ada has a native data type that is a restricted integer where you define an integer variable and explicitly indicate that it will only and always be within a certain numeric range
61664
also of interest is that he used a continuation passing style lexer parser instead of the more typical lex or regex based lexers that you ll see in the wild
61692
i ve also tried using the exit handler on my main application ui window but it has no way to pause or halt shutdown as far as i can tell
61713
when you start trying to do things that become difficult in shell-script i would strongly suggest looking into rewriting the script in a proper scripting language python perl ruby etc
61734
ruby will expose you to more concepts than python does due to it being more liberal in how it handles things like lambda functions code blocks eval and so on
61750
method should work for mainstream engines - mssql2000+ oracle mysql etc
61795
i m looking for a java profiler that works well with the jvm coming with websphere 6.0.2 ibm jvm 1.4.2
61795
i use yourkit for my usual profiling needs but it specifically refuses to work with this old jvm i m sure the authors had their reasons...
61870
i d like to add the order total as a property of my order class
61873
here the redirection 2 1 which sets file descriptor 2 stderr to point to the same stream as file descriptor 1 stdout gets evaluated before the redirection dev null which sets file descriptor 1 to point to dev null
61873
the effect is that what you write to stderr gets sent to stdout and what you write to stdout gets thrown away
61891
the thing that would put me off that idea is that for general use any binary data would get copied over anytime it changed whereas the text content scm systems are based around can easily be updated in the form of diffs
61906
the bar member of foo is a proxy object in our case javassist proxy but it can be cglib one depending on the bytecode provider you use that is not initialized
61924
you can set a simple rule described in your header file that any variables to be accessed external to the class must be accessed via the property or by using custom methods on the class to affect values
61994
then you should really consider using some type of fixed point arbitrary-precision number package java bignum python decimal module otherwise you ll be in for a world of hurt
62017
i m interested in learning more about asterisk open source pbx so i thought i would try building a hobby system for my home

currently the videos are in the flv container format but transcoding is an option
62077
we re looking for a transformation library or engine which can read any input edifact files csv xml stuff like that
62079
i am trying to get some accurate runtime comparisons of php vs python and potentially any other language that i have to include
62097
you should generally know why you re optimizing code as in a specific task in your existing codebase is taking too long not i heard php is slower than python
62099
i have done some tests in java and the first run is always slowest due to the jit doing its job and the same sort of hit may exist in php python and any other languages you try
62102
i want to know what exactly is the sequence of calls that occurs when a getter setter created through class methodmaker is called
62165
if you re trying to change the root element of a document you don t really need to-- just throw out the existing document and replace it
62169
utcnow only means subtract my timezone from the time
62198
personally i feel that you can get pretty far by checking that you get the right results 1+1 should return 2 in a addition function trying out all the boundary conditions you can think of such as using two numbers of which the sum is greater than the integer max value in the add function and forcing error conditions such as network failures
62207
i m always amazed that more people don t know about use ndepend - it shows all dependencies at every level of your code and will even draw pretty box and arrow pictures showing how confused your architecture really is together with testdriven.net i can t imagine working without it any more
62237
the zend feed class of the zend-framework can automatically parse a webpage and list the available feeds
62310
if the line height was increased same effect though font-size with less words per line this becomes less of an issue
62336
the short version is to place a vbscript stop statement or jscript debugger at the beginning of the procedure before any statements that you will want to step through
62362
it means a layout which adjusts dynamically to the browser or whatever client width and height to make efficient use of all available screen space as opposed to mostly fixed width layouts which are made to fit a common denominator resolution at that particular time 800x600 used to be the norm for websites for many years
62377
there s a osx distribution of ies4 linux called ies4osx which has worked fine for me without any configuration
62396
to call perl from c++ you need to use the api as someone else mentioned
62396
note that if you want to embed perl in a c++ program you might have to recompile it anyway to have the same compilation flags on perl and on your program
62477
according to brief googling no personal experience with this aptana now supports python development via pydev
62513
having created a typical api using specific calls for specific functions i am considering simplifying the api by using a rest type api get put post delete or crud type create read update delete interface
62593
is it possible to reload a schema file without having to restart mysqld
62649
however we thankfully don t see much 16-bit any more and when 64-bit started to get popular people were more concerned with making it compatible with older software and 32-bit had been around so long that for most compilers an int is just assumed to be 32 bits
62659
using the stl or boost are quite good approaches if you don t know beforehand how many entries you will have in each dimension of the array because they will give you dynamic memory allocation and i recommend either of these approaches if your data set is to remain largely static or if it to mostly only receive new entries and not many deletions
62680
then your class is already a dictionary and if you want you can override getattr and or setattr to call through and set the dict
62684
depending on who s writing the code some people change the meaning of the getter setter methods
62698
if on the other hand you are doing something clever like encrypting and decrypting the password in the getter setter then give it a test
62732
you need to put your own trace logging in to create some chatter
62737
beside activemq which should work for your demands you could also take a look at rabbitmq or openamq
62762
mp3wrap would be ideal for this - it s designed to join together mp3 files without needing to decode + re-encode the data which would result in a loss of audio quality and will also deal with the id3 tags intelligently
62770
so far i see a very large difference the approach using something like ext and others like jquery ui scriptaculous mochikit etc
62797
use almost any character in the current code page for a name including unicode characters and characters in the extended character set 128 255 except for the following
62797
characters whose integer representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed
62821
for restful web services in java also check out the restlet api which provides a very powerful and flexible abstraction for rest web services both server and client in a container or standalone and also integrates nicely with spring and json

login works perfectly but when i try to logout i get this error message from the rubycas-server
63039
try setinterval or settimeout
63044
i usually don t test setter getter but lets says you make one for user.name which concatenate first and last name i would write a test so if someone change the order for last and first name at least he would know he changed something that was tested
63084
the multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex
63084
even if the thread gets the mutex and then calls a function that further modifies the object and gets puts the protector mutex around its own operations the operations should still be safe because they re all happening under a single thread
63124
if you want to break up a single line into multiple lines you can finish a line with the character which means the current line effectively continues from the first non-whitespace character of the next line
63125
in the case of a normal round each scoresheet contains a non-ordered set of m couples m the number of couples entered into the round - exact value determined by the competition organiser

when you send more data on that stream anyway the peer rejects it with an rst to let you know it isn t listening
63184
you can use annotations to define precisely the structure mapping of the xml and your objects
63185
note that this does not remove revision from revision history in svn repository
63187
if you are iterating through any kind of a result set and performing operations on said results for e.g within a for each and if one particular result caused a problem its rather useful in capturing an expected error via try-catch logging it and moving on to the next result via continue
63224
then find an interpreter in plain c for the iphone and one in java for android. scheme lisp and javascript could fit the bill
63228
you should be able to make a usercontrol that has a textbox and button on it and embed that in the datagridview

raphael is a javascript framework for manipulating vector graphics either with svg or vml depending on what the browser supports
63376
in this way reintroduce is a little bit like declaring a parameterless constructor as private in c#

it has apis for writing plugins in several langauges python ruby perl as well as its own extension language vimscript
63416
do a cat -v press shift-enter then enter then ctrl - d and then tell us what is output
63469
if you need to store an integer in memory in your application and you are concerned about the amount of memory used then you could go with int16 since it uses less memeory and has a smaller min max range than int32 which is what int is.
63480
you only need to do the cast if you want the result as a boolean value if you are happy with an int this works
63511
version control - there are lots of emacs bindings for various vcs backends cvs sccs rcs svn git all come to mind
63527
this is prone to casting errors though if the array contains non-int elements
63560
the c# way gives you the right information but the vb way is what users of vba or vb6 will expect
63679
there are 2 jvms for winmo mysaifu for j2se and ibm websphere everyplace micro environment for j2me
63719
i am using the out of the box dhcp client on freebsd which is derived from openbsd s and based on the isc s dhclient and this is the out of the box behavior
63720
we recently migrated the back-end server in our largest office -- new york -- from a msc cluster to a new virtual machine hosted on vmware s esx technology
63739
we have an existing load balanced system where we have the load balanced nic s going into a vlan to keep the traffic separate and we ve turned off the mac address to ip mapping in order to reduce the problem
63769
i like scite as a basic editor for c++ python on linux
63784
i heard that python and lua can be integrated into a c++ app but i do not know how to do this to achieve my goals
63787
i talked to a few friends that say drupal is amazing and that it is way better than joomla
63812
it s also not portable it crashes on solaris but some alloca implementations might return an error here or call malloc
63813
yeah as other mentioned here silverlight is a subset of wpf
63821
the b element represents a span of text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance such as key words in a document abstract product names in a review or other spans of text whose typical typographic presentation is boldened
63834
guide a friend by phone through installing mercurial tortoisehg creating a repository and setting it up for working together using seperate push his and pull mine repositories - after installing it only once on a windows machine i only run gnu linux
63865
it makes it very simple to integrate lua in your c++ code and vice versa
63865
it is also possible to expose whole c++ classes to be used in lua
63870
i need to split it in 150 files of 2 million lines with each output line being alternatively the first 5 characters or the last 5 characters of the source line
63877
there s also the pv command - available in debian ubuntu repostitories which shows you the throughput of your pipes
63878
i have a report in reporting services and when i preview it the headers for a table wrap but when i export it to excel the don t
63879
you might look at the groovy syntax which is an extension of the java language to support closures right now
63901
this second link contains links to other posts where the author shows how to use other java classes natively to gain either functionality or speed over cf functions
63904
in any case just running the compiler will be non-trivial as your build system probably sets a bunch of preprocessor defines and build variables that need to be set for the compile to succeed
63904
there are native versions of scons and cmake but those will try to use vs so that won t help you
63918
i m a front-end developer and i was looking for opinions about the best all-round online documentation for javascript css html xhtml dom browser quirks and support
63932
your best bet is to embed either lua www.lua.org or python www.python.org
63932
interfacing to c++ objects will be a bit more work on your end but you can look up how to do this on google or on lua or python discussion forums
63944
run as network service which is also a low privilege account but one that retains the computers network credentials
63944
a disadvantage to using another domain account is the overhead of managing those accounts especially since each service for each developer should ideally have unique credentials so you do not have any leaks if a developer were to leave
63964
even with really really big spaces like md5 128 bits there are still two strings that can generate the same resulting hash
63972
can delphi call win32 dlls and or functions directly like vb6 can
63984
the system.security.cryptography namespace contains multiple classes which can do hashing for you such as md5 which will probably hash them better than you could yourself and will take much less effort
63996
i would go with chart as an itemscontrol and its itemspanel be a canvas for some light use i would go with grid as itemspanel
64000
when launching a process from java both stderr and stdout can block on output if i don t read from the pipes
64043
then set the default value to from query and set the dataset and value field to the appropriate values
64083
you can place the databound field within the body of the report as a hidden textbox and then in the header place another textbox with it s value pointed at the the one hidden within the body
64092
as clearly stated in the winhttpgetproxyforurl docs it works only with http and https schemes so it fails with file
64098
ie has problems with the hover pseudo-class on anything other than anchor elements so you need to change the element the hover is affecting to the anchor itself
64103
i ve only worked with moss 2007 and sharepoint designer though - i m not sure about wss
64110
in python arguments are passed by reference but in the sense of java not c++
64120
we are using netbeans as ide win mac linux solaris if you are used to eclipse or visual studio there is a good chance you will like it
64142
edit fixed definitions of add and subtract for
64145
just have two threads one reading from stdout one from stderr
64151
it would add one more layer but might solve your problem if no one finds the reverse layout order switch soon enough
64165
then we can run any consecutive set of scripts to skip from some existing version to the new version
64182
have a different control for each data set and show hide the controls
64183
set the redirecterrorstream property on processbuilder to send stderr output to stdout
64186
you will find that as you read code written by others it is easier to grok than code in say perl or php
64191
next show the page header by right clicking in the report area with the designer
64195
is what you want basically a class that can reset an instance object to a set of default values
64195
how about just providing a reset method that resets the properties of your object to whatever is the default
64253
make ant maven or any other build
64262
if you want to find out if two files contain the same set of lines but in a different order you can use a regular hash function on each line individually then combine them with a function where ordering doesn t matter like addition
64265
if the lines are fairly long you could just keep a list of the hashes of each line -- sort those and compare with previous outputs
64285
if you add up the ascii values of each character you d get the same result regardless of order
64360
when i cut kill text in emacs 22.1.1 in its own window on x in kde on kubuntu i can t paste yank it in any other application
64362
i have corporate proxy that supports https but not http connect even after authentication
64362
it just gives 403 forbidden in response anything but http or https urls

bouml is a free uml 2 tool box under development allowing you to specify and generate code in c++ java idl php and python
64378
bouml runs under unix linux solaris macos x power pc and intel and windows
64380
the blog author did an inconsistent job of adding categories to posts so while some of them had legitimate categories in their urls at least half are uncategorised
64412
from the reference to kate i take it you re on linux or similar and probably using emacs in x one way or another.
64415
is it on linux unix macosx windows ms-dos
64422
don t count the cpu line which is a combination of the cpun lines
64422
next you need to know that the fourth number in these lines is a measure of idle time and thus the fourth number on the cpu line is the total idle time for all processors since boot time
64422
edit remember that when you calculate your process s cpu utilization you have to take into account 1 the number of threads in your process and 2 the number of processors in the system
64446
if you get a positive you could compare the actual data to make sure it s not a false positive - though this would be extremely rare you could go with a quicker hash algorithm like md5 or crc instead of something like sha which is slower but less likely to collide just so it s quick and then compare the actual data when you get a hit
64469
i have a vb6 program that someone recently helped me convert to vb.net
64475
perl and python both use separate language constructs for lists and maps resulting in more copying and potentially confusing transformations
64523
there is also at a lower level the lwjgl library which jmonkeyengine is built on which is a set of apis to wrap opengl as well as provide other game specific libs.
64535
the best two technologies available for you for the .net client are microsoft web service enhancements wse and windows communication foundation wcf
64543
if your switch statement contains any code to actually handle the messages than you would be better off breaking them out
64590
do however use maven or ivy for ant builds to keep track of what versions of external libraries your project uses
64596
minimizing and then restoring the windows initiates a redraw event in the browser s rendering engine
64596
subtract the height of the old content node from the current scroll position reseting the browser s scroll to the content node s 0 change the node content then add the new node s height to the scroll position
64596
palehorse is right though i can t vote his answer up at the moment - no points an abstraction library like jquery dojo or even prototype can often help with these matters
64600
if you re porting vb to vb.net you should probably go ahead and use the datetime.today property rather than the vb6 compatability code
64604
there is also boost while not a gui library boost is a really great complement to c++ s stl
64605
is it possible to use both jscript and vbscript in the same hta
64605
can i call vbscript functions from jscript and vice-versa
64605
are there any gotchas like the jscript running first and the vbscript running second classic asp pages have this issue
64638
edit the specific gotcha of all jscript being executed first then vbscript is related to how asp processes scripts
64643
there are a number of open source cross-domain sso packages such as josso opensso cas shibboleth and others
64644
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim
64682
you can use either lua or python
64682
lua is more lightweight than python
64682
python and ironpython are other choices but based on experience they seem more heavy handed than lua
64696
if you want to do real tdd read test first with the red green refactor steps then you also have to start using mocks stubs when you want to test integration points
64722
the site erroneously redirects users to http from a page as https
64722
images and other assets on an https page are being loading via http which will trigger a security alert from the browser

for value types int double etc. the function receives a copy of the value
64759
ideally i d like to be able to place it like the png tiff or jpg objects with the zend_pdf_image object
64768
is there a terminal program that shows the difference between input standard output error output the prompt and user-entered commands
64771
if it s a myisam table actually this may work with innodb too try issuing a lock table before the delete
64803
however silverlight requires an understanding of wpf which is dramatically different than the html js that your app currently uses
64836
to reduce the chances of inappropriate or offensive words from being generated in english or in the recipients languages i limited runs of consecutive alpha characters to two with numerals or punctuation characters betwee
64836
using the just the rules above some offensive words are possible now that some numerals and punctuation are substituted for letters
64844
myisam innodb and memory are the main ones
64844
at the least the candidate should mention that myisam issues a table-level lock whereas innodb uses row-level locking
64851
how would you write in c c++ a macro which tests if an integer type given as a parameter is signed or unsigned
64860
on linux unix os x cygwin
64869
a schema definition in xsd relaxng or dtd helps various tools that work with the xml because they can verify that the structure of the xml conforms to what you want
64883
you probably need to get a jms connection from jndi like this
64887
most of them allow you to separate instantiation behavior from the implementation of your classes
64896
i agree with everyone else that you should try as hard as you can to separate the html xhtml markup from the application logic
64902
where you can use pre-increment instead of post-increment
64907
phpthumb asido so i don t have to run gd or imagemagick functions directly
64942
for a xml document to be queryable using xqquery you do not have to define a dtd or xsd
64942
the purpose of dtd or xsd is to define the strict structure of a xml document and to allow validation before usage
64953
is there something like php s pdo library for lisp or arc or scheme or one of the dialects
64995
then you can right click tree nodes to add new templates or new folders to organize your new templates

.net wcf faults generating incorrect soap 1.1 faultcode values
65133
when i run ie under a debugger i don t see anything unusual - the debugger doesn t catch any exceptions access violations or assertion failures but the problem is still there - i can set a breakpoint in the control s destructor and it s never hit when i close the broswer
65208
i have tried to use it for a ning social network which used dojo and for magento which uses prototype and i could not get either to play right with jquery
65209
i would love to stay with php for this but i am open to python or perl as well
65212
if any of the modifier keys are being held down when that event fires the corresponding property is set to true
65212
this applies to keyboard as well as mouse events onclick etc
65233
why do you have any expectation that param will be set to the value
65241
write the interface in c++ and use macros to make it look like a standard cpp header file on unix and like an idl file on windows if this does not work out you can always write a python ruby script to generate the idl from the c++ header file
65243
has anybody attempted to pass a vba or vb6 function via addressof
65259
the only problem with using triggers is that it adds to performance overhead of any insert update delete
65279
i use pc-lint on my c++ projects and especially like how it references existing publications such as the misra guidelines or scott meyers effective c++ and more effective c++
65282
on top of that any value returned from within the finally block will override the value returned prior to execution of the finally block so be careful of checking all exit points when using try finally
65305
it provides a common distribution network and a loading architecture for jquery prototype script.aculo.us mootools and dojo
65343
interprocess cooperation such as passing a reference of some kind is acceptable both processes are mine but i want to avoid binding the sheet s code into the primary process
65367
currenly the .net framework is not on server core which means asp.net is currently not available
65420
pd for the ubuntu part you are in luck they say that ubuntu is our linux distro of choice
65423
and then use the compareto method defined by the icomparable interface
65472
any dvcs bitkeeper git bazaar mercurial etc because being distributed will cut down the load on the central canonical scm server
65510
my usual method for commenting out 40 lines would be to put the cursor on the first line and enter the command
65510
seems a bit longer than some other methods suggested but i like to do things with the keyboard instead of the mouse
65549
you should also consider that aside from the substantial risk to the installation you may well be building in dependencies upon your changes that are then over-written in a future patch or service pack
65553
by default windbg will show you next to the command line the thread were the process crashed
65562
- and they ve said that this is the same for all of the companies - when they made the decision to go with perforce it was either that or sourcesafe or cvs - and honestly given those three choices i d go with perforce too
65570
you get an sql-error if you misspell or rename a field not an empty value from a recordset row
65599
can you just add an id field to the vertex object and assign it a number in order of construction
65601
if you create a view using select and later add columns to your table the view definition and the data returned won t match and you ll need to recompile your views in order for them to work again
65603
fxcop will detect public protected methods with no upstream callers
65604
so if you use all the data try select for simplicity imagine having many columns and doing a join.
65627
most of the columns are the same for the parents and for the children so i d like to show the first value of the group as the summary rather than the max min or avg
65627
this code works on numerical but not textual values without the commented line you get nan s
65642
can t use the default constructor with no arguments
65652
for better presentation your two divs will probably need some padding and margins so that the text doesn t all run together
65673
however i haven t been able to find a good .net implementation that allows me to do this within iis our application is written in asp.net 2.0
65845
gnu autounit uses glib extensively which means that linking and such need special options but this may not be a big problem to you especially if you are already using gtk or glib
65847
what i like about perforce say compared to cvs is that the branch management is must more sophisticated but still reasonably easy and you don t need to bug a central bureaucracy to create branches labels and the like
65856
vmware esx esxi and virtualcenter are supposed to be able to support http put uploads since version 3.5

to continue your example the cdp mib has been published at cisco s a href step 2 mibname cisco-cdp-mib rel nofollow noreferrer snmp object navigator. a
65902
the oid will change if nothing else to move it into their own enterprise oid space but the mib may also change to conform to cisco s snmp practices

if you re talking about editing components as opposed to stand-alone apps like dreamweaver i ve used cuteeditor tinymce fckeditor ewebeditpro and telerik s rad editor
65917
i agree with thomas owens on eclipse rich client platform designing coding and packaging java tm applications and would also add eclipse building commercial-quality plug-ins to the list of rather outdated but still somewhat useful books on eclipse rcp
65924
the difficult part however is not the communication channel but the messages you pass over it
65925
in linux for example ubuntu it is possible to turn off the wireless adapter without turning of the network capabilities
65938
using graphicsmagick or imagemagick along with magick++ you can then use imagick
66001
in addition to the auditing tools the simplest tool and the one i use most is to select a cell and hit f2 to have all the cell references in the formula and the referenced cells highlighted with colour coding
66006
clarification i do not mean html dom scripting performed after the document is transformed nor do i mean xsl transformations initiated by javascript in the browser what the w3schools page shows
66060
also nice integration with a variety of scp sftp clients
66069
it s open source and is supported on pretty much every os you can think of as well as having language support for c++ c# java ruby python and php
66072
open the file using whatever scripting language you prefer perl python and traverse the file until you find a match for your version
66093
it s been a while since i used lucene but my guess would be to add an extra field for sorting and storing the value in there with the stop words already stripped
66111
for reasons that don t bear explaining i am sending clientmessage from a comand-line utility to a gui app.most of the messages end up having the same contents as the message s purpose is to trigger a synchronous communication process over some side pipes
66112
a document-ordered node list is the behavior in other implementations of the dom such as javascript s or python s
66221
modern browsers either don t appear to support sslv2 at all google chrome opera 9.52 firefox or have it disabled by default ie7 ie8
66228
if you have constants that are only valid to a particular class or one of its subclasses declare them as either protected or public and place them on the top class in the hierarchy
66238
duplicate this collection to examine the incoming lines reducing the count for each line as you see it
66282
in the bioinformatics development group where i work we re encouraging use of python for new development where perl would have been the language of choice in the past
66339
any time you need a fixed set of constants
66356
there seems to be a catch-22 in that you must tokenize a field with an analyzer in order to strip punctuation and stop words but you can t sort on tokenized fields
66442
if your need is to store heterogeneous data for example like a cms scenario i would suggest storing xml validated by an xsd in a row
66455
even more important i d like to change it globally so the new behavior applies to jtextfield jpasswordfield jformattedtextfield jtextarea jcombobox jspinner and so on
66494
at a basic level what you want to do is define an array of image names then take the number of days from a given point in time then modulo remainder after division by the number of images and access that index in the array and set the image untested code
66505
i create an abstract base class commandbase which implements icommand to contain common code
66508
every industry expert i ve heard on podcasts blogs and interviews recommend learning silverlight first and then gradually moving to wpf which is a huge ui framework
66513
because vb and .net will use different sql connections and there is no way to make ado and ado.net share the same connection your only possibility is to enlist the dtc distributed transaction coordinator
66525
can antlr output c# using stringtemplate or any text i want it to like yacc bison or does it only output to java
66535
keep in mind that the opengl paradigm is quite different from swing awt or the java 2d api
66574
if you can guarantee the presence of imagemagick you can use their mogrify -flop command
66577
jogl provides full access to the apis in the opengl 2.0 specification as well as nearly all vendor extensions and integrates with the awt and swing widget sets
66602
what if someone extends the abstract class and forget to initiate the field
66605
set system preferences keyboard mouse trackpad to use two finger secondary click
66605
set system preferences keyboard mouse trackpad to use two finger screen zoom for magnifying an area in the screen by holding the control key and scrolling up or down
66625
by default windbg will show you next to the command line the thread were the process crashed
66647
just keep in mind that swing swt and opengl are generally used for entirely different things
66652
i do it on my own web site for certain pages that are guaranteed not to change -- i simply run a shell script that could be boiled to warning bash pseudocode
66654
i m trying to convert old quicktime framework code to the 64-bit cocoa-based qtkit on os x which means that i can t drop down to the straight c function calls at any time
66654
specifically i m trying to find a way to write quicktime vr movies with qtkit as they require some special metadata to set the display controller
66693
we also got a new way to create objects without using new-object -- in fact if you kept your class simple and don t define a constructor you can create objects by casting a hashtable although without a constructor there would be no way to enforce that all properties must be set
66738
you could use the svn rev property to get the revision number into your footer
66741
it s the same basic concept but supports transactional backups if the update goes wrong in the middle by storing each checkout in a separate folder and symlinking the latest to your www directory
66745
each module is packageable as a jar or a war in the case of the web module and thus allows for easier code reuse we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project
66771
you may not want to change the capitalization -- different cultures capitalize different words for example in german you capitalize every noun not just proper nouns
66799
using this method could get painful though you could put it all into a shell script and it doesn t allow you to pass variables in the same way eg won t work
66817
if the data store is a jet database it makes little sense to use any form of ado unless you re running your code from a scripting platform where it s the preferred choice
66852
a standard-ish api is the dlopen dlsym api
66873
i ve used bitkeeper clearcase accurev perforce subversion cvs sccs and rcs and out of all of those bitkeeper was far and above the best
66876
ant is of course verbosity city but it has better support for building java-like languages scala and groovy included
66876
if you want dependency management for java-like libraries maven is the canonical choice but i personally like buildr a lot better
66893
c5 looks nifty but their tree structures seem to be implemented as balanced red-black trees better suited to search than representing a hierarchy of nodes
66898
it s the build system used for vtk among other things which is a c++ library with cross-platform python tcl and java bindings
66900
when browsers treat the markup as html and you want your xhtml 1.0 markup for example to validate
66917
i have used swig to make an interface from c++ to java or python and then used the typical web interface support for those languages
66917
since java and python have reflection the web services frameworks that exist for them have a much easier time passing data around
66917
as a bonus you can test your c++ code from python using these same swig interfaces
66924
according to yahoo s documentation for geoplanet requests are made in the form of an http get messages which can very easily be made using python s httplib module and responses can take one of several forms including xml and json
66924
itself even offers libraries for parsing both xml and json with python
66934
we are automating excel using vb.net and trying to place multiple lines of text on an excel worksheet that we can set to not print
66936
it is possible that you are misunderstanding just what a classmethod is in python it s a bit different from say a static method in java
66937
another option is that she will do chown nobody and chmod +s on your binary executable and you ll be able to execute it directly
66956
if you need to only navigate down the tree then a node class needs a list of children
66963
chartdirector is available for lots of platforms win linux solaris bsd osx and has an api for lots of languages too perl asp .net java php python ruby c++
67000
the one requirement for writing my app is that i have pixel level precision over the canvas
67000
ideally i would like to write this in python or perhaps java as a second choice
67035
essentially any time you set a name of an a tag you can then access it by linking to #name-used-in-tag
67063
but when there s complex calculations or database involved we should use a getter setter
67068
google uses a combination of that the local domain you use eg google.it google.hu and any preferences you set with the preferences link in the home page to assign a language to your pages
67085
when it gets compiled it turns out to be getter setter functions either way
67089
as for java using swt pixel level manipulation of a canvas is somewhat difficult and slow so i would not recommend it
67093
this needs to work with innodb which stores things very differently than myisam
67099
you can use tidy to convert it to xhtml and then use whatever xml processing facilities your language of choice has available
67100
you should have the repository set up so this can happen with a single checkout including any necessary sub folders
67174
i found some advice in the web that proposed to collect call stacks of the increment decrement operations of the reference counter
67183
there are various documents describing threading on solaris linux but nowwhere describing the windows implementation
67189
any new column data may be set to initial value virtually in zero time
67213
if you have to get under the hood and make modifications i m also a firm believer that drupal is a more friendly and elegant system than joomla
67215
also if a setter has non-obvious prerequisites in the class i might use a getter or setter instead since people rarely read documentation on properties and properties are expected to be accessable at all times
67217
forget the getter and setter methods
67217
an interesting thing to mention is that properties are ending up as setter and or getter method s in the assembly
67217
setter and or getter become a property just by a little bit of metadata
67217
so in fact properties setter getter methods
67227
you have the files in your local directory the so called working copy and one in the repository which can be located in another local folder or on another machine usually accessed over the network
67227
should you at any point wish to go back to the version at which you committed those changes then you can simply revert your working copy to an older revision the name given to the set of changes that you commit at once
67227
note that this is all very cvs svn-specific as git would work slightly different
67259
i mention pyglet instead of pure pyopengl because pyglet handles a lot of ugly opengl stuff transparently with no effort on your part
67275
if i don t try copying the file into another inputstream via the outputstream mentioned above and just pass the zipinputstream to my 3rd party library the library closes the stream and i can t do anything more like dealing with the remaining files in the stream
67290
there have been a number of answers recommending perl mechanize but i think that ruby mechanize very similar to perl s version is even better
67308
you don t do division modulus to get the digits in production code firstly because it s suboptimal your cpu is designed for binary arithmetics not decimal and secondly because it s unintuitive
67312
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck
67321
the advantages would be that because emptycell contains no member variables it wouldn t require any storage space like the empty in haxe whereas a cons cell would
67371
you can t beat the easy install of the free visual svn server and the visualsvn plug-in is well worth the money
67378
what i have done to solve this is to override the malloc new free delete operators such that they keep track in a data structure as much as possible about the operation you are performing
67388
tuples are the cheapest kind of containers in python they are also hashable so they can be used as dictionary keys set members etc
67437
std set is basically a sorted container
67475
for example you would not require that general computer users learn python in order to write an email filter. similarly rule languages such as jess are only a partial solution since some simpler user interface needs to be built on-top of the rule language so non-programmers can make use of it
67505
however i would state that silverlight is not rtm yet and wpf is
67505
wpf has a lot of books out on the subject where silverlight does not
67505
just keep in mind that silverlight has a subset of the controls of wpf a paired down .net framework and does not do synchronous calls
67512
i m considering switching to a dvorak-based keyboard layout but one optimized for programming mostly java and python ddvorak programmer dvorak etc.
67562
if you do this type of functional programming all the time you might want to check out f# or maybe even iron ruby or python
67590
what happens if when html 5 is finally implemented and django is generating html 4 or xhtml markup
67612
how does one find the coordinates x y height width of every link in a webpage
67628
are there any ports to wpf of silverlight s multiscaleimage aka deepzoom
67628
i want to move from winforms to wpf and require something like deepzoom using silverlight isn t an option
67633
i would suggest using svn with the visualsvn plug-in if you require source control which everyone does on the cheap
67640
i m not looking for solutions with vim or emacs nor editors like bbedit that support syntax highlighting but a full fledged ide with
67670
one possible approach to this would be to first run each phrase through a stop-word list to remove common words such as a to the etc. then for each of the remaining words in each phrase you could compute the semantic similarity between each of the words in the other phrase using a distance measure based on wordnet
67671
much more resources are available for wpf than silverlight such as books blogs and msdn documentation
67682
target browsers ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 opera safari
67685
c is there a way for mencoder to decode and encode flvs correctly
67687
textmate is an editor like bbedit but it has the ability to run commands such as compilation debugging refactoring though it will do so via xcode
67700
most flv audio is encoded in the mp3 format meaning you can extract it directly from the flv container
67700
i d check out libavcodec which handles flv mp3 nellymoser natively and should let you get to the audio
67703
from there you can have your syslog feed into zenoss nagios splunk or anything else that syslog can talk to
67706
has anyone come up with a good way of performing full text searches freetext contains for any number of arbitrary keywords using standard linqtosql query syntax
67714
an https or secure sockets layer ssl certificate is served for a site and is typically signed by a certificate authority ca which is effectively a trusted 3rd party that verifies some basic details about your site and certifies it for use in browsers
67714
each http or https request consists of two parts a request and a response
67714
https traffic is much bigger than its equivalent http traffic due to encryption and certificate overhead and it also puts a bigger strain on the server encrypting and decrypting
67714
if you try to fetch images from http when the page is loaded with https the user will get security warnings
67714
don t do posts form submits when changing from https to http
67718
i prefer cxxtest because it has a perl python script to build the test runner
67739
ive seen some sites that gives you a http login page and only redirect you to https after you post your username pass
67747
if you do build the integration code using .net you may want to consider leveraging the wcf line-of-business sdk
67751
if you want to allocate a block and initialize it to 0 use calloc which is like malloc only with initialization an an element size parameter which you set to 1 if you want to emulate malloc
67767
the following might be helpful if you are attempting to accomplish this with c++ or python
67767
windows linux mac osx and even beyond
67767
wxwidgets is a c++ framework but it also provides python bindings via wxpython
67798
works to match any from line but i want it to be restricted to lines in the body anything after the first blank line
67853
in vb its normally dir to find the directory of the file
67878
the text breaks out of the 150px box in firefox 3 and opera 9.5
67902
when necessary stabilize your code base define a set of tests such that passing all of those tests means you are confident enough in the quality of your product to release it then drive toward 0 test failures ban any checkins to the release branch other than fixes for the outstanding issues
67925
you can use a simple bookmarklet to add a script tag which loads an external javascript file that can push the necessary elements to the dom and present a modal window to the user
67927
eclipse should now stop at any breakpoints that you ve set in the projects you added in step 3
67931
for instance try using the w3c dom more for more than just trivial javascript
67991
set and multiset are appropriate for keeping items sorted but are generally optimised for a balanced set of add remove and fetch
67991
if you have manly lookup operations then a sorted vector may be more appropriate and then use lower_bound to lookup the element
68078
each of these tabs is also a view and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label it s almost certainly some other viewgroup maybe a linearlayout but it doesn t matter that contains an imageview and a textview
68096
gsm-338 contains a subset of the unicode characters so what you re doing is extracting a set of codepoints from your string and checking to see if that set is contained in gsm-338
68115
once i am ready to go live i can export the files from the repo sans .svn folders and upload it to a production or staging server
68156
each of the nodes in this tree needs access to its tree s root
68186
i usually name the copied directory v1.0 or whatever is appropriate and keep them all in a folder that is the main project name
68193
edit one of the apps i m working on has a node tree containing about 55k nodes
68208
i m assuming you re referring to indexing tables on a relational dbms like mysql oracle or postgres
68225
private variables that are exposed as public getter setter properties and do get serialized deserialized as such through those properties
68234
my question is how can i create a base controller which does this for me so that the particular helpdesk department specified in the url is available to all derived controllers and i can just focus on the actions
68237
the solution to the problem of sharing data between threads in core data like the enterprise objects framework before it is don t. if you ve thought about it further and you really honestly do have to share data between threads then the solution is to keep independent object graphs in thread-isolated contexts and use the information in the save notification from one context to tell the other context what to re-fetch
68253
clearcase perforce and bazaar
68270
ignoring the distaste for inner classes i could define a tree class and define the nodes as inner classes
68270
each of the nodes would have access to its tree s state including its root
68314
why because in previous versions of delphi the typed constants were assignable by default to preserve compatibility with older versions where they were always writable delphi 1 up to early pascal
68323
update i should also note that we have an audit database that tracks changes field old value new value time user ip to all tables fields within the application database
68350
then there is a browser view exposed at a fixed url that searches the metadata and returns the appropriate livesearch html and finally each html page is sent the appropriate javascript to handle the autocomplete ajax functionality to query this view and slot the resulting html results into the dom
68362
don t try to use yacc or bison with a context-sensitive grammar they are far to strict to express such concepts easily
68365
you need to generate on the source machine and install on the destination machine an ssh key beforehand so that the scp automatically gets authenticated with your public ssh key in other words so your script doesn t ask for a password
68367
i believe that cscope can be configured to work with vim and emacs although i ve seen people use other editors also
68369
i would recommend a distributed version control system mercurial git bazaar darcs rather than a centralized version control system cvs svn
68386
you get a shell inside emacs and have all the power of emacs along with the power of a shell there are some limitations such as opening another emacs within it but in most cases it is a lot more powerful than a vanilla bash prompt
68392
there s a glcanvas that belongs to swt and a glcanvas that belongs to awt
68400
dev tcp and dev udp
68443
this is particularly true for those coming over from languages such as php python ruby or even java
68511
sounds like you re looking for a phonetic-based algorithms such as soundex nysiis or double metaphone
68524
though eli courtwright s program will work fine what you really seem to want though is just a way to reconfigure after instantiation any attribute which you could have set when you instantiated
68548
the thing is what i really want to do is programming but my interships were mostly sysadmins jobs with some programming due to my previous experience with linux and unix
68548
this is not as big as what is being done in the real world but it a fun project and i am having a lot of fun doing it and if i can get it quite advance in the next month i will probably put in on sourceforge
68558
when you reference a static final field the value of that constant is compiled into any bytecode that references it
68566
you will need to setup ssh keys to enable password-less logins if you are wrapping system commands like ssh scp or rsync. you can embed a password in a script using paramiko or some other library but you might find the lack of documentation frustrating especially if you are not familiar with the basics of the ssh connection eg - key exchanges agents etc
68566
note its hard to beat rsync if you plan on transferring files via ssh especially if the alternative is plain old scp
68610
in firefox 2 3 and safari everything work fine but for some reason the text doesn t appear centered in ie 6 or 7
68614
i d like to start migrating this application to use a much more expressive transparent and non-invasive persistence strategy and given my company s previous experience with it hibernate 3.x is the obvious choice
68615
if you re familiar at all with dom manipulation in javascript you ll feel right at home with this library
68630
is there any performance difference between tuples and lists when it comes to instantiation and retrieval of elements
68654
or alternately use ejb 3 which is hibernate standardized into the java persistence api
68671
the scrolltop property is a available on any dom element including the document body
68673
here s hoping that quicktime x will have a more fully featured qtkit set of apis
68674
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it
68679
for the second question well try some good dvcs git mercurial bazaar and see if any can help you
68725
it allows to easily verify the stdout and stderr and the exit value of programs
68807
but i teach a first semester linux admin course in which we install configure several distributions and i usually start with ubuntu since it s generally the smoothest and requires minimal tweaking after the install
68821
i want to dynamically hide show some of the columns in a nstableview based on the data that is going to be displayed - basically if a column is empty i d like the column to be hidden
68871
you ll also want to get rid of all your built-in events such as onenterframe and you ll want to take a close look at nontrivial mouse interaction such as dragging and keyboard interaction such as detecting whether a key is pressed
68928
depending on the cpu architecture arguments can be passed in registers for example a0 through a3 on mips or by pushing them onto the stack as in the original x86 calling convention
68959
you can optionally use a private constructor to force all references to the class to go through a static property
68961
so instead of the tired old object object you often get with the typeof keyword you can actually get real object types based upon the constructor
68988
some processors have a timestamp counter which increments at a rapid rate every few processor clock ticks
69040
mxmlc an actionscript and mxml compiler to output the final swf file for deployment to flash player
69040
mxml is actually converted to actionscript during the compilation process
69045
i m really new on python but i tried quiet a few specially django and web2py
69048
the problem i m running into is that selecting a new category updates the categoryname of the category table instead of updating the categoryid in the product table
69048
what happens is if the current product has a categoryid of 12 which is the categoryname chairs in the category table then selecting a new value let s say tables categoryid 13 in the combo box updates the categoryid of 12 with the new categoryname tables instead of updating the product table categoryid to 13
69059
all operations on an x86 system anyway are done with 32-bit registers so a single bit compare would be just as efficient as a 32-bit compare
69064
i usually set the options of my editor to substitute the tab character with 4 spaces and i never run into any problems
69067
i put static in quotes because python does not really have static variables in the sense that c++ and java do
69080
it seems that you are referring to x86 processor family that is not built with real-time systems in mind so there is no real guarantee for constant time execution cpu may reorder micro-instructions than there is branch prediction and instruction prefetch queue which is flushed each time when cpu wrongly predicts conditional jumps...
69104

i ve used both and while subclipse has been flaky for me subversive at least with a previous version locked out an account of my coworker when he accidentally put in the wrong credentials the network login is used to access the subversion repository
69195
public static void main string args throws uriexception
69237
this is because someone experienced needs to coordinate the whole show or we will risk the time resources of the next guy down the line
69274
in c mode and makefile mode at least m-q fill-paragraph will insert line continuations in the fill-column and wrap your lines
69333
copy the next of second node i+1 into a temporary variable
69335
the c++ open type dialog not only allows incremental filtering by type but also selecting of definition .h or declaration .cpp and even filtering by element type typedef struct class etc
69338
high scalability is a good blog for scaling saas applications
69387
the general consensus is that programmers prefer drupal whereas mere mortals prefer joomla
69410
personally i like celementtree which is a faster c-based implementation of elementtree which is a dom-like model
69453
yes wpf is magnificent and it may be that i m all wet about this but i believe in my gut that silverlight changes everything
69474
note after a bit more thought - you d need to have these covers be linked so clicking on them would take you to where the tab was supposed to which means you could should do this with the anchor element set to display box width and height set as well as the transparent background image
69482
contrary to other contributors i say you should play with simpler parser generators like yacc and bison first and only when you get burned because you can t do something with that tool should you go on to try to build something with an ll parser like antlr
69516
git mercurial bazaar darcs
69545
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

we re currently making pdfs this way vb6 app drops a record into sql with filename create date user and final destination and the xls or doc gets moved into a server directory share and the server has a vb.net service that has a filewatcher monitoring that directory
69616
for the second and third persons will is declarative while shall is imperative while the first person is the reverse
69620
assuming you haven t worked in silverlight or wpf before i d take a look at our showcase 3 applications just to get a sense of what can be done with silverlight
69646
i m running visualsvn as my svn server and using tortoisesvn as the client
69655
workaround is to programmatically add blocks to head dom element in javascript at callback function or call eval method
69697
this process can remove intermediate results which are unncessary to complete an expression or function evaluation but may be of interest to you when debugging
69714
i personally use emacs for editing xml but i m willing to put up with the learning curve of the editor for the sheer power it gives me - editing xml is now rather easy and painless for me but it took me a bit to get it to that point
69768
this question is a place to collect information about where configuration files live and how to tweak the apache installation to do things like serve php pages
69817
other options here are trac or redmine
69825
the get and put principle use an extends wildcard when you only get values our of a structure use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure and don t use a wildcard you both get and put
69854
you can t convert adobe s activex control to 64bit yourself but you can force your application to run in 32bit mode by setting the platform target to x86
69948
to expand slightly on my answer we were using swt not swing so ymmv
69989
you d have to add ssl as all methods post get and http auth well except digest hhtp authentication send plaintext
69989
there are many choices in python like the cgi module or some framework like django cherrypy and so on
69995
or as suggested by the other posters use a different method entirely like http auth digest auth or some higher level authentication scheme like ad ldap kerberos or shib
70035
if you want to stay on the oop side learn python or ruby both languages provide an easy way to create bindings to use your c++ code from a script for efficiency reasons
70035
if you need another approach to programming learn a functional language like lisp or haskell
70035
and if you need to include a fast and small scripting language inside your c++ application try lua
70035
last but not least if you know java and hate it you can try scala a language where you can mix your java classes with your scala code very interesting
70046
they basically abstract all the sql jpa in a seam component that jsf can easily use
70074
it seems that amazon aws error isn t the superclass of the generated error - i guess since it s a module everything is a subclass of it
70109
then user changes selected item in one of dropdowns asp.net doesn t seem to handle selectedindexchanged event until form is submitted with a submit button click
70179
factory classes are useful for when the object type that they return has a private constructor when different factory classes set different properties on the returning object or when a specific factory type is coupled with its returning concrete type
70236
for example there is an entry called main-class that specifies the name of the java class with the static main for executable jar files
70239
via a plugin you will be able to register your own mime type and then manipulate javascript the dom
70257
it supports a large range of languages c c++ lua erlang ... and you can even write your own output formatter
70261
unfortunately you can t use a vb6 vba function as a callback directly as vb6 only generates stdcall functions rather than the cdecl functions sqlite expects
70292
as i put together each asp.net page its clear that most of the time i could use the standard html tags just as easily as the webforms controls
70296
however if you remove the parameter to application.run then the application will be started with no form shown and you will be free to show and hide forms as much as you like
70299
this should be do-able on either a unix linux system or on windows platform using pageant and pscp
70325
sort selected lines search and destroy within selection whole doc or all open docs

is there any way to prevent visual studio from creating a vsmacros80 folder in my default project directory
70384
vim is rapidly turning into the emacs of the new century
70392
is there a distributed version control system git bazaar mercurial darcs etc. that can handle files larger than available ram
70402
they re both o nlogn and yet most people use quicksort instead of mergesort
70421
is in-place mergesort requires extra memory linear to number of elements to be sorted
70423
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average
70427
if an attacker can choose the input to be sorted he can easily construct a set that takes the worst case time complexity of o n 2
70427
i m a bigger fan of mergesort than i am of quicksort for these reasons
70428
quicksort and heapsort and can be
70428
variant of quicksort with in-place
70430
i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is n that quicksort implementations don t have
70440
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster
70440
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort
70440
i personally often will use mergesort or a quicksort variant that degrades to mergesort when quicksort does poorly
70447
allowing http when you should be enforcing https
70447
retrieving some resources over http from an https page images iframes etc
70447
directing to http page from https page unintentionally - note that this includes fake pages such as about blank i ve seen this used as iframe placeholders this will needlessly and unpleasantly popup a warning
70447
requesting the user s credentials from an http page even if submitting to an https page
70452
i d like to add that of the three algoritms mentioned so far mergesort quicksort and heap sort only mergesort is stable
70453
shell script perl or python or is there anything else
70459
in one of my talks on the subject i even give an example of a test suite written in perl c ruby and html yes html -- you d have to see it
70471
however i can also swear that i have seen property getter setter code in java in one codebase but i cannot remember where
70473
which can be combined together to do pretty much anything you can achieve using perl or python
70473
on the other hand if the processes you want to automate are complex not just a linear sequence of steps then you ll probably find that writing the scripts in perl or python or even ruby
70486
it is maybe not as up to date as python or ruby but it does have massive library support from cpan
70486
if i was starting today maybe i would pick python or ruby but i don t know enough about them to make a judgement call
70488
python has well-implemented o-o features for multiple inheritance polymorphism and encapsulation.n summary it seems to me that python dominates perl in most applications except for fairly short shell-script sorts of applications and there they are roughly comparable
70489
go for all three of them start with bash awk sed plus fileutils grep find and so on and then move up the abstraction hierarchy with perl and python
70489
i say start with bash and friends because they are ubiquitous some machines will not have perl or python installed and you ll feel helpless there especially in traditional unix land ie not linux
70500
for more focus on code reuse and readability maintainability i d want to step it up it up to python or ruby
70511
python and ruby are roughly equivalent
70511
learn at least python or ruby well
70522
therefore the rule of thumb is to try to define static nested class with as limited scope as possible private class protected public and then convert it to inner class by removing static identifier and loosen the scope if it s really necessary
70527
if you re using eclipse then it has the capabilities to auto generate the getter and setter method for the internal attributes it can be a usefull and timesaving tool
70533
when choosing a scripting language to help automate your linux unix environment the most important thing in my opinion is.
70533
i am currently working in an environment where the lead unix guy is a real script head but he has mainly restrained himself to using bash with some perl and windows vbscript thrown in for good luck
70536
cryptography is not the solution to your security problems
70546
then there are things like json which is like xml but optimized and google protocol buffers which optimizes the interop but is typically precompiled and not late-coupled
70548
most ides for java will automatically generate getter and setter code for you if you want them to
70548
eclipse even includes automated refactoring that will allow you to wrap a property up in a getter and setter and it will modify all the code that accesses the property directly to make it use the getter and or setter
70558
i normally do this by having a second constructor that i call passing in the mock object
70558
the normal constructor would have just loaded the com object as normal
70618
at the time of constructor call there is no object created yet so the polymorphism does not make any sense
70621
we then pipe this output to a log file which is then moved to the backup archive for reference
70627
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort
70653
i have found several method in web framework such as django or turbogears
70687
if the parent contains multiple constructors the simplest one is called simplest as determined by a rather complex set of rules not worth bothering to learn in detail--just pay attention to what netbeans or eclipse tell you.
70687
such a declaration creates a new instance of an unnamed class which extends object and implements interfacename
70687
if you want a local inner class which implements multiple interfaces or which implements interfaces while extending some class other than object or which specifies its own constructor you re stuck creating a regular named local inner class
70705
does having the allowed language syntax in a yacc or bison format give me a leg up
70708
after finding questions with words from query we might want to calculate distance between words we are interested in in questions so question with phrases similarity text ranks higher than question with discussing similarity you hear following phrases... text
70723
yacc bison definitely gives you a leg up since good linting would require parsing the program
70745
date on linux converts to epoch but not on solaris
70772
if you want a reliable iteratior order there s linkedhashmap and treemap
70783
the great news is that languages like python and ruby are open sourced and you can download and study the c source code in order to better understand how it s done
70848
it gives you a unidirectional pipe with which you can access stdin and stdout of the program
70848
popen is standard on modern unix and unix-like os of which linux is one -
70848
in linux and openbsd popen produces unidirectional pipes which are read-only or write-only
70848
on os x freebsd and netbsd popen produces bidirectional pipes
70851
the traditional bodmas brackets orders division multiplication addition subtraction or pedmas parentheses exponents division multiplication addition subtraction are just subsets of all the possible operations and denote the order that such operations should be applied in
70858
create two pipes with pipe ... one for stdin one for stdout
70881
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas
70890
i have seen the ability to draw custom images in other ria toolkits dojo but i can t see a way of doing this inside of richfaces
70916
the work done by the jruby and rubinius teams in creating a ruby spec is probably the most important outcome so far as it will help ensure that all implementations remain compatible
70931
then you would have executable jar file running your application
70945
antlr looks to be an alternative path to the more common ok i heard about them before yacc bison approach which it turns out also commonly use lex flex as a front end
70991
you ll encounter a very subtle problem here because most video and audio formats especially in ordinary containers use global headers meaning at the start of the file they have a single header which specifies compression information like width height etc for the whole file
70998
for best results particularly when creating documentation for c++ install graphviz and enable in your doxygen configuration file
70999
progress on perl 6 is slow but steady pugs perl 6 over haskell has been stalled for a while but audrey might resume workingon it soon
71014
in .net world you can use datacontractserializer class from wcf or javascriptserializer asp.net
71065
we have a collection of commercial mfc c++ applications which we sell using stingray objective toolkit we have source code license and have ported it in the past to solaris irix hp-ux aix using bristol technologies windu windows api on unix including mfc

ladder logic can be transformed to one of the modern hdl s like verilog
71150
i just found it out myself if you add a trailing backslash to the project folder setting changing it from c dev to c dev the vsmacros80 directory will no longer be created
71152
it offers features like prepare + execute emulation for dbs that don t support it properly and allows you to use placeholders which is good practice to avoid sql injection problems
71152
it will work with mysql mysqli pgsql postgresql oci8 oracle sqllite msql mssql microsoft sql server sybase informix fbsql ibase odbc
71171
you might want to use a combination of cruisecontrol or cruisecontrol.net and ant or nant
71190
you can unit test your clr code inside of vs using any of the standard unit testing frameworks nunit mstest and you don t have to write a bunch of set up and tear down scripts that can be difficult to manage
71196
i use it with eclipse in linux ubuntu and fedora core windows xp and mac os x.5
71214
it emulates your program and intercepts calls to malloc free etc
71226
i am using a .net windows forms datagridview and i need to edit a databound column that binds on a boolean datatable column
71240
depending on the installation environment your installer may also need to ask the user for a server port since your application may not be able to use the default http port
71242
this will doubtless be because safari on windows uses its own text-rendering and anti-aliasing layer instead of windows s gdi
71297
if you are just producing a string then you should set the output mode of the stylesheet to text by including the following as a child of the xsl stylesheet
71322
firefox opera safari google chrome all work
71336
jedit was kinda big in 2004 but now notepad++ seems to have taken the lead on windows
71349
first function moves the cursor to the last non-empty row in the column
71371
the last parameter to builder.node is array list of other nodes to be appended as children according to the wiki
71374
the font family and size is consistent across the cells though the color may vary from cell to cell as will bold italic plain
71397
you can easily do things in vim in the normal course of editing that would require you to drop down to scripting in emacs
71412
other than that i m quite happy with jedit - it s the best general editor i ve found so far for linux ducks as hordes of vi and emacs users light up their flame cannons
71429
should i use a vmware virtual workstation with some remote logon software like realvnc teamviewer logmein whatever... or should i invest in a full vdi system like sun or vmware provide
71451
everything from redirection servers to just forwarding a port in your firewall to an ssh server and setting up the various tunnels
71468
preferably something that can be used from a windows command-line and or can be included easily in a java python program
71475
when the user clicks one of the those items the contents of the related directory are zipped in place and the resulting zip file is stored in a cache folder
71482
put on some music close down your email and get busy
71594
i don t yet have the ability to add comments so i m adding this as an answer it was suggested by joel spolsky that such questions would be best phrased as one tool per answer please - this would allow voting on individual development tools thus is more likely to give you a list in order of popularity of the best tools to have
71642
i also paid for textmate and ultraedit at different times both very good but in the end jedit comes out on top for me
71665
if selectionmode is not fullrowselect you ll want to additionally override setselectedcellcore and not call the base setselectedcellcore for rows you don t want selected as setselectedrowcore will only kick in if you click the row header and not an individual cell
71743
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page
71743
tapestry components can take other components as parameters which allows the sitemesh style wrapping
71750
fyi this hack only targets safari 3 and also targets opera 9
71766
in delphi i want to be able to create an private object that s associated with a class and access it from all instances of that class
71786
the most highly recommended editors are jedit and notepad++
71790
you could use an httphandler instead of an httpmodule
71798
an easy way in perl probably easily adaptable to bash is to glob the filenames in an array then get the sequence number and remove those that are not divisible by 4
71815
until now all work on the codebase has been done purely with nano or perhaps kate
71816
for perl there is feed find which does automate the discovery of syndication feeds from the webpage
71819
this will work even if the numbers are not exactly in sequence if some frame numbers are missing then using mod 4 arithmetic won t work
71861
though it started primarily as a java ide it s been extended via plugins to support many others including c c++ flex haskell and coldfusion to name a few and can fairly easily be adapted to a new language if support isn t already out there
71889
note that this class variable will be writable from any class instance hence you can set it up somewhere else in the code usually based on some condition type of logger etc.
71890
for what it s worth i have had no trouble using sharpziplib to create zips on a windows mobile device and open them with winzip or windows xp s built-in compressed folders feature and also no trouble producing zips on the desktop with sharpziplib and processing them with my own zip extraction utility basically a wrapper around zlib on the mobile device
71899
it works fine for realplayer and mplayer but the quicktime plugin doesn t respond to javascript if the hidden bit is set - is there any workaround for this
71929
corey my answer of using fxcop had assumed you were interested in removing unused private members however to solve the problem with other cases you can try using ndepend
71950
if you need to impose packets on a pipe you need to do it yourself by writing pre-determined or delimited number of bytes as packet length and then the rest of teh packet
71977
something like vi is great emacs is also fine or if you absolutely must be on windows something like notepad++ or jedit will be decent
71983
2 set a breakpoint at the last known location that examplestring is used or modified without any problem
71993
the keywords you are looking for are class var - this starts a block of class variables in your class declaration
72018
passing the data through perl sed awk one-liners can help with getting it in the proper format and the shell script can easily handle prompting for filenames handling arguments etc
72020
unless this returns the error code for invalid argument or any other error bytesavailable contains the amount of data available for unblocking read operations at that time
72027
if you absolutely must scrape content look for microformats in the markup most blogs especially wordpress based blogs have this by default
72063
of course html validity may not be a requirement for you so long as it works in most browsers and then the quirks-mode switching mentioned will get you without the doctype many browsers will switch to quirks mode possibly changing the layout
72073
i found that setting height 0 width 0 worked the same as hidden true and solved the problem
72117
if you were building perl code to be executed on a windows machine other than your own i would consider writing it with an eye towards a default or as default as i could get it as perl installation executing it
72147
why would you want to do this though - adding in a line to obtain a mutex lock is only one or two lines of code in most languages and would remove any possibility of problem
72180
use python module zipfile to create zip archive but as the file specify stringio object zipfile constructor requires file-like object
72214
you can start a replication by creating a database from scratch and you can control either the updates will be done by updating the available client database or simply recreating the database
72230
there is no need of mocking frameworks to do tdd
72267
another issue that occurs when using select is that there are idiots who choose to add new fields in the middle fo the table always a bad practice if you use select as the basis for an insert then suddenly your column order may be wrong and you may try to insert the social security number into the honorarium the amoutn of money a speaker may get paid to pick a non-random example which could be a very bad thing for data integrity
72274
using recursion you re incurring the cost of a function call with each iteration whereas with a loop the only thing you usually pay is an increment decrement
72278
on intranet with nt domain you can use ntlm to pass windows credentials directly to servers in intranet perimeter without any need to duplicate sessions
72328
the clr likes to optimize instructions so when you access a field in code it might not always access the current value of the field it might be from the stack etc
72328
marking a field as volatile ensures that the current value of the field is accessed by the instruction
72418
setfromrow will setup the object from an associative array of col value pairs and get as row will essentially serialize the object as col value pairs
72444
i ve changed the code to use malloc free
72456
bugzilla is a defect tracking system or bug-tracking system
72456
gmail is a new kind of webmail built on the idea that email can be more intuitive efficient and useful.
72515
is it possible to change the type of control that is used for the value field of a property
72556
i am playing with microsoft s treeview control and i am trying to force a data update of some sorts while editing a node s label similar to updatedata for a grid
72580
by cross-platform i mean currently mac osx windows and linux
72600
you can either use a std set of 3d coordinates or a sorted std vector
72633
but as you already have a working c# code porting it to actionscript might requires a redesign due to actionscript having a different way of thinking programming they use different primitive data types for example they use just a number instead of int float double etc
72643
for a question that vague all that i can answer is open ms access and click the mouse a few times
72653
features most used by myself include integrated grep search which can include use of regular expressions with a nice ui code navigation ctrl-g for quick search and jump to any method in unit custom key combinations eg you could set ctrl-shift-b to build-all ascii chart for any installed system fonts
72662
the only minor annoyance is that the debug parameters execution path deployment target etc. are stored in one of those files don t know which so if you have a standard for them you won t be able to publish it via scm for other developers to have the entire development environment ready to use
72760
in visual studio 2008 you may get a compiler error because bstr is defined as a pointer to unsigned short while wchar_t is a native type
72773
sharepoint 2007 both moss and wss exposes document libraries via web dav allowing you to create documents via essentially file system level activities saving documents to a location
72799
i for one have windows development experience with builder c++ almost delphi and mfc almost qt with a bit more time working with builder c++
72820
using the file utility in cygwin reveals that there is indeed a difference between the same file compressed with gzipstream and with gnu gzip probably header information as others has stated in this thread
72828
i think you ll want to capture the http_host value and then use that in the rewrite rule
72858
that includes all the installation + configuration and stuff
72921
the difference is that instead of an alert message as in levik s answer i open a new window similar to jacob s answer
72942
enable tracing logging in all third party apps and libraries you are using such that the errors are logged to files instead of stdout or stderr
73008
unfortunately we can t submit the information in chunks during each form submission so we have to store it the users session until the end of the process and submit it all at the same time
73021
in c++ ada pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference you can actually change the variable that was passed
73046
my solution was to wrap the connection objects returned by odbc.odbc ... and pyodbc.pyodbc ... by a delegate class which contains the desired time representation function as the value of an extra field and which delegates all other field requests to the original connection object
73065
this has the advantage that normal win32 forms functionality will continue to work such as taskbar-flashing of the form when you click on one of its modal dialogs or the management of mouseover mousedown events would still work normally etc
73084
why not just use instr for oracle or charindex for sql server combined with substring
73085
your value objects need some kind of identity field
73087
is there a standard x gnome program that will display the x y width and depth in pixels of a window that i select
73101
so generally if you want to target mobile devices you will have to make sure your ecommerce website works fine in small resolutions it doesn t use activex since it won t work on iphone safari opera mini and psp browser etc
73109
the error shows up using both myisam and innodb table engines
73112
public protected and then private and within each section alphabetically although i often list constructor first and deconstructor last
73119
increment a count for that function and line every time the constructor is called and decrement the count every time the destructor is called
73134
would i be better off changing this code to use malloc and free instead
73149
if the module s name does not contain any package information it is set to __main__ then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system
73150
if that is not possible then it is okay to use oids as they should not change per the snmp mib guidelines
73150
this is obvious but be sure to look at the attributes of the snmp mib variable
73157
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors
73176
the nice thing about madexcept is that it will generate a report for you with a full stack trace that will generally point you in the right direction as to what went wrong and can even include a screenshot as well has have this automatically emailed to you from the clients computer with a simple mouse click
73194
the messages have sequence numbers so i can t accidentally process an old message left on the card
73202
bison is readily available and at least on linux yacc is usually implemented as bison
73233
if you must do this then it might be clearer to use malloc and free in this case since then you or other programmers might be a little less likely to make assumptions about the types and sizes of the allocated objects
73236
i personally prefer python but php will work as well
73250
with the ongoing port of swt jface i plan to do more and work in d which i would have been done in java before
73295
rather than switching to malloc free if only because it s a simpler change to make without making mistakes
73295
so i guess it s probably as easy to switch to malloc free after all
73325
strange - no one mentioned gedit gnome or openkomodo windows mac gnu linux...
73326
there are a lot of frameworks based on ruby php python of course
73342
fortunately if you re using .net you can use clickonce deployment instead of an msi which should allow you to install to a folder in each user s profile without requiring admin permissions
73350
built in ssh command line prompt sftp ftp etc support
73352
if you really want the image to stretch to fit you can go a little further and add an image into that div and define its style to fit width height 100
73381
then simply hide the part that is filled out and show the next part of the form.
73384
you could do the same thing with nominal typing and implementing an anonymous class that implements an interface or abstract class but that ends up being a lot of code when only one function is needed
73399
edit i may have misread your question doxygen is a tool to generate documentation and models based off your code and javadoc
73415
building off of icco s suggestion of svn i d actually suggest that if you are using subversion or similar for source control and if you aren t you should probably start you can keep the production environment up to date by putting the command to update the repository into the post-commit hook
73418
you can tell tidy to generate xhtml which is a type of xml which means you can use all the usual xml tools like xslt and xquery on the results
73430
python and c++ make a good combination see for example pygame
73468
i m coding the shutdown of a multithreaded server.if everything goes as it should all the threads exit by their own but there s a small chance that a thread gets stuck.in this case it would be convenient to have a non-blocking join so i could do
73471
i have an editable datagridview with selectionmode set to fullrowselect so the whole row is highlighted when the user clicks on any cell
73517
in a silverlight application i want to access the page the silverlight .xap file from an http subdomain but have the web services access a different subdomain for sensitive information over https
73517
i set up clientaccesspolicy.xml at the root of the subdomain and it lets the silverlight app access its services over http but not over https
73517
i know that browsers themselves have a lot of restrictions about mixing http and https
73519
i would like to remove stl boost debug symbols from libraries and executable for two reasons
73519
debugging jumps into stl boost code which is annoying
73561
by the way if you develop networked applications and care about data security the least you should do is read a book like practical cryptography by niels ferguson and bruce schneier and probably further reading that s more focused on web application security would be a good idea
73574
ssl..or rather https http over ssl sends all http content over ssl and as http content and headers are in fact the same thing this means the headers are encrypted as well
73588
use checkradiobutton to set select one button in a group and getcheckedradiobutton to retrieve the id of the selected button
73599
how can i send an email by java application using gmail yahoo or hotmail
73667
how can i start an interactive console for perl similar to the irb command for ruby or python for python
73670
static routes- these will work fine unless you are using a vpn tunnel
73687
if you want something simple without having to make your own framework while still not being all inclusive django you might want to try cherrypy
73688
so you are gonna have to call toupper on the first char and tolower on the remaining characters
73698
there isn t an interactive console for perl built in like python does
73704
python and c++ is a good choice but other style like c# c++ works
73704
for scientific visualization python c++ is accepted like vtk s bindings in python
73719
in general most languages winforms java awt swt etc have an image or background image property that allows you to use images for buttons
73722
yes if you are using the https http over ssl protocol instead of plain http
73745
after a couple years i don t get all the files off that i put on them
73763
then you need to make the constructor private to prevent users to create their own foo
73765
it s a full on shell you can use it in replacement of bash for example but uses perl syntax
73777
1 backup to some optical media on a regular basis say burn it to dvd once a month and archive it offsite
73876
you could use javascript to traverse and pass the dom than make a call into your wcf service from the javascript when all the ajax calls are complete
73891
in excel vba this function will give you the content of any cell in any worksheet
73891
so if you want to check the value of cells just put the function in a loop give it the reference to the worksheet you want and the row index and column index of the cell
73930
what do i need to add to my .spec file to create the desktop shortcut and assign an icon to the shortcut during install of my .rpm
73933
i can add them simply order them as desired and view them in the browsing perspective and preview tab
73939
the server can then send a stream of javascript commands like
73946
the worksheet object has three properties that can be used to access cell data cells rows columns and a method that can be used to obtain a block of cell data get_range
73959
jersey makes it easy to expose restful web services as xml and or json
73963
what i do in these cases is open a blank line between the paragraph lines and the argument lines then use m-q to wrap the paragraph lines then kill the blank line between them
73985
unlike ruby python php etc d tries to be almost as fast as c even if it is less dynamic and slightly more difficult to program in than scripting languages
73997
if you want to use pre-request injection such as in a web application you might find guice is quite a bit faster for dependency injection than spring
74003
gnome will generally look in the kde icon directory to see if there are other icons there also..
74058
however any mainstream linux distribution should have either the ifconfig program or the ip program or both
74131
because the underlying file type excel spreadsheet vs openoffice oracle vs mysql etc
74139
well you could store the data in a format you could read but which maintained the integrity of your data xml or json for instance
74174
i can however recommend itextsharp which is a .net port of the java itext
74188
i ve created a listbox to display items in groups where the groups are wrapped right to left when they can no longer fit within the height of the listbox s panel
74198
hex - decimal
74198
decimal - hex
74218
hup reload without restart
74223
to convert from decimal to hex do.
74223
to convert from hex to decimal do either.
74236
looking at the source it appears that someone did a search and replace for malloc and free and the above is the result
74240
see fopen fread fwrite and fclose for a starting point
74288
this fills out a provided xwindowattributes structure which includes integers for the x and y position of the window as well as its width and height and other useful facts
74299
so if i m doing .net sql server python via django or pylons mysql or sqlite
74327
this is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc free
74327
but the management cost of having to increment and decrement counters upon each pointer assignment cost a lot of time and some kind of garbage collection is still needed to reclaim cycles
74341
i ve rolled my own for years but when playing with others stay far far away from dojo + jquery
74368
i am trying to create an email two column flexible layout which works in outlook 07 i have created a successful version in outlook 03 hotmail gmail yahoo and aol in both ie and mozilla firefox however when testing in outlook 07 it strips out my float left css
74372
i am involved in the process of porting a system containing several hundreds of ksh scripts from aix solaris and hpux to linux
74372
on aix solaris and hpux the output is flag true on linux the output is flag false
74372
on aix solaris and hpux ksh is a variant of ksh88
74372
on aix solaris and hpux dtksh and ksh93 where i have them installed are consistent with ksh
74372
on aix solaris and linux bash is consistent giving the incorrect from my perspective result of flag false
74378
inside of my style rule declarations i keep all my rules well ordered going from display attributes position size margin border padding background color text attributes line attributes word attributes to font-attributes
74386
is it possible to call managed code specifically ironruby or ironpython from unamanaged code such as c++ or delphi
74386
for example we have an application written in delphi that is being moved to c#.net we d like to provide ruby or python scripting in our new application to replace vbscript
74386
however we would need to provide ruby python scripting in the old delphi application
74386
is it possible to use the managed dlls provided by ironruby ironpython from delphi code
74400
the static keyword in the above example is redundant a nested interface is automatically static and can be removed with no effect on semantics
74400
the same goes for public on interface methods and public final on interface fields - the modifiers are redundant and just add clutter to the source code
74401
if your target is a pc i think you can try c# or embed lua in your c++ app and run scripts for high-level stuff
74406
starting with a proper database like oracle or sql server or mysql postgres if you are looking for free options is a good idea
74409
i m starting to think that it would be a simpler though less flexible to just use the free svg continent maps on wikipedia convert them to png and create an image map of all the countries - then use canvas and vml to draw an element on top of the countries - but this just seems like a huge pain and very error-prone compared to a flash solution
74420
basically you are enabling your .net classes to be called through com activex from your win32 code delphi or c++
74446
aix and solaris use versions of the original ksh so the kornshell.org version is usually feature- and bug- complete
74446
having cut my teeth with sunos solaris installing kornshell.org ksh is usually one of the first things i do on a new linux box.
74483
the ide comes with over 100 examples some language examples loops some learning examples arrays some fully-functional games and sims pong missile command game of life
74539
but i have known programmers who wrote a perl or python script to try commenting out each include line one at a time and then compile each file
74552
parallelism means awk and perl and
74552
python and perl look ok while awk
74552
and perl and python and perl do
74566
lua and python are both popular for higher-level scripting
74585
that s what ref and out parameters c# are for
74596
i have seen significant performance gains from using the ensurecapacity int capacity method call on an instance of stringbuilder before using it for any string storage
74625
edit note that i m aware of the vim gvim cream and macvim etc. variants of vi
74625
i ve been using vim more precisely macvim in my day to day professional life since last december
74668
these include fortify and ouncelabs expensive and for many languages visualstudio.net codeanalysis for .net and c++ free with vsts decent but not great owasp s lapse for java free decent not great checkmarx not cheap fantastic tool for .net and java but high overhead and many more
74675
the script can print to stdout or stderr and that output should be visible to you in the visual studio build output window the window that usually shows stuff like build 3 succeeded 0 failed
74680
in your keyup event listener call the store s filter method see doc passing the field name and the value from the text field
74688
you can use java s zipfile and zipentry classes to read the contents of a jar file then use zipoutputstream to create a new one
74715
a guideline though is if you set width on an element don t set margin or padding on the same element
74720
if you are using tomcat check out psi probe which lets you monitor internal and external memory consumption as well as a host of other areas
74782
what s the difference between eruby and erb
74782
my plan is to template the config files using embedded ruby via either eruby or erb within the source files to do things like iteratively generate all the interface config blocks for a router these blocks are all very similar differing only in a label and an ip address
74782
which when run through an embedded ruby interpreter either erb or eruby produces the following output
74801
it can do charts of these parameters export to csv show the number of classes loaded the number of instances deadlocks threads etc.
74807
erb is pure ruby eruby is written in c so it s a bit faster
74823
eruby is an external executable while erb is a library within ruby
74823
you would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files quick-and-dirty php replacement and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other ruby script
74823
it is more common to use erb simply because it is more flexible but i ll admit that i have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute .rhtml files for quick little utility websites
74841
attackers control the runtime memory of the flash interpreter so that anyone who knows how to use a programmable debugger can alter any variable including the current score at any time or alter the program itself
74844
my question is what are the advantages of using kornshell ksh or bash shell
74846
sudo bash will basically switch you over to running a shell as root although it s probably best to stay as su as little as possible
74857
according to this vim-enhanced is just vim with the perl python tcl and cscope options compiled in. you should be able to find everything you need to know about these compile options in the documentation
74867
on linux unix you can easyly make a jvm crash by sending it a signal to the running process
74872
z shell has a good combination of ksh s unique features with the nice things that bash provides plus a lot more stuff on top of that
74878
it can be set on any versioned directory and its value is a multi-line table of subdirectories relative to the versioned directory on which the property is set and fully qualified absolute subversion repository urls.
74879
i am looking for a tool which will take an xml instance document and output a corresponding xsd schema
74904
for my implementation i put the iframe in a modal popup and added a button with style display none to handle the closing of the popup
74913
microsoft lost and now it s either width or margin padding border for an element
74921
i tried prototype and scriptaculous first but then switched to jquery and there is no looking back
74931
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql
74936
bin sh on linux is actually bash but if you re aiming for cross-platform scripts you re better off sticking to features of the original bourne shell or writing it in something like perl
74937
you could simply use the bash shell arguments like this
74951
so i followed the technique suggested and it only works if i explicitly set the width height on the proxy image
74970
antlr creates native parsers in java python and .net
74971
i would imagine you could use tools like lex flex cup antlr or yacc or their equivalents for whatever programming language you are using
74972
i created an auth library that i use to manage authentication and authorization
74992
i don t have experience with ksh but i have used both bash and zsh
74992
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion
75003
on a side note string + var is also more performant that the string.format approach generally that uses a stringbuilder internally when in doubt.
75015
put all the ideas together and you might get a model-t.
75021
so if you want place another pdf inside another dynamically generated pdf document like an image use fpdi + fpdf tcpdf
75051
the yourkit java profiler is an excellent commercial solution
75103
for example if you need to pad three lines and line x is the edge line x+1 is equal to line x line x+2 is equal to line x-1 and line x+3 is equal to line x-2
75114
this is a bit of a unix vs linux battle
75114
most unix systems like solaris aix and hpux have ksh as default
75134
the fadeout and the fadein run simultaneously how do i make them run one after the other
75151
learn macros because vim is the best for automated tasks and snippet insertion like formatting a few words into a complex xml tag or converting a csv to an html table
75166
the methods for detecting screen width and height are accurate for all handsets in my experience
75182
assume a standard bsd or linux system
75185
enter that as the only content in your index.php in your root directory and any requests sent to that folder will then redirect the user to the forum
75192
2 create spring helper class that finds all relevant listeners in the context and calls maintainer#addlistener for each listener found
75193
i remember when i first started learning emacs it was after i was already very comfortable with vim and i was in the same or similar boat that you were where i knew how to get a lot done in another editor so as i started using emacs it was always painfully slow
75205
synchronizing via collections.synchronizedxxx won t do good since it does not guarantee iterator safety it only synchronizes writes and reads via put get set .
75238
on most platforms signed char will be an 8-bit two s complement number ranging from -128 to 127 and unsigned char will be an 8-bit unsigned integer 0 to 255
75244
also the remove listener methods are likely unneeded since the listener contains no exterior references to any other instances but they can be added to make code reviews go smoother
75298
if you re just running a regular java program then i would imagine you re stuck with public static void main string args try .
75301
as a general rule of thumb if i have to set the value of the string more than once or if there are any appends to the string then it needs to be a string builder
75303
some languages like javascript adapted basic features like garbage collection and lexical closures but all the stuff that might actually change how you write programs on a large scale like powerful macros the code-as-data thing and custom control structures only seems to propagate within other functional languages none of which are practical to use for non-trivial projects
75319
in most cases public apis will expose ilist or icollection or ienumerable as appropriate
75477
in addition to the standard approach of mixing alpha numeric and symbols i noticed when i registered with myopenid last week the password checker tells you if your password is based on a dictionary word even if you add numbers or replace alphas with similar numbers using zero instead of o 1 instead of i etc.
75491
you can edit it with emacs or vim or eclipse or whatever you are most comfortable with
75493
talend should be able to handle all versions of excel and output the result set in any format you require including loading it directly into a database if need be
75495
when creating a usercontrol in wpf i find it convenient to give it some arbitrary height and width values so that i can view my changes in the visual studio designer
75495
when i run the control however i want the height and width to be undefined so that the control will expand to fill whatever container i place it in
75495
how can i acheive this same functionality without having to remove the height and width values before building my control
75506
javafx desktop will run on windows mac linux and solaris at fcs and will require java se
75506
support for linux and solaris will be forthcoming
75506
one important platform distinction is that javafx desktop will support swing components while javafx mobile will not only scene graph for graphics
75513
you can use asynccallbacks to specify a delegate to a method and then specify callback methods that get called once the execution of the target method completes
75514
python or ruby
75514
see paul graham s thoughts on this in the question i like lisp but my company won t let me use it
75527
this will set the design height and width to 500 and 600 respectively
75567
use imagemagick or better yet ghostscript
75590
you could also use pdf2ps ps2image and then convert from the resulting image to tiff with other utilities i remember paul paul - yet another image viewer displays png tiff gif jpg etc.
75591
depending on the project i ve turned it around and used cakephp or symfony tools for generating the forms and a blend of plain x html form coding
75606
in visual studio add the width and height attribute to your usercontrol xaml but in the code-behind insert this
75606
if not runtime it will set the width and height to nan not a number which is the value you set it to if you remove the width and height attributes in xaml
75606
so at design-time you will have the preset width and height including if you put the user control in a form and at runtime it will dock depending on its parent container
75633
there is a local dev qa production sections each containing the configuration keys relevant to that environment in our config file s
75638
the guys behind lua have repeatedly listed scheme and lisp as major influences on lua and lua has even been described as scheme without the parentheses
75654
in java and .net the object members are zero null initialized before any constructor is run and is at this point that the object life time begins
75654
so when you enter the constructor you ve already got an initialized object
75654
in c++ the object life time only begins when the constructor finishes although member variables and base classes are fully constructed before it starts
75654
the problem with the java .net definition of object lifetime is that it s harder to make sure the object always meets its invariant without having to put in special cases for when the object is initialized but the constructor hasn t run
75671
if the switch your host is attached to does not have igmp snooping enabled then all hosts on the same vlan will receive the additional multicast traffic which could lead them to experience the same problems as mentioned above
75700
i want to use annotation based transactions transactional to not mess around with transactionstatus commit save and rollback
75705
i have searched for various techniques on how to read write dbase iii dbf files using oledb or odbc with c# .net
75714
however the field is then bolded in the propertiesgrid because it does not match the default value
75714
from what i can figure out i would need to use methodbuilder and generate the il to check if the field is equal to the default value
75732
i ve seen numerous people mentions that you shouldn t use widths and padding or margins on the same element with css
75736
why aren t lisp haskell ocaml or f# modern
75739
this allows for an optional plus minus sign at the beginning one optional decimal point and the rest numeric digits
75747
i d prefer to render each list item as a single cell with complex rendering for instance the way that stackoverflow shows its lists of questions. i d also like to get as much of the sharepoint-standard ui as possible such as the sorting filtering and paging controls
75758
because some browsers treat the width as the total width of the element including the padding and the margins and others treat the width as the base width to which the padding and margins are added
75789
i ve never come across a problem caused by using width padding and or margin together
75789
so long as you have a valid doctype and are not in quirks mode you will have a predictable box model and therefor should use whichever is most appropriate out of margin padding to represent what you are trying to do
75789
margin applies outside of borders padding applies inside of borders
75792
the raid controller in those does not play well with the xen kernel
75797
are you stating that padding and or margin values shouldn t co-exist with a dom element that also has a width value assigned to it
75797
it would be difficult to achieve the layout you re looking for usually without some margin or padding value
75798
however it s written in python which means there s little real support in the way of deployment packaging debugging profilers and other tools that make building and maintaining applications much easier
75798
ruby has similar issues and although i do like ruby much better than i like python i get the impression that rails is roughly in the same boat at django when it comes to managing supporting the app
75810
same interface so if you like me use oracle ms-sql mysql and postgres then at least your day to day query management tool will look the same for all platforms
75811
summary ie renders width different then the standard rendering if padding and margin used with width or height
75827
if you are using ajax you may also be doing a callback not a full postback
75833
it s outline might not actually match up to the expected 400px 300 px size plus 2 30px padding plus 2 20 px margin
75833
that said i personally use widths along with padding and margins and have no problems with it
75883
an unsigned integer of usually 8 bits
75892
postgres is acid-compliant like innodb and when well-tuned nearly as speedy as myisam
75904
many common desktops including gnome kde and xfce where relevant implement the specifications laid out by freedesktop.org
75935
xml schema should be based on a xsd provided
75943
i m inserting the whole thing into the dom but the javascript isn t being run
75994
another feature that i find useful is that it can pop-up a dialog box that shows all the js and css scripts used on the page
76012
as a simple example let s suppose you want lisp to use curly braces rather than parentheses
76040
there is also slimdx which is under constant development as a means of providing a lean wrapper of directx in a similar fashion as managed directx which was i believe discontinued by microsoft in favor of xna
76276
i would assume you run separate build scripts or have separate targets in the same script - ant and maven can both easily handle conditionally grabbing files and copying them
76279
when you copy paste a textbox excel will place the new textbox over whichever cell is currently selected
76295
tested and working in firefox 2 safari 3.1.2 for windows ie 6 and opera 9.52
76305
but any set of z coordinates that a keep the same x-y distance between the points and b keep the shape a rectangle will work
76305
so any member of this infinite set will do z0+i z1+i z2+i z3+i | i - r
76306
you know a line passing through points 1 and 3 must be parallel to the lines passing through points 2 and 4
76319
then we need to think of opera and safari and
76326
when you redirect to the other server on the same domain check to see if the authentication cookie exists that was created by the authentication server and if it exists and has valid data auto login the user
76328
php5 has a magic method __call that can be defined on any class that is invoked when an undefined method is called -- it is roughly equivalent to ruby s method_missing or perl s autoload
76329
basic authentication sends the login information in the http headers with every request but it s the browser that does this when it sees a new server new password request
76334
i generally use gcc and recall that it can calculate certain values at compile-time when all inputs are known ex sin cos etc...
76348
for databases where it doesn t work hsqldb oracle postgresql etc you will need to futz with database-specific tricks
76368
in addition to the solution suggested by joel coehoorn -- generate typed datasets or business entities from xsd -- let me add a couple of other approaches
76368
in case your database schema is not directly mapped to the given xsd you already have a typed dataset or a set of xml-serializable business objects and those objects are serialized into xml that doesn t conform to xsd you re provided with then you can use xslt to transform your xml to another xml document which will be compliant with the given xsd
76408
the languages to choose from are perl python and ruby
76458
generally if you must have the best indexed lookup performance it s best to build a list first and then turn it into a array thus paying a small penalty at first but avoiding any later
76470
but both perl and python can be used
76508
if you re looking for a scripting language that will play well with java you might want to look at groovy
76556
last time i ran it dojo was the fastest followed by jquery mootools prototype and finally yui
76608
it should be https not ssl

can you double check this in your example client and make sure it is https not ssl
76641
don t video encoding algorithms like mpeg compute the difference between each frame of a video so they can just encode the delta
76742
if cat gets something on the stdin it will echo it to the stdout so you ll have to pipe it to cat output
76763
if exim or sendmail is what s writing into the pipe then procmail is a good answer because it ll give you file locking serialization and you can put it all in the same file
76789
you need to benchmark your own application myisam vs innodb
76793
unfortunately there are several sets of nested nodes the purpose of some of them is just to hold a collection of their children
76811
the only allowed verbs are get put post and delete
76811
in practice though most of this falls away and rest usually just refers to simple http requests that return results in json while soap is a more complex api that communicates by passing xml around
76826
you can simply decorate your class properties with some attributes and the rest is all done for you
76829
the various unix and linux implementations have various different source level implementations of ksh some of which are real ksh some of which are pdksh implementations and some of which are just symlinks to some other shell that has a ksh personality
76833
at the very least use apache but if you can use lighttpd or another high-performance webserver
76854
unfortunately around 45-50 of our client base uses ie6 while the other half are pretty much equally split between firefox and webkit-based browsers with a sprinkling of opera users
76858
even if you use the same ksh you ll still call all kinds of external commands grep ps cat etc... part of them will have different parameters and different output from system to system
76890
i ve also heard very good things about grails which uses groovy on top of spring and is modeled after ruby on rails
76922
namely the reset component will revert all browser specific rendering margin and padding on certain elements for instance creating a level playing field to start from when designing your site

its web site says it can cross compile win32 linux and solaris
77278
according to its web site it works on windows mac os x linux solaris aix and hp-ux
77278
based on the test reports it works on the windows mac os x linux netbsd and solaris but theoretically it should work on other unix systems as well
77290
escaping your output using htmlentities and friends should work as long as it s used properly but this is the html equivalent of creating a sql query by concatenating strings with mysql_real_escape_string var - it should work but fewer things can validate your work so to speak compared to an approach like using parameterized queries
77297
there s no point in attempting to convince your employer to port from php to python especially not for an existing system which is what i think you implied in your question
77310
ping and traceroute use the icmp protocol
77310
like udp and tcp this is accessible through the normal sockets api
77310
only udp and tcp port numbers less than 1024 are protected from use other than by root
77310
if you really want to see how ping and traceroute work you can download an example c code implementation for them from codeproject
77328
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

you cannot write virtual functions to for instance return the desired size of the object and have the default constructor initialize each item
77485
what do folks here see as the relative strengths and weaknesses of git mercurial and bazaar
77496
i faced a similar issue some months ago where some unknown but probably mine app was preventing shutdown so i wrote some quick code that used enumwindows to enumerate all the top level windows sent each one a wm_queryendsession message noted what the return value from sendmessage was and stopped the enumeration if anyone returned false

i ve worked on a high-volume system using mysql and i ve tried both myisam and innodb
77625
of course i have no idea what your application is but hopefully this gives you some insight into some of the issues with myisam and innodb
77639
it seems to me that a constructor should fail -- and thus refuse to create an object -- if the object isn t complete
77639
i.e. the constructor should have a contract with its caller to provide a functional and working object on which methods can be called meaningfully
77643
with respect to performance testing i ve been very skeptical of using vmware or other virtualization processes
77672
for any new project there s a set procedure
77681
if you need to validate something during construction make the constructor private and define a public static factory method
77683
for example reductio for java scala and quickcheck for haskell
77683
for example if i implemented a vector class and it had an add method i might want to check that my addition commutes
77693
the downside is it s written in php and as far as i know php doesn t have superb tools for debugging profiling and packaging of apps
77694
you ll have access to your cck field values with field_name 0 value
77705
the constructor s job is to bring the object into a usable state
77705
the constructor merely brings the object into a sleeper state in which it refuses to do any work
77705
if the object cannot be initialized it must not be allowed to exist so the constructor must throw
77709
allows you to write code which is applicable to many types with the same underlying behaviour a dictionary string int uses the same underlying code as a dictionary datetime double
77717
also for the same reason servers that have neither python nor ruby installed are still likely to have perl on them again making it important to have some familiarity with
77717
in terms of libraries i do not know how ruby and python compare against each other i do know that perl has them beat by a margin
77717
and if you are only looking to do things in some particular area which is well covered by libraries for python or ruby the mass of other stuff on cpan isn t necessarily an advantage
77724
i agree with iulian erb noiu code blocks is a very good solution usable both from linux it will use g++ gcc and from windows it will use either the ms compiler or gcc

every time a feed is selected in the gui i reload all the items from that feeds xml file

bazaar is reasonably fast very fast for trees with shallow history but presently scales poorly with history length and is easy-to-learn to those familiar with the command-line interfaces of traditional scms cvs svn etc
77727
while globally unique revision-id identifiers are available for all revisions tree-local revnos standard revision numbers more akin to those used by svn or other more conventional scms are used in place of content hashes for identifying revisions
77727
about the author i use git and perforce for work and bazaar for my personal projects and as an embedded library
77731
i m looking for a python analogue to this library since the website only has java .net ruby versions available
77740
this is not the only option it could finish the constructor and build an object but with a method iscoherent returning false in order to be able to signal an incoherent state that may be preferable in certain case in order to avoid a brutal interruption of the execution workflow due to an exception
77748
the server is linux debian 4.0
77765
well if the objects in the stack can throw in their constructors constructing the temporary to return to the caller you can t guarantee that you won t lose data decrement stack pointer construct return value using copy constructor of value in stack which throws and now have a stack that just lost an item
77766
you absolutely should throw an exception from a constructor if you re unable to create a valid object
77789
so as a corrolary to never return a zombie object form a constructor init
77818
you probably need to install gnu binutils first
77827
it s always tough to imagine how that will look - maybe new tech will become a more immersive experience incorporating more senses then just sight and sound touch is a good candidate as well as something that allows for full-range-motion interaction rather then the 2d point and click mouse interface
77834
the only real difference between cvs subversion clearcase perforce visualsourcesafe and all the other cvcses is in the workflow performance and integration that each product offers

quicksort is not better than mergesort
77945
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases
77951
a constructor should throw an exception when it is unable to complete the construction of said object
77951
for example if the constructor is supposed to allocate 1024 kb of ram and it fails to do so it should throw an exception this way the caller of the constructor knows that the object is not ready to be used and there is an error somewhere that needs to be fixed
77963
in c++ this expression tells the compiler to create 3 objects on the stack perform addition and copy the resultant value from the temporary object into the existing object a
77975
also keep in mind many people use webmail such as gmail hotmail yahoo mail etc
77992
simply looking to push data to and pull data from sap

ruby is a lovely language to learn - and lacks some of the cruft in perl 5
78104
a quad tree is a 2 dimensional tree in which at each level a node has 4 children each of which covers 1 4 of the area of the parent node
78104
an oct tree is a 3 dimensional tree in which at each level a node has 8 children each of which contains 1 8th of the volume of the parent node
78104
intersection algorithms work by starting at the top of the tree and recursively traversing into any child nodes that intersect the object being tested at some point you get to leaf nodes which contain the actual objects
78106
as your question is tool writing and exploit development i would recommend ruby if you choose metasploit or python if you choose canvas
78111
the first column indicates the child frame pointer the second column indicates the return address of the method that is executing the next three columns show the first 3 parameters that were passed to the method and the last part is the dll name nv4_disp and the offset of the method that is being executed +0x48b94

78157
the software architecture involves a kernel driver that reads data into a pool of buffers and a userland app that writes the data to a file on the mounted removable device
78157
this is enough to cause the kernel driver to run out of buffers - and even if i could increase the number of buffers the video data has to be synchronised ideally within 40ms with other things that are going on in real time
78158

78238
i can put together a very nice looking app the prototypes look slick - but when i need to interact with the user to ask questions get input i have to use wx
78284
make sure you are using a lower level api for writing to the disk don t use user-mode caching functions like fopen fread fwrite use the lower level functions open read write
78294
traditionally this means that you want to craft all of the layer 4 header tcp udp icmp.
78315
the standard pattern is for your base class to implement idisposable and the non-virtual dispose method and to implement a virtual dispose bool method which those classes which hold disposable resources must override
78327
there is a difference between authentication and authorization profiling so don t force both necessarily into a single tool
78327
your second solution of using ldap for authentication and a db for authorization seems more robust as the ldap data is controlled by the user and the db would be controlled by an admin
78336
on linux it would be something like dev hda or dev sda but on solaris i am getting a bit lost in the partitions and what the device is called
78340
use ldap ad for authentication only tie ldap users to a most robust profile authorization server using some sort of traditional database mssql postgresql mysql or document based db couchdb simpledb et cetera
78368
if you use malloc free instead of new delete malloc and free won t care about the type
78368
so if you re using a c-like pod plain old data like a build-in type or a struct you can malloc some type and free another
78383
use the latter for any atomic operations on pointers so you re 32 64-bit compatible automatically. that goes whether you want to do things like atomic compare-and-swap increment decrement spin locking or stack queue management

there are more pentesting libraries available in python than in ruby but not enough to offset metasploit
78561
ready integration with windbg for remote windows kernel debugging there s still no good answer in ruby for kernel debugging which is why i still occasionally use python
78561
both ruby and python have java variants you can use to get access to tools like that
78561
also both ruby and python offer
78561
you re not going to go wrong with either language though for mainstream pentest work metasploit probably edges out all the python benefits and at present for x86 reversing work python s superior debugging interfaces edge out all the ruby benefits
78565
don t use atoi and atof as these functions return 0 on failure
78569
atoi and atof will convert the number even if there are trailing non numerical characters
78580
using sscanf you can be certain if the string is a float or int or whatever without having to special case 0 as is the case with atoi and atof solution

if your algorithm is sufficiently complex the fact that the input is xml becomes irrelevant to your choice of tool - i.e roll your own in c++ python whatever
78847
asp.net 1.1 - i have a datagrid on an aspx page that is databound and displays a value within a textbox
78847
the user is able to change this value then click on a button where the code behind basically iterates through each datagriditem in the grid does a findcontrol for the id of the textbox then assigns the .text value to a variable which is then used to update the database
78864
if your controller is massive as you say consider whether it s dealing with multiple resources and if it is perhaps it should be split into multiple controllers based on resource
78907
if you re using or can migrate to .net 3.5 then there s a new binding explicitly created to support scenarios like this where you want your service to be exposed not as a soap service but as fully rest-like service or simply as xml json over http

i there any way to set this in the c# code say with an attribute or something like that
78979
and once you get started you ll want to put an mcu everywhere
78983
has anyone come across best practices for moving from cvs to perforce
79022
you can select that element in css as #first .name and in jquery like so but if you forget the backslash you will have a perfectly valid selector looking for an element with id first and also having class name
79047
take a more declarative approach and decorate your classes interfaces and or properties with some custom attributes then write some generic glue code that binds your ui to your model

i have successfully tried asterisk with lumenvox for a speech recognition ivr
79118
asterisk is an open source software pbx that runs primarily on linux
79134
simply set the width and height values to auto where you instantiate your control and this will override the design-time values for that usercontrol
79134
another option is to set a combination of minwidth and minheight to a size that allows design-time work while width and height remain auto
79182
as others have noted worst case of quicksort is o n 2 while mergesort and heapsort stay at o nlogn

ms-dos is an example of a non-multitasking os as long as you re playing commander keen no other tasks can run on your computer including the dos shell itself
79292
can databases mysql in particular any sql--ms oracle postgres--in general do mass updates and figure out on their own what the new value should be
79323
at that point field 1 s value should be updated and you can perform your check then
79357
although you could get multiple processes to run simultaneously under ms-dos with the help of windows 3.1 or windows 9x the os itself was non-multi-tasking
79358
its true that vim and emacs are very powerful tools but the learning curve is very steep

take a look at the advanced bash-scripting guide for a lot of wisdom on shell scripting - not just bash either
79446
to clarify earlier answers the http protocol is registered with port 80 and http over ssl aka https is registered with port 443
79449
you should use width height
79459
aspect should be a function of your window width and height
79459
specifically width divided by height but watch out for division by zero
79464
for example i connect to my home computer from work using ssh with port forwarding like this
79474
i can put them in one of the shell rc files that get sourced and this solves the environment variables for processes spawned from the console

there is a simlar page for cvs to perforce conversion here although i don t have direct experience with that
79496
i have seen several other sites do this and also connect to yahoo gmail and hotmail contacts

in the vxworks rtos there is a shell that allows you to issue command to your embedded system
79744
for example python web applications can take advantage of mod_wsgi to talk to web servers which is faster than any of the typical ways that php talks to web servers even mod_php ends up being slower if you re using apache because apache can only use the prefork mpm with mod_php rather than multi-threaded mpm like worker
79744
because of this one could argue that python has a native advantage over php
79744
website hosting services are more likely to offer php support than python support
79771
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72
79771
that may require special functions for performing more complex math sine cosine etc but even those can be sped up by using lookup tables
79771
example since you re using fixed-2 representation there s only 100 values in the range 0.0 1 0-99 and sin cos repeat outside this range so you only need a 100-integer lookup table
79774
so for example if i have an expiry set to 08 march 2008 i want that value to be returned to any client - no matter what their timezone is

i ve investigated this and it appears that i need to access console stdout and stderr buffers
79811
once you ve set that up with the dns host from your web app you really are just url rewriting which can be done with some sort of module for the web server itself such as isapi rewrite if you re on iis this would be the prefered route if possible
79811
i have several sites set up in just this exact way create the wildcard for the domain with the dns host and then simply read the host or base domain from the url to decide what to display based on the subdomain which was actually a username
79811
you have to add the wildcard dns entry for your domain with your dns host
79813
if you want something beyond the id column that s there in all lists you re probably going to have to resort to an event receiver on the list that calculates what the value of your unique identified should be or using a custom field type that has the required logic embedded in this

if you are strictly talking about wss 3.0 and not moss then you really don t have global user profiles per se but a hiddenh user information list in each site collection

then you would use your client javascript svg html css to query your server that could store these into a database and the server would be written in an objected-oriented language like java or python

it generates completely separate javascript for each major browser family ie firefox safari etc.

postgres allows you to use languages like perl and python inside the database but the interaction between the language and the database is nowhere near as clean and easy as it is in plpgsql
80346
the preview generates much faster for the client and it hermetically seals the client s session away from things which might bust it in the target website -- poorly behaving javascript and or malware can cause really bad things when you open them even in an ajaxy window-within-a-window

my recommendation for the communication between the client and your c++ server would be to expose your c++ application as a set of restful resources - then at any point in time you can easily write other kinds of clients in any language technology or framework
81182
actual choice is a matter of personal taste although none of these two i consider lightweigth pylons might seem lighter but in fact is not and recently django gathered some additional weight - most likely you will not fit even small application like personal blog in 20mb resident memory
81223
btw i would discourage the use of alloca since stack tends to be much more limited than heap use malloc instead

so the constructor is only being run once for each object but to give you the interactivity it s creating objects silently in the background without telling you about it

he told me that the probability of finding a tcp packet that has an equal payload even if the same data is sent out several times is very low due to the way tcp packets are constructed at system level
81526
admittedly this can be a bit of overkill sometimes but it not hard to set up improves readability and reduces the chances of the author incorrectly remembering whether true means yes do to comparison in a case-sensitive manner or yes do to comparison in a case-insensitive manner
81527
finding the nearest neighbours means walking back up the tree until you get a node with more than one populated child and all surrounding nodes included this ensures the query gets all sides

when you are on a windows machine talking to a unix ftp server ftps or ftp - doesn t matter - the protocol is the same the server will replace any cr lf -combination with lf before storing the file and consequently do the translation in reverse in case you get the file from the unix server

as jordi said though it depends what context you want to run this in - if you re literally going to use templates like the one you listed eruby would probably work better but i d guess you re actually going to be passing variables to the template in which case you want erb

in order to be sure that you are generating the correct artefacts you should have a dedicated server build your deliverables cruisecontrol either with the help of ant maven or any other tool
81728
the java language always promotes arguments of arithmetic operators to int long float or double

the best way of doing it natively is to get into a final variable check for null and put it back in with a 1

in nt4 you can create that folder in your installation directory and in windows 98 and below it doesn t matter anyways due to these systems not having a permission system anyways
81784
on the other hand if you mix up code and its tests in a single project you end up with binaries related to your unit test framework be it nunit mbunit or whatever else and your own binaries side by side
81817
if you don t like that you could look into groovy or scala jruby or jpython both are languages for the jvm compatible with java and which allow such extensions
81826
so in a server shutdown scenario don t expect exit codes
81922
once that is done you should either be able to exclude the test dlls from your production deployment or even better but higher maintenance create an nant or msbuild for production that compiles without the references to the test dlls
81923
if it doesn t you might seriously want to consider vmware or virtualbox as these do have this feature and it s really useful for things like this

fwiw we re using jersey as its packed full of features wadl implicit views xml json atom support has a large and vibrant developer community behind it and has great spring integration
81938
if you use jboss seam you might find resteasy integrates a little better - but if you use spring for dependency injection then jersey seems the easiest most popular active and functional implementation

i m not talking about inversion of control containers and frameworks to assemble plugin architectures just passing dependencies into the constructor of the object under test
82041
this led to brittle tests that required lots of painful set up and would fall over as soon as i started any refactoring
82055
however if you re predominantly a java or groovy developer you may prefer it
82111
rendering html versus xml versus json of your resources is normally pretty easy with frameworks like jax-rs and implicit views - plus its easy to work with restful resources using a web browser
82128
alternatively since we actually use nant to drive the build process we use jetbrains teamcity is there a way to get nant to tell me the time taken for each step
82154
i would use flash if i m trying to add sound into a webpage you can embed a flash document with no width or height so it will be invisible but still play noise
82169
how would i go about build the setup project using nant so i can include it with the build report on teamcity
82178
keep in mind that the actual packets will be different because of differing sequence numbers which are supposed to be incrementing and pseudorandom
82202
ruby and python
82202
also there are more libraries for delphi than for qt but this is mitigated due to the fact you can just use a c or c++ library in a qt project and also because qt is so fully featured you often don t have to look any further
82211
i considered java c++ delphi among others before starting with this six years ago
82215
personally i like to make all inheritance public so as to avoid wasting time with should i make inheritance relation protected or private discussions

i want to add another field which is a calculated value field that needs to be the date provided by the user + 30 days
82220
what formula do i need to pass to the calculated value field to achieve that
82240
the command line is something along the lines of
82240
you can change the debug to release or any other build configuration you ve set up
82265
one thing you ll gain from using annotations instead of an external mapping file is that your mapping information will be on classes and fields which improves maintainability
82269
how can i build the lists in a way that i configure the choice field once and use it in multiple lists so that in the future if i add a value to the choice i add it only once
82275
log4j loggers aren t serializable not in the version of log4j that i m using anyway so if you don t make your logger fields transient you ll get exceptions on serialization
82282
you have all the basic bash shell commands for example grep cut sed and awk at your disposal
82282
you can also use perl or ruby for more complex things
82323
i have a 3 column grid in a window with a gridsplitter on the first column
82373
raii is correct a successful call to the constructor should either result in a fully initialized live object or it should fail and all failures at any point in any code path should always throw an exception
82373
it will still have the potential to throw exceptions they still have to be handled and they virtually always have to be called immediately after the constructor anyway except now you have 4 possible object states instead of 2 ie constructed initialized uninitialized and failed vs just valid and non-existent
82374

82423
on linux and solaris machines this is autodetected
82468
in perforce p4 sync -n doesn t give output like cvs -n -q update
82470
instead i would create a method that performs the functionality that you need in the empty constructor and returns the new object
82480
you can use max and min widths as well as set percentages for cell sizes or hard code cell width s but dynamically growing cells work fine for 1 row it s the next row below it that won t match up
82555
however and i generally disapprove of this method since it duplicates existing functionality it is possible to use elements to build a table like structure
82599
is it java grails python rails coldfusion something else
82601
if you re using the standard svn installation the svn connection will work on tcpip port 3690 and so it s basically impossible to connect unless you change your network configuration you said only http traffic is allowed or you install the http module and apache on the server hosting your svn server
82602
i would say it is possible to drop to flash if you detect that the item is dragged on to the that contains the flash stuff and you set your dragged objects to have a z-index higher than the flash
82634
it depends on your skills with ruby and or groovy whether you have legacy java systems to deal with and where you want to deploy your applications
82634
grails works because we can mix and match groovy with the existing java solutions
82637
however i would choose a light solution like python or rails over java or coldfusion
82704
use urlrewriteing.net for asp.net webforms or routing with mvc
82715
i found that one solution was to setup a custom handler which would move my message onto another queue or poison queue and restart my service
82721
in a sql server database i have a table which contains a text field which is set to allow nulls
82734
the python lxml library acts as a pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

i want to be able to take two or three feeds and then merge then in to a single rss feed to be published internally on our network
82803
you can also use mac or dos to respectively convert your file to macintosh or ms-dos ms-windows file convention
82810
google reader create a group add your feeds into the folder and then share that as an rss feed
82840
once thing you could do is write to an innodb copy of the table and then replicate to a myisam copy
82860
personally i hold passwords in configuration files which are then distributed independently of the application and can be changed to the specific machine environment

if you have linux the same steps are needed but i m not sure how you create a dsn in unix
83128
for each port on the switch list the mac addresses it s forwarding

83292
if you re doing a table-based layout you re unlikely to be using css to control all the spacing and padding in the cells if you were you d almost certainly find it easier to use floating divs etc
83292
however with a div-and-css-based layout it s much easier to tweak things like the spacing between various blocks and their relative sizes
83298
in order to do this you should use css and add position fixed
83299
the library is written in c and was developed under unix linux and my application will run on windows

as already mentioned getting everything to work in internet explorer and firefox opera safari requires judicious use of hacks
83393
by enforcing relationships fks specify an order in which you have to add delete things which can lead to refusal by the db to do what you want
83402
similarly if this is not easily doable in ruby but is in another language such as perl for example running on linux then those suggestions would be welcome
83405
i got spoiled a bit working with json and am looking forward to something on similar lines for xml

because currently all i get back from the authentication process is a token granting me access to which ever google service i have specified in the scope but there s no easy way to even get the user s login id gmail address as far as i can tell.
83497
the benefit is that you can reformat the time however you like including am pm adjustments for timezone addition subtraction etc
83510
have the developers work on a small fixed set of features during a small fixed iteration interval

i am writing a perl script to parse a mysql database schema and create c++ classes when necessary
83512
does it make sense to call all of the get methods in the constructor so that the object has data right away
83516
there s possibly a phobia of stored procedures with mysql partly due to not being overwhelmingly powerful compared to postgresql and even mssql mysqls stored procedures are greatly lacking
83519
concerning an ide i use either dreamweaver or bbedit on os x or vim

on delete set default - if a row in the other table is deleted set any foreign keys referencing it to the column s default
83527
on delete set null - if a row in the other table is deleted set any foreign keys referencing it in this table to null
83578
sorry i don t know mysql but with oracle i would always explicity state the format that i was expecting the format to be in eg dd-mm-yyyy to avoid regional date format problems
83584
if your xml is in a simple format you may look at jquery and the xml to json plugin or the xmlobjectifier
83596
however any method you come up with has worst-case-scenario sets of numbers where you will have to try every combination -- or at least a subset of combinations that grows exponentially with the size of the set

i have a need to display a uitableview containing a user s account credentials
83725
you may find it happens if you are using min- width height or max- width height
83733
this will immediately tell you whether it s a margin problem or a padding problem how wide the element really is etc
83754
you can probably do all of these things in bash but my experience with zsh is that if there s something i want to do i can probably find it in zsh-lovers
83778
have your constructor call a separate init method that queries the database and populates your object s data members
83793
but personally on linux i have a soft spot for oprofile oprofile this is a system wide profiler which is embedded as a kernel module and periodically traces where you application is spending time

this code project paper has a string similarity function using the levenshtein distance
83907
there is the following levenshtein distance algorithm which assigns a value to the similarity of two strings well the difference actually that could be used to build upon
83928
you can use a stringwriter but it s still writing into a stringbuilder
83952
also of note vmware forbids any type of benchmarking to be posted on the internet unless if they authorize the data you will not see any benchmarks that show vmware as slower than tech x the rumor mill states that you can see better performance with hyper-v xvm sun s enterprise version of virtualbox and xen

computing the fr chet distance between simple polygons
84138
maybe you can still use your old deployment infrastructure - just check whether it supports the ftps or ftp ssl
84138
you can check details about ftp ftp ssl and sftp differences at page
84138
2 sftp or ftp ssl server for windows
84138
when you choose whether to use sftp or ftps you have to deploy the proper server
84138
i would recommend the rebex file transfer pack - it supports both ftp and ftp ssl and sftp ssh file transfer
84148
there are no supported methods to uninstall updates in moss or wss
84149
currently i m leaning towards the solution of exposing my java data via a simple servlet that returns json and then rendering the data using php or ruby
84179
there is one interesting initiative called mono which offers .net support on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

i m not sure php or ruby are the answer if java isn t fast enough for you
84206
we use it to stream xml and json back to the browser for ajax stuff
84207
check out restlet for a good framework for exposing your domain model as rest services including json and trivial xml output
84232
i m looking through its menus and don t see any obvious way to set up any custom build steps pre-build post-build pre-link.
84239
for each vertex in the red polygon compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt
84249
i do not know about log4net but nlog works perfectly ok with shared file target - multiple processes can write in one and the same file
84253
the distance can be used to gauge the similarity of your tracks
84257
keep in mind that if you return any result set at all from the stored procedure then you need to use these apis as the stored procedure generates 1 result set for the actual execution and then 1 additional one for each result set intentionally returned from the stored procedure
84263
it s a tree of nodes
84285
i understand that the object wont have fully initialized until the constructor has run to completion but aside from this are there any other issues
84286
is there any tool that can parse a valid c program and generate a report which contains list of functions global variables #define constants local variables in each function etc
84303
we just don t want to spend more time on installation configuration than it is going to save us
84307
regarding sorting usually quicksort is hard to beat in performance an optimized one that cuts off recursion if size goes below 7 items and switches to something like insertionsort maybe shellsort
84307
thus i guess the question is how to quickly calculate the distance between two polygons after all you need to make this computation 50 times
84310
this provides a .net dll with classes similar to those in the system.data namespace
84331
is there a macro or a way to conditionally copy rows from one worksheet to another in excel 2003
84331
i m pulling a list of data from sharepoint via a web query into a blank worksheet in excel and then i want to copy the rows for a particular month to a particular worksheet for example all july data from a sharepoint worksheet to the jul worksheet all june data from a sharepoint worksheet to jun worksheet etc.
84335
those run-time libraries handle the memory management calls to the os in a os independent consistent syntax and those run-time libraries are responsible for making malloc and new work consistently between oses such as linux windows solaris aix etc..
84335
calls to malloc and free may occur in any order
84371
now you can collect say the 5-10 closest polygons to the red one find the distance center to center subtract the radius sort the list and take the top 5 and then do a much more exhaustive routine
84390
sounds like a good approach to me sorry don t know mysql but in oracle you could set a trigger so that when your main column is updated the length column gets automatically updated
84400
often dynamc languages especially python and lua are embedded in programs to add a more plugin-like functionality and because they are high-level languages that make it easy to add certain behavior where a low mid-level language is not needed
84408
when i first learned python i worked for a java shop
84408
occasionally i d have to do serious text-processing tasks which were much easier to do with quick python scripts than java programs
84408
for example if i had to parse a complex csv file and figure out which of its rows corresponded to rows in our oracle database this was much easier to do with python than java
84408
more than that i found that learning python made me a much better java programmer
84408
and as for what makes python easier than java you might check out this question java - python
84420
so really if there s only one element per document that s going to use the style #title then go with id
84423
im not sure if this is what you are looking for but we write our main application with java at the small company i work for but have used python to write smaller scripts quickly
84423
it just seems easier sometimes to sit down with python and write a quick script than mess with classes and stuff in java
84427
int main void
84437
i primarily program in java and c# but use dynamic languages ruby perl to support smoother deployment kicking off os tasks automated reporting some log parsing etc
84437
after a short time learning and experimenting with ruby or perl you should be able to write some regex manipulating scripts that can alter data formats or grab information from logs
84437
an example of a small ruby perl script that could be written quickly would be a script to parse a very large log file and report out only a few events of interest in either a human readable format or a csv format
84438
testing the distance between rectangles is easier than testing the distance between polygons and you can immediately eliminate any polygons that are more than nearest_rect + its_diagonal away possibly you can refine that even more
84441
as for tasks python lua ruby perl are great for small simple tasks like finding some files and renaming them
84503
in addition to the excellent answers above i would also like to add
84504
as well an element you give a specific id to can be manipulated via javascript and dom commands - getelementbyid for example
84535
one big reason to learn perl or ruby is to help you automate any complicated tasks that you have to do over and over
84546
the above is meant for debugging targets that don t match your host that is why it s important to replicate your root filesystem structure containing your libraries
84546
if you are trying to override some of the libraries but not all then you can copy the target library directory structure into a temporary place and use the solib-absolute-prefix solution described above
84661
sometimes in pl sql you want to add a parameter to a package function or procedure in order to prepare future functionality
84713
i can t speak for anything but .net 2003 parser where i did some informal performance tests on push vs pull xslt code
84713
this is similar to what you are asking apply-template push and call-template pull

i m using the rxtx library over usbserial on a linux distro
84785
a bigger question you should be asking yourself is - why do i have a category code in the parts table that doesn t exist in the categories table
84838
your question could use some clarification as to exactly what aspects of translation localization you need help with
84839
i am trying to create an xml file based on data fields from a table and i want to have the nodes named based on the value in a field from the table
84859
i m using the rxtx library over usbserial on a linux distro
84859
one of my biggest problems is that the rxtx serialportevent.output_buffer_empty does not work on linux over usbserial
84860
forgot to mention we still have to support windows 2000 machines in the field so wcf and anything above .net 2.0 won t fly
84866
named pipes doesn t give you the promise of enhancements in future versions of .net
84878
such a handler must be registered in hkcr directory background instead of usual locations like hkcr directory hkcr folder etc
84893
the wcf and .net remoting are really comparable in performance
84893
wcf though has much better server throughput than .net remoting
84903
i ve had good experience using the test frameworks of both perl and python from testing embedded devices
84907
does your form have a checkbox toggle button or option button
84934
for a tray app you d want a simle protocol to communicate - you might as well use a rest style system to send commands to it and stream xml yuk or a custom data format back
84937
for memory-safety reasons you shouldn t expose a reference to an object or that object s fields to another thread from within its constructor
84940
just the mainline ones opera firefox ie and safari
84940
in my experience opera firefox and safari all behave similarly when it comes to basic stuff positioning floats divs etc and it s just ie you ll have to tweak for
84942
sqlinform is an automatic sql code formatter for all major databases oracle sql server db2 udb sybase informix postgresql mysql etc with many formatting options
84943
it is a lot easier to do text parsing in perl ruby python than it is in java or c# partially because it is a lot easier to use regular expressions
84943
it will probably take a lot less time to parse the text file using perl ruby python or maybe even vbscript cringe and then load it into the database than it would to create a java c# program to do it or to do it by hand
84943
it is much easier to create a python perl ruby program to link to a web service and throw some data against it than it is to create the equivalent java program
84943
but even if you don t is it more fun to spend time cutting pasting or is it more fun to create a perl python ruby script once and then have that generate the code
84943
however slapping something together in perl python ruby probably would have been worth it
84943
is it better to do it yourself spend the larger amount of time to make java c# do the task or spend a much smaller amount of time doing it in python perl ruby
84960
i really like the ability to write my hql or jpql and view the generated sql real time
84971
ie restart it 5 times then after the 5th shutdown the whole program and log to file syslog
84974
in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

what are come good or at least clever ways of running multiple sites from a single common python web framework ie pylons turbogears etc
85158
also for a user accustomed to ruby python etc the ability to generate java bytecode and take advantage of the jdk classes and jit compiler has obvious benefits
85193
but i think there are also genuine reasons for introducing new languages to the jvm particularly when they will be run in parallel you can use the right language for the right job a scripting language like groovy may be exactly what you need for your page presentation whereas regular old java is better for your business logic
85215
get all the projects put on a website and see which gets the most hits..
85223
i m thinking of multiplying the integer part with 10 n where n is the number of digits in the fractional part and then adding the fractional part to the integer part and subtracting n from the exponent
85267
i d recommend python or perl
85271
i use cherrypy as my web server which comes bundled with turbogears and i simply run multiple instances of the cherrypy web server on different ports bound to localhost
85277
in the vim and emacs terminal apps the color schemes look horrid
85338
both python and perl have excellent string processing capabilities
85372
you can add subtract that to from any date type and you get the right answer
85377
i use the following svn ignore pattern with tortoisesvn and subversion cli for native c++ c# vb.net and perl projects on both windows and linux platforms
85386
yes any change in any part of the url excluding http and https protocols changes is interpreted as a different resource by the browser and any intermediary proxies and will thus result in a separate entity in the browser-cache
85386
the claim in this thinkvitamin article that opera and safari webkit browsers don t cache urls with
85386
what may have confused the author of the thinkvitamin article is the fact that hitting enter in the address location bar in safari and opera results in different behavior for urls with query string in them
85386
opera and safari behave just like ie and firefox when it comes to caching embedded linked images and stylesheets and scripts in web pages - regardless of whether they have
85402
iterators aren t exactly translatable to the .net way but they are roughly replaced by ienumerable t and ienumerator t
85402
if you do want to control iteration or make the collection a bit more custom have your collection implement the ienumerable t and or icollection t interfaces as well
85409
if you can catch it as soon as it s committed the svnadmin dump load technique isn t too painful
85413
the first thing to do is to scan the integer representation of the digits for the first set one-bit highest to lowest
85414
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox
85414
how do you port a virtual machine from vmware to virtualbox and keep all the capabilities intact
85416
this could easily be parsed into the integer 1567834 followed by e10 which you d then modify to e6 since the decimal was 4 digits from the end of the numeral portion of the float
85422
in addition if there are dev s using emacs or vim you probably want to add and # #
85438
if you can t use a debugger for whatever reason then compile your application with debugging support and add an exception handler for this particular error and print out the stack trace
85452
i ve developed on numerous multi-platform c++ apps the largest being 1.5m lines of code and running on 7 platforms -- aix hp-ux pa-risc hp-ux itanium solaris linux windows os x
85452
use the c99 integer types if at all possible instead of long int short etc -- otherwise it will bite you when you move from a 32-bit platform to a 64-bit one and longs suddenly change from 4 bytes to 8 bytes
85477
virtualbox uses a couple of schemes for networking that are a bit different than vmware
85500
i have an updatepanel with a trigger pointed to an event on a formview control
85500
when the updatepanel refreshes it needs values from the formview control so that on the server it can use them to query the database
85511
however if you re timing some hardware for example some algorithm you put in the gpu then time.clock will get rid of this time and time.time is the only solution left
85517
as you may know silverlight does not have the tilebrush found in wpf
85532
my environment is seam 2.0.1.ga jboss 4.2.2.ga and i m using jsf
85536
however if you re timing the execution of a block of code for benchmarking profiling purposes you should take a look at the timeit module
85540
you can use a stored procedure that returns all the mapped columns in the table for all the records that are not marked deleted then map the linq to sql class to the stored procedure s results
85570
unsafe is useful for for example getting pixel data out of an image quickly using lockbits
85614
i would like if possible not to rely on macports or fink though if they can be made to work with the default apache 2 install that would probably be ok
85620
if that doesn t work you could ping the address and then look or if you have access to the raw network using bpf or some other mechanism you could send your own arp packets but that is probably overkill
85634
your best bet would be to parse the output of ipconfig all on windows or ifconfig on linux
85649
since i mostly work on the console i don t like to use the mouse and click on the small task-bar icon hundred times a day
85664
you just have to be sure that it s authenticating using kerberos and not ntlm or some other digest authentication because the digest is not trusted to use as an impersonation token
85715
hey juan i d recommend that you use the vector3 class as suggested by several others since it s easy to use and above all - supports all operations you need like addition multiplication matrix multiply etc... without the need to implement it yourself
85742
haven t done it yet with wcf but plan to have a local dns entry pointing to our network load balancing nlb virtual ip address which will direct all traffic to one of our servers hosting services within iis
85750
programming at least in the declarative sense comes down to combinations of sequence alternation and repetition
85770
i get this out put
85789
but with languages like python which allow you to embed standard c c++ java inside them or visa versa you can speed up the really critical bits but leave it glued together with the flexibility of a dynamic language
85795
just build your routes as language controller action id
85803
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok
85803
the mysql one was more stable than the postgresql one
85807
i have a web application that is able to open an excel template push data into a worksheet and send the file to a user
85816
or if you submit a form to an https page from an http page does it send it by https instead of http
85816
sure i can put all of the links to this page pointed at the https version but that doesn t stop some fool from accessing it through http on purpose.
85817
first of all you could try a reset like some other people mentioned here you can do a quick margin and padding reset with this piece of css
85817
most of the layout problems you ll have will probably be caused by internet explorer s wrong interpretation of the box model you can avoid this by never setting a width and margin or padding at the same time
85817
this might seem annoying but it s not just apply the padding or margin to the content which is inside your element which has a width set
85820
now if you call container.dispose it will call the disposable methods also though unfortunately it will dispose of the whole kernel and you will have to add all components back in
85846
also you need to take care that any cookies are set to be secure so they will only be sent via ssl
85852
on a recent install i tried the beta drivers i have eclipse ganymede and svnkit pure java svnkit v1.2.0.4502 that you can optionally install with subclipse and they worked pretty much straight out of the box although a colleague found he had to go through a few hoops to make sure eclipse installed them and their dependancies correctly
85868
i have a sufficient amount of experience with ant so far but i am interested in learning more about maven
85878
don t mix http and https on the same page
85878
if you have a form page that is served up via http i m going to be nervous about submitting data -- i can t see if the submit goes over https or http without doing a view source and hunting for it
85891
in ruby perl or python you just intuitively reach for associative arrays hashes dictionaries whatever word you want to use for the smallest things where you might be tempted to create a complex class hierarchy in a statically typed language when the problem doesn t necessarily demand it
85898
perhaps the only immediate short-term benefit is that developers learn to distinguish the nails that need a python perl ruby -hammer
85916
i m looking for a ruby s equivalent of code like a pythonista idiomatic python
86001
later if someone views the pdf in acrobat or foxit just hover the mouse over or click on the little note icons on the page to view the comments
86003
an ssl wrapper pound will decrypt https requests from client browsers and pass them as plain http to the back-end servers
86003
an http https sanitizer pound will verify requests for correctness and accept only well-formed ones
86030
it took some editing to remove control declarations as they get put in a generated file and conflict with the decompiled base class but nothing a few hours didn t cure
86047
what i m trying to find out is why imake would interpret a word such as unix linux or i386 to a number 1 in the produced make-file
86052
linux unix - .subversion config
86083
convert compressed to to raw audio data and if possible raw audio data to mp3 ogg aac .
86088
use the command svn status on your working copy to show the status of files files that are not yet under version control and not ignored will have a question mark next to them
86094
i m not sure if this works on windows it works on osx and linux
86105
my web application has a login page that submits authentication credentials via an ajax call
86105
for example by displaying an error message on the login page. i want the user to re-enter their username and password of course but i want them to see my friendly reassuring login form not the browser s ugly default authentication dialog
86105
the entire reason that i am doing a login form is that our product management team rightly considers the browsers authentication dialogs to be awful
86106
then in your views you have to know which styling type you re using sass or css by virtue of having to select the public stylesheets foo stylesheet or the public stylesheets sass-out foo stylesheet
86111
aquamacs and macvim
86144
use sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader
86162
try not to use margin left and right when floating elements
86173
jython and ironpython are useful if you have an overriding need to interface with existing libraries written in a different platform like if you have 100 000 lines of java and you just want to write a 20-line python script
86173
pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas
86189
there is some truth to this i switch constantly between javascript c# vbscript and vb.net and there is a bit of lost time as i switch from one language to another as i mix my syntax a bit
86201
scala link above for example implements functional features while maintaining compatibility with java
86204
using a configuration file i want to enable myself to turn on and off things like third party logging and using a cache in a c# website
86204
i have a configuration xml file in which i can assert that logging and caching should be turned on or off it could also be in the web.config that s not the point right now which will result in for example a bool logging and a bool caching that are true or false
86212
since the question didn t specify .net this should work in vbscript or vb6
86219
i have used ms tapi in the past but this is windows only and don t want to go the jtapi java route which seems to be the only option on the face of it
86250
you could use a dependency injection container and have it load different logging and caching objects based on configuration
86256
when i say design-view i mean that i right+click on the file and choose view designer - this gives me access to the toolbox and tabs for designer split and code-view which is the view i primarily work in
86260
i think in addition to your mainstream language you want to have a scripting language high productivity for smaller and one-off tasks and a language with a seriously different cognitive style haskell prolog lisp etc.
86265
try this microsoft knowledge base article can t run macro that calls 16-bit dll in 32-bit ms excel
86310
generally there s a core language c or c++ sql of varying degrees shell scripting and possibly some perl or python code on the periphery
86314
it is quite simple use jsr75 fileconnection and remember to sign your midlet with a valid trusted certificate
86325
note the abort message will be written to stderr as opposed to puts which will write to stdout
86327
you can set up some insert update triggers
86346
if you are using the .net framework 3.0 or above i would use wcf
86346
my personal take is that the wcf approach is more clean as you can do contract-driven services and focus on messages not objects i m making a generalization here based on the default programming models of wcf .net remoting
86350
inside the method you put field elements that specify the value for each field
86350
for instance the title field gets the value abcdef
86410
consider using python ruby etc
86426
would it not make sense to support a set of languages java python ruby etc. by way of a standardized virtual machine hosted in the browser rather than requiring the use of a specialized language -- really a specialized paradigm -- for client scripting only
86427
ironpython and jython use the runtime environment for .net or java and with that comes just in time compilation and a garbage collector different from the original cpython
86427
a downside in using jython or ironpython is that you cannot use native c modules they can be only used in cpython
86431
you may also export the metrics to html for public display or to csv format for further analysis
86431
export of metrics to csv or html
86456
i don t think however any of these better designed languages will be java python or ruby
86471
now if you add a maybe int to a maybe int the operator will check to see if they are both just int s inside and if so will unwrap the int s pass them the addition operator re-wrap the resulting int into a new just int which is a valid maybe int and thus return a maybe int
86497
we can say that we re stuck with js but is it really so bad with jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools and all fantastic libraries
86510
update winscp now has a .net library available as a nuget package that supports sftp scp and ftps
86515
i m using cvs on windows with the wincvs front end and would like to add details of the last check in to the email from our automated build process whenever a build fails in order to make it easier to fix
86534
one way to read those lines is to save and compare the line count between changes and read the difference between the last and second last change
86543
if you are not doing that and you absolutely do not want any codebehind on the page then you ll have to create a usercontrol that contains a calendar control and sets its selecteddate
86548
i ve heard great things about sun s zfs with raid-z but the linux and bsd implementations are still experimental

86560
lately it has a jit and can also generate bytecode on the fly check out runtime expression evaluation for an example where they use flash to compile user-input math expressions all the way to native binary
86649
languages such as python and ruby use singletons very little because you can use global variables within a module instead
86660
if some other identity comparison is required you have to override both equals and gethashcode
86693
the distance between the polygons is at most r
86710
the document at indicates that some environments do not support editing -
86712
if you need to make any more than few non-trivial decisions loops anything go for python perl and modularize
86712
the biggest problem with shell is often that end result just looks like a big ball of mud 4000 lines of bash and growing.
86779
if you are doing anything in unix linux macos etc you must read advanced programming in the unix environment also known by the acronym apue by the late w richard stevens
86783
it is a possible security risk it has a different scope of execution and is quite inefficient as it creates an entirely new scripting environment for the execution of the code
86790
it s a tree of nodes
86790
some nodes on the tree are special
86793
if the user then clicks to select just one item in the list the listview will fire a selectedindexchanged event for every item that is getting unselected and then an selectedindexchanged event for the single newly selected item rather than firing an event to indicate that the selection has changed
86803
inside any set accessor or function with state-changing side effects just call the event delegate with a guard for the null no listeners case
86812
the nodes may be different in their design you can build a tree structure many ways
86812
for example a single abstract class that can have child nodes if no children its a leaf if no parent its a root but this can change in its lifetime
86827
you could also make the value of the combo box into an uneditable text field and then launch a pop-up modal window to edit that value
86855
the first thing you should change are your calls to streamwriter and streamreader to wrap them in a using statement like this
86865
so you have nodes which have children and a parent and you have sectionnodes which are the roots of these special subtrees
86873
create xsd schema from an xml document
86881
when two object are the same the equals method returns true they must have the same value returned from gethashcode
86881
if some other identity comparison is required you have to override both equals and gethashcode
86901
i have tried setting the rootpanel width and height to 100 and that still didn t work
86928
in addition you can also add filtering on the appender itself but this should normally not be necessary
86931
kent fredric note that the last comma is not strictly needed but allows you to more easily move lines around if you move or add after the last line and it didn t have a comma you d have to specifically remember to add one
86956
think about the number of mouse keyboard clicks it takes a user to get to something
86958
sun studio is available for linux as well as solaris
86977
nish also says that if the method signature contains any clr types then the jit compiler will automatically add the __clrcall
86980
however if you wrap your items in some sort of frameworkelement-derived object before adding them to the listbox you can use transformtovisual to get the relative size and use height and width to set the size of the item
86991
then you need to programmatically export the report
86996
i think you ll need to put something on the left and or right of the split split.setleftwidget widget split.setrightwidget widget or split.add widget which will add first to the left then to the right in order for anything to show up
87006
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths
87018
we created a lookup table that holds all the available pick lists and a lookupvalue table that contains all the name value records for the lookup
87021
given a moderately complex xml structure dozens of elements hundreds of attributes with no xsd and a desire to create an object model what s an elegant way to avoid writing boilerplate from_xml and to_xml methods
87035
for instance sniff the network traffic rather than monitor it from your server -- have another machine watch the packets fly back and forth and record statistics about them
87062
i would like to find a way to take jpeg or gif png images and reduce the amount of colors to 20
87064
you could also add a sortorder field if you want to manually define the order to display them in
87071
where findmeinad is a method that looks up a user s info in ad and tbpfolderverification.text is a text box in the form that contains the path i d like to set a particular drive to map to
87111
i would look into using jax-rs java.net project jsr311 it is pretty simple to use it supports marshalling and unmarshalling objects to from xml out of the box
87111
resteasy - the implementation i prefer good support for marshalling and unmarshalling a wide-range of formats
87141
then i use drawimage in the onrender method to draw the rendered content
87177
i had data in xml that had line feeds spaces and tabs that i wanted to preserve in the output html so i couldn t use p but i also wanted the lines to wrap when the side of the screen was reached so i couldn t use pre
87210
fortunately my hosting account has both .net and php support so i ve been looking into drupal graffiti dotnetnuke joomla community server and more
87211
if you want you could add a separate value field but i just usually use the id field as the select box value
87214
you ll normally only get mouse keyboard events to a window or control when it has focus
87217
one last thing i would look at is that if you re doing any joins that can be re-ordered try using a hint to force the join order to happen in what you know to be the most selective order
87221
product 12 when a rewrite rule exists would be an issue as then you are linking to content in two different ways
87245
in asp.net webforms how do you detect which textbox someone pressed enter
87280
boost is to c++ as cpan is to perl
87308
when working with multiple people we create a similar environment for each person and still can work with each of our individual projects at times we will have completely isolated dev environments with individual databases and code at other times i have worked with a shared dev database to resolve issues with dev module installation issues
87334
are you looking to see which textbox was being focused so that you can trigger the proper button click event
87334
textbox button combination on a single form and still allow the user to type their query parameter hit enter and have the proper search method get invoked in the code behind
87339
to find some best practices look how linux distro s debian write their init-scripts usually found in etc init.d
87343
you could keep a counter increment it after each frame is rendered then reset the counter when you are on a new second storing the previous value as the last second s # of frames rendered
87360
map and hashmap were two derived classes of basemap one specializing basemap on std map and the other on stdext hash_map
87360
map and hashmap needed easy read write access to the tmap defined in basemap
87360
but otherwise protected should be avoided as much as possible use private by default and public when you must expose the method
87364
if any have the status user set right-click on the preference and choose reset
87392
the thickbox plugin for jquery will do what you want
87403
just use resharper to create you equals gethashcode methods
87410
if you put your regex in parentheses you can get the length and thus the end using
87428
and then the lightbox plugin for jquery
87430
they login to your account and scrape the contents or use a public api
87435
i assume they log into your email account either by pop3 a public api or they know the html formatting of webmail systems and read the dom
87438
all the gnu tools amd unix stuff works great on windows if you install cygwin
87450
-context this allows you to see lines before and after the match line
87516
in a bash shell for example
87519
similarly even objects with expensive equals methods have inexpensive tostring calls
87519
for example the java.net.url class has an equals method which makes use of an internet connection to determine whether two urls are truly equal but it still has a simple and constant-time tostring method
87522
port the existing application to classic asp using jscript which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .net msjscript without too much trouble and eventually end up on the .net platform preferably the mvc stuff will be done by then asp.net isn t much better than were we are on now in our opinions
87523
though with a moving average if you have consistent formatting printing the instantaneous average fps on each frame would probably be ok
87526
the reason why i used crystal report is because i had to print the report into lg matrix printer that is basically i had to export the report in text format
87556
maybe gmail hotmail and all others do have api s which users can use....need to look into it more i guess
87577
it seems that getting the value of an element in an array can be much faster than interacting with excel so you can see some difference in performance using an array of all cell values compared to repeatedly getting single cells
87621
it is important for me to have the xml in the structure xsd that i created
87624
the library is available for php .net java ruby coldfusion
87638
linq to xml is very powerful if you re using .net 3.5 linq to xsd may be useful to you too
87649
alternatively you can add it to the url and let the scripting language php perl asp python ruby whatever handle it on the other side
87666
i have recently run into an issue where i wanted to add a folder to the directory structure of my project that would become the new root directory for the previously housed files
87704
the use of python as a scripting language we run c++ tests is worthwhile if you re trying to build a series of structured tests
87726
my preferred python xml library is lxml which wraps libxml2
87734
the only way i can think of so far is to calculate all the points around the perimeter and find the max min x and y values
87734
if there s a function in the mathematical sense that describes an ellipse at an arbitrary angle then i could use its derivative to find points where the slope is zero or undefined but i can t seem to find one
87752
step 1 define a property in your nant script to track the environment you re building for local test production etc.
87752
step 3 update your configuration target to pull in an appropriate properties file based on the environment property
87756
that .fla can be passed off to a designer who can add whatever they want as long as they keep the names and nesting order - essentially like skinning an app
87802
running rails 2.1 either via mongrel webrick or passenger in development mode if i make changes to my views they don t update without me having to kick the server
87840
if you only want to update the text simply set the changed subitem s text directly rather than updating the entire listviewitem you ve not said how you re doing your updates
87842
probably the most important thing to remember when performing an extended precision multiplication is that you must also perform a multiple precision addition at the same time
87849
i am about to move to svn as my rcs of choice after many years using cvs and have a basic question.
87868
just do normal long multiplication as if you were multiplying a pair of 2-digit numbers except each digit is really a 32-bit integer
87892
web site for linux kernel asynchronous i o support here says that sockets don t work but the aio.h manual pages on my ubuntu 8.04.1 workstation all seem to imply that it works for arbitrary file descriptors
87923
i should probably make it clear that the slashes are the literal regex delimiter in ruby and perl and js etc
87925
this could lead to discepancy in an update-heavy system so systems should be architectured to work with updates as less as possible - moving things to aggregation of data and pulling out the aggregates once the exact figure is critical moving requirement for consistency from write-time to critical-read-time
87984
you would have to access the javascript dom
88020
you could try using the parametrized equations for an ellipse rotated at an arbitrary angle
88020
...where ellipse has centre h k semimajor axis a and semiminor axis b and is rotated through angle phi
88020
which should give you many solutions for t two of which you are interested in plug that back into 1 to get your max and min x
88047
drupal tends to be more developer-friendly than end-user friendly so if you re not a developer it is harder to grasp than something like joomla
88075
luajit is also around 10 times as fast as python and the lua interpreter is much much smaller 150kb or around 15k lines of c which you can actually read through and understand
88100
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss
88114
technically converting a result set to an xml file is straight forward and doesn t need any tool unless you have a requirement to convert the data structure to fit specific export schema
88157
in case a new value cannot be accepted you can cancel data update bringing back the previous value in the field
88166
your desire to create a wpf mapping tool is similar to mine which lead me to ask this question about deepzoom aka multiscaleimage from silverlight
88183
the python c api manual is longer than the whole lua manual including the lua c api
88215
xrtti is a tool and accompanying c++ library which extends the standard runtime type system of c++ to provide a much richer set of reflection information about classes and methods to manipulate these classes and their members
88248
when you click on a date with the calendar asp does a postback you could always put the selecteddate value of the calendar control into a hidden field on the page during the onload event of the page or the selectionchanged event of the calendar control

i have an asp.net repeater which contains a textbox and a checkbox
88361
i need to add client-side validation that verifies that when the checkbox is checked the textbox can only accept a value of zero or blank
88361
this is an issue because the clientids of the checkbox and the textbox are unknown to me at runtime as they re part of a repeater
88361
pass the textbox and checkbox to the customvalidator somehow doesn t seem to be possible
88382
i have a pretty good knowledge of programming languages like c c++ java python
88399
i saw this same question for vim and it has been something that i myself wanted to know how to do for emacs
88403
this is an asp.net app developed in c# using webforms
88523
as others have said you can use typeof or instanceof to see if it s actually a function
88570
specifically i m trying to create a group-based http auth for individual directories vhosts on a server in apache 2.0
88605
the only thing i can think to suggest is to take a look at the properties and decorated attributes generated for those classes and associations
88616
when working with motorola devices i tend to stick to the standard emulator or sometimes the sony ericsson emulators as those are the best i have worked with by far
88632
for example even .net developers occasionally use firefox maybe even opera
88632
it must run reasonably in internet explorer 6 firefox 3.0 opera 9+ and safari for windows not everything has to be flawless but it can t look downright ugly either
88683
i typically take the xml document that i m after push it through the xsd tool with the flag to generate a schema xsd and then push the xsd file back through the tool using the flags to get classes that i can import and use in my day to day .net projects
88695
if you are working in the java world - intellij idea has also extensive xml support including xsd generation and samle xml from xsd generation and with plugins you can get xslt debuggers
88716
verify that every mount point has inode 2
88733
one approach i ve used was to apply custom attributes to business object properties which described the validation rules
88736
is there any centralized repository of useful objective-c cocoa libraries as there is for perl ruby python etc
88743
i m using jmockit for unit testing with testng and i m having trouble using the expectations class to mock out a method that takes a primitive type boolean as a parameter using a matcher
88772
if you want to use a continuous form for navigation to records for editing use a subform displaying the detailed data for editing and use the pk value from the subform for the link field
88783
this example will correctly do multiplication before addition
88803
try setting the width and or height of the rootpanel to 100 before adding your widget

great article by dino esposito that is meant to explain asp.net mvc to asp.net webforms developpers
88831
anyone has ever programmed a php or perl function to get the ceiling value excel style
88836
fpdf tcpdf and php s included pdf libraries allow me to create an image and plop it on a pdf but the more advanced layouts and crop marks are a bit beyond me
88838
in java i have a string and i want to encode it as a byte array in utf8 or some other encoding
88851
specifically with the session facade - you use a session ejb to act as the business facade - which is nice cause then you can take advantage of all the j2ee services authentication authorization transactions etc .
88862
i ve had a lot of success with pdflib it s a very powerful library with php and c c# perl etc bindings
88867
we already have a pro c program reading from an oracle database it calls a perl script which in turn executes some java to extract data in xml format from the aforementioned database for calling a batch file to execute some vbscript ftping the file to some other server
88882
but doesn t apple provide all the foundation cocoa appkit coreaudio qtkit etc libraries that should provide all of the very basic functions you are looking for
88893
it primarily goes over http https
88895
as far as i understand your question it seems to me that you do not clearly see the point of libraries like cgal and openmesh
88903
i d do it in either prolog java or haskell though
88904
we re making heavy use of 3rd party controls janus gridex infralution virtualtree and .net magic docking and we do a lot of dynamic loading and rendering of content based on metadata in our database
88908
if you want to enforce the use of a constructor you could set your object s default parameterless constructor to private and leave public only some enforced constructors
88931
when defining or calling functions with enough arguments to span multiple lines i want vim to line them up
88943
well .net has never been able to fully counter the inertia of visual basic 6 i still see a few shops here and there who are just beginning to shift to .net so one has to consider the inertia of asp.net webforms and how it is deployed everywhere at the moment
88963
to elaborate overly long lines of code are harder to read by humans and some people might have console widths that only accommodate 80 characters per line
88985
on the other hand if you don t put any validation in your app you might not have any bad data but you may have users thinking they entered stuff that doesn t get saved
89008
this will print any commits where the diff contains xyz
89059
it is forbidden to bound a temporary object which is a rvalue to a non-const reference
89073
it appears that it s in ubuntu linux in the cutils or cdecl package and it s probably available elsewhere
89136
rand was different on osx than on linux
89167
sharepoint is really two different technologies windows sharepoint services wss and microsoft office sharepoint server moss
89167
moss is probably less popular because its not free and having used it for a year i don t see as much value in it as wss
89215
but jmockit s expectation is not using it for matching value it uses it for some kind of parsing to determine the method call signature type..which in this case the matchers will resulted in boolean type while your method is primitive type..so it fails to mock it properly
89222
it allows creation of document libraries which are collections of files that can be shared for collaborative editing
89223
this is possible because linq queries are actually expressions code as data which linq providers like linq-to-sql can evaluate and generate corresponding sql
89243
the advantage of subprocess vs system is that it is more flexible you can get the stdout stderr the real status code better error handling etc...
89249
here is the table of all the values note that you can add up values to hide multiple drives also the value is binary type but must be entered in hexadecimal so if you add up a few drives get ready for a little hex math
89289
extreme scalability reliability concurrency
89313
short-circuiting boolean expressions are exactly equivalent to some set of nested ifs so are as efficient as that would be
89363
if you have the machinery for a precise copying gc you could allocate on the stack initially and copy to the heap and update pointers if you discover at exit that a pointer to this stack frame has escaped
89386
stack allocation and probably pointers
89418
assume i have an images folder directory under the root of my application
89424
or if the input vectors are small enough but not constant size just use alloca instead of malloc
89454
however if your queries are quite similar but you have huge numbers of permutations in your query conditions like complicated paging sorting filtering etc an object relational mapper tool is probably the way to go although the process of overhauling your existing code to make use of the tool could be quite complicated
89520
the logo temporary is covering the main copy
89573
that might help as it s actually using a variable that you ve declared and therefore can control the scope of plus it ll let you use strict without other nastiness that could be muddying the waters
89578
the second makes a number of functions more expensive but has a huge impact on malloc and free
89578
i make a lot of use of builds that use have symbols zi and link debug and asserts ddebug but are still optimized o1 or o2 or whatever flags you use but with stack frame pointers kept for clear backtraces oy- and using the normal runtime library mt
89612
since you re using ubuntu and not kubuntu i assume you re using gnome
89619
also even if you do supply -o 123 optimizations that prevent stack tracing will still be disabled stripping frame pointers from stack frames
89619
for more info take a look at dwarf the debugging format originally designed to go along with elf the binary format for linux and other os s
89638
in the broken box model the height and width values refer to the size of the box excluding the margins

using help - check for updates i was able to install the oracle mysql browser extension but there are no connection options for mysql databases
89714
group #1 is browsers that use webkit safari for example presto opera for example khtml konqueror for example or gecko firefox for example
89714
ones that are definitely not dead are ie6 starting to push it ie7 ie8 latest opera 9.x latest ff 3.x latest safari 3.x and others that have about the same capabilities
89780
i m using ksh-style subshell here i m not totally sure that it works in bash
89780
that s the nice thing about shell is that you can use perl awk sed grep..
89788
as far as i know proc is specific to linux it s not in unix in general
89850
updates to your database may also be thought of as graph operations updating the quantity in an order line item row propagates the change to the the total in the order row which propagates the change to the totalsales in the customer row and so on
89889
as described in the referenced wikipedia article the needleman-wunsch algorithm requires a similarity matrix which defines the distance between a pair of points

although the csla framework is written in .net the overall approach can be used in any language
90049
this works for opera 9 but not for firefox 2 or internet explorer 7
90095
there s lxml for parsing well-formed html but you should really use beautifulsoup if you re not 100 certain that your input will always be well-formed
90136
the de-autoboxing back the the primitive boolean value is where the npe comes from
90138
use beautifulsoup html5lib or lxml.html
90147
personally i have found that with tdd i write simpler code i spend less time debating if a particular code solution will work or not and that i have no fear to change any line of code that doesn t meet the criteria set forth by the team
90153
the other advantage to learning a bit of groovy and java is that web frameworks like gwt will open up to you
90163
the most sensible data type for that column is an unsigned small integer
90165
there might even be a vim or emacs script that already does something similar
90196
use a profiler e.g yourkit
90197
though we used json rather than xml
90197
instead of the classic database jsp actions scheme for mvc you ll find yourself moving to a servlet javascript scheme whereby the model is represented by http get requests actions are represented by post put delete requests and the view is rendered on the fly by the web browser
90242
the double equals operator is used to compare values such as a pair of ints and returns a boolean
90245
to test them is usually not necessary as the coverage is obtained by testing the logic - try to check some coverage reporting tools like cobertura clover or try emma and see what needs to be tested
90252
for example branch prediction enabled in -o1 and up can break poorly written multi threading programs by causing a race condition
90258
also you probably can emulate shifting register with xor sum elements between separate bits which will give you pseudo-random sequence of numbers
90283
ogre3d and irrlicht are both popular 3d game engines for c++
90308
everything i ve seen so far in python and java omits one or more pretty important pieces or makes too many things hard
90308
add and subtract intervals from timestamps
90313
when i google a lot of terms for this i end up with examples with 50+ lines of code for what i would think should only take one line or so similar to opening an ie window
90352
the guys over at vbdotnetheaven.com have a simple example using the webclient webrequest and httpwebrequest classes
90408
i would suggest using rtf if you can as there really is not a sound solution for doc files yet
90423
do i really need to use udp packets or will tcp suffice
90435
the bash shell actually provides an array which can assist in that case that being pipestatus
90441
if you put this at the top of the shell script it looks like bash will take care of this for you
90441
as a previous poster noted set -e will cause bash to exit with an error on any simple command
90441
set -o pipefail will cause bash to exit with an error on any command in a pipeline as well
90444
the protocol it s important that you decide whether you want tcp or udp
90444
making sure your multiplayer game doesn t have to make 2000 outbound connections and uses a standard port so portforwarding is easy
90458
unfortunately as erlang and haskell prove sometimes the best ideas remain relegated to an extremely fringe demographic
90473
less duplication http already represents operations like delete put get etc
90477
as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort
90482
with tools like wcf in the .net framework it is very trivial to implement a service as rest or soap
90518
there s also a reference tcf implementation for linux which you may or may not have any luck recompiling for aix but it allows for remote debugging if gdbserver is otherwise not available
90539
most other database servers like mysql and postgresql have similar interfaces for connection and manipulation
90558
abraham s posts here and here this guide on installing the .net framework 1.1 on vista if you have to support some legacy application s that require it and this post which documents running asp.net 1.1 and 2.0 side by side which describes the application pool issues you will encounter if attempting to mix the framework version of applications
90575
in my experience yourkit profiler is very good
90586
as long as i click on any clickable control textbox button or i press the tab key on the keyboard to change the cursor s location the dialog just closes no solution is created and the status bar will display creating project c mywebapp .
90592
licensing a commercial library like fmod or miles is an option in a sense that all this platform dependent work is already done for you
90596
you ll just need to set the height and width on the cell and that should be it
90597
many of the common controls used in asp.net gridview and treeview for example can be processed through an adapter to change the resulting html that is outputted to the browser
90608
i would set the images as the cells background via css set the cells size to the proper fixed value again via css and then insert the text label as the cell content
90616
plugins for eclipse maven ant and idea are available
90648
then you should provide a constructor with a parameter the oid of the object you want to edit
90648
inside the constructor you should use the criteria to make the xpcollection contain only that object
90655
in java the primitive types int float double char and long are not object s like in c#
90658
no commits to a central repository should be required -- assume that there is a ci engine which tries to build as soon as anything is checked in
90670
rhino mocks typemock and moq are all good options for doing this
90686
set up build configurations for each of your deployment testing environment and use separate config files based on each build configuration
90720
if you want to capture mouse keyboard events outside of your application you will need low-level hooks
90733
have it build on osx linux ubuntu linux debian linux redhat vista windows xp etc and have emails sent or whatever you prefer when a build fails
90744
and also vim has all the scripting support you need either using it s native scripting language or using python ruby ...
90759
also you have to login with a domain account on that computer otherwise that authentication box will be shown
90775
i have an exe file generated with py2exe
90795
if you need to return such data with a select you could use a temporary table in which to copy the original data and then update that table
90798
the buffer data i receive from the camera does not contain any exif information apart from the width height and pixels per inch
90803
in this case i have a sqlxml column in a ms sql 2005 server that i am trying to pull out and push into a function that requires an xmlnode as a parameter
90805
wordpress - i keep trying other blogs and i keep going back to wordpress
90843
the advantage of the devicepassword is that each device effectively has a unique secret and if i didn t know that it would make it harder to determine the secret by packet sniffing the submitted scores
90852
if you use a prefix tree you ensure that to find any word is going to o n where n is the maximum length of a word in your data set
90886
once you can get this value and set the element s height you need to attach event handlers to both the window onload and onresize so that you can fire your resize function
90888
as vba states visual basic for application it is living inside an application word excel scala whatever
90889
however how does the caching work when calling it from a wcf channel factory or .net web request objects
90890
treetagger binary only linux solaris os-x
90907
is there a way to do this simply using classical tools such as junit or preferrably testng
90934
like previously said ogre3d and irrlicht are probably your best options in regards to free
90939
the first line just gets libraries that help with parts of the problem as in the second line where urllib2 downloads a copy of ambrose bierce s devil s dictionary the next lines make a list of all the words in the text without punctuation
90939
then you create a hash table which in this case is like a list of unique words associated with a number
90964
if you want c++ and your just starting out i d go with irrlicht its free and its code although not blazing fast like ogre its very well structured and a good example of what a c++ should look like
90993
it s even better to put the mock creation methods in a base servlet superclass and make all servlets unit tests to extend it
91109
there are a large number of add-ons for junit testng available including
91122
-standard project directory structure eg maven standard dir layout etc
91122
-project management and issue tracking eg trac redmine etc
91123
this means that in order to throw any non-runtime exception you also need to add a throws annotation to your method declaration
91123
a lot of exceptions you take for granted such as nullpointerexception or illegalargumentexception in fact derive from runtimeexception and you therefore don t need to declare them
91123
whereas in c# you can interchangeably use int as both a value type and reference type in java they re literally not the same type you get the primitive value type int and the library reference type java.lang.integer
91154
subversion cvs git
91165
as you already plan to use wiki like trac or redmine you could use it for km as well
91181
i use cruise control for my continuous integration scheme i want to use obfuscation in order to add another protection layer to my assemblies
91229
looks like dbi or a dbd not sure where bind parameters are used isn t honoring tie magic
91259
nunit mbunit ms test etc
91265
i ve never used it but is seems to support multiple backends other than xml - json
91271
you can see the differences here mysql-real-escape-string and addslashes
91278
warning there was some case-specific code in the original version it actually turned the xml into csv that i just stripped and i didn t test this version
91304
i would like to use 3des or aes for some added security
91317
webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest
91326
webrequest and more specifically the httpwebrequest class is a good starting point for what you want to achieve
91326
you will then create your post data and send it to the stream like
91436
the only alternative i know is using c++.net to wrap your c++ classes and writing unit tests with one of .net unit testing frameworks nunit mbunit etc.
91446

use bitblt to let gdi perform the color conversion
91511
besides even if i find out i won t be using the accelerated features of gdi that bitblt has access to

the following code shows how to get at the pixels inside of a bitmap change them and put them back into the bitmap
91616
i m looking for one that minimally covers windows osx and linux with a c or c++ interface
91618
but in dynamic languages like php and python you just take
91618
ruby and python don t have them

a more low-level appproach is redland which provides bindings to a lot of languages like perl php python and ruby
91721
it works in widescreen maximize browser window and is ok in ie7 firefox chrome and safari in maximize and reduced window size
91731
how do you update a summary field s value from post function in jira
91732
i think the easiest thing to do is to include some kind of javascript library on the html page say jquery and use it s functions for determining the position and size of dom nodes
91740
clustered indexes work great for ranges select from my_table where my_key between min and max
91741
the easiest one to cook up a prototype in a scripting language then convert to a compiled one might be any toolkit with a scripting language binding pygtk wxpython etc.
91794
i d select distinct the rows and throw them into a temporary table then drop the source table and copy back the data from the temp
91795
otherwise you can find it using this for linux and unix
91801
xmltk doesn t seem to have package in debian ubuntu fedora or macports hasn t had a release since 2007 and uses non-portable build automation
91835
cxxtest is also worth a look for lightweight easy to use cross platform junit cppunit xunit-like framework for c++
91888
specifically it can be used for variable names that clash with reserved keywords you can t use params but you can use params instead same with out ref any other keyword in the language specification

as a bonus your application will run on windows 32 64 bit linux mac os x freebsd solaris etc.
91955
decide on what operations you want to do on xml files and create a script in python perl perhaps that exposes that functionality through arguments for shell scripts to use
91965
the -z means output with zeros 0 after the filenames so spaces are not used as delimeters
91998
the urlstreamhandler can then delegate to the default http https handler modifying the openconnection call
92003
in c c++ any variable is susceptible to this problem of var constant when you intended var constant

itextsharp is a pretty easy pdf tool to use with .net it s a port of the itext java project
92085
mock objects presuppose the existence of the object whereas a constructor presuppose that the object doesn t exist

to change the active row for the datagrid you need to set the current cell property of the datagrid to a non-hidden non-disabled non-header cell on the row that you have selected
92126
in order to remove duplicates the result set must be sorted and this may have an impact on the performance of the union depending on the volume of data being sorted and the settings of various rdbms parameters for oracle pga_aggregate_target with or sort_area_size and sor_area_retained_size if
92135
now if you use primitive types instead like int or float and pass them as method parameters changes in object c cannot be seen by object a because object a merely passed a copy instead of a reference of its own copy of the variable
92182
i use scp ssh and authentication keys to allow my scripts to get data from all servers without any login prompts
92202
to summarize contains will find any pattern in the string but startswith and endswith will help you find matches at the beginning and end of the word
92208
the only difference in c is that it s common to add and subtract from pointers - and if you get the logic wrong you can end up messing with data you shouldn t be touching
92246
if you feel up to it you could also create a tool that compares said element to the revision history of the document and shouts at you if you haven t updated it
92247
metaphone and double metaphone are similar to soundex except they may be tuned more toward your goal than soundex

i d suggest writing a non-trivial webapp using either django or pylons something that does some number crunching
92322
note that for transport the encoding doesn t matter much if you can zip gzip bz2 the data
92324
c++ is more standard you will find more code libraries examples etc. and you may freely use the stl and boost while object pascal is more of an exotic language
92345
i would use a generic proxy that is responsible for consuming the webmethod and transforming the dataset into xml json
92359
just compare let s say average php or visual basic programs and solutions in smalltalk common lisp haskell and the like
92373
the fcgid documentations page drops hints that php and ruby are supported -- php directly and ruby through dispatch.fcgi -- and python is not supported
92413
i can get authentication to work if the group i put in is a global but not if the group is universal
92420
but even dynamic languages like ruby python perl etc
92425
i ended up working around the original problem by bringing up the search dialog with ctrl + h then clicking the customize button on the dialog which brings up a search page selection dialog which allows you to hide or show tabs on the search dialog
92551
add and subtract intervals from timestamps
92556
i ve been a unix-based web programmer for years perl and php
92556
i could do this is perl tcl tk but i want something more native for a variety of reasons
92585
but bear in mind that this will replace any existing styles that are set on the style attribute
92588
a second option is to use the webclient class this provides an easier to use interface for downloading web resources but is not as flexible as httpwebrequest
92633
when you only need to update simple variables 32 or 64 bit int or pointers perform simply addition or subtraction operations on them or just swap the values of two variables most platforms offer atomic operations for that further gcc offers these as well
92635
i can t speak to mono s osx support but it is used for some pretty big projects in linux such as banshee and f-spot
92642
and python ruby perl is where the puck is going to be
92750
so right now we use unittest++ for unmanaged c++ and i m currently deciding between mstest and nunit for the managed libraries
92754
is that possible to switch an open source project license from gpl to lgpl v3
92765
however you can get the listviewitem that is currently selected and use the visualtreehelper class to get the textbox from the listviewitem
92774
you can use performance monitor to track hardware and os factors - like cpu usage memory
92778
this method only loops on search results until it loops on the first search result if any and puts a bookmark on the found lines and optionally set an indicator on the found items
92798
a bank account can t exist without a legal entity to own it but that s just a detail here - other failures are that amazon might pull sc2 or raise the price or make an incompatible api change or be bribed by your rival or ordered by a court to remove your app

i guess this is a big ask for the general case so to narrow things down a bit i m most interested in gnu emacs 22 on windows and debian linux
92980
it contains concrete advices of do-s and dont-s for clean and pretty code with java python examples
92992
structs are particularly useful in file serialization deserialization as the structure can often be written to the file verbatim
92998
in groovy you can easily mock java interfaces using the as operator
93034
that is to say i think that determining the amount of stack space used depends on the branches taken which in turn depends on input parameters and in general requires solving the halting problem
93044
when the signal is called i get the button widget and eventargs as a parameter
93044
i need to determine the page number based on the button widget but mynotebook.pagenum buttonwidget always returns -1
93080
accorting to kjetil klaussen this is caused by the visual studio testrunner running mstest tests in testdriven.net makes mstest performance comparable to nunit
93126
for now you can use posix or create your own platform independent wrappers around compare and swap and or interlocked increment decrement
93134
you would have a lot of options at this point for communication but .net remoting or wcf would probably be good and easy choices
93150
i don t want to specify the join order and details manually-- there are too many queries affected by this for it to be worthwhile
93150
is there a way that i can hint that a join will have a lot of rows without specifying the entire join order manually
93156
bash uses uid while tcsh uses uid and in case matters
93156
i ve also found that tcsh sets gid but i wasn t able to find a matching variable in bash
93224
in my case i have spring s messagesource integrated with jsf using messagesourcepropertyresolver
93233
subclass of the hierarchal superclass
93236
upx can encrypt compress mac osx executable
93252
if they really need that much protection they probably should be using a more stable solution for data access than a website a secure ssh tunnel to their server is bulletproof you can tell them they can have their 256-bit aes and 4096-bit rsa too or a vpn depending upon implementation
93313
the application is a client of ibm websphere mq
93334
a pci nvidia geforce 5200 or ati radeon 7000 is still pretty easy to find
93341
the access value just tells it how to access the field and field.camelcase just tells it the naming strategy
93361
we re testing our clickonce deployed application internally on iis internet information services but we re wondering if we can deploy it to the wider internet using apache on linux so we can make use of our existing external website host
93363
safari internet explorer and firefox all have different max lengths that it accepts
93415
when maximizing an emacs frame the frame expands to fill the width of both monitors and the height of the larger monitor
93461
if two threads call this method at the same time for an event type that previously had no listeners map.get eventtype will return null in both threads each thread will create its own copyonwritearraylist each containing a single listener one thread will replace the list created by the other and the first listener will be forgotten
93489
the best you can do is compare the 2 query outputs based on a given set of inputs looking for any differences
93492
you just need to set up which bits of your news feed to scour and voila instant rss without having to touch any code.
93499
the back end can communicate with the javascript using either simple csv json xml web service etc
93518
the biggest advantage to doing this is that any browser which could display a png or gif would be able to display your frame
93550
this operation is relevant in programming language theory because it allows the implementation of recursion in the form of a rewrite rule without explicit support from the language s runtime engine
93579
a materialized view is a table on disk that contains the result set of a query
93581
while there are a few good commercial applications for black box testing of applications holodeck cenzic hailstorm the only open source applications that i know about only test network security spike owasp webscarab and nikto
93589
spawn a java.util.timertask where you will check if you have finished the process otherwise close the bufferedreader and the outputstream of the urlconnection
93590
q are the bytes read from disk when i create the filestream object or when the object consuming the stream in this case an md5 hash algorithm actually reads it
93598
instructions such as addition and multiplication are non-jumping
93673
for example you could tokenize your document into a list of words by stripping out punctuation capitalization and stemming words running runs both - run to increase semantic matches
93673
then just build a hash map such as hash_map in c++ a dictionary in python etc of each adjacent pair of words to its number of occurrences so far
93685
you have to know what the encoding of the file is and then decode the bytebuffer into a charbuffer using that encoding
93692
note just to make it clear i m not interested in dom scripting or writing javascript in a browser
93696
as i said above the key bit of knowledge is that the cert doesn t matter so long as it s generated with an algorithm that supports aes 256-bit encryption rsa
93711
a server is a runtime environment a process of execution
93714
in linux and unix systems
93771
i have a program that creates a windows user account using the netuseradd api which is suggested by microsoft
93773
i was looking at datamapper which appeared at first glance to use the activerecord orm pattern
93791
i ve been using it for over a year now and i ve very much enjoyed working with it however i notice that throughout stack overflow it doesn t seem to rate a mention when symfony or cakephp are being talked about as potential candidates for a framework
93797
for example vc could easily implement different alignment requirements for an arm processor than it does for x86 processors
93799
before i set the value the listbox s selected value might be hello and the alert box which pops up after i ve assigned this value to text is also hello
93825
use the username as a reg_dword and a value of 1 to show the user and 0 to hide
93846
how can i allow others to create java .net ruby php perl web user interface components that interact with each other
93846
for example one web ui component written in .net selects a customer and the other web user interface components are written in java ruby or php are able to refresh showing information about the selected customer from different systems
93896
the s behaves differently on scanf and printf
93937
i recommend rails authorization which will work with restful authentication quite nicely
93944
do you use separate files ant maven resource filtering or other approaches
93945
actually your problem is even worse your string contains byte sequences that do not represent characters in any character encoding
93947
you will need to generate a war file or the folder of files that would comprise the war file a project would typically include an ant or maven build script to do this or if the project used eclipse s dynamic web project type there might be a generate war option somewhere
93967
note that this is sql-server specific and the question owner has since made it clear that he s using oracle
93975
it runs on linux windows bsd and other platforms and you can write a python script if you want to use it with python
94025
most python gui apis will be wrappers around the most common c c++ gui apis
94042
i unfortunately haven t been sniffing network traffic when this has happened to me or i would ve checked if the asp.net session cookie has stuck around or not
94053
if you re not using it how are you managing environment specific configuration settings that may change for each environment
94070
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord
94086
the important thing about this type of vulnerability is that the attacker is able to encode his xss payload using utf-7 and if you haven t specified a different character encoding on your page a user s browser could interpret the utf-7 payload and execute the attack script
94113
https ssl tls options for wget
94119
it is a bit more advanced than the code samples in fowler s article especially when you use the unitils library to wrap easymock so the syntax will be much simpler than that in the article
94148
i ve tried to avoid the new event call since there can be a huge number of events and the event objects are generally short lived and having the callback methods per type with primitive property arguments
94148
i am not sure i like this and its really similar to the callbacks per type approach just code is inside an execute function in the type subclasses versus the callback methods per type
94161
i m working on a project that will be distributed with gnu autoconf automake and i have a set of bash scripts which call awk scripts
94167
then any configuration element that is environment-specific gets the environment appended like so
94172
i m not sure if there s a way to compute the max height width of a frame in the current windowing environment
94184
my biggest increase in typing when coding was to really learn my ide s keyboard shortcuts since that eliminated the relatively slow process of using the mouse
94195
easymock or jmock are definitely the winners
94195
i haven t used jmock but i know with easymock you can setup the mock object according to a testing script and it will return certain values in certain situations or points during your test
94202
i recommend just passing in cmanager as a parameter in your gui object constructor but don t maintain a reference to it java code here but you get the idea
94211
the firewalls mapped external facing addresses to the web servers so by swapping host files on your pc the same url could be used - would go to either staging or production depending on which hosts file you had swapped in
94216
if your problem happens in internet explorer but it renders the way you d expect in firefox or safari this link was extraordinarily helpful for me with a similar problem
94224
some of the key reasons to use oo are to structure code in a similar way to how we humans like to perceive and relate to things and exploit the benefits of economy maintainability reliability and scalability
94224
just has the added condition where the height is the same as the width
94274
minimized undo the minimize and bring the running instance to the front
94280
you can specify your environment either by using a user.name variable or by specifying the profile in a -d argument for ant or maven
94280
both ant and maven support these capabilities
94286
anyway my criteria were 9 on ease of use 10 on maturity of documentation widgets 10 on installed base 5 on gui code generators 10 on native look and feel for both windows linux and 1 and 5 for the last two i m not big into mac osx even with a 10 here it suggests wxpython
94351
the command svn up -r 4 only updates your local copy to revision 4
94419
a method in a subclass that used to override the superclass method will no longer do so due the changed method signature
94511
if you used a default constructor and exposed the two custom members with getter setter properties you could get away with just setting the attribute
94572
the live cd will make things a bit quicker by having a few precompiled binaries available but besides that you still have to choose what you want to install
94610
i can t put the try catch in my callback functions because the exception occurs before they would get called
94625
exception is already serializable but you need to override the getobjectdata method to store your variables and provide a constructor which can be called when re-hydrating your object
94644
depending on your database you might have the option of either using a sequenser oracle or a autoincrement mysql ms sql etc
94685
this question is a follow up on one of my other questions can i legally incorporating gpl lgpl open-sourced software in a proprietary closed-source project
94705
in fact even when you are talking about fetching or sending data asynchronously the term ajax isn t entirely correct - it was originally coined to mean asynchronous javascript and xml but most modern implementations use json in place of xml
94705
the dom is actually rather complicated in comparison to the javascript language and is likely to be the place where you have the most trouble not least because the dom provided by different browsers tends to be subtly different
94705
notice i haven t mentioned ajax or any frameworks yet - you will find it much easier if you have a basic grounding in javascript and the dom before you start looking at a framework
94706
and be sure to test this using a wide variety of email clients eg thunderbird outlook outlook express gmail yahoo msn hotmail .
94716
returns a jquery object that contains all the selected elements
94724
midp 2.1 cldc 1.1 and jsr-75 fileconnection are available
94728
either can be integrated into your build environment if you re using msbuild or nant
94772
we use awk and perl scripts to parse the log files and create summary reports and databases technically databases in that each row corresponds to a unique event with many columns of data about that event but not stored in a traditional database format
94792
please don t say use emacs as i ve already ramped up on vim and i m really enjoying it as an editor
94824
some properties are read statically at class loading time and others might cache the value in some object field
94838
just a note iteration over all elements in a map is o n so it would be guaranteed o n not worse to look up the way you are thinking of doing it
94850
so make the sub folder a virtual directory on your site and then in the properties of the virtual directory choose the option for a redirection to a url .
94862
you can give emacs with vim emulation a try is not perfect but it may be somewhat familiar
94869
first the documentation flat out lies where it reads in any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings splitlast or splitfirst to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table or the first row of a continuation. in the current release the splitlast and splitfirst row indices break with the aforementioned typeerrors on the textcolor and background commnds
94876
just take any decent calculator and type in 7fffffff in hex mode then switch to decimal
94894
local bookmarks - i store bookmarks on the browser toolbar in folders so i can middle-click and open all in tabs
94896
i check the error property of the event args in the service method completed event handler
94901
firefox 3 and opera 9.5 do
94974
but it tries as best it can to put a firebug console in ie safari and opera
94975
i ve read in one of my ai books that popular algorithms a-star dijkstra for path-finding in simulation or games is also used to solve the well-known 15-puzzle
95001
since an int uses 31 bits + 1 bit for the sign just double 2 30 to get approximately 2 billion
95001
for an unsigned int using 32 bits double again for 4 billion
95033
my understanding is that this simple jquery plugin just show and hide content
95033
i had the exact same problem with the jquery thickbox plugin that the item marked as hidden the dialog box will always show up in my mvc view page
95033
i can understand some of the mvc+jquery+json articles but i don t understand why the hide show doesn t work
95046
under the hood joomla runs on mostly an oo architecture whereas drupal is almost entirely procedural with oo paradigms
95046
joomla has no form builder that i am aware of so you are forced to hand-code entire blocks of html for the form whereas with drupal you create forms as structured arrays
95046
in general joomla s admin gui is considered prettier and more user-friendly than drupal s but joomla is in my opinion a less intuitive system at the programming level and makes certain tasks more difficult than necessary
95046
2 areas where drupal truly outshines joomla in my opinion is in the ability to create various content types - with various fields - on the fly to easily segment data and the ability to create pretty seo-friendly urls with path or even better with pathauto
95046
bottom line joomla tends to look pretty from an administration perspective but drupal tends to outperform joomla and be a more easily customizable system to achieve many of the things you really want out of a cms
95083
pspsdk uses newlib which lacks some of glibc s features and headers
95106
it would be great if i could just hit a for example and instantly get put into insert mode at the end beginning of the argument list
95114
groovy is extremely useful for quick reference within a java context.
95200
remember that asp.net mvc is built on top of a solid asp.net .net foundation which is already well proven and you can mix the technologies if you choose
95208
when you declare a field transient it will be ignored during the serialization and deserialization process
95208
keep in mind that when you deserialize an object with a transient field that field s value will always be it s default usually null.
95210
udp and tcp ip
95224
you will need to implement writeobject and readobject and do manual serialization deserialization of those fields
95242
you can start by looking into the transient keyword which marks fields as not part of the persistent state of an object
95273
xstream is a great library for doing fast java to xml serialization for any object no matter if it is serializable or not
95286
i have the following configuration but i have not able to find any documentation on how to set a maximum backup files on date rolling style
95297
others such as python and ruby make you download third-party modules to do strong encryption
95317
you ll have to put up with remembering to get it right
95339
this file also contains a startup target which sets up some runtime settings like assembly version information and any dependent paths
95373
also python and perl are older than java and c# from the days when it was illegal to export cryptographic software from the us
95442
i m used to using fiddler to sniff transactions between http clients and servers and it works great as long as you re using plain text or xml http requests and responses including those over ssl but it isn t much help for binary protocols like amf over http
95443
the problem is that i need to modify the path to an absolute path to the view page because the relative path doesn t work with the mvc routes controller action id
95522
you could make an annotation enforceauthor with inherited on the superclass and use compiler annotations since java 1.6 to catch up at compile time
95724
i am a .net developer that has been tasked with upgrading a classic asp website to asp.net
95743
within the java language the only way to create an object is by calling its constructor be it explicitly or implicitly
95800
what would be the easiest way to access a file or maybe create a remote project trough ftp and maybe ssh and sftp
95821
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.
95858
but is there a better way to get the id of the element and set the src or data parameter for the object embed and have it instantly load up a new document
95944
i believe you re talking about ftp with ssl when you say sftp and not the sftp protocol that goes along with ssh
95944
use sftp the ssh version as it doesn t require an encrypted control channel and will work fine over nat
95955
i think the best you can do is set a threshold for visiting a page. have an automated task run every 60 120 300 or some number of seconds that clears out any entry that is older than a specified amount of time
95956
if i use them to iterate through the folder c windows system32 drivers they only find a handful of files although there are 185 when i issue a dir command in a command prompt
95961
as far as free sources are concerned as a .net programmer i like www.asp.net and there are many others such as the asp.net quickstart tutorials at c-sharpcorner is good too if you don t mind c#
95978
yah i meant ssl ftp not sftp
96012
are you sure it is looking in the same directory as the dir command
96028
.net has out and ref parameters
96028
there are other language differences but most of them are not expressed at the byte code level for example if memory serves java s non- static inner classes which do not exist in .net are not a bytecode feature the compiler generates an additional argument to the inner class s constructor and passes the outer object
96041
some ui frameworks are layers over swing or swt for example a framework could read a description of a screen in xml and instantiate the corresponding swing components
96042
i m working on the creation of an activex exe using vb6 and the only example i got is all written in delphi
96048
this is possible because since it s an identity it will just increment as you add items which will be in the order that you are selecting them
96133
i have uncovered another problem in the effort that we are making to port several hundreds of ksh scripts from aix solaris and hpux to linux
96150
i believe that there is some kind of permissions issue but can t seem to find any difference between the permissions on the noted folders and the folder directory where the excel file is uploaded
96163
it is possible for iptables i guess your suse has iptables firewall to be setup to let trough only ping icmp packets
96164
i m attempting to convert a home-grown login system to the standard asp.net login control included in .net
96213
moving to a content manager like drupal joomla wordpress or the like will be much easier if you re already organized with semantic markup too
96245
parsererror - when an xml json response is
96313
i ve got a couple large checkouts where the .svn folder has become damaged so i m getting and error cleanup failed to process the following path.. and i can no longer commit or update files in that directory
96316
for example when wrapping c++ code to be used with other interfaces .net com python etc... i need to catch different types of exceptions
96372
if you know which folder has the damaged .svn directory you can just delete that one directory and run an svn update again
96372
of course if the folder with the damaged .svn directory is the one containing a gigabyte then you re back where you started
96429
setting up password-less publickey authentication with ssh would allow you to scp your files to any of your servers very quickly or be automated by a shell script
96432
however you will have to add back the namespace in order for it to work
96486
ie firefox opera safari compatible
96490
this is what var is for
96490
any comparison to jscript vbscript or dynamic typing is total bunk
96528
raphael is pretty cool for that and works across browsers since it uses vml for msie and svg for everything else
96531
i think grails and groovy hold promise but the user experience of working with them is cumbersome at present present being last spring
96569
we use vmware esx 3.5.x exclusively
96574
however native vml can do text on a path and such things much like svg
96574
i think theoretically if you want complex text handling you d want svg and vml like the raphael library that dan mentioned
96576
if you re running on redhat or debian consider packaging up your code into rpm s or debs
96595
if you are really and truly stuck understanding pointers in c then your best option might be to obtain a copy a a pascal compiler and try writing some basic pointer code in it pascal is near enough to c you ll get the basics in a few hours
96605
you can also try c-x c-l which will repeat the last line from insert mode and brings you a completion window with all of the lines
96628
i m assuming you mean by turned off that a field doesn t have a value
96630
the resize effectively calls the default constructor of the object inside the vector but if the default constructor does nothing then nothing is initialized.
96641
so the basic technique is to update the top and left values as the user drags use these together with the defined width and height of the view onto the image to create the appropriate rect string and update the top left and clip properties of the img element s style property
96665
but if the copy constructor is user supplied then i don t see how the compiler can optimize out the temporary variable
96689
from a practical perspective i generally consider any select that ends up taking more than 10 lines to write putting each clause condition on a separate line to be too long to easily maintain
96690
but despise those limitations the generation itself is quite easy with oaw you can navigate your models like a charm in xtend and xpand and by combining several workflows into bigger workflows you can also do very complex things
96835
then move on to the other standards-based browsers namely safari and opera
96837
the yes button is a hyperlink because it executes javascript to hide the dialog and show a different one
96837
i do not have an onclick event registered with the linkbutton because i simply check if ispostback is true
96850
we work with several separate idl files hand-build for different parts of our framework making use of the #include construct to include them into the idl of the actual application then generate the single tlb using midl and tlibimp it

in addition you can use existing python libraries in a java application
96952
field with value 00345abc would need to return 345abc
96982
runs on centos although debian fedora core freebsd are options if necessary
97025
you can put the original dmg dmg template even under version control svn so if you ever accidentally change destroy it you can just go back to a revision where it was still okay
97069
thus it is sometimes easier to write the code in python and integrate it via jython that to attempt to write the code in java
97114
however we ve now added a dynamic dispatch call where static would suffice the object is larger even in the production version and we ve added a new failure path for foo s constructor allocation can fail
97142
others on debian or ubuntu seem to be able to get rid of this by installing libopenssl-ruby which is not available for redhat
97187
when a login shell exits bash reads
97187
a login shell is started bash reads
97197
select n+1 is generally stated as a problem in object-relational mapping orm discussions and i understand that it has something do to with having to make a lot of database queries for something that seems simple in the object world
97224
when using bash the first of .bash_profile .bash_login and .profile will be run for an interactive login shell
97224
bash will run .bashrc for a non-login interactive shell

97276
if i ve got a time_t value from gettimeofday or compatible in a unix environment linux bsd is there a compact algorithm available that would be able to tell me the corresponding week number within the month
97276
however if we re counting the number of mondays that have occurred so far then we want to count the number of integral weeks including today then consider if the fractional week left over also contains any mondays
97299
somehow and i m not familiar with the specifics of how .bat files exit but either jsmin or the batch file execution is exiting with a non-zero return code
97359
if i had to parse some file i d choose python over java in a blink
97414
i know you asked for windows but thought i d add this anyway in unix linux you could do
97445
a deployment project from visual studio allows you to install a sql server express instance with ease
97447
in addition it can add an extra copy of the returned array depending on whether the compiler could optimize this or not that might have a negative impact on performance
97466
if working with java jython is an option for this groovy is another
97510
for querying the db directly such as at a sqlplus prompt or through a db administration tool select is generally fine--it saves you the trouble of writing out all the columns
97513
i would like to use komodo as my python editor but i haven t found a replacement for pywin s ability to restart the shell and reload the current module
97515
this selected all the text on entry but allowed me to highlight part of the text afterwards or allow you to highlight on the first click
97528
i do not have access to iis 6.0 so i cannot map requests to asp.net and handle with a httphandler httpmodule
97536
std vector must initialize the values in the array somehow which means some constructor or copy-constructor must be called
97540
jython allows you to use the java robustness and when needed the python clarity
97623
represents whatever parameters you need to create the end iterator which might use a private constructor
97708
as i didn t want to install python just to run this script i ported it to php

wxwidgets has all the mfc has in early wx versions a lot of classes were clones of mfc classes and a lot more
97762
what is the best way to find the containing rectangle for a mouse click
97778
the good deployment issue -- for python -- doesn t have the deep significance that it has for java
97788
you could create replacements for ushort uint32 by making a pixel class with 32-bit and 16-bit sub-classes overriding various operators up the wazoo but this incurs a lot of overhead is tricky to get right and even trickier to determine if its right
97788
the downside there is that you would likely end up with a lot of special case code in the imagedata class which executed one way or the other depending on some 16-bit 32-bit mode flag
97788
the better solution i think would be to sub-class imagedata into 16-bit and 32-bit classes and use a factory method to create instances
97830
i m working on a project using windows 2008 .net 3.5 and wcf for some internal services and the question of how to host the services has arisen
97842
when asp.net ajax 1.0 was released for .net 2.0 there was a lot of custom web.config settings which added handlers controls etc

i have a 2gb drive to put this on but i can get a bigger one if necessary
97885
the best answer for you is some sort of dvcs popular ones being git mercurial darcs bazaar ...
97885
i haven t used these systems personally so others will be best at recommending a dvcs with a small footprint and good cross platform compatibility
97890
show some kind of message right next to the field and update it as he types
97917
was a macro expansion but that s a problem w macros not curly braces w ifs.
97918
also if i find i do want to avoid braces and inline an if clause code i may single line them just so it is obvious to anyone adding new lines to the if that brackets do need to be added
97922
once you set this up you can use git pull to fetch the changes only you don t need to clone anymore just the first time and git push to push the changes the other way
97937
convert your system.drawing.color to an hslcolor add subtract values against the luminosity and convert back to system.drawing.color for use in your app
97944
if you are then you want to create a savepoint and at the end you can just pass through the end of the function believing a commit or rollback will happen later or else rollback to your savepoint
97979
jgroups treecache from jboss support this so does ehcache i think and i know it definitely works if you use ehcache with terracotta which is a very slick integration
97983
i would like to put another server that would listen to an https port accessible from outside and forward the requests to that http server and send back the responses via https
97994
an editor like emacs or vim can really focus on being a good editor first and foremost
98016
unless someone gains access to your server via ftp or ssh in which case you re already buggered i wouldn t worry about storing passwords in plaintext in php files
98030
i prefer if statements over case statements because they are more readable and more flexible -- you can add other conditions not based on numeric equality like || max min
98032
you can consult their source code to see how this is accomplished on linux solaris windows and mac platforms
98044
would it be using a websphere adaptor for sap or webmethods or something else
98048
obfuscate the password even rot13 will do it won t put up much defense if some does get access to the file but at least it will prevent casual viewing of it
98058
has_header is set to true if the first row contains header values that you don t want sorted
98116
you can also port the python implementation to java -- i doubt it s very complex
98127
on every browser firefox opera camino safari etc... except for internet explorer i can access my own cookie
98162
there are potential compatibility issues now that getyear has been deprecated in favour of getfullyear - from quirksmode
98225
addendum the main reason i don t just use vim is that i love how emacs lets you open a file in two different frames added sorry this was confusing i mean separate windows which emacs calls frames
98230
jquery prototype ext js dojo mootools yui mochikit the list goes on
98234
sadly this was written for unix linux users
98234
personally i would install cygwin just to get linux binaries of lftp rsync to work on windows as there appears not to be anything that competes with it
98237
javascript prototype can be used to extend existing objects much like c# extension methods
98246
this will let you mount the remote ftp directory locally and you can use dir s or any other application you want on it
98267
the order of evaluation for arguments to a function is undefined
98270
it is in c++ not c but you should be able to easily extract the bmp and gif load code
98288
a good place to start is with wikipedia s comparison of javascript frameworks which covers dojo ext js jquery midori mochikit mootools prototype script.aculo.us qooxdoo yui and sweetdev ria
98366
for example last i looked hibernate has issues with an entity having multiple one-to-many eager relationships
98409
if you don t have moss but wss mr
98430
so if the team want to choose erlang or haskell then management has the responsibility to the company to say no
98430
sorry to pick on erlang and haskell devs but there aren t that many of you about
98445
yaml used in ruby on rails for database configuration and has gained in popularity in other languages python java perl and others
98476
i ve made sure to build it using the correct cldc and midp versions
98477
supported kernel execution environment for tasks and did not support
98477
processes which is the traditional application execution environment
98500
the chuck api reference uses the c int type so the maximum value would depend on your local machine 2 31-1 around two billion on standard 32-bit x86
98501
this contains any build settings scripts and tools that this specific developer chooses to store in the source control system they can do whatever they want here
98536
select is o n sort is o nlogn group by is o n having is o n -- worse case
98544
generally this is a good thing because it means that any errors in the configuration or in the surrounding environment will be discovered immediately as opposed to possibly hours or even days down the line
98547
it s great for allowing you to keep your hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse
98562
yes for unix platforms curses or ncurses these days is the way to go
98586
our current best is derived from the best of perl + tcl s atof implementation and outperforms msvcrt.dll s atof by an order of magnitude
98586
the bcd related x86 instructions seemed promising but i couldn t get it to outperform the perl tcl c code
98606
i m always up for leaving my hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse
98644
that is to say you have to track the correct start revision somehow unless you have svn 1.5 merge history
98653
i ve been quite used to working on small projects which i coded with 1 000 lines or less pong tetris simple 3d games etc
98707
for jumping just pick a significant negative vertical velocity apply that to the character at the instant they jump and decrement it by your per-frame gravity increment
98751
i would never want to program in scheme or lisp again if i didn t have to but i am glad that i at least did a little in them just to learn the different way to program
98843
this is the spreadsheet conundrum do you write repository.store entity or entity.storein repository
98861
in my intro course we are taught java and i see lots of my friends struggling with public static void main even though that s not the point of the program and how the profs have no choice but to handwave it until they re more advanced
98869
for example if you need to put some chars in a 2gb file you can use split -b bytecount put the ouptut in to a file append the new text to it and get the rest of the content and add to it
98915
it is based on the mozilla engine so scripts are written with javascript and you have complete access to the dom on the server-side
98915
it also can be used to process documents that are generated in another language php ruby which i imagine is not practical except to help in transitioning existing applications to use jaxer
98915
technology php pearl ruby etc.
98918
as mentioned above some of the fundamental object oriented design principles are ocp lsp dip and isp
98934
for standard notation convert the aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd netmask into an unsigned 4 byte integer many networking libraries have this function and subtract that from 2 32 - 2
98952
i haven t used this code for a put so i m not exactly sure if it s right for you but it might get you close
98962
you can make a macro span several lines by ending each line of the macro with a backslash but this doesn t output newlines
98991
ctrl + for matching braces and parentheses
99007
if your 3rd party does some javascript that attempts to modify their dom a bit too early.
99056
asp.net webforms + asp.net ajax
99056
are there any limitations that asp.net webforms asp.net ajax has vis-a-vis mvc
99060
akin to not providing any client ui to set the price on an item being placed in a shopping cart but posting a a bogus price on the url
99065
i love webforms but asp.net ajax is a pile of crap
99066
as your packet size decreases the overhead for spacing synchronization ethernet headers ip headers and udp headers increases in relation to the payload and therefore degrades your maximum throughput even more
99081
both nagios and munin seem to have plugins support for xen data collection
99121
languages like lisp and the very closely related scheme are to programming what latin is to english
99124
flex is basically a language that compiles down to a flash movie or applet that will run in the adobe flash player plugin
99168
while this is not considered to be a huge drawback by some those people are using python ruby or perl and not java
99247
i really dislike the implementation of the asp.net ajax controls i ve run into a lot of issues with timing events and debugging postback issues
99260
it may require things like sales tax shipping costs customer discounts
99304
.net 3.5 may be used in a lot of hosted web apps but it is just starting to show up in distributed apps and with it wcf wpf etc
99331
the janrain libraries are good for php python and ruby
99386
if you have control over the content or can gain control through mirroring or scraping you should consider using ajax or server-side includes to pull external data onto and push it off of the page - it ll end up being more flexible more robust and easier to manage in the end
99395
how to check if a folder directory exists in cocoa using objective-c
99456
javadoc or doxygen is more suitable if you want distributable code documentation
99462
generally speaking if you use a language that has good documentation generation tools javadoc doxygen ms s c# stuff you should write your documentation above your methods and have your tools generate the pages
99468
given that i need to retrieve the last row to get the number of rows and populate the end buffer is there a better way of doing it
99485
this library contains your printf your malloc your strtok etcetera
99488
ideally this would also include a solution solution that allows me to tint the widget s existing colors and identify the average colors of any images in use by the theme so that i can programmatically compensate for any color choices which might make text unreadable or otherwise clashing - but i would be happy if i could just turn a button red
99508
it integrate with your source countrol system including git subversion mercurial bazaar tla and monotone so all your docs track with your project
99520
so although i can put together a test project that exercises the interop layer i can t get a sense for how many of those methods and properties i m actually calling
99549
instead of trying to bind the selectedindex why don t you just bind the selecteditem in the combobox to the value in the record
99553
ruby encoder - may be the best option as their php encoder looks alright i haven t tried it however but it s not available yet
99565
connection pools are simply a bridge between the post-web era of stateless applications http protocol and the pre-web era of stateful long-lived batch processing applications
99568
now for a rectangle vertex put the x value in the line equation get the y value and see if the y value lies in the rectangle bounds shown below
99575
since you can t make a virtual function call from a constructor or destructor the derived class object hasn t been constructed or has already been destroyed it calls the base class version which in the case of a pure virtual function doesn t exist
99578
using ajax where necessary will improve performance especially if the alternative is a complete full-page round-trip to the server a postback in asp.net terminology
99605
nant for builds but msbuild rake almost anything would be fine and cruisecontrol.net for deployments
99608
webforms with asp.net ajax is heaven
99616
with weborb you can simply deploy your dlls into the bin folder of the virtual directory and it will take care of enabling your classes as flex remoting services
99627
the gnu autotools definitely
99628
can you not define a view on the db server that does the union query for you so from the client code it just looks like a single select
99628
if you can t can you just issue the union operation as part of your select
99684
is the proper way to establish this reference to pass the object as a parameter to the constructor or initializer method of the calling object
99702
say you want two hashtables one that maps objects of type string to type int and one that maps objects of type string to type double
99723
my preference in c++ and python is to use exceptions
99724
if you are developing a site that accepts passwords don t put a silly password limit unless you want to get tarred with the same brush
99734
at some point in the future someone is going to inherit from your class because maybe an extra action needs to be taken when the value of a field changes so there has to be a setter
99756
use errorcodes when you need localization internationalization -- in .net you could use these errorcodes to reference a resource file which will then display the error in the appropriate language
99766
if you go to the tools customise menu option and press the keyboard button it gives you a list of commands you can search to see if a shortcut is available or you can select the press shortcut keys textbox and test shortcut keys you want to assign to see if they conflict
99769
the default shell in solaris has command history but you can also use bash instead it s more user friendly
99769
you can also edit etc passwd to make bash your default shell
99785
for instance perl has cpan php has pear ruby has rubygems and so on
99789
dependency injection frameworks like spring and guice provide a solution to cyclical dependencies in java by using proxies which can resolve the receiver of a message the first time it is required
99802
the idea is to parse the output of phpinfo and write any setup values it contains into a local php.ini
99817
that is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumb
99897
i have been given a set of cobol dat idx and key files and i need to read the data in them and export it into access xls csv etc
99926
two dimensions means a quadtree four an octree
99926
as stated as quadtree can work in three-space but if you want each dimension given a proper treatment an octree is the way to go
99929
the term itself is stolen from software languages -- for example c has the auto keyword for declaring variables as being allocated on the stack when the scope it s in is executed and deallocated afterwards so that multiple invocations of the same scope do not see persistent values of that variable
99948
draw the two images to the screen full screen quad with two textures set up with a fragment shader that computes abs texel1-texel2 and kills the pixel discard in glsl if the pixels are the same difference is zero or below some threshold
99954
lex flex and yacc bison provide easy-to-use well-understood lexer- and parser-generators and i d really recommend doing something like that as opposed to doing it procedurally in perl
99954
imagine dealing with all possible interleavings of keywords identifiers operators extraneous parentheses extraneous semicolons and comments that are allowed in something like verilog ams with regular expressions and procedural code alone
99954
also if you re lazy check out the eclipse plugins that do syntax highlighting and basic refactoring for verilog and vhdl
99980
nservicebus and masstransit are two tools that can be used to implement messaging with msmq and other message queues
99999
the methods you are allowed to use might be restricted by the author - no patching no disassembling - or involve anything you can do with a binary objdump and a hex editor
