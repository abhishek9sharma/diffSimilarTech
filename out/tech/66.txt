9504612
free	malloc
you shall never free memory that you did not malloc ed

9504612
free	malloc
you can free a pointer to memory that you allocated using malloc and only those or you are risking the life of your system

9504612
free	malloc
ideally malloc calls and free calls should appear on the same design level inside the same implementation file for the same module for example and they should match perfectly one free for each malloc

9504616
free	malloc
the allocation can add some overhead you could use a static variable instead of malloc or malloc once and only free after the event loop is finished

9504618
folder	directory
the way codeigniter does it is have a mirror directory structure in the client application folder of the system classes

9504625
distance	altitude
these data usually consist of latitude and longitude coordinates though they can also include altitude bearing distance accuracy data and place names

9504690
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is working as intended in google-chrome firefox safari and ie

9504691
versioning	upgrade
but keep in mind that this approach introduces some versioning issues if you re going to upgrade the dataconnection dialog library at some point in the future these properties might not be available in the newer versioning

9504889
junit	testng
i know i can do this using testng but i would prefer to stay with junit for now

this design decision makes sense because that way you can call super in an overriding method of an extends class

9504925
pull	push
i assume you ve got myrepo on server as a staging ground that you can git push and git pull from

9504925
pull	push
you can git push origin and git pull origin to your hearts content without messing up a repository with a work tree

9504970
inherited	properties
now oldreservation no longer derives from a concrete type so all of oldreservation own properties and inherited properties will map to the oldreservations table

9504992
implements	extends
there s not much you can do about implements being closed but you can close the extends with an abstract class and a private constructor so that s what i would do if you want that behavior

9505022
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if it s in init try placing it in the viewdidload or viewwillappear method

9505049
apache	nginx
also to get your web server to look into the right place you need to configure a rewrite rule in apache or nginx to look in the cache directory

9505127
margin	height
this makes the element that is going away collapse its top-margin by negating the margin of the element above it and making the element disappear by subtracting its height without margins at the same time setting its own bottom-margin to same as the element above it essentially matching what will be there when it disappears

9505169

9505378
centos	linux
my linux server runs on centos with no gui as it is a hosted machine so when i try and deploy it i get a segmentation fault

9505383

did you check out your javascript console firefox firebug or built in for google-chrome for any indication of an error

9505405
mouse	keyboard
method and not in a layer s draw method or in mouse or keyboard

9505406

9505535
packets	multicast
can you not multicast a udp packets on the network which the server listens for and responds to with a packets containing the ip address of the server in order to set up the connection

9505557
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome 19 doesn t need the timestamp query string and firefox 10 does need the timestamp

9505589
hash	md5
my thought to accomplish this is to have a database table setup as a guest relationship table that will be used to store uids md5 hash keys and the destination page that the record is referring to

9505628
hex	binary
this works by converting the binary value to a literal hex string then reading it in 8-character chunks

when i debug with visual studio 2010 and the built in web server i get 404 not found on delete put methods when i make requests to the .svc files using curl in cygwin specifically

9505750
vb.net	vb6
in vb.net you can do this by using the system.diagnostics.debugger.isattached property but i can t find anything similar in vb6 on google

9505798
int	double
changing to quads involved defining an int to be 16 instead of 8 and recompiling lapack with gfortran using -fdefault-real-8 to promote double to quads

9505798
post	get
sorry for not being more specific i ve not tried anything like this but i remembered the blog post and it may be enough for you to at least get started

9505808
clang	llvm
llvm includes a jit compiler lli and clang can already produce bitcode from c++

9505839
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs
because hfs filesystems hold a lot more metadata than most others including fat and ntfs copying entire branches folders of files onto other filesystems tends to lose stuff like the bundle state

9505850
width	height
i m trying to create a sine wave that has an amplitude total height of the height of the container in this case 400px and have the total length of the wavelength equal the width on the container in this case 600px

9505872
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the strangest thing is that this behaviour is persisten with the latest firefox safari and google-chrome for mac but does not verify using jsfiddle.net

9505872
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i noticed that deselecting normalized css in jsfiddle draws the lines in the very same manner safari firefox and google-chrome are doing

9505927
accessor	properties
if you want to keep the possibility to store properties as nsstring you can implement special accessor to nsstring properties of your managed object which will transform the nsstring to nsarray value or use your nsvaluetransformer outside your coredata model like this

9505941
inherited	properties
yes it s possible this is called inherited mapping but the child class has to be explicitly declared as entity and its mapping has to be explicitly defined as well if the child class adds extra properties

9505974
hide	show
i m having trouble with the show hide function of jqueryui

9505974

bmp	png
list of single images jpg png bmp jpeg-2000

9506162
icns	ico
what about resizing or ico icns

9506162
icns	ico
the only difference between an ico and icns is that one is a single image while the other one is multiple-images in one file

9506162
writetofile	nsdata
when you get the nsdata object do as you want with it such as writetofile writetourl or heck create another nsimage if you want

9506189
for-loop	arrays
is there anyway to use a for-loop to change to #name so that i don t have to write out a line of code to set each arrays element

9506208
subobject	instances
if you want folder semantics with btree storage semantics look at products.btreefolder2 and add-on that implements the folder interfaces but stores subobject in a oobtree instead of as attributes directly on the instances

9506210
onkeyup	onkeydown
when i touch screen and then press a button onkeyup and onkeydown methods aren t called

9506274
children	parent
but your sql implies that authentication is the parent here with zero-or-more authorization children not the other way around which would be more like

i m trying to upgrade an excel vba workbook to a vsto excel add-in in vb.net using vs 2010

9506389
vsto	add-in
the problem is that in the new vsto add-in i can not get the windows form to mimic this same behavior

9506460
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
immediately before writeablebitmap creation in rendertobitmap the width height of the element is 7 7 the desired size is 7 7 but the actualwidth actualheight is 0 0

9506470
put	get
the point is that someone somewhere will get around any measures you put in place but if the math holds 96 of your users will just give in and pay you for full access when faced with a shift-ciphered registry key and obfuscated program code

9506487
move	drag
so far i can record every movement and touch events however when using drag and drop the drag shadow overrides regular move event

9506510
g++	gcc
compile using g++ instead of gcc so you get the c++ library linked in

9506510
g++	gcc
s the difference between gcc and g++ gcc-c++

9506521
division	modulo
note that the generic way to check whether a number is even or odd is modulo division with the operator

9506528
post	get
will post more as i get into this

9506533
floating-point	integer
the operator performs integer division in python 2.x while it does floating-point division in python 3.x

9506570
int	chars
will work since a is of type chars which can be implicitly cast into an int

9506579
post	get
i have thought about forcing the methods to be called using post rather than get so that a person can t just paste the url in the address even though i could just check the user id of the person doing it

9506579
post	get
one way i have thought about is allowing the get method and then checking the user id of the post compared with the logged in user id like so

9506619
inherited	properties
you can setup a style.xml in res values and inherited from holo and override the properties you need to

9506625
twig	smarty
the best approach in my opinion would be to use an existing template system such as twig or smarty

9506625
twig	smarty
twig and smarty also provide caching options so you aren t rebuilding your template on every request

9506673
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been doing this in google-chrome because firefox doesn t natively support the html5 audio tag

9506755
for-loop	arrays
to give an example lets say the first for-loop dynamically generated the associative arrays with four values

9506773
client-side	server-side
it sounds like you might be blending the server-side and the client-side together in your head

9506773
submit	submission
user clicks the submit button or hits enter or alternatively you could add an onblur handler to the file input to have it trigger the form submission

9506788
width	height
you must divide this by the width and height of the viewport to get the texture coordinates for lookup

9506793
post	get
i can get the post data i tried with a simple string it worked fine but with a heavy file the data seems corrupted

9506795
accessor	properties
__attribute__ nsobject on the properties only causes it to retain release the properties when using the properties accessor

9506798
oncreate	onstart
that case i imagine it would go through oncreate onstart

9506799
width	height
there are other parameters you can pass in the specs parameter besides width and height

9506824
maven	pom.xml
is it possible to import maven project to jidea when maven project file is named other than pom.xml

9506826
actualheight	actualwidth
i found this link which suggests actualwidth actualheight are evaluated asynchronously hence a well-place begininvoke can solve the problem

9506827
getter	setter
there can be static local variables with getter and setter

9506827
getter	setter
using getter and setter allows one to slide in patterns to prevent multitasking issues from arising

9506836
google-chrome	firefox
borders showed up in firefox ie8 and google-chrome

9506837

i know i can compress by height and width but i would like to compress the images by size to a fixed size 200 kb only and keep the original height and width

9506988
sorting	filtering
interactive sorting and filtering are more recent but they are there too

9506990
hash	salt
if wordpress salt their hash then you d have to gain access to their salt table or single salt phrase to alter their hash -- but i doubt you ll get that

9507028
redmine	mantis
you can also download redmine and mantis from bitnami if you want to try them out

9507044
int	double
regarding your specific implementation i would be much more inclined to use a 64 bit int as the accumulator rather than a 64 bit double

9507044
int	double
the double only has 53 bits of int precision compared to the 64 bits of a long

9507062
super	self
super mymodel self .save args kwargs

9507080
pjax	history.js

9507123
google-chrome	safari
this only happens with safari and google-chrome

9507123
opera	firefox
works fine on firefox and opera

9507124
put	get
i am not saying that this is the way to go just that because of the nature of couchdb this configuration is actually a viable option and will give you benefits of scaling and replication that you would not get if you put node in front and couchdb in back

9507128
voltdb	acid
voltdb supports sql and i think it supports acid transactions as well

9507151
apache	nginx
and make sure to enable ssl on the server nginx apache etc.

9507197
getter	setter
it s a shame to see a small vocal minority take a back lash against the whole getter and setter are evil debate

9507197
getter	setter
getter and setter accessors are not evil

9507200
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome opera.

9507211
post	get
using post method instead of get or pass random dummy parameter like current timestamp is only robust method to prevent caching in ie

9507220
width	height
and set the height and width

9507229
mamp	wamp
also web apps can be developed via a local environment research mamp or wamp depending on the dependencies in which your app require

9507274
width	height
then on hover you animate the height and width of the image at the same time you animate its left and top properties by negative half of the position values

9507300
width	height
if the linter tool does not recognize the new thumbnail make sure it is compliant with the height and width requirements 50x50

9507300
width	height
also be sure the width to height ratio is also not too high ratio 3.0

9507333
qlistwidget	qdialog
ensure the parent of the qlistwidget qdialog has the following

9507335
matlab	simulink
simulink is part of matlab and works great for engineering problems

the triple double-quotes prevent single-quotes double-quotes and double double-quotes from prematurely ending the string

9507388
button	checkbox	hide	show
when i first check or last uncheck a checkbox i want a linearlayout with some button to show hide

9507388
post	get
i ve already checked this post listview list is reversed when selection made but i could not get my code to work

9507410
width	height
get the width height aspect ratio less than 3.0 and your image should appear

9507412
width	height
lets draw the same amount using the same positioning and only change a few attributes that will not affect render times width and height

9507415
post	get
if i can get it working i ll post the code when it s done

9507423
hide	show
ideally i ll be able to have these products listed by category and will put in some javascript to hide show products of a given category

9507433
width	height
obviously you will want to adjust all the height width top and left values but this should do what you are looking for.

9507468
hide	show
i dont want to grab the default value enter keywords address.... which is controlled to show or hide by the following

9507473
nettcpbinding	net.tcp

i have a listview populated from a simplecursoradapter each row containing some textview and an imageview

9507559
width	height
according to microsoft documentation if you specify a width height it will open in a dialog but this is not the case when using gcf

9507576
eventlet	gevent
eventlet and gevent are both compatible with urllib2 and cookielib which both depend on the automatically patched socket module and should be able to work with different request methods and cookies

9507583
getter	setter
if you declared an ivar instead of using property and synthesize you have to create the getter and setter yourself

9507602
packets	pcap
really simple code that just fires one pcap packets using scapy

9507605
int	double
so if you know how to skip bytes and read short int into double you should be good to go

9507621
google-chrome	firefox
after having some other strange things happen related to google-chrome i tried to use dapper.net on firefox and ie and the same thing continues to happen

9507621

you could first find height and width and guess the compression factor larger image more compression then after you compress it check the size and split the difference again

9507883
background-color	transparency
perhaps try adding position relative and background-color transparency to the button s style then use a div inside the button tag setting the top and left to 0px

9507990
toupper	uppercase
that said the two versions of the code are not equivalent the version onot using toupper isn t writing the characters all the time while the latter version is once everything is converted to uppercase it always takes the same branch after a test and then does nothing

9508152
folder	directory
i am trying to write a script that takes in one parameter and then copies a folder in a different directory naming it using the parameter

9508153
floating-point	fractions
thats normal due to float imprecision - floating-point numbers are imprecise if you need to compute with precise numbers use integers and emulate fractions parts on n places

9508262
box-sizing	border-box
it has 8px black borders and box-sizing border-box

9508263

hide and show store the display property and change between display none and previously stored value

9508263
width	height
so it doesn t change the width or height of an element

9508270
int	double
define a function which takes an input x which is a float or double and returns a triplet of int each in the range 0-255

9508271
width	height
if anyone could assist me in my journey to have a script that makes images without a height but a width of 500px greyscale on page load but change to color on hover it would be awesome

9508273
width	height
as far as what the real w h should be set to on the first line that s a matter of looking at infowindow.b.contentnode and getting a real width height either through the standard properties or jquery s methods

9508275
int	double
then you just need to define an mpi datatype that describes the struct s memory layout lots of double and an int

9508284
charindex	substr
how can i do it using charindex and substr

9508346

9508372
getter	setter
first i planed to set an element s innerhtml a getter and setter

9508392

width	height
relative or absolute positioning would change the positioning but not the height or width check this

9508431
ant	pom.xml
the ability to restrict to a particular filename would be really useful for me as there are numerous xml usecases ant build.xml or mvn pom.xml that it would be perfect for

9508444
post	put	post	get	put	get
put your post data in the optional data argument and it will use post instead of get for the request

9508512
getter	setter
also note that i am not looking for a tool to generate getter setter methods for class members

9508528
getter	setter
all of the validation code is already in each component via their getter and setter so ideally what i d like to do is try to create a component with the settings provided by the user and see if there were any errors

9508538
int	double
i would think that instead of casting you need to apply an int not double round-nearest function to the double result of floor

9508538
ceil	floor
the c library versions of floor and ceil are very slow anyway

9508558
decimal	ieee
since not all numbers can be represented exactly in ieee floating point arithmetic the standard that almost all computers use to represent decimal numbers and do math with them you will not always get what you expected

9508558
hex	binary
if we look at them in binary well hex which is equivalent we get a clearer picture

9508576
ggplot2	lattice
another option is to use a grid graphics function to create the histogram such as something from the lattice or ggplot2 packages both can do histograms then create a specific viewport using grid graphics functions and use grid.table to put the table into that viewport

next do the post request to authenticate and get the auth cookie

9508793

9508796
width	height
how can i keep the current width height and not move the user at the beginning of the page

9508840
couchbase	couchdb
there s a big difference between couchdb and couchbase if i m right couchbase use couchdb to store the data but do not offer present the views and others nice functionality of couchdb

9508840
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase looks more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb and maybe it does not fit your needs

9508840
couchbase	couchdb
why are you using couchbase instead of couchdb

9508840
couchbase	couchdb
from the comment i understand that damien katz is now working on this new project called couchbase but it s not couchdb s last version but just another nosql database

daemons	launchd
launchd is the osx daemons process manager which does seem to launchd programs in a way that they have complete access to the windowserver

9509010
onfocus	onblur
why don t you consider emptying the default value onfocus and assigning it back onblur if its value is empty

9509048

subtract	add	subtraction	add
i find the easiest way to do subtraction in two s complement is by the method of complements which is instead of trying to subtract the positive 18 from the positive 15 +15 - +18 we instead add negative 18 to positive 15 +15 + -18

9509313

9509502
ord	chr
chr and ord and unichr don t seem to be working

9509540
move	drag
i have subclassed qmimedata and drag drop works perfectly fine within my widget â for both copyaction and moveaction data gets copied and move as needed based on shift ctrl keys etc.

9509540

post	get
even on server side if you don t send any data there is no way for the server to know if you made a post or get request

9510321

something similar to how we do it with chars to int just by adding + 0

9510480
width	height
if the camera driver does not support previewsize for portrait mode height width you cannot get yuv data in portrait mode

9510480
portrait	landscape
and the rest depends on you you can scan barcode in portrait mode but it take time longer or you have to change orient of screen to landscape to get result faster

9510513
int	chars
see the reason why you subtract 0 to a chars example 9 to convert it to an int is because the ascii value of 0 is 48 1 is 49 and so on till 9 which is 57

9510535
width	height
while doing this use .css function for button to change it s color and a callback function change it to normal color and make container div s width and height a bit bigger than button when animation is finished

9510574

9520903
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
yes you can just add the views of the viewcontrollers to your scrolling view but remember that you are rolling your own equivalent to a uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller and so you have some responsibilities

9520903

9521140
int	boolean
is int better for boolean values and if so - why

9521166
for-loop	loops
but if we re copy and pasting it in to the input i m confused how it should detect the error with rows and columns when in order to accept the rest of the data i m using for loops to scan all the values in and the length of the for-loop is dependent on the input of rows and columns for matrix1 and matrix2

9521193
mouseover	mouseout
while hover mostly works fine in ie for mouseout there are a few things i ve found that that can trip it up causing it to a ignore mouseouts as you describe and b trigger the mouseover event recursively such that if you put a console.log in there ie developer tools console breaks and turns grey.

9521202
int	chars
actually there s no real difference since chars gets always promoted to int when using it check this

9521202

getter	setter
if you provide a getter and setter then they can do both but you still have control over it

9524776
getter	setter
it could be that you don t have any such assumptions in this class right now but a you may have some in the future and b other classes do have those assumptions and therefore need to protected their private fields and it s nice to have a consistent way of accessing data not fields in some cases getter and setter in others

9524776
getter	setter
which brings us to the last big point at least in this answer which is that a getter and setter can be overriden to take advantage of inheritance while a field cannot

i thought i d be able to put this snapshot in an ikimageview which preserves anti-aliasing but ikimageview suffers from the same issue qcview in that when print is called you get nothing in your print window

9525272

reading values from users is done by handling http get post actions and reading the attributes

9525331

for example downsampling might not be very effective at full screens resolution 1900x1200 switching to 64bit architecture etc

9525724
getter	setter
i m also not clear if javabeans are allowed to have methods beyond getter and setter

9525724
subtract	add
if i had a calculator bean could i have a method like add or subtract

9525755
postgresql	mysql
but you ll probably want to switch to a more robust database at some point mysql postgresql oracle etc

9525780
innodb	myisam
innodb is not designed to use it and myisam is

9525821
for-loop	loops
also i cannot simply move the extraneous code outside of the for-loop because it all depends on the integer ii which is part of loops

google-chrome	firefox
pretty slick and has firefox google-chrome put support for uploading

9526034
aim	instant
edit if the aim is merely to remember the time zone as well as the instant in noda time you d want zoneddatetime like this

as an aside 32 bits is the space of one modern int -- it isn t large enough for a struct except of a couple of chars or bitfields

9526146
implements	extends
next make sure the timer-class extends thread or implements runnable and make it a thread

you expect to pass a single param of type t and people keep implementing their own version with all sorts of param types strings int comparables etc. and a varying quantity of them for example compareto boolean b string s int minmatches

9526247
128bit	64bit
not all types can be aligned on the same memory boundaries some might need to be 32-bit aligned some 64bit some 128bit and this is all platform-dependent

9526278
children	parent
a child of the view being added had the attribute layout_alignparentbottom true which caused it to fill the whole parent blocking any additional children

9526302

uiview	subviews	uiview	uiwindow
you have added your view controller s uiview property to uiwindow as a subviews but prematurely released it soon after

9526308
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
all child view controllers in your uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller do not agree on a common orientation set

9526350
dictionary	map
to have the features provided by some of the previous answers instead of using a dictionary you could also use both a list and a dictionary to map conditions to actions

9526369
width	height
at some point the width is sharply reduced by a certain amount and at the same time the height doubles

9526369
width	font-size
from there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increases

9526421

integer	unsigned	subtraction	addition
it uses the same algorithm for integer addition subtraction moreover this algorithm is the same for signed and unsigned integers

9526874
width	height
this won t do what you want because you only switched x - y and width - height

9526891
crossover	mutation
the first big change is that de is using actual real numbers in the strict mathematical sense-- they re implemented as floats or doubles or whatever but in theory they re ranging over the field of reals. as a result the ideas of mutation and crossover are substantially different

9526915
width	margin
if you view the source of this stackoverflow page then you will notice that all of the content on the page is wrapped inside of a container div with the width set to 100 and the margin and padding both set to 0

9526956
switching	screens
the autoresizing keeps in in the center when its size changes when switching screens orientation

9526958
post	put
is there a standard or best practice here of whether to use post or put

9526958
post	put
another possibility would be to force that the post only updates one table and would require an additional method to do a put in the audit table

9526979
width	height
the one on the left is not always going to be there and contains an image of 128px width height

9526988
post	put
there is also some information about the difference between post and put

9526988
post	put
the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is reflected in the different meaning of the request-uri

9527022
rss	feed
about your rss url the default feed of smf forum is really index.php

9527027
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that the library you are using makes use of callbacks to implement the confirm pop-up which means that the function you are attaching to the click event does not wait for the confirm dialog to be clicked before exiting

9527077
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass with four subclassing

9527077
superclass	subclassing
since the superclass does not know about each subclassing i think i think i would violate oop principles if i somehow force that data down to the subclassing

9527116
mp3	ogg
they are ogg files tried mp3 as well

9527149

http request headers for authentication instead of normal post get or even cookie variables

setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
assuming you don t rely on any apis beyond the language itself you don t use any functions other than settimeout cleartimeout and setinterval clearinterval and those attached to math there are just two things to worry about

9527335
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox works fine

9527336
children	parent
the parent should be able to keep the state that is shared between the 4 children

9527336
children	parent
in inheritance-terms children can surely know what methods and properties their parent have

9527336
children	parent
so define the common callback handler routines in the parent and override the handlers in the children that must handle extra tags

9527371
uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
turns out this was a newbie mistake where i was constructing a uiwindow in my uiviewcontroller when i really just need to construct a uiview instead

9527379
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

9527423

9527453
google-chrome	safari
however this doesn t happen on google-chrome and safari

9527458
addeventlistener	onload
a key difference is that you can bind multiple handlers using addeventlistener but just one with onload

9527558
onclick	onkeydown
you can attach click and keydown events to the checkbox onclick onkeydown or use jquery if you want and they will be triggered on click or keydown

9527572
folder	directory
for me the solution was to delete the yourprojectname-build-desktop folder which resides on the same level as your project directory

9527582
google-chrome	firefox

9527596
google-chrome	firefox
but the same codes worked very well with firefox google-chrome

9527599
bimap	hashmap
not in hashmap but google-guava has a bimap and you could do it like below pseudo-code

9527607
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
is there any difference between nsmutableurlrequest and nsurlrequest

9527652
tostring	gethashcode
you can do that because every object has tostring gethashcode and gettype methods because every object s runtime type inherits either directly or indirectly from object

9527659
appdata	denied
error cs0016 could not write to output file c users myusername appdata local temp czdgjjs0.dll -- access is denied

9527672
backslash	double-quotes
and double-quotes vs single quotes seem to affect how the backslash is interpreted

9527686
put	get
i m going to assume you want code that will let you search for arbitrary patterns in perhaps a flood of incoming arbitrary strings and edit the strings using the simple rule that if a b follows an a then you want to put a dot between them so if you get abba as input you d get a.bba as output

9527688
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i don t honestly know if css3 transitions are specified this way in the specification but my experience in safari firefox and google-chrome has been that this is how they work

9527801
int	double
you re passing two int into pow yet it takes either a long double and int float and int or double and int

9527801
int	double
i ve used double here as it will more accurately represent the full range of int than a float without being overkill but if you re dealing with small numbers in the 100s and 1000s you could probably just use a float

9527826
google-chrome	firefox
getjson jquery and everything worked perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

9527900
put	get
so the stack has three things the destination table the hash table we ll get to naming it in a second and the function we want to put into the hash table

file shares use the smb protocol as opposed to the ftp protocol implemented by ftpwebrequest

9528206
google-chrome	firefox
i guess this in the callback context is being wrapped as an object and hence the issue i guess checked in firefox and google-chrome latest versions.

the solution was rather easy - i needed to set a width and height for the div i was using to display the map

the mutation crossover operations make use of the difference between two or more vectors in the population to create a new vector typically by adding some random proportion of the difference to one of the existing vectors plus a small amount of random noise

9528345
post	get
in every web technology is is possible to read post get parameters so the answer is yes you can read php post parameters in asp

9528385
udp	tcp
i want to block the packet according to the highlighted parts of the tcp dump namely udp length 32 + length 0 at the end

9528637
tinyint	boolean
it is better to have a column for each of the boolean properties i would also recommend using a bit or tinyint column with 1 0 values instead of y n as they take up less space and are easier to manipulate for reporting purposes

9528664
decltype	auto
i suppose the simplest thing would be a flag on types that would simply error if auto tries to deduce it but even that would be complex because decltype can also deduce it as well as template argument deduction

9540587
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are easy

9540587
subtraction	addition
clearly if the longer collection contains n digits then addition and subtraction methods can be implemented to take o n time

of course it s going to be at a minimum o n but how much does the multiplication and addition add to the complexity

9541166
getter	setter
and in most of the examples and tutorials i have seen that a simple model class is created by defining private variables and providing setter and getter methods for them

9541166
getter	setter
but i can define the above class by just defining public variables as i am not doing any processing in the getter and setter method like below

9541166
getter	setter
i understand the approach is not very dynamic in the sense if at later point i decide to put some processing logic in getter and setter methods then i may have to change all my client objects to change to use the getter and setter

9541225
getter	setter
stick to private fields and public getter setter

9541225
getter	setter
most frameworks depends on getter setter jpa is a notable exception in field mode as per the javabeans standard

9541226
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested with firefox and google-chrome

9541231
getter	setter
the main argument towards creating getter and setter is for improved encapsulation from an object oriented sense

9541231
getter	setter
a getter setter method may go out to a database or a filesystem or a local instance variable to retrieve the model data

9541231
getter	setter
if those underlying data sources change in some later update you will only have to change the getter setter methods whereas if you access the variables directly you will have to refactor your entire code base

alternatively you could implement this in a custom subclassing of uiviewcontroller and then have all of your app s view controllers inherited from your custom view controller

9541331
implements	extends
a singleton is somewhat better because you can at least make it implements interfaces or extends an abstract class but it s usually a design smell

rss	feed
i m going to answer this question by changing the standard rss feed of a wordpress installation to respond to limits passed by query parameters

9541740
rss	feed
reading page and are unpaginated as that wouldn t generally make sense for an rss feed

9541740
rss	feed
so the following code in a plugin -- or even in your theme s functions.php -- will completely unlimit the items returned in your rss feed

9541740
rss	feed
for this example you ll get the normal rss feed but with 25 items starting from item number 30

9541746

tax	shipping
also make sure your account email address that you re testing with doesn t have any shipping and tax rules defined in the profile settings

9541921
tax	shipping
you can pass in shipping and tax values as button parameters and those should work

9541926
hide	show
but here s a force-directed layout which allows you to show hide nodes by clicking on them which might give you some ideas

9541955
post	put
rails will automatically make you an empty javascript file for each model so if know you ll be using this in a model called post you would put it in app assets javacsripts posts.js

9542204
inherited	properties
even better if you have different types of enemies that all share the same properties you could create a superclass cenemy that these enemies all inherited from

9542205
apache	nginx
the upside is that it is very fast you normally configure nginx apache etc

9542205

9542764
hash	salt
the point of including a random salt in your password hash is firstly to prevent two hash being the same even when the password is the same

9542764
hash	salt
and secondly to thwart rainbow table attacks that match hash against a precompiled list because none of the precompiled hash used the salt you have used so a new rainbow table would need to be generated for each salt hash

width	height
what is the best way to dynamically change the width and height of an html5 video within a webpage

9542999
width	height
what i have in mind right now is to dynamically change the width height properties of the video to fit the viewable area using javascript but also set a minimum size such that the video doesn t get distorted

9543017
min	max
min and max should use the value the player is looking for secret value rather than the value the player provided

9543017
min	max
as it is min and max change every time the player gives a guess and you re not even using the secret value

9543038
width	height
it looks like they have the css properties of height and width set to 100

9543038

width	height
this means there is currently no way to dynamically adjust the cell height based on the div width at least until css expressions start being implemented

9543330
getter	setter
in the case of readonly attributes they just map to a setter and for non-readonly attributes there s a setter and a getter implicitly created for you when the idl gets compiled

9543330
getter	setter
given the dynamic and non-deterministic nature of the values they can return and the fact that client orbs might behave differently from each other and still remain compliant to the corba spec you can only reliably expect idl attributes to map to getter and setter that can be used to retrieve or set a value

9543384

i wanted to do this so that in a for-loop i could get the ids and the values easily but the above only returns the value when i loops through it

9543530
post	get
you can also remove the where and add x.post_id as this_post_id into the from to get this for all post

9543534
implements	extends
you need to have the object extends or implements another object so that you can cast them as different kinds of objects

9543569
width	height
float is preferred over display inline since with the latter you can t set the element s dimensions width and height as well as vertical paddings top and bottom - which floated elements can do since they re treated as block elements

9543569
width	height
inline-block is like inline but gives you some properties that block elements like width height as well as vertical padding

9543576
for-loop	arrays
however i can t get it to work with two arrays in a double for-loop only nothing more

9543576
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
like i said it works fine if i either only display one arrays data or use more loops however i only have to use a double for-loop and nothing else

9543580
momentjs	datejs
i ve done a fair bit of reading on so tried to manipulate momentjs and datejs into helping me and generally been plagued by a feeling of frustration since i started trying to solve this so if someone could help or point me at the duplicate question on so that i just haven t been able to find that d be awesome

9543588
pypdf	reportlab
it uses reportlab toolkit the html5lib and pypdf together and pretty easy to use

9543611
octal	decimal
by the time unicode and java came along octal had pretty much given way to hexadecimal as the preferred number base when decimal just wouldn t do

9543613
glfw	freeglut
btw you may want to consider ditching freeglut for glfw

9543637
width	height
i try to get image details to my application like date taken camera model width height description..

9543670
pop-up	dialog
right now the dialog pop-up fine then it properly redirects to facebook then redirects back but instead of just popping out to the main page it pops out then pops back up then pops back out again

9543797
tinyurl	bit.ly
base 62 is used by tinyurl and bit.ly for the abbreviated urls

9543820
submit	submission
if you want to use the updateuser function on submit then it must prevent the form from actually submission

9543820
submit	submission
the browser runs the function before submission the form that s how on submit works

9543838
firefox	safari
i would like to get the font to display at 1.5em as it does in firefox but i would like to maintain the rounded corners that are present in safari which disappear in firefox only when i add the font-size 1.5em

9543856
factories	presenter
you could publish a new view was instantiated to a message bus to which a presenter factories could bind the instantiated view to a presenter

9543891
integer	unsigned	filesystems	hfs
historically hfs plus the mac os x native filesystems probably used by ios also stored each timestamp in a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the number of seconds since midnight jan 1 1904 gmt

9543897
asterisk	pbx
after too many time using this phone with any type of pbx server like asterisk asterisk windows and elestisk i face mysterious problem in my soft-phone

9543911
width	height
you can use padding property so its automatically set height width what you want.

9543930
portrait	landscape
this should tell you whether you are in portrait or landscape

9543951
memcached	apc
i think i can t use all the api php extension memcached apc xcache that need to install something in my remote linux server as my web host server is a shared server what i just can do is to place files scripts in the httpdocs folder

9543962
submit	submission
so the click first triggers the submission regardless then the event handler kicks in because it is a submit button and then the form is sent to the server from the first submt

9543966
int	chars
you may need to cast the int to chars so that you can store it in a string

9543981
google-chrome	firefox
at the moment the information appears to be scattered across the internet and i haven t found much that addresses specific versions of browsers which change rapidly google-chrome and now firefox

9543993
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i am facing is lets say my default browser is firefox and i open the page in google-chrome so when the python script opens the new page it opens that in firefox instead of google-chrome

9544177
firefox	safari
it generally isn t that difficult to get the buttons to look the same between firefox and safari

9544209
google-chrome	firefox
but ok under firefox and google-chrome

9544219
implements	extends
i assume this means it doesn t recursively extends but i thought i d ask here before implements it into my project and wasting a lot of time

9544290
google-chrome	safari
i m seeing the same behavior in google-chrome 17 and safari mac

9544328
int	chars	int	double
in java not only string but all primitive wrapper classes int double chars etc are immutable

9544334
togglebutton	seekbar
i have seekbar and a togglebutton for each of the rows in list

9544402
backbone.js	zepto
backbone.js requires either jquery or zepto to be loaded before backbone.js if you intend to do any dom manipulation if you use a view

9544402
backbone.js	zepto
so backbone.js doesn t know if it should use jquery or zepto when it loads and you end up with an undefined value being used a function

9544434
width	height
a simple way would be to add a uiimageview to your cells that has a small width and the same height with the cell example

9544449
button	checkbox
finally i found a solution the event that triggers then radio checkbox button are checked with javascript and not only is called onpropertychange in ie and domattrmodified in firefox

9544453
folder	dir
i told cmake to build it into my opencv source dir build x64 vc10 and ended up with both debug and release folder there possible to tell it just to put it all in the same folder

9544468
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 firefox and google-chrome are giving perfect output

9544473
maven	pom.xml
i do not think maven will search for un-installed dependencies within a multi module project if you are not executing on the parent pom.xml

9544482
postgresql	mysql
there is a transaction_retry gem which not only works with rails 3+ but supports all major databases mysql postgresql and sqlite

9544486
onfocus	onblur
the problem is it works fine in chrome mozilla ie onfocus orange onblur gray and onerror red

9544499
width	height
if your listbox is inside a grid it should take all the space of that grid - if it is inside a stackpanel it will use the least amount os space possible so you will have to use fixed height width

9544542
pull	push
surely you d be better off using a pull for updates than a push and use a technology like nuget to handle your references

9544582
opera	firefox
what i don t get is some browsers like firefox opera will not go through proxy

9544582
opera	firefox
so what do i need to do to allow my app bypass proxy like firefox opera

9544583
interpolation	splines
then you can either define them manually or take a look at splines interpolation

9544583
interpolation	splines
with splines interpolation you only need a single point in-between to determine the full curve

9544620
post	get
the get friends function in hackbook works fine though but you can t post anything on your friends wall

9544695
getter	setter
then you would have to manually create setter and getter methods to access the variable outside your class

9544695
accessor	properties
in order to help deal with memory management useful for objects apple introduced properties in obj-c 2.0 and it allowed you to define the accessor for a given variable

9544695
getter	setter
you could say that a variable would have certain attributes such as retaining or copying a value having alternate setter or getter name etc and you defined this like

9544695
getter	setter
then in your implementation you could synthesize these properties with the given attributes and the compiler would generate setter and getter methods for your variable

9544695
getter	setter
is a setter and a getter called settopspeed and topspeed with an instance variable called topspeed created by the compiler to store the value

9544695
accessor	ivar
this helps for code readability because there can be confusion between when you say self.topspeed or topspeed in your code the first calls the accessor the second is the ivar

9544695
accessor	ivar
the _topspeed differentiates itself from normal variables and also makes it explicit when you re calling self.topspeed the accessor vs _topspeed the ivar

9544718
uiview	catransition
i have a method inside my uiview subclass which adds a to catransition its layer

9544744
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
but not in google-chrome opera and firefox

9544747
children	parent
parent usually calculates it s size according to it s children

9544765
for-loop	loops
when you go to iterate or pass through the data structure one element at a time the iterator presents you with an interface in which each element in the data structure follows sequentially allowing you to loops through with a basic for-loop structure

9544785
getter	setter
i have a worksite class that has worksiteid worksitename and refcode fields each with a getter and setter

9544785
tostring	getter	getter	setter
i can use the worksite objects with no problem except that when i look at the client-side jax-ws generated sources in netbeans the getter and setter are all there but the tostring method is not there

9544810
post	put
and in the loaded page window.php i put the code to print the post parameters.

9544838
google-chrome	firefox
both on firefox and google-chrome in ubuntu

9544862
post	get
for this reason you should use a post verb instead of get

9544940
textarea	textbox
i already done this with some textbox and textarea with a .js file named farsitype.js

9544954
inherited	subclassing
subclassing the form create another form which inherited from registrationform

9545000
switching	screens
you will need full control over the client machine to enforce something like this using a client-side application that can occupy the full screens lock task switching etc..

9545025
width	height
change height or width whatever is needed.

9545027
pull	push
it should work under windows 7 and allow at least the following commands git add git status git commit git push git pull

9545029
post	get
post it to the server then use to get its value

9545097
post	get
works with get post or the hope is that it will

9545097
post	get
my issue is currently i don t want to have mirror code if at all possible where one acts based on post and one acts based on get where both are literally the same code otherwise

9545097
post	get
so what i am trying to figure out is there a solution i can use to work with post get data where i can use the same code base but not have to make one copy for _get and another for _post

9545114
public	protected
if it s a member variable the visibility modifier needs to be default no modifier or higher protected or public

9545119
post	get
the code acts based on post and one acts based on get will never be the same

9545124
width	height
is there some way that i could change the height and width inside the open to be

9545128
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 ie9 firefox google-chrome etc

9545134
width	height
parent container will take the height and width

9545153
udp	tcp
i send my socket with a application in c++ in udp or tcp if impossible in udp... to nodejs

9545169
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
a good way to center a div is to use fixed positioning top and left set to 50 and left and top margin to the negative of half of the width height

9545187
width	height
in javascript you can center an element by determining the viewport dimensions height width of the available screen and position your element relative to those dimension

9545216
width	height
using auto as margins and defining a width and height should be enough

9545230
folder	directory
once you made your file changes and are ready deploy change directory to the new folder and run the following commands

9545265
submit	submission
in my first javascript i am showing alerts if any text box having class check is left empty before submission if all are filled then in second javascript i am showing an alert that confirm submit

9545280
google-chrome	firefox	width	height
explorer will display it improperly sized even when width and height are provided google-chrome and firefox just prompt to download

9545286
allocator	stl
in modern c++ with the stl containers and smart pointers plain memory allocator should only happen in very rare exceptional cases

9545313
google-chrome	firefox
have you tried the same page with firefox and google-chrome

9545343
put	get
here s my previous question how to get data from my database and put it on a listview that is clickable

9545356
post	get
you can use to determine whether your script was called via http get or post method

9545356
post	get
now assuming that you ve coded your entire script to use you can copy all post variables to get variables

9545382
qobject	qpointer
you can t have a shared ownership between a parent qobject and a smart pointer and prevent one to delete the other but you can track the deletion of any qobject by using only qweakpointer or qpointer

9545382
qobject	qsharedpointer	qobject	qpointer	qsharedpointer	qpointer
update with qt 5 tracking qobject s not managed by qsharedpointer with qweakpointer is deprecated in favor of qpointer which is itself undeprecated

9545453
jobs	cron
also could that pose a problem for the remaining cron jobs

9545458
public	protected
the protected and public members of the parent class are still accessible in the derived class and friends thereof

9545462
public	protected
public inheritance makes public base members public protected members protected and private base members are inaccessible

9545462
public	protected
protected inheritance makes public and protected base members protected within the derived class and private base members are inaccessible

9545462
public	protected
private inheritance makes public and protected base members private within the derived class and private base members are inaccessible

9545465
boost	stl
there is dependency on the boost and stl libraries

9545465
boost	stl
stl is not a problem and the boost dependency is quite easy to avoid

9545482
width	height
e androidruntime 4276 java.lang.illegalargumentexception width and height must be 0

9545487
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a sample project located on github that does exactly the pinterest piictu style hide the uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller stuff

9545498
jobs	cron
it doesn t cause any problems for any following cron jobs

9545503
pull	push
i want to let users commit pull and push changes in current branch switch to another existing branch but do not allow to merge branches

9545524
hash	salt
the server stored salt+hash pass salt now if you send hash pass salt the server calculates salt+hash hash pass salt salt which is obviously not the same as salt+hash pass salt and the login fails

9545528
post	get
if these are the only ones will call the callback five times which means you get the title of the first five post

9545528
post	get
or in case there are less than 5 post you will get an error

9545552
jboss	glassfish
for java ee 6 obvious choices are glassfish 3.1.2 jboss 7.1 tomee

9545598
google-chrome	firefox
i was so confounded as google-chrome just said there was a problem but thankfully i tried firefox and it actually blurted out the offending code

9545600
gif	png
the full transparency works fine for png and gif merely the half-transparent areas are a problem

9545601
post	get
i am not sure i get it but if you use a form with post _post array will keep variables and they will not be visible in the url

9545676
hide	show
this way you d be able to hide big ball and can show small balls

9545693
int	chars
server is localhost and has database test with table person chars 50 name int 10 number - primary key

9545701
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
when i hover over the image with my mouse the javascript works fine in ie but in firefox google-chrome safari etc

9545701
width	height
as you can see from the img tag height is inferred proportional to width by not being specified

9545709
entities	entitymanager
you re trying to work on entities that are not managed by the entitymanager you re working with

9545712
jboss	glassfish	jboss	resin	glassfish	resin
examples of those are glassfish jboss tomee and resin

9545721
jar	manifest.mf
if the jar is indeed runnable then you can read the main class from meta-inf manifest.mf and invoke main via reflection

9545723
postgresql	mysql
maintaining mysql in addition to postgresql in same server may be not reasonable so i m looking for a way to use postgresql

9545741
width	height
the reason is surfaceview aspect ratio width height must be same as camera.size aspect ratio used in preview parameters

9545750
subtract	add
the offset cancels out as you d have to both add it to get to the function and subtract it to get the base address so you might as well not bother

9545753
postgresql	mysql
maintaining mysql in addition to postgresql in same server may be not reasonable

9545753
postgresql	mysql
adding postgresql support as a requirement seriously limits your options so installing mysql side-by-side with postgresql may be a good idea

9545760
expression-blend	silverlight
i am making a silverlight application using expression-blend 4.0

9545761
google-chrome	firefox
use inspect element on google-chrome or firebug on firefox

9545765
min	max
just had to maintain a lastcandleindex var and convert the scrolling to use candles indexes and their dates instead of increasing decreasing the min max values by time intervals so now the scrolling is not scrolling time intervals but a fixed number of candles

9545794
min	max
just had to maintain a lastcandleindex var and convert the scrolling to use candles indexes and their dates instead of increasing decreasing the min max values by time intervals so now the scrolling is not scrolling time intervals but a fixed number of candles

9545814
clearance	devise
i haven t used clearance i usually either roll my own authentication or use devise but a quick look through the code tells me that sign_in user does nothing more than set current_user user so you need some way to persist that information before you redirect

9545828
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this will work for you in all ie firefox google-chrome safari etc

9545845
winpcap	wireshark
also take a look at winpcap which lets your application access the same sniffing abilities of wireshark

9545846
children	parent
when you build the max min-heap you don t need to heapify percolatedown the leafs as they can t have any children which are bigger smaller then their parent

9545866
addition	multiplication
now suppose i wish to use this operation in modular arithmetic addition multiplication etc

9545869
put	get
i ve put in a finally statement but i get syntax error i don t have any idea on how to correct them i ve tried everything but to no avail

9545877
comparator	comparable
your object should implement comparable interface and hence you will be forced to override comparator method

9545886
tax	shipping
note in my example that there s no tax or shipping breakout as pp has so you ll need to display that as necessary before showing this buynow buton or perhaps on your confirmation page or confirmation email you send

express	node.js
i was using express in node.js where it was serving static images in a case-insensitive way but when i moved to s3 i found that the images are case sensitive

9545955
onchange	onkeyup
for a textbox you don t want to do this it would if you clicked to enter so instead you can look at either onchange or onkeyup

9545973
primefaces	richfaces
both primefaces and richfaces have such a component p poll and a4j poll respectively

9545973
primefaces	richfaces
for push both primefaces and richfaces have components available again p push vs a4j push

9545992
opera	firefox
i think that some android applications you said opera and firefox simply doesn t do this check but implements some native proxy handling not caring of how the system work

9546055
hash	salt
you should never use passwords use password hash instead properly salt of course

9546060
jtextfield	jeditorpane
i want to pass the search string entered in simplebrowser jtextfield into jeditorpane which is in mytabbedpane

9546060
getter	setter
i don t how to use getter and setter

9546071
pull	push
otoh my guess is that we can start just using only the develos release hotfix branches introducing feature branches later and in this setting folks would just have to pull push normally

9546071
squash	merge
am planning to keep that in sync with develop obviously ignoring the merge history by squash merge

9546118
children	parent
the difference is that capturing method starts the event chain from parent to children meaning that parent event will fire first and the child element will fire last this happens in your case

9546154
oncreate	ondestroy
whenever there is an orientation change android destroys your activity calls ondestroy and then restarts it calls oncreate

9546188
implements	extends
what is the difference between extends and implements in java with respect to performance and memory etc

9546188
implements	extends
for above scenarios 1 2 what is difference between using extends deriving child class implements implements interface

9546195
for-loop	arrays
my question how can i do this for the above mentioned 4d arrays without using a for-loop

9546196
sse	avx
i know various ways that i can do this using sse instructions as well as the avx instruction vbroadcastsd but i m not sure which method will yield the best result

9546197
for-loop	arrays
if the for-loop is only for checking if every field is empty the bla bla is empty and the trigger arrays isn t being used afterwards your if statement can be compactly written as

9546204
portrait	landscape
this technique is good if you dont have different layouts for portrait and landscape mode

9546247
min	max
i m calculating the min max and the avg of player level

9546247
min	max
how can how can i get the p.name field value which refers to the min and max

9546247
min	max
but i want it to withdraw also the name corresponding to the min and max value

9546279
inherited	subclassing
it means the subclassing inherited

9546303
firefox	safari
i m wondering if there is a common routine for making input boxes look like they do in firefox and ie in safari because they usually look horrible once you add a touch of css to the element

9546330
folder	directory
create temporary directory without modifying mtime of parent folder

9546354
rss	feed
i working on a universal ios app that gets news from an rss feed

9546369
getter	setter
you are correct -- use getter and setter and you are also correct that you don t want simplebrowser s button s actionlistener creating a new mytabbedpane object inside its actionperformed since your program should only have one mytabbedpane object

9546449
ubuntu	linux
i know that is probably off topic as it is a linux ubuntu question but my main problem may still be java-related

9546452
strlen	substr
by smart use of pointer arithmetic you can skip the calls to substr which do allocation and strlen which take o n time in the length of the string

9546465
setinterval	clearinterval
use setinterval clearinterval instead

9546494
persistent	transient
normally java card simulators keep both persistent and transient memory in ram

9546496
children	parent
if you read the text given by your links carefully you will see that each parent node at position i in a heap has children at positions and only if these positions do not exceed the length of the array

9546496
children	parent
since the percolatedown algorithm swaps parent with their children only length 2 iterations are needed

9546541
centos	linux
the amazon linux ami is loosely based on centos and a perfectly decent os for ec2 in fact it has been tailored by amazon for ec2 specifically

9546541
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
that said centos and the amazon linux ami in turn uses the yum package manager to install and update packages from centos and 3rd party repositories debian ubuntu use the apt package manager instead - the inherent concepts are very similar though see section adding packages in amazon linux ami basics

9546541
centos	linux
be advised though that you might actually not need to do that insofar the amazon linux ami has been built to be binary-compatible with the centos series of releases and therefore packages built to run on centos should also run on the amazon linux ami

9546541
centos	linux
the desired package pptpd is not part of the standard repositories on centos either though but it is available in the 3rd party extra packages for enterprise linux epel repository see letter p - i can t comment on the viability of using this one vs

9546577
post	get
since phonegap s file transfer does an http post at it s most basic this should get you started

9546665
post	get
add a parameter to your request either post or get to determine the type of request it is

9546668
uilabel	nsstring
i m trying to pass an nsstring address object to a uilabel text but i received a warning from xcode compiler about incompatible pointer as shown in the screen shot below

9546685
versioning	upgrade
on a side note i don t know what versioning of kdevelop ubuntu is shipping these days but if it s anything less then 4.2 you certainly want to upgrade

9546805
post	get
instead of just seeing the information of the selected post i always get a list of all available post under the post details

9546830
int	chars
because the chars type is a signed 8-bit int in the implementation of c that you are using

9546853
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
you have access to the view from your viewmodel in caliburn.micro

9546858
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
so there is a loss of precision when you add subtract multiplying etc

9546896
pop-up	dialog
what s the right way to implement the trigger mechanism that will make the reminder dialog box pop-up

9546943
hash	md5
md5 has the characteristic you are seeking that the same string always produces the same hash value and it can be implemented in any language

9546944
hash	md5
php md5 hash

9546954
firefox	safari
i just compared firefox 10 safari latest and ie7

9546963
min	max
take the tripservice wsdl from this link in this wsdl i replaced the from element with the below added nillable as true and added min length and max length restriction

9546965
put	get
as for getting the status of the system i would recommend just making that a separate get request to the same uri however i can t think of why you also wouldn t just be able to include this same summary as part of the put response

9546976
width	height
height and width isn t enough

9546990
width	height
the width is 100 and the height is 14

9547170
maven	pom.xml
in maven there is a very useful feature when you can define a dependency in the section of the parent pom.xml and reference that dependency from child modules without specifying the version or scope or whatever

9547356
oncreate	ondestroy
when an activity is created for the fist time then system calls the oncontentchanged method as the first method and last call by system is the ondetachedfromwindow method when an activity is killed but android docs says entire lifetime of an activity happens between oncreate and ondestroy

int	chars
one idea is to send string containing the two int concatenated by a comma chars

9547880

9547999
int	chars
is there a way for me to limit the number of chars of int in c++

9548030
int	chars
if you talking about number of bits you can use short chars instead of int

9548047
int	chars
if you want to limit how many chars a user can input as an int you can use a control-structure checking if the entered value is between 2 limits

this works great it keeps the max min y x values in mind so something always get selected

9548096
margin	height
if top or bottom padding or margin is set on the row then it should be in em units and added to the line-height value before calculating the doubled linear-gradient height

9548162

also see jonskeet s answer regarding reading booth stdout and stderr at the same time in the background

9548254
client-side	server-side
the problem i encountered there as you may probably guess but i understood only later on was that one check is done client-side and the other is done server-side

9548254
client-side	server-side
being one client-side it sounds immediate while the other server-side sounds remote

9548254
client-side	server-side
a tech user would very easily bypass the whole verification if everything is done client-side and nothing server-side

9548254

and when i get a 100 functioning sbox going i ll post the final product here so it s available to all who may encounter the same or a similar problem

9548256
stdout	stderr
you re trying to read all of stdout - which will basically block until the process finishes - and then all of stderr

9548256
stdout	stderr
use two threads one reading from stdout and one reading from stderr - that way it doesn t matter which of them next has data you ll be reading from both of them

9548303
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you can do this by attaching event handlers to the mousedown and mouseup events similar to how you attached to the mousemove event

9548303
mouseup	mousedown
when using the mouseup and mousedown events you may want to limit your handling to only when the first mouse button is pressed

i still have some small problems with google-chrome but i think is connected with the fact that for google-chrome and safari the font is 20 px height instead of 16 like in all other browsers don t know why but they are not so bad the text is 4 px lowered i can accept this

to work around this try adding a thread.sleep timespan.fromminutes 2 in your exception handlers to ensure that the exception log gets fflush to storage

9549252

pbkdf2 uses hmac

9549252

hmac however is an algorithm which uses any hash function

9549257
int	chars
that is three int which may be positive or negative each separated by single spaces and then another space before a block of text which may consist of any chars but which should not contain carriage returns

udp	rtp
for live streaming the latency should be kept to a minimum and the typical protocols used are rtp udp

9549524
udp	rtp
this is more often necessary with audio streaming since the header size ip + udp + rtp is considered big in relation to the audio payload

9549567
sorting	filtering
the reason avoiding custom sql is so important in this case is that the code i m writing is generic and heavily data-driven and it needs to mix with other filtering and sorting qualifiers on the query for post objects so i can t just hard code either method calls on post to access the collection of categories or custom sql that might not mix well with the sql generated by the other filtering

9549608

this way you force inlining for sure since the inline statement is only a hint and does not always lead to inlining

int	chars
i m trying to learn more about bitwise and see how i can improve the performance of my code with it so i ve made an test code in that code i make 2 arrays one with unsigned chars and another with unsigned int the idea is to simulate an rgba array and see the differences in manipulating it with just pointer or with bitwise

9549672
int	chars
to be sure that everything is working in the end i do an sum of all values of the array the problem is that the values from the array manipulated with pointer differs from the one with bitwise for now the array have just 4 positions in the int array and 16 in the chars one

popupwindow	pop-up
instead i want it to be done by using popupwindow class which gets popped up on startup and display some message on the pop-up

9549814
width	margin
because the left declaration pushes your element with width added to the calculation so the push actually means 50 to the left + width of your element so we use the negative margin to compensate for the width 50 - width 2

9549877
width	height
if i use a specific height and width it works fine

9549877
width	height
if the tabcontainer takes all the available width and height the menu does something very strange

for-loop	arrays
one finds the same thing is true when comparing a for-loop direct iteration of an arrays to a .foreach iteration of the same arrays for the same reaons

9549913
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
you probably call getwritabledatabase or getreadabledatabase in one of the methods oncreate or onupgrade of your implementation of sqliteopenhelper

9549913

another is linux s clone function which underlies both the pthreads thread implementation and fork in linux by creating a new execution path for the kernel s scheduler and either copying all virtual memory new process or not new thread

9551189
for-loop	loops
basically you can t use variables declared inside the for-loop in a callback function to an asynchronous call because they will all be set to the last value in loops

9551681
dbcontext	objectcontext
this objectcontext is used to back the dbcontext

9551681
dbcontext	objectcontext
when the dbcontext is disposed it will dispose the objectcontext which will in turn call dispose and the store connection will be disposed

9552089
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i don t use uitabbarcontroller i just add the uitabbar in viewcontroller.i know when we use uitabbarcontroller we will create one array which contain viewcontrollers so when we tap the tab will show the specific viewcontroller but the uitabbar just can add uitabbaritem so how to connect the viewcontroller to the tab

width	height
you can t use them for just the width or just the height of a background image you can t put two of them together

9552642
width	height
if you mean to preserve only the background image s original width and stretch its height along with its containing box without preserving the image s aspect ratio you will have to specify its width in pixels and 100 for its height

9552642
background-repeat	background-position
don t forget to give your image an appropriate background-position and background-repeat

9552693
filesystems	ntfs

9553556
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
which is a very ugly way but works in firefox and safari not in google-chrome

9553571
put	get
when i do get errors its the above instead of what i want which is the domain name and curls output its silenced in the first call because it will put junk on stdout

redirection send the output stdout and or stderr of a command to a file

9553699
int	chars
the bitfields ihl and version will be placed in an unsigned int field despite the fact that they would fit into a chars

9553730
pop-up	dialog
using jquery dialog i have created a pop-up box with a form

9553774

9558889
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
we recommend that you derive from the equalitycomparer of t class instead of implementing the iequalitycomparer of t interface because the equalitycomparer of t class tests for equality using the iequatable of t .equals method instead of the object.equals method

9558894

9559103
superclass	subclassing
i want to collect which methods can be safely pushed down from a superclass to a subclassing specifically when you have only one subclassing and there is no reason to maintain the method in the superclass

9559103
superclass	subclassing
it could be a matter of dinamically discover these methods during execution to check which ones are executed in a superclass and they could be pushed down given that there is only one subclassing

9559186

this object has variables so when we property - and - synthesize the username variable all its the objects variables get setter getter - so i can do username.text etc

9559338

getter	setter
you can get and change all not the read only properties of username uitextfiels object because the uitextfiels class has got setter and getter methods for all its properties

9559879
google-chrome	safari
this sampel code works in google-chrome but not in safari both regular and ios version

9559926
getter	setter	public	protected
also instead of using fields you can use properties that allow you to dictate whether the property getter and setter are private public internal protected

9559926
accessor	properties
in your sample you could have interviewid as a properties with a public get accessor and a private only set accessor

9559936

you can declare enums and typedef enums as you would with struct

9560170
inherited	properties
in class-b i would like to inherited all properties and nested declarations of class-a

9560476
membase	couchbase
in january 2012 membase became couchbase and you can download it here if you want to give it a try

9560520
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5

also kineticjs api has the .setsize method so stage.setsize width height might be a step toward a solution

9560596
getter	setter
and that variable has either been previously defined with a _prototypes getter setter

9560598
put	get
setdates that gets called on success in the javascript function is another javascript function but i have put alerts in setdates in the dev environment the code does not get that far presumably because it will not find the code in the validationcontroller

9560598
google-chrome	firefox
traced the calls in dev using firefox firebug and google-chrome google-chrome s f12 feature

ubuntu	linux
on the ubuntu linux machine with 16 gib ram i have the following output

9560609

9560769
gif	png
according to the many answers on so facebook s process for determining the image to associate with a shared link involves searching for several recognized meta tags and then if those are not found stepping through the images on the page and returning a list of appropriately sized ones at least 50px by 50px have a maximum aspect ratio of 3 1 and in png jpeg or gif format according to this answer

onresume	onpause
i planned to use onpause onresume to check when to pop the passcode activity but onpause fires every time i change activities and therefore i need to add more.

9570842
union	distinct
which should probably be union distinct

9570873
ddms	adb
when the device is connected use adb tcpip 5555 to have the device listen over tcp then use to connect to it and use the ddms tools as usual

9570879
int	boolean
when i pass an int value from a .net webservice to jquery it is returned as a boolean

9570919
onresume	onpause
you could even do something like set a timeout of say 5 seconds between one activity s onpause and another activity s onresume to decide that you were doing an out-of-app switch instead of an in-app switch although if you just have a utility function that you call from your activity base class for initiating an activity change that still vastly reduces the surface area of where you have to keep track of things

9570956
children	parent
which will force the parent to make room for its floated children

9571016
int	chars
in the first line it s implict conversion from chars to int

9571023
screens	tablet
i only needed to change the application s icon it needs to be 86x86 for the playbook adjust layout for the bigger screens my android app wasn t optimized for tablet and digitally sign and package the app to blackberry s .bar format

9571083
onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onblur	onkeyup	onblur
i ve tried using onblur or onchange or onkeyup on the form element but can t seem to get it working

9571112
folder	directory
you should be able to copy all of the folder shown here into that directory and edit them as you need

9571112
folder	directory
if you haven t set template_dirs you can do the same thing but copy the template folder into the templates directory of one of your apps

9571145
int	chars
my understanding is that the standard lets the compiler decide if it is ok to use 8-bit addition as long as the result is not going to be distinguishable from the addition of int and converted to chars

9571151
dynamic-languages	typechecking
or i could do some explicit typechecking in the list compression but is typechecking in a dynamic-languages like python the right approach

9571188
for-loop	loops
at the end the program will re-run the while loops if the user returns 1 but when that happens the program will not print the series of numbers again the for-loop doesn t work

9571232

git and grit are not developed further rugged is currently developed but not finished

9571276
post	get
i ve added phone to the post section created the feild in my form now i just need to get the contents returned in the email that is recieved

9571343
post	put
simply put a hidden field containing an unique id that will allow you to refetch the corresponding list elements in the post action given this unique id from wherever you fetched them initially your database or something i suppose

9571382
post	get
this will help figure out what is causing the problem and then if you get an exception post it up here and we can help you more

9571394
xsl-fo	xslt
you are referring to a suggested new feature that might be included in a future xslt xsl-fo specification

9571394
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt and xsl-fo are related in the sense that the former is the most common way to generate the latter

9571394
xsl-fo	xslt
but in general you can t enhance the functionality of an xsl-fo processor by writing a clever xslt stylesheet

9571450
width	height
just specify the width and height of the video as 100 and its parent css property as max-width 100

9571497
firefox	safari
well actually safari and firefox are both correct

9571514
for-loop	loops
i thought that creating a for-loop that loops as many times as there are dictionary keys would solve half of the problem

9571572
maven	pom.xml
however it s structure is very complicated and the source for each maven module almost all maven modules in this app are flexmojo ones does not live under each pom.xml

9571577
serializable	deserialization
i have tried to control the deserialization behaviour by adding some of the .net serializable attributes to my message definition

9571629
stdout	stderr
its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be

9571804
dbcontext	objectcontext
note - i don t want to make a property to expose the objectcontext from the dbcontext as i used to do that expose the objectcontext in order to attach directly and test if object is attached i don t want to do this as i think this not best practice as dbcontext should replace all that

9571846
superclass	subclassing
however i don t want to reproduce these classes in every sub-project without a good reason and i can t see how subclassing would make anything better the superclass would still be against the 2.3.3 version of

9571849

i ve tried to hide the original modal then show the new one but i get stuck with just showing the backdrop

9571992
int	chars
you assign that int to a variable of type chars thereby losing information

9572003
range	max
query the table once to get the highest imprints column value to use for your maximum random value range like so select max imprints as max from my_table

9572031
hash	md5
because sha256 hash are much longer than md5 hash you can detect the hash algorithm by looking at the length of the hash

9572072
children	parent
it properly creates the ul parent but the li children don t get created added properly - they just get wrapped in the default span tags

9572083
16-bit	64bit
the length variable can be of byte 16-bit 32-bit or 64bit width

9572086
uiview	subviews
i d like to have a view uiview with two uiimageview subviews

9572093
versioning	upgrade
i found another way of getting this to work along the line to a taiwanese s blog on upgrade from mvc 2 to mvc 3 you can actually use microsoft translate in ie10 to see the english versioning and it is a fairly good translation...

9572117
google-chrome	firefox
i have had good luck with the new google-chrome user agent overriding in the console settings and some plugins for firefox

9572227
junit	testng
abstracttransactionaltestngspringcontexttests tor testng or abstracttransactionaljunit4springcontexttests for junit

9572265
hide	show
over the years there must be a dozen ways to show hide rows or showing hiding page sections to the client in asp.net on the server or through client side methods like javascript and i am getting lost on what to do

9572265
hide	show
html table with css to show hide and client side javascript to show rows

9572265
hide	show
gets a little bit more involved when server side results dictate when to show hide in js back on client

9572265
hide	show
most of the time a server-side action dictates for me at least when to show hide rows in the ui so i typically lean toward the server side options but i want to get some input as to which one of these methods is most advantageous and why so i can be more consistient in my approach to doing this

9572286
width	margin
according to the width of the dialogpreference i set the margin of a text field so that its position is aligned with the thumb position of a seek bar

9572295
filtering	grouping
you could then keep the two completely separate without having to go through incredible measures to filtering access to different user grouping for something that seems more like an administrative task than an actual value-added feature to your site

9572318
google-chrome	safari
but ie9 google-chrome and safari -- the divisions that the tabs are supposed to switch to remain set at display hidden

9572320
keydown	keyup
i can detect keyup and keydown for f10 just fine but when f10 is released the application menu receives focus and the app ignores subsequent function key presses until either a f10 is pressed again or b a non-function key is pressed

9572337
haskell	ocaml
in particular it is widely used in type deduction for example in c++ templates type deduction or in functional language such as scala ocaml haskell type synthesis

9572362
hide	show
controls hidden client side allow you to show hide without a post back

9572362

hide	show
then you want to show hide the assigned_to box depending on that value

9572459
folder	directory
the directory structure for all these files are identical but the names of the folder vary slightly

9572459
folder	directory
i can do this from command line by running a move command on each individual folder but is there a way to run it recursively on all files within the entire directory

9572511
getter	setter
simply do nothing in the position setter and for the position getter return the total number of bytes that have been returned from the read method so far just have a private variable of type long to store this

9572536
django-userena	pinax
i was thinking of using the accounts app but django-userena seems better so i created a project zero with pinax and tried to integrate django-userena with it

9572536
django-userena	pinax
but is it easier for me to actually download django-userena demo and use it as a starting point instead of using pinax

9572543
getter	setter
updated the object to include a new string object and getter setter

9572551

tax calculation based on shipping origin

9572598
put	get
read this to get more enlightened on the segments part in c++ where in memory are class functions put

9572649
put	get
the attacker cannot get the token to put in their form so you know the form is on your site if the tokens match

9572655
post	get
i don t think that it should be a problem for post requests but if you use get then the sdk adds

9572683
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
4 the following css accomplishes what i m looking for in google-chrome firefox and safari on the mac i use for testing

9572685
installation	upgrade
you should be able to share the system directory across all of your ci installation providing a central place for upgrade and using less disk space

9572720
width	height
you can get the image dimensions from javascript and then force positioning them as a background image in a fixed height width div

9572720
width	height
you can grab the height the width via javascript after the image has loaded

9572739
fgets	getchar
edit i would also delete the fflush stdin and replace getchar with fgets

9572743
autodesk	3ds
there currently is no official support of the quicksilver hardware renderer for autodesk products other than 3ds max and 3ds max design

9572743
ati	nvidia
however autocad uses a built-in opengl renderer which is more beneficial when using nvidia quadro or ati firegl gpu s over consumer graphics cards

9572743
autodesk	3ds
many users often install 3ds max in combination with other autodesk or 3d modelling software strictly for final rendering due to its superior rendering tools

9572743
autodesk	3ds
there may be other third-party renderers that i have missed or to come in future releases but 3ds max is always autodesk s first foot forward and despite the learning curve will always have more advantages including gpu accelerated final rendering

9572790
unix	solaris
which works on some unix systems like hpux but not on solaris or linux.

9572797
hide	show
as you can see at several points in the hide show sequence i use deferreds to allow certain events to complete before launching new ones

9572810
min	max
the function changes the value of minval maxval minloc maxloc to correspond to the min max intensity values and locations

9572812
maven	pom.xml
i had it ready and when i exported the jar from eclipse i got a 76kb jar which is correct but when i make bamboo use a plan to build the same jar using a maven pom.xml file bamboo gives me a 1kb jar saying there s nothing to compile

9572816
qtreeview	qabstracttablemodel
i have a window which contains a qtreeview databasetreeview on a subclass of qabstracttablemodel via a qsortfilterproxymodel

9572838
post	get

9572899
strlen	strcmp
i also get a lot of warnings about how i use strlen and strcmp about the arguments and how i m making a pointer from a int without a cast

9572939
modulus	fractions
i m trying to pass a number that looks like it s a fractions int but because i ve used modulus to check if it s divisible i know will evaluate to an int

9572939
primes	modulus	modulus	fractions
the problem is that when i try this in haskell on the fourth line in my code i run into an issue with passing the number divided by a primes that goes into it - it appears to be a fractions int but because i ve already checked with modulus i know it s going to resolve to a regular int

9573000
for-loop	loops
i embed this in a for-loop and i want to write to the file loops that i am on

9573009
many-to-one	one-to-many
i use -- to illustrate one-to-many and many-to-one since you describe the

9573027
int	double
the operator has type which means that it only works on fractional types like float double and rational and not int

9573080
gridview	repeater
if you don t want to use a gridview you might consider a repeater

9573130
children	parent
there s generally no reason for a parent to fork a single child to do that sort of work but if a parent forks multiple children then that work can be distributed across multiple processors or the multiple units of work can at least be scheduled to make optimal use of one processor is the forked children ever need to wait on i o or for a long-running system call

9573146
slideup	slidedown
applied to your code it gives the following inverting the slideup slidedown to match the condition correctly

9573169
centos	linux
i ve got a very simple java program j.java see below on my application server that successfully connects to an oracle 11.2 database on a database server both servers are linux centos using jdbc thin driver from oracle

9573169
next	except
as you can see from the seturl command in the java code below i ve configured the application and database servers to sit next to each other and they re on the same network cross-cable connected to each other so there s no network traffic on these development boxes except my code

9573197
inherited	properties
am i misunderstanding the way properties inherited works in objective-c

9573234
post	get
then don t run the query yet but use the explain statement to get the query plan and post it here

9573245
domcontentloaded	onload
wrap the method in an onload or domcontentloaded event

9573290
width	height
the canvas gives you it s height width using which you can draw each line on the canvas using drawtext based on the width height available

9573293

a form on my website is not functioning correctly in safari google-chrome

9573333
opera	firefox
it works in ie opera and firefox

binary output for an 8 bit unsigned integer

9573388
sequence	permutation
below is the code this is after i ve done like a hundred of permutation and different sequence of let-do-if and tabulation and i m exhausted

9573394
children	parent
i think that one of the easiest thing to change the background color of the parent frame and all children jpanel could be set the background color of the jframe and then iterate over all the child jpanel and set the background also to them

9573501
cassini	iis
the headers posted here are from the cassini server asp.net development server 10.0.0.0 but i have seen identical results in iis 7 on windows 2008 as well

in the latest versions of firefox and google-chrome for mac i get the started getstuff... alert then nothing after that

9573516
google-chrome	firefox
i thought xmlhttprequest is supported in google-chrome and firefox

9573522
int	chars
i doubt chars i is the way to go there you should try chars int 0 + i

9573546
post	get
and no i cannot post the whole code as it is an assignment this isn t the goal of the assignment trust me it focuses on data forwarding and more just need to get this basic thing working thank you for help everyone

9573564
for-loop	loops
if you replace your for-loop with jquery s function it should solve the problem not because there s anything magical about but just because that encapsulates each iteration of loops in a separate function call which means your variables gallerytitle and the others will be captured in separate closures and thus retain their correct values after loops is finished

9573571
textview	imageview
hi have a app with a actionbar sherlock and a listview that shows 1 imageview and 2 textview but the actionbar blocks the first row in listview

9573572
gif	bmp
i was thinking in using a timage and a imagelist + timer but i need to export each frame of the gif to a separated bmp file

9573603
tolower	toupper
use tolower or toupper before comparing characters

9573603

capistrano	bundler
i m using rails 3.2.1 bundler 1.0.22 capistrano 2.11.2

9573620
accessor	properties
in the example below i m using a string properties accessor on zipfile to get a zip file named somefile.txt

9573629
organization	naming
i have somehow turned into the person to oversee my organization s sharepoint and i have been tasked with finding a way that when a file is uploaded to any of our document libraries the file name of said file is either prepended appended with a date or random string in an effort to prevent naming collisions

9573698
post	get
when the formset comes back in the post i get the data like so

9573729
taskkill	processbuilder
but if tasklist works for you you can use processbuilder in order to run the windows command taskkill

9573729
taskkill	processbuilder
call taskkill like this with a processbuilder instance cmd c taskkill pid pid replace pid with the actual pid

9573769
struts	wicket
we have nearly 1 000 screens with our core financial services application and although wicket looks great it is extremely difficult to convert our struts 1.3 code to wicket

9573784
put	get
the tasks now properly time out and i can get the data by prerender time - and i can easily genericize this and put it on any page i need this functionality

9573804
button	checkbox
currently i have a button click event which takes the datakey from a row in a datagrid via a checkbox and assigns it to an int variable to update an individual in a databsse

9573804
button	checkbox
here is my button click event so far which is working for 1 checkbox selected

9573818
getter	setter
so i managed to optimise the code since i figured what was causing the bottleneck was the ruby - js communication which happened each time was being executed which is all the time since ruby uses getter and setter methods for classes or when objects were being passed directly between languages

9573826
repo	egit
you can tell egit to point to a local git repo from the git repositories view

9573826
repo	egit
once egit knows where your repo is it can import projects from that repo

9573844
winpcap	wireshark
although i can see traffic being sent by a and received by b wireshark and winpcap shows no activity on any network adapter

9573847
int	chars
here you have every bit of chars stored in int array which means 4bytes for 1bit

9573855
portrait	landscape
when i m starting the app in portrait mode and change the orientation to landscape

9573855
portrait	landscape
when i m starting the app in landscape mode and change the orienation to portrait mode press then the back button results in a slide animation from right to left like closing an activity and shows the home activity again

9573855
portrait	landscape
so it s like the landscape and the portrait mode are treated like two different activities

9573855
portrait	landscape
i don t use so an orientation change should follow the normal android activity lifecycle and destroy the old portrait or landscape version of the activity

9573855
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
in myfragmentactivity i just do some logging tracking stuff in oncreate onrestart onstart onsaveinstancestate onpause onresume onstop ondestroy by calling some static methods of a tracking class which just holds a reference to the application context

9573858
width	height
i have a big image about 14848 px width 14336 px height i used deep-zoom tool and exported the files to silverlight and used a multi scale image control

9573926
serializable	deserialization
the time required for serializable deserialization of each session object is going to increase more or less linearly with the size of the object

9573931
respond.js	modernizr
the source code for this polyfill is here and including it out-of-the-box will make things easier to keep updated and allow for smaller file compression for those already including it via modernizr or otherwise if you are you can delete it from respond.js

9573940
children	parent
i did a left outer join assuming that some parent might exist that have no children

9573974
apache	nginx
i was playing with this earlier i have apache and nginx and testing both on my server

int	chars
tablea id int match chars 15 multiple chars 10

9574023
binutils	bfd
i made a symlinks for ld opcodes bfd gas gprof and binutils in the gcc source folder to get this output.

9574023
binutils	mpc	mpfr	mpc
i built gmp v5.0.4 mpfr v3.1.0 and mpc v0.9 using gcc v4.2.1 installing them in the same prefix as used in the gcc and binutils configure

9574023
mpfr	mpc
for each configure i am explicitly stating the locations of gmp mpfr and mpc

9574023
mpfr	mpc
i built gmp mpfr and mpc separately from gcc doing so resulted in some build errors

9574023
binutils	mpc	mpfr	mpc
gcc binutils gmp mpfr and mpc are all build in a separate directory which is not a subdirectory of the source directory as recommended by the gcc installation instructions

9574023
binutils	bfd
make symlinks to the main gcc src directory for ld gas binutils opcodes gprof bfd

9574023
binutils	bfd
and gcc found most of them as stated before i put symlinks in the gcc directory for ld opcodes bfd gas gprof and binutils my actual problem here is telling the configure script to compile a new assembler and linker

9574034
getter	setter
in your node class java naming conventions the same way that setter should be prefixed with set getter should be prefixed with get nextitem should really be getnextitem

9574061
daemon	cron
there s a cron job that runs the daemon every 5 minutes

9574118
udp	tcp
when doing a lot of transaction based connections and having issues with tcp s time_wait state duration which last 2msl 120 seconds leading to no more connections available for a client host toward a special server host you should consider udp and managing yourself the re-sending of lost requests

9574118
udp	tcp
as a consequence the dns server send a udp reply with a dedicated flag raised in order to ask the client to use tcp this time

9574202
int	double
from experience i always keep the interface to simple types like int double etc i did also use string in the interface and simply converted to std string using code that s easy to find on the internet

9574212
mouseleave	mouseenter
i m new to javascript should i instead be using the mouseenter mouseleave function

9574235
portrait	landscape
this video would need to be able to be viewed in portrait and landscape mode so it will need to autoresize on deviceoriantation

9574235
portrait	landscape
but all the images can only be viewed in portrait mode and if the device is in landscape mode they are still displayed in portrait mode so they dont adapt to the layout

9574235
portrait	landscape
the video doesnt autoresize properly also i want to be able to swipe from landscape mode but the next set of views be in portrait mode is this even possible

9574235
portrait	landscape
or should i be locking the movie so that when its in landscape mode you cant scroll and you have to return it to portrait mode

9574235
portrait	landscape
i know a lot of apps lock to portrait or landscape

9574256
slider	supersized
i ve adapted the supersized slider to work with wp e-commerce to create a featured product slider

this is for historical reasons because iirc matlab originally didn t have support for int at all so all numeric constants in matlab produce double values and the promotion rules were created to make it possible to mix int types with floating-point constants

9574518
int	double
to fix this explicitly convert those int types to double before concatenating

after reading the man page for realloc i was not entirely sure that the second line would cause the 19995 extra bytes to be free

9575122
free	realloc
i mean the block pointed by b certainly contains 5 free bytes so would it be enough for a lazy complying allocator to just not do anything for the realloc line

i started learning clojure a few months ago in earnest have looked at common lisp and scheme on and off over the years

9578127
width	height
would it be possible to detect the width and height of the image a user pastes in the box then resize the canvas accordingly

9578173
pypdf	reportlab	reportlab	pyx
reading and creating pdfs is pretty easy with python pdf libraries like reportlab pypdf and pyx

9578217
hide	show
other methods like show hide etc.

9578221
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
check out the webkit inspector safari and google-chrome firebug firefox or the f12 developer tools ie

9578257
pop-up	dialog
i have a confirmation dialog in jquery that pop-up and show some confirmation details

9578272
lisp	scheme
there are two primary dialects of lisp common lisp and scheme

9578272
lisp	scheme
however both common lisp and scheme are standardized and the standards define a certain baseline of features which you can expect any implementation to have

9578272
lisp	scheme
if you want to understand lisp you re better off first learning either common lisp or scheme

9578272
lisp	scheme
you can easily learn common lisp after you know scheme

9578272
lisp	scheme
common lisp has many good libraries out there scheme less so but it pales in comparison to the vast amount of library support available for java or python

9578272
scheme	racket
if you want to get started i recommend downloading racket a highly popular implementation of scheme

9578272
lisp	scheme
though originally developed as a teaching language it comes with a very large standard library more characteristic of common lisp than of scheme

9578287
post	get
i spent a while attempting to get my code to display correctly in this post but it keeps breaking

9578359
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

9578360
width	height
you can draw using the center of the image by simply offsetting it by width 2 and height 2

9578414
width	height
edit it alerts success but doesn t apply the width height

9578415
facebook	fbconnect
in fbconnect there is a class fbdialog which is using uiwebview for facebook login authentication

9578495
daemon	cron
i don t think either it s a good idea to run script by cron daemon each minute and you mentioned reasons so i offer you twisted

9578500
width	height
basically i varied the the height of the images and kept the width of all the images the same 300px

9578510
put	get
can anyone please tell me how to handle object that comes from ajax call as string and put it into dynamic and get its details

9578518
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome has a feature that shows the network traffic

9578518
apache	nginx
make sure your javascript is treated and served as static content via nginx apache whatever directly or cdn not hitting your application framework

9578518
yslow	pagespeed
have a look at the yslow plugin and pagespeed both very useful in improving performance

9578562
addslashes	multibyte
if you want something generic use addslashes but note that it will give incorrect results for some obscure multibyte character sets

9578572
post	get
this will use get for pull and post for all pushes read create update delete

9578612
int	double
i could be wrong about this but this could be a precision error arising from the fact that js numbers are represented as ieee double and the number that you re describing is so large that it might actually be out of the range of int values representable exactly with ieee double

9578612
int	double
according to this earlier answer the largest int representable exactly by an ieee double with no gaps in the representable int is 2 53 which is about 10 14

9578617
put	get
either way you ll never get a form to accept a focus event unless you first put a tabindex on it but if an input based field gets focus first it will never bubble

9578624
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the reason that you should not do a custom subclass is that uinavigationcontroller instantiates it s uinavigationbar directly and you cannot tell it to use your subclass

9578639
integer	unsigned
for certain hash functions in java it would be nice to see the value as an unsigned integer for comparison to other implementations but java supports only signed types

9578671
draggable	droppable
my issue is while i drag the draggable content to the droppable area the corresponding which contains the class subtopic-drop-playlist should open and it s happening and the becomes display block and it s showing the below content

9578671
hide	show
show hide while dragging the content to the droppable area

9578676
strdup	strtok
your best solution is probably to stick with strtok but throw it only content you ve strdup ed from the authoritative original

9578682
int	boolean
like others i m not sure what you mean by and the essential element in the array is int but if you are creating a bit array of boolean 1 and 0 use bitarray

9578705
google-chrome	safari
the browsers you can test it on are safari google-chrome

9578712
int	double
it works with string and int however doesn t work with double what is wrong and how to fix it

9578712
int	double
output is brown over fox quick quick dog brown the brown lazy brown 3 0 3 1 1 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 so it works for string and int but doesn t for double same value each time

9578713
simplexmlrpcserver	xmlrpclib
simplexmlrpcserver and xmlrpclib â if you can live with the constraints imposed by http + xmlrpc stateless streaming is tricky this will get you up and running in about 5 minutes

9578764
puts	gets
i use multi-thread and one thread puts the received data into the jitter buffer and another thread gets the data from the active jitter buffer sometimes the getting thread can t get effective data especially when it is faster than the putting data thread

9578772
disk	ram
3 when ever the ram is full the page which is not used rapidly is returned to the hard disk to allocate memory to the other pages processes

9578826

9578862
toolbar	tabs
tabs toolbar

9578930

i want to create a gaussian high-pass filter after determining the correct padding size if image width and height is 10x10 then should be 20x20

9578971
postgresql	mysql
my requirement is i want to diff two database which can be any database for now considering 3 database oracle mysql postgresql and suppose if any of two database has a common schema with common table name but lets say those two tables are different

9578980
scheme	racket	lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
the flawed benchmarks as of early 2012 put clojure within a factor of 2-3 of the speed of statically typed languages like java scala and c# a little bit behind common lisp and a little bit ahead of scheme racket

9578988
integer	unsigned
i need to use a 6 bytes 48 bit bit field in a structure that i can use as unsigned integer for comparison etc

9578990
vb.net	vb6
i have some vb6 code that needs to be migrated to vb.net and i wanted to inquire about this line of code and see if there is a way to implement it in .net

9579024
children	parent
the nested children are inheriting the color from their parent so the selector wasn t actually matching them

9579040
inherited	properties
my guess is that both your selectors have the same specificity + the color properties is inherited

9579040
inherited	properties
the color properties is inherited

9579093
udp	tcp
it s possible that your clients understand udp and not tcp

9579106

here you can call the user defined method shrinkmehtod that actually send the string file path and the height and width to be reduce image to method

9579154
getter	setter
hi you need to do something like this create a getter setter as followed

9579164
codeigniter	cakephp
i might also recommend if you re interested in learning a framework and want to stick with php look into cakephp very similar to ror or codeigniter lighter in comparison

9579164
magento	joomla
it wouldn t have the same steep learning curve as a custom framework and would be much more flexible than a shopping cart built in joomla or magento

9579197
action-filter	onactionexecuting
try creating a custom action-filter system.web.httpfilters.actionfilterattribute and implement the onactionexecuting method

9579197

9579332
vb.net	vb6
edit well ok there s vbfixedstringattribute but i m pretty sure that exists solely so that automated migration tools can more easily convert vb6 code to vb.net for you and it s not really the .net way to do things

9579332
int	double
for example you might have a file that contains a set of fixed-length records that all have the format int 1-character-string double which you could represent in vb6 as a user-defined type

9579395
int	double
you can then bind parameters as int double strings or blobs

9579425
postgresql	mysql
i have worked on mysql and nosqls but postgresql is appearing to be a tricky part for me

9579440
int	boolean
as the comments are alluding to the answer to your question lies in differentiating between bool the real boolean type and bool the ms typedef of int

9579449
width	height
this line of code is just setting a height and width on any object with the .resize class and isn t doing anything to objects without that class

your problem is that the solution is very large and the web deployment project is copying it from one directory to another that s why it is taking that long what you have to do is that you should exclude any unwanted folder from being deployed images files anything not needed to do so follow these easy steps

9581673
superclass	subclassing
i could write a query like this - using the instance of operator to limit the result to the subclassing i want of course but i will get an error because the property i want to match against status is not mapped in the superclass even tough all the entities i want to match against have it

9581673

width	height
please note that some extensions such as adblock can mess up the extracted width height from the image

9582015
width	height
when you ll resize the form that control will keep its height but it ll resize to keep its margins so if you ll make the form wider its width will be increased

9582015

getter	setter
now a property is just shorthand for declaring two methods - a setter and a getter

9582151
getter	setter
a property is usually not always backed by an instance variable and if you have the compiler write the setter getter for you by using synthesize then the backing variable pre xcode 4.4 has the same name as the property

9582151
getter	setter
instructs the compiler to write the setter getter but to use the variable foo_ as the backing variable

9582151
getter	setter
so the difference is that foo is the name of a property and used either in dot notation myclassinstance.foo or less usually by directly calling the setter or getter

9582151
getter	setter
if you ve written you own custom setter getter or if you are using manual memory management and synthesized retain or copy properties the difference is huge as foo_ by passes the setter getter and hence the custom code or the synthesized memory management code

9582157
stdout	fflush
if you call fflush stdout

9582179
iboutlet	ibaction
you need to declare the button in the controller like you did as an ibaction and this time declare this as an outlet iboutlet

9582292
fseek	ftell
another approach typically used as long as you know the file isn t being updated is to use fseek ftell to seek to the end of the file get the position wich will tell you its size then seek back to the start

9582326
ready	each
an idea could be creating an array of deferred to use inside every ready function except the last one resolving each one when the snippet has completed

viewmodel	caliburn.micro
the second link is stating how if you create a view usercontrol and create an instance of the view in xaml and you wish to bind it to a viewmodel then that is called view first and you have to tell caliburn.micro where the viewmodel is to bind to

9582523
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
when you have a contentcontrol in a view with the same name as a viewmodel property on your parent viewmodel then caliburn.micro will locate the view of the corresponding viewmodel inject it into the contentcontrol and bind up the view viewmodel

essentially by changing the expression from an iqueryable to an ienumerable you can now use linq to objects instead of the iqueryable implementation by your database provider without any restriction - there does not have to be an equivalent method on the database side so you can freely perform object transformation remote calls if required or any sort of string manipulation

9585978
getter	setter
since to write both setter and getter methods for one property like this is just too much work

9585986
post	get
most of the complexity of creating the params map in play is due to combining post get route etc.

9586026
getter	setter
if the setter and getter do nothing else than accessing an underlying real attribute then the simplest way of implementing them is not to write setter and getter at all

9586026
getter	setter
you don t need getter and setter to ensure encapsulation in the case your access logic changes to something different than the standard access mechanics later since introducing a property won t break your interface

getter	setter
you would need a getter setter for the entityid string in my case

9592608
superclass	subclassing
as a generalisation an instantiable class should only depend on itself and its superclass never subclassing

9592608
superclass	subclassing
there are possible exceptions to this where a superclass may need to know about its subclassing but this is probably an indication of poor design due to the generally undesirable coupling

9593097
int	chars
how can i set each chars in a string to an int

9593097
int	chars
i have to set each chars in a string to an int so that i can sum their values

9593118
for-loop	arrays
instead in your template you could iterate over the arrays in a for-loop and traverse the dictionary to the username and category keys

9593139
int	chars
chars are usually represented internally by int so can be assigned to an int

9593139
int	chars
if you have chars 1 and want to store int 1 then you can do

9593142
getter	setter
as i want this is auto for quick fix ctrl-1 - create setter and getter .

9593148
int	chars
yes -- in c and c++ chars is just a small int type typically with a range from -128 to +127

for example my own private scripts reside in the private folder which is in the same directory as the var www directory and are accessed via include .. private script.php

9593219
hide	show
if the user clicks on the complete radio box its should show the application_complete box else hide it

9593228
int	double
from what i ve seen there has been some success passing the type of an object the custom attribute expected a new instance of a custom object but i m primarily looking at simple data types string int double and perhaps generic collections list dictionary etc.

9593252
post	put
if necessary you can send a running server a post with json data containing a new configuration which then gets put into effect by the view handling the post request

-the blue line does not appear in the most recent versions of firefox google-chrome ie or safari

9593359

9593374
inherited	subclassing
you can also do this in viewdidload a uiwebview is a subclassing of uiview and inherited all its methods

9593384
accessor	properties
your class has to have a constructor and if you have at least one properties you can get accessor and mutators as a shortcut

9593384
getter	setter
now you can add add getter and setter automatically if you have a constructor and if you have variables for initializing

9593404
folder	directory
i could write a php program that read a directory process each file and when done transfer it into another folder

h.264	webm
the 3 main formats for html5 are ogg h.264 and webm

9593562
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
unfortunately there s no one format that works on all major browsers msie firefox google-chrome safari so the solution is

9593569
children	parent
group those children by their parent

9593569
children	parent
because if the size of the group is equal to names.length all names have been found assuming no two children of a parent have the same name

9593569
children	parent
if you need to do more with the parent like paging or fetching the children you could split this problem into a sub query note that the line is not required it s just an example what you can further do with the query

9593586
width	height
for example database username passwords paths thumbnail height width etc .

9593611
jar	war
you will always need a version number for a project however it is possible to change the name of the generated package jar war ear etc. through the element in the pom

9593616
istream	getline
if you want to find out if std istream getline read an array full of characters as demanded but not an end of line character you need to figure out whether the number of stored characters minus the terminating null is identical to the extracted characters

9593616
istream	getline
actually looking more closely at the spec std istream getline actually sets std ios_base failbit if it doesn t encounter a newline while reading the character it also sets std ios_base failbit when no character is read but it doesn t set std ios_base failbit if at least one character is read before end of file is reached

9593628
google-chrome	firefox
this works when using ie and google-chrome but does not work in firefox

9593645
rss	feed
in order to get the rss feed for a repository you first have to watch the repository you re interested in

9593645
rss	feed
now if you need to use an external rss reader or similar you should find a news feed link on the main github page that will take you to an aggregated rss feed of any and all interesting things happening in your watched repositories

9593716
mouseleave	mouseenter
what i am trying to do is to create a function where on mouseenter will flip the image and on mouseleave the image will flip back to original state

9593720
istream	getline
istream getline sets the streams failbit flag if the line is too long

9593747

pop-up	dialog
based on what you want to do with this i d imagine you could do something like pop-up a dialog as a system level alert which needs a password to make it go away

9593780
nsstring	nsdata	writetofile	nsdata
but the second problem in your code is that if your budget class is not a property list type nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects writetofile will not save it sucessfully

9593811
put	get
one way to get the url to stay as the one a user typed in instead of showing up as your subdomain is to put the whole site in a frame that loads your subdomain inside of it

9593813

name vectorposition type min max avg med ..

9593818

9593832
cos	sin
s and c are sin and cos values for an angle passed into the function as it is called

9593851
strdup	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strdup
if you cannot use strdup i would recommend the use of strncpy instead of strcpy

9593851
strcpy	malloc
so use strcpy or strncp with a pre-sized array or a malloc -ed pointer

9593861
mouseover	mouseenter
edit i apologize i mis-read your previous code i saw mouseenter when it is mouseover

9593861
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
did you consider using mouseenter and mouseleave rather than mouseover

9593861
google-chrome	safari
this page is functional in all modern browsers but is extra cool in webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari - you could mimic a similar behavior by having a basic hover and extending that for browsers that support it

9593864
punctuation	words
finally you iterate through the sentences of set 1 and in each sentence through the candidate starting positions of relevant tokens probably only words that follow white space or punctuation and search the suffix array of set 2 for them

9593919
for-loop	arrays
i then have a for-loop which is runs data from another arrays

9593929
inherited	subclassing
it is much easier to use child-parent relationship with inherited super and subclassing

9593929
super	extends
well you could say that when you import a package you are going to extends some of its classes and in this way it would be most super parent

9594035
button	checkbox
i am trying to click a checkbox that enables a purchase button to appear

9594057
onchange	onkeyup
just bind a listener to the onkeyup and onchange events for the that runs a function that creates the right kind of mailto link

9594074
post	get
this could be an artifact of me doing a get instead of a post of course

9594084
post	get
on a side note if i click on the submit button again after the first post and without refreshing the page i get this message

9594084
post	put
so not sure why my form is converting the method from post to put

9594096
bitblt	gdi
edit fixed i created a compatibledc for the graphics object and a handle for the bitmap using b.gethbitmap then used the selectobject function inside gdi to select those two and used the compatibledc instead of hdc in the bitblt function

9594125
hash	salt
this code is supposed to hash a password with a salt

9594125
hash	salt
the salt and hash password are being saved in the database

9594164
getter	setter
but once you declare them there it s not possible anymore to change the behavior getter and setter like you can when declaring in the class body

9594164
getter	setter
it seems confusing when you show people that they can easily create attributes by setting var or val in constructor and not care about getter and setter they can change if they need to ultimately find that in fact you should avoid using those kind of facilitations

9594192
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on current browser versions of google-chrome android 2.2+ and mobile safari but not displaying at all on blackberry versions 5 6 windows mobile mobile ie 7 and android browser 2.1

9594231
ravendb	couchdb
this is not something specific to ravendb as you can do those things with mongodb and couchdb as well so probably the most intrinsic difference among those databases is that raven gives you a very nice and easy .net experience and has out-of-the-box multi document transactions

9594245
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
as you need object i o just use an objectinputstream and objectoutputstream for everything

9594245
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you must construct the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream at both ends

9594245
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
use the same objectinputstream and objectoutputstream for the life of the socket at both ends

9594301
min	max
for the performance comparison i ve been using one of the built in jmeter listeners that show average min max response time and average bytes per each request

9594314
super	extends
there are extends and super keywords to define bounds for java generics

9594318
outputstream	inputstream
but what is all this copying from an inputstream to an outputstream after all data are already downloaded

9594332
udp	tcp
the server identifies client-a from the token and forwards the request to client-b over its tcp link including a s udp address port number in the request

9594332
udp	tcp
the server identifies client-b from the token and forwards the request to client-a over its tcp link including b s udp address port number in the request

9594332
udp	tcp
as you can see the server never talks on the udp links created by the clients for their requests only on the tcp links

9594356
strtol	atoi
your way could be extended to handle more than one digit but i think that what you re really looking for is atoi or the non-deprecated strtol

9594393
explode	substr
suggestion explode your string on the space character get the first and last values in the array by index then use substr to fetch the characters you require

9594443
explode	substr
the optional parameter indicates into how many pieces the string should be explode to and considering what you want to achieve along with substr

9594444
google-chrome	safari
this behavior only occurs in google-chrome and safari

9594444
google-chrome	safari
when i open an offline version on my computer using both google-chrome and safari it works fine

9594446
bufferedreader	objectinputstream

to get everything that is sent post to your apache server via your test.php file you can use

min	max
but you ended up doing too much with your max and min functions

9595423
min	max
again a misleading part was that assignment is that it suggested you write a custom routine for these functions even though max and min exist in python and return exactly what you need

9595423
min	max
its another story if you are required to write your own max and min and are not permitted to use the built in functions

9595423
min	max
that should hopefully be enough general information for you to piece together your custom min and max functions

9595423
min	max
while there are some more advanced and efficient ways to do min and max i think to start out a simple for-loop over the list would be easiest

9595457

9595937
udp	tcp
i was wondering if this is the best way and if it is whether udp or tcp would be better

9595937
udp	tcp
you usually resort to udp as a speed optimization when tcp is not fast enough and packet loss is inconvenient rather than when it can t be handled

9595948

there is some implied semantics in the choice of method in that get requests never modify server state and their results may be cached and reused which is what allows the browser to go back and forth between pages while post requests do change server state -- incidentally this is what you do when you upload a file

9603204
width	height
i think the viewpoint will handle the width and the content should handle the height of the page

9603221

i wrote the following implementation for firefox safari and google-chrome

9603337
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the solution must work in the newest version of firefox google-chrome ie and if possible opera and safari ordered by importance

i add a div element to the map that is of a certain width and height to contain the line and arrowhead

9603353
google-chrome	safari
if viewed in safari or google-chrome some very annoying and unexpected behavior occurs

9603353
google-chrome	safari
in safari the whole svg graphic disappears beyond a certain zoom level and in google-chrome the arrowheads at the end of the line disappear and re-appear at random zoom levels so it seems

9603353
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera this behavior is not happening and the arrowheads are visible at any zoom level

9603369
min	max
my main problem was the height of different characters so instead of using a font s ascent i used its outline s max and min y-coordinates to calculate its height

any ideas on how to get this post to work using a secure path as the action

9603519

it may actually make sense for you to create separate resources for status and dispatched with their own get post put delete behavior to represent the use case you are describing

9603536

an element can lose focus via keyboard commands such as the tab key or by mouse clicks elsewhere on the page.

3 your container has a fixed height by margin paddings or height for example and overflow hidden

9603655

a placeholder for the array size is not required since this is the normal way of declaring arrays

9603710
post	get
you can create a php script that is accessed via get and does the two post requests itself

9603723
filtering	grouping
i am trying to create a single ldap filtering that will find users with various attributes status create date etc who are also members of a particular grouping

9603723
filtering	grouping
normally the answer would be to filtering on the memberof attribute -- but unfortunately users in our directory do not have this attribute -- instead of members referring to their grouping only grouping refer to their members using uniquemember

9603723
filtering	grouping
relationally my instinct is to join the uniquemember attribute of the grouping to the dns we get from the other attribute filtering but my investigation has not shown that this is possible in ldap

9603740
width	height
the problem i ve run into is that once the iframe page is viewed the window.innerheight and window.innerwidth javascript objects change their values to match the iframe s width height which is causing the rest of the pages to display incorrectly as they are not the same size

9603758

hide	show
this will hide it when it needs to be hidden and show it when it needs to be show

9603934

9604030
width	height
what that means is that the width height which depend on the image that s currently loaded change async as well

9604030
width	height
so if you set .src and immediately read the width height you should get the old image dimensions per spec

9604044
serializable	deserialization
but you can always implement ixmlserializable and handle the serializable and deserialization by yourself

9604047
completionhandler	clgeocoder
you use the reversegeocodelocation completionhandler method on the clgeocoder class to do this

9604925
multiplication	modulo
with the multiplication i recommend using the modulo to determine which numbers divide evenly into the target number like

9604933
mouseleave	mouseenter
what you can do is add the mouseenter part to the li as you have it but put the mouseleave part on the entire ul

9604933

there are a number of traps which can occur if you extends thread which you don t get with implements runnable

9605424
range	min	range	max	min	max
you can do it in o max l a l b time where l a and l b are lengths of a and b respectively but at the price of using o m space where m is an allowed range of values in the arrays there are such constants min and max so that holds true for every a in a and b in b

but even if the vm can use 64-bit instructions which it should on a 64-bit vm depending on the cpu they may still be slower than their 32-bit counterparts add subtract will probably go in one clock but multiplying and divide in 64-bit are usually slower than in 32-bit

9607062
nfa	dfa
as i understand it a regular expression can be converted to an nfa which in some cases can be efficiently converted to a dfa

9607062
nfa	dfa
i realize that not all regular expression nfa s can be efficently transformed into dfa s especially when they were generate from perl regexps which are not truly regular in which case ideally the library would just return an error or some other indication that the conversion is not possible

9607068
ant	maven
does work for direct test calls via run as junit test not for commandline runs like ant or maven

9607083
tolower	toupper
note also that according to best practices for using strings in the .net framework you should be using toupper rather than tolower for your string comparisons but you should be using string.equals string string stringcomparison rather than converting the case yourself

9607088
int	boolean
i d prefer not to rewrite my boolean as int as that will cause several issues with existing code nonobvious hard to read hard to enforce etc.

9607494
post	put
store the entire contents of the post in content ie put it into the database

9607494

the content would then need to be sanitised before i tried to put it into the tuple and i m limited by size although it s unlikely that i d write a 4gb blog post

9607510
post	put	post	get	put	get
if you want you can use the get post put delete api methods that allows you to specify a url so you can call web services using your custom routes e.g

9607519
min	max
i would use two binary heaps a min and a max heap

9607519
min	max
in each one you store half the elements and that way you can access both max and min in o 1 time

9607519
min	max
the min heap would contain the half with the smallest elements and the max heap the half with the larger elements

9607621
int	chars
the first value corresponds an int the second value corresponds a date in the format dd mm yy and the third value is a chars

9607654

9607657
dictionary	map
why dictionary and not map

9607665

9608047
button	checkbox
i would like to check the checked status of each when clicking a command button and then write the checkbox caption to be used in an email or print out

9608059

9608071
put	get
you can also join the test table these results to get labels put onto each score and calculate a grade based on scores and weight

9608086
button	checkbox
a checkbox is only a single type of control and a button can t be cast into it so that is why you are getting casting issues

9608101
tcplistener	tcpclient
on the server side you re using tcplistener which is nothing more than a socket or tcpclient factory

9608132

if you get pack all the properties of a model on a post but not the id then how do you know which id to edit

9608597
put	get
i have put that bit of development on the back burner waiting for the browsers to get their act together

9608601
int	chars
it would take the int and generate a chars string from them

9608612
for-loop	arrays
then later i will want to run a for-loop for the arrays from my main activity using.length

9608653
getter	setter
a getter setter property exists for data on somebean managed bean eg

9608653
getter	setter
a getter setter property exists for column on the class type of datatable var record

9608653
getter	setter
a getter setter property exists for propertofcolumn on the class type of column

9608673
portrait	landscape
however when showing the second view and then rotating from landscape to portrait mode the second view is shifted partly to the right and a portion of the first view s right hand side is shown on the left side hence destroying the paging mode

9608685
post	get
redirecttoaction for example does not pass through the model binder so it is conceivable in this instance for you to create a new model in a post controller action and redirect to a get controller action passing along a sanitised model

9608698
put	get
the beauty of it is that if you have put validations inside pattern attribute of your inputs which i prefer to do rather than writing javascript snippets for every input field the form will get submitted only when each of the validations passes

9608700
width	height
i could also do the resizing first set width and height fields and then save but file at location self.banner.path doesn t exist before save is performed

9608735
firefox	safari
this works well in firefox and safari

9608742
width	height
i want this as background for my webpage but that doesn t seem to work untill i add 100 width and height to like so but that will mess up the rest of my page

9608778
getter	setter
it s saying sym.symptomlist is an unknown property because you do not have a public getter and setter for it and sym.symptom doesn t exist at all

9608778
getter	setter
create a public getter and setter for symptomlist and don t set the value of syptomlist in your getallsym method

9608779
goo.gl	bit.ly
my question is how to redirect url when it contains a + like goo.gl and bit.ly

9608862

9608862
vmware	esx
it s a virtual machine on a vmware esx cluster

9608885
lisp	scheme
emacs lisp is rather different from regular lisp so it s probably not directly useful for classes or self-study if your target is something like scheme or common lisp

9608895
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval causes the function to be called every 500ms settimeout will just call it once

9608897
hide	show
i am looking for a plugin that allows you to show three images at once but lets you hide half of the 1st and the 3rd image making the center image the focal at given point

children	parent
i have a cpview with some children cpimageview s cptextfield s etc and i would like to know if it s possible to take an screenshot of that parent view

9608973
gcov	gprof
however newer versions of gcc use the gcov tool instead of gprof to display line by line profiling information

9608979
mouseleave	mouseenter
so you will be going between having a one interval animation going slow when you mouseenter and two when you mouseleave fast

9609013
hide	show
if it s not being dynamically generated you re often better off inserting it in with the rest of the html and using css to hide show it when needed

9609015
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
personally i would just use powermockito along with mockito or easymock to mock the static securitycontextholder.getsecuritycontext in your unit integration test

9609032
google-chrome	safari
instead of alert data try console.log data assuming you re using firebug or the inspector google-chrome safari

9609060
superclass	subclassing
the biggest reason to have a unique context is to deal with the situation where a subclassing or superclass is also observing the same keypath

9609060
superclass	subclassing
however in the case of subclassing you need to pass on the observation to the superclass which is where this becomes important

9609076
scheme	racket	lisp	scheme	lisp	racket	r5rs	r6rs
if you were actually asking about scheme or could go for either scheme or common lisp take a look at racket not technically a scheme it actually has a lot of additional features but they do support r5rs and have a fairly short list of unsupported r6rs features

9609098
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could use the opacity property to implement the behavior you seek and furthermore use eventtriggers on mouseenter and mouseleave to be able to put a nice animation there

9609120
cpython	ironpython
ironpython v2.7.2 rc1 s modulefinder doesn t appear to work so the above script needs to be run using cpython

9609120
cpython	ironpython
it then uses cpython s modulefinder but against ironpython s customised runtime library

9609152
erd	diagram
i have a large erd diagram done in mysql workbench and i also have a large format printer

inherited	subclassing
i am trying to build a simple abstract cache class that can enforce methods in subclassing and i am trying to set up default settings for the subclassing to inherited

9609184
subclass	abstract-class
is this how you access properties in abstract-class while in a subclass

9609184
memcached	apc
e.g cache link cache tpl cache apc cache memcached

9609215
width	height
its width and height are both set to fill_parent

9609219
dictionary	map
to do this in a functional style you can use f# map which is an immutable dictionary

9609226
put	get
but i put this in my uiviewcontroller but it isn t get called

9609227
google-chrome	firefox
i m having trouble figuring out why inline elements ignore line-height in some browsers google-chrome and firefox ignore it but ie9 does not

9609227
margin	height
for replaced elements inline-block elements and inline-table elements this is the height of their margin box

9609246
for-loop	arrays
you can also go through the entire arrays with a for-loop

9609247
stdout	stderr
i m using 6 as the file descriptor because 0 1 2 are stdin stdout and stderr

9609263
put	get
well you can use a case statement with what you have and put whatever code you want in there though most of us would get upset if it was more than five statements.

9609280
width	height
its x y width height

9609285
rss	feed
try the source view of your rss feed and check if the videos are included

packets	pcap
i ve done another search on that and have found on wikipedia and see that it is the windows version of pcap which stands for packets capture

9609293
winpcap	wireshark
and according to wireshark s website whatever version of winpcap currently on my system is â œâ annoying bugs â â and version 4.1.2 of winpcap fixes them

9609326
folder	directory
i did an svn co of branch in the branch directory and an svn co of trunk in the trunk folder

9609327
opera	firefox
opera 11.61 ie9 and firefox 1.5.0.9

9609385
put	get
so i want to get the css from a particular element put it in json-array change element around later restore the css of the element from the stored array

9609405
packets	pcap
if you have other tools that require packets capturing they may use pcap

9609430
post	get
i have my weblog s single article page if i try to share this page with the facebook like button or with the old sharing bookmarklet i get no image on facebook post preview and of course i don t get any image on my facebook page too

9609436
width	text-align
this will make it shrink-wrap to its contents here the video and if content-unit has text-align center set on it then the inline-block framewrap will be centered at whatever width it turns out to be

9609436
width	text-align
now because its width is contrained to the widest content the iframe here an inline element the h4 can be set to text-align right and the text should be restricted to the right side of framewrap since the block h4 will still expand to 100 of whatever framewrap is

9609472
png	ico
this is the one and only case of ico files in the project so i was suspicious and switched it to png

9609477
apache	nginx
nginx wipes the floor with apache for anything over zero concurrent users

9609477
apache	nginx

9609485
opera	firefox
opera which was initially slugging in the way you describe for firefox

9609485
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave handling is delegated to the container and though this doesn t appear to be particularly important to performance on my hardware it should consume less memory

9609500
packets	multicast
i receive ticker data via udp each udp multicast packets has sequence number

9609505
width	height
use photoshop the parameters tell the position on the screen x and y the width and height of the frame so each image and the number of frames

9609541
width	height
you could try adding css width and height to it

9609571
google-chrome	firefox
android webview is just another render engine that render html contents downloaded from a http server much like google-chrome or firefox

9609591
cpu	affinity
if you really really wanted to do this and esnyder s suggestion of prioritising using nice levels is almost certainly a better solution for whatever you re really trying to achieve and you re happy to do it at the granularity of 1 number-of-cpus e.g on an 8 core system specify utilisation as a multiple of 12.5 of total cpu resource then you could use sched_setaffinity to set the cpu affinity mask for the process you want to control you can do this from another process

9609619
ordereddictionary	sorteddictionary
it might not be the most efficient way to do it but i ve used ordereddictionary though sorteddictionary is probably more appropriate for handling the out of order issue in the past

9609643
width	height
if i have my layout s width and height set to wrap_content it will take up about half the screen

9609647
button	checkbox
basically you can add a class to all your checkbox and radio button inputs

9609731
keydown	keyup

when distributing it on a samsung galaxy tablet the only non-apple tablet i have running android 3.2 it attempts to set the portrait height the dimensions of the landscape height and leaves whitespace below it

9610095
ant	maven
i think i reproduced this problem locally and ran ant with -d and i could see it try all the standard maven repos out there but not all terracotta artifacts are on maven central

9610189
put	get
adding a pass-through converter on a binding can sometimes help by allowing you to put a break point in the converter that will get pulled when ever there is a binding update

9610197
pull	push
this would have provided an attacker with clone pull access to repositories with read permissions and clone pull push access to repositories with write permissions

9610197
pull	push
until you have approved your ssh keys you will be unable to clone pull push your repositories over ssh

9610217
daemons	systemd

9610240
stdout	stderr
your input is nothing like that - a file descriptor is gained by calling the open syscall first or referring to one of the always-open files stdin stdout or stderr

9610292
doc	rtf
after that while you ll get away with saving straight text with an rtf extension or doc

9610318
glm	predict
i have a glm family binomial link logit model that i apply within a predict function seen below

9610360
getter	setter
the code seems to be crashing on the imagedisplay.animationimages line as if i create the uiimageview create its getter and setter and build it s fine until i uncomment that line

9610389
rtp	sip
stun will help that somewhat but you may need to limit your sip phones so that their rtp ports are unique so that traffic from one phone doesn t suddenly start showing up on another

9610389
rtp	sip
the port ranges for sip and rtp are ridiculously huge - you can limit your phones to say 10 per phone and cover a lot of ground with very little trouble

9610406
folder	directory
how do you get the last folder directory out of user-input regardless of if the input is a path to a folder or a file

9610415
hash	md5
you say you have some md5 hash passwords that you want to convert to crypt-style md5

9610415
hash	md5
unfortunately you likely can t do this from plain md5 hash values

9610415
hash	md5
apache s md5-crypt hash algorithm isn t an md5 sum of the password alone

9610415
hash	salt
the two append something to or otherwise modify the input password not including salt to give the resulting hash

9610415
hash	md5
if indeed you have the md5 hash values using the method you describe piping a string to md5sum that resulting hash cannot be reversed to anything you can then hash to an htpasswd compatible hash

9610416
width	height
i have a div that i want to go full-screen 100 width height of window size onclick of a button

9619488
allocator	stl
i ve read on a c++ optimization cookbook that the standard allocator for stl containers such as std list std set std multi_set std map e std multi_map can be replaced by a more performant block allocator

9619488
allocator	stl
i ve tried it with std map and found the seems to be faster indeed but my question is how can be the stl implementation be so slower than a specific allocator and what are the drawbacks of another allocator than the standard in terms of both portability and robustness

9619520

you should use a cluster scheduler like torque slurm or sge all are free foss

9619806
openmpi	mpich
per the mpich cluster setup doc it s just about exactly what you need for openmpi but there s no need to setup mpd at the end mpich has since deprecated mpd anyway

secondly the standard memory allocator is built on top of new delete which in turn is often built on top of malloc free

9619951
free	malloc
although i don t recall whether malloc free is guaranteed to be thread safe under all circumstances it usually is

9619951

get your javascript off the page and put it in a linked file

9619987
spine.js	backbone.js
for use with backbone.js or spine.js

9619998
int	chars
i suggest you print out the int value of each chars in the string as an int ideally in hex to find out exactly what you ve got.

9620018
google-chrome	firefox
i figured out the upload is broken in firefox and google-chrome but works in ie8 and ie9

9620027

but when i try to recuperate an image from this rss feed i catch a nullreferenceexception.

9620097
google-chrome	firefox
seeing this in google-chrome and firefox on lubuntu

9620106
box-shadow	border-box
an outer box-shadow casts a shadow as if the border-box of the element

9620120
getter	setter
you have a problem because hibernate is lazy fetching referenced objects when userinfo object is created by hibernate favdb is not pointing to an actual dbschema object but to a hibernate-generated proxy this is actually implemented via getter setter not the field itself

9620126
bash	subshell
however a subshell does not inherit traps so the canonical example for saving and restoring traps fails in bash

9620172
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
similarly objectinputstream when we create it new objectinputstream in tries to read the same header from the corresponding objectoutputstream at the server side

9620172
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the objectinputstream created blocks when trying to read the stream header which will not come since there is no corresponding objectoutputstream at server which will write the header to the client

9620172
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the objectoutputstream and the objectinputstream created at the client and server sides must align with each other

9620178
width	height
in a nutshell the pixelspacing attribute 0028 0030 gives you the voxel width and height

9620209
stdout	fflush
i found the solution python s print doesn t fflush stdout and waits for a certain amount of data before actually pushing the data to the stdout

9620223
width	height
i have a div that i want to go full-screen 100 width height of window size onclick of a seperate button image or link

9620240
hide	show
you can hide it in the sense show here so that child func1 will be called instead of parent func1 in code that knows it s looking at a child instance

9620260
maven	cargo
another approach would be turning your plugin in form of a container for cargo maven plugin in similar manner that i did with osgi framework the cargo project is aimed for testing against javaee containers but that wasn t a problem for me

9620262
cos	sqrt
because i don t have cos and sqrt functions

9620278
try-catch	exception-handling
the problem is that i think the exception-handling block is being triggered because when i remove the try-catch i get a server error 500 message

9620284
udp	tcp
network data in tcp udp packets maybe even on the ip level but i m not sure about that

9620306
maven	m2e
first of all you need the m2e eclipse plugin which is needed to have eclipse automatically recognize and update maven dependencies

9620306
maven	pom.xml
however this new eclipse based maven integration is now aware of the fact that there are many maven plugins used within pom.xml files and that only certain goals of certain plug-ins make sense within an ide environment

9620306
maven	m2e
m2e has a long list of special connectors that allow it to do the right thing when invoking various mojos maven plugin goals

9620306
maven	m2e
however this requires the correct version of the m2e maven import wizard which indigo does not have until sr2

9620346
width	height
you can use this functions to get the width and height

9620347
getter	setter
this other class library would dynamically create getter and setter based on a predefined function name template a member function _ get _xxx would yield a getter for xxx

9620347
getter	setter
this works great and it creates the getter and setter properly

9620347
getter	setter
these dynamic getter setter are not propagated to the child class

9620347
getter	setter
in the log for foo i can see the getter and setter for bar

9620347
getter	setter
in the log for baz i can see the getter and setter for quux but i d also like to see the getter and setter from the parent

9620358
post	get
when the user selects a news the popup should do an ajax post request to get the news id and close itself

9620391
floor	sqrt
obviously only primes floor sqrt candidate need be tested for a particular candidate value

9620393
getter	setter
i ve narrowed it down to the a file that i m including in my site this file is a php class that has a number of different functions like login getter and setter and so on

9620402
pull	push
so in order to get subtree push working in a pull situation the original repolib remote repo must be added and fetched to get d76a03f0ec7e2 exsited to produce a branch that have a common accesstor with the original repolib

9620437
int	chars
what s the fastest way to convert a string represented by const chars size_t to an int

9620455
put	get
i put together a quick jsfiddle page but i haven t been able to get it to work though i do see the round element with the same code without jsfiddle

9620459
opera	firefox
you can use to get their browser and parse the value to determine the actual agent ie firefox opera etc. then save that information back to the database

9620469
ubuntu	linux
i have not solved this problem but worked around it by switching to using the ndk on ubuntu linux

9620498
put	get
if i remove the wp function i get no server error the page outputs echos i put at the end

9620499
mouse	keyboard
you can assign it to any keyboard combo or mouse movement.

9620506
next	except
so if you click on a link it will behave like a web browser except you don t have any controls like go to previous go to next or refresh.

9620514
int	boolean
i establish the connection by calling wifimanager.enablenetwork int netid boolean disableothers with setting disableothers to true which seems necessary to reliably establish the connection

9620521
mouse	keyboard
you can then set these to true false depending on what mouse or keyboard event takes place and your game class then read these variables like so

9620524
swing	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swt	windowbuilder
for desktop apps swing or eclipse swt there s windowbuilder

9620544
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the connection is being used to move objects back and forth using objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

9620584
pull	push
i have a git repo on my server that i can push pull through ssh just fine like

9620585

9620594
margin	text-indent
i ve read a bunch of solutions and tried setting margin and padding to zero using text-indent list-style but nothing works

9620603
ant	maven
compile at compile deployment time - if you have a build step where you run an ant or maven build a lot of this work has been done thanks to projects like asual s less css jar and the official less-rhino js file that is not updated often enough

9620620
maven	pom.xml
i have read here about unit testing with the surefire plugin and integration testing with the failsafe plugin but i am still unclear about how the poms should look in a maven project that consists of a parent and multiple child modules each with their own pom.xml file

9620693
width	height
you ll want a fixed position element at 100 width and height if you don t have a background color or image you ll be able to click through it

9620697
email	dkim
i have noticed that a number of email i get have a dkim header

9620697
email	dkim
is there any reason to have an email backed by both dkim and domainkeys or is one or the other sufficient

9620697
email	dkim
if using both of these on each email is overkill assuming you have domainkeys already working is there any benefit to replacing it with dkim

9620754
lua	scheme
prior art python icon lua scheme smalltalk

9620768
children	parent
for example let s say i have a car parent entity and that i have children entities coupe sedan minivan and so on and i want a list of cars given a property that is common to all and therefore in the entity and it its table car

9620812
vim	sublimetext
i am a vim user who is moving to sublimetext and using vintage mode

9620841
oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	recreate
i understand that when the orientation of the screen changes the current activities ondestroy is called followed by the oncreate to effectively recreate the activity

9620868
hide	show
i use it to hide al .groupo elementes and show an specific element

9620869
getter	setter
the following things have been omitted constructors getter and setter column annotations basic annotations table annotations imports and package declarations

9620902
iboutlet	ibaction
just make sure that when you are adding iboutlet ibaction put them on the top level of your app delegate controller so that interface builder can find them

9620906
post	get
especially for get requests though post requests would be nice too -- and seeing what was posted as well

9620921
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working in firefox and google-chrome but doesn t work on ie

9620943
margin	border-box	box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box so that the 50 then applies to the inner+padding+border but sadly no setting to add the margin

9620961
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately if you try to run this example using firefox you see a gray rectangle instead in google-chrome everything works well.how can i resolve this issue

9620972
hide	show
emulation will show you your software is functionally working but it may hide timing bugs it you have time critical code

9620989
google-chrome	firefox
it works on in firefox or google-chrome

9620999
factors	matrix
you can set the contrasts to be whatever you want by creating the matrix you want to use and setting it either to the contrasts argument of lm or setting the default contrast of the factors itself

9621034
margin	text-align
use css attributes margin padding and text-align for this

9621038
width	margin
a clean work can be made by making the two floating divs with 0 margin and 0 border just width at 50

9621038
put	get
as alternative you can keep everything dynamic so put something like margin 1 you ll get a nice behavior in window resizing

9621069
width	height
declare a 2d array based on the number of canvas height and width in pixels

9621165
winpcap	pcap.net
you could use pcap.net which is a wrapper for winpcap pcap.net

9621178
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie 9+ firefox 2+ google-chrome safari 3+ opera 9+ and android 2.1+

9621181
tlistview	tdbgrid
a recent question i asked here showed that in later delphi versions 2010 xe xe2 you also sometimes need to call canvas.refresh for both tdbgrid and tlistview when changing canvas properties in ownerdraw events but that doesn t apply to delphi 7

9621245
getter	setter
protecting and proxying direct access to these properties won t work when you extend the object because the setter getter - accessing the properties on the new object - won t go to the parent prototype object where you are listening

9621245
getter	setter
when you set the new class up look for the functions being present all the way up the prototype chain from the new params object and if a match is found you should apply the setter getter to the new object as well

9621245
getter	setter
i d say probably after you should be able to check if the getter setter have become available and attach your listeners

9621302
outputstream	inputstream
you can compile it to a file by using jaspercompilemanager.compilereporttostream inputstream outputstream

9621314
google-chrome	safari
is only supported in webkit-based browsers right now google-chrome and safari

9621314
opera	firefox
it s non-standard so it s hard to say if the text attribute will ever become supported in the other browsers firefox opera and internet explorer

9621470
ant	maven
basically you add minor configuration to your ant or maven setup before compiling and before running tests and then run your coverage as usual

9621522
maven	pom.xml
why not just created a standard maven project with just a single pom.xml

9621573
hide	show
upon clicking on a tab it will hide the current one show the new one then set the new one as the current one

9621608
int	double
but if the attributes are different types string int double etc this will require making the map of type object and casting all the values when you use them a lot more work for you

9621616
folder	directory
let s say my repo is inside my public_html folder in my server if i create it using git init --bare i d just be able to push my local .git folder so i won t have access to my working directory files and if i create a regular repo with git init i get a warning everytime i try to push saying that i shouldn t be pushing to non-bare repos

9621634
profiling	debugging
after debugging all the accesscontrolexceptions and adding the necessary permissions to the .. profiling was70profile1 config cells amscnt0009node01cell applications app.ear deployments app meta-inf was.policy and .. profiling was70profile1 installedapps amscnt0009node01cell app.ear meta-inf was.policy i end up with one accesscontrolexception that doesn t seem to disappear in any way java.io.filepermission c program files ibm sdp runtimes base_v7 profiling was70profile1 installedapps amscnt0009node01cell app.ear appaxis2-3.5.2.war web-inf scriptservices read

button	checkbox
so i did that and it works when i check or uncheck the checkbox the button enables or disables itself correctly

9621675
pull	push
3 use a hook in the bare repo to execute a git pull in the real location after the push is completed

9621721
nofollow	noindex
by this way you won t have to change any noindex or nofollow metas

9621721
nofollow	noindex
it is a better way to prevent from spam than changing noindex and nofollow metas

9621767
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
here is a non-framework solution demo 1 that works in ie9 firefox and google-chrome safari using element.addeventlistener

9621779
nofollow	noindex
this is the principle behind unlisted videos on youtube and other sites - an obscure randomly-generated string that s blocked from search via noindex and nofollow

9621799
hide	show
for visibilty with show or hide based on an expression selected visible is false and hidden is true

9621893
hex	binary
i m having some problems reading a binary file and converting it s bytes to hex representation

9621906
getter	setter
those codes would be much more than the field declaration and getter setter if you have them

9621907
folder	directory
i have a local git repository and all i want to do is copy all of the files from a particular revision to a folder outside of the working directory

9621922
fadein	fadeout
in fadeout once you have detected the alpha is 0 and remove the event listener just add another listener for the fadein function

9621932
width	height
and yes your overlay should have absolute positioning so that you place it at the top-right corner of the parent container and give it 100 width and height so that it covers the entire parent container

9621956
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and ie all ignore the media query

9621956
google-chrome	safari
i just can t get the google-chrome safari and ie on my desktop to read the dang thing

9621968
folder	directory
the script starts the service which unpacks the files and folder in the webapps directory

9621968
folder	directory
however i need to wait until the folder has been unpacked so that the directory exists before i can add the images to it what command or commands could i used to make this happen apart from just waiting an arbitrary long enough time

9622004
matplotlib	scipy
i have used pip successfully to install numpy scipy and matplotlib and they work well with python2.7 but in python3 typing import numpy brings up no module named numpy

9622057
ssl	https
i m trying to configure my oc4j standalone version 10.1.3 to use https ssl

9622069
rss	feed
how to fetch rss feed from another site and show according to month wise week wise.

9622077
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am assuming that you have a one-to-many relationship between projects and userprojects seems like userproject might be a bridge table in a many-to-many relationship between projects and users

9622098
pop-up	dialog
you can either open a modal dialog pop-up window if you were to hide granular details of your data in gridview

9622108
google-chrome	firefox
i have a script that calls the server via .ajax with jquery and it works well on google-chrome or firefox but not in ie 8

9622113
ubuntu	linux
i m doing the developing on linux ubuntu and the libraries i use are all c

9622131
squash	branch
this git command would squash all my changes on my branch into a single commit on top of master

9622171
getter	setter
as skaffman alluded to it might be better to not allow direct access to the bookids list at all remove the getter and setter

9622191
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian installing ivy also involves manually adding it to

9622198
button	checkbox
you can then place a checkbox list radio button list inside a template field bind that with your answers dataset

i am following railsspace book but when i trying edit show and eliminate a post owner chapter 15 i get error message

9622251
post	put
in this view i has triying put in the variable post post but it not work

9622260
keylistener	jmenuitem
adding something to the arraylist now has an own jmenuitem with its accelerator set to the keystroke 1 and an actionlistener which performs the same stuff than the keylistener before

9622294
apache	nginx
there is a performance hit on a in having to manage this as apache unlike nginx say isn t really optimised for this task but sometimes the flexibility to do this is useful

9622317
post	put
so i think you should also specify the place page id of the location associated with the post in order to put tags

9622357
width	height
i would to get it height and width in mm

9622394
width	height
if you have fixed width height you can easily translate the point in the center to be actually the center of the wrapper div by giving negative margin-left and margin-top therefore with the help of some extremely easy basic math their values will be - width 2 and - height 2

9622417
post	get
i think you need to add a get for post index although i would really look to try and use restful routing which would clean up much of your routes

9622435
apache	nginx
if you re worried about the speed of apache you might want to consider nginx

9622435
versioning	upgrade
as a result both have received many many security updates since the versioning you mention and you would be wise to upgrade asap

9622480
google-chrome	firefox
the code that works with ie6 ie7 ie8 ie9 and firefox google-chrome etc

9622494

9638318
getter	setter
i have been reading about getter and setter and i have a question

9638318
getter	setter
are getter and setter supposed to be used when accessing the variables in the class that declared the variables

9638318
getter	setter
it seems like there is no need for getter and setter here because it doesnt matter that the variable is private the class that declared it will always have access to it...

9638318
getter	setter
or are getter and setter only supposed to be used when external classes want to access these variables

9638358
getter	setter
while the language doesn t require you to do so it is good practice to use getter and setter when accessing private fields that are exposed through getter and setter

9638358
accessor	properties	getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
an example of a change might be a class that exposes through getter accessor setter mutators methods a certain properties that is initially stored as a private field in that class

9638358
accessor	properties
at that point if you ve only used the methods to access and modify the properties you can simply change the code of the accessor and mutator methods to implement the change

9638379
subclass	accessor	getter	setter
if the getter or setter is not final and if it is intended to be overridden in potential subclasses it might make sense to call it even from the class itself in order to avoid bypassing the additional behavior added by the subclass to the accessor

9638413
accessor	properties
there are plenty of examples where you wouldn t want to access the variable using the properties from inside the class but not let an external entity access that variable without going through your properties accessor

9638478
equals	gethashcode
in other words if your itemssource is bound to a collection of object1 object2 object3 you cannot set the selecteditem to if you do this you must override the equals and gethashcode methods

9638485
getter	setter
for exapmle if you are doing java programming in the android environment direct access is encouraged over getter setter

9638485
getter	setter
in other environments the getter setter may be encouraged for maintainability

9638485
getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter

9638514
agile	metrics
since software development is a creative process such rigid metrics in a highly flexible methodology such as agile is irrelevant

9638531

9639258
imperative	declarative
trying to implement a for next loop in prolog is a strong indication that you are thinking in terms of imperative programming where you tell the computer what to do rather than in terms of declarative programming where you describe the solution and let prolog s inference engine figure it out

how could i alter my code to allow the post method to be used instead of get

9651759
post	get
i would strongly recommend using post rather than get as get requests are assumed not to change any data

9651783
int	chars
so what happens is reading from the right 1 - -1 - long -1 - int -1 - - chars 1 - byte 1 which then gets cast to an int during the assignment

9651889
textmate	sublimetext
sublimetext uses the same format for syntax coloring themes as textmate .tmtheme format

9651925

switching	screens
i can do it quite easily with plain old signals see commented out code but i figure that i could probably do some fancy animation upon switching screens using transitions

9651980
affinity	processors
or setting processors affinity

9652027
cpu	affinity
i can t give you a good use case for this heat map except that it looks super awesome but i can tell you a sad story about how we used cpu affinity to fix something

9652027
cpu	affinity
after a while of troubleshooting and desperation we tried setting word process affinity to just one cpu to reduce concurrency and hence reduce the likelihood of race conditions

9652028
post	get
so the post data would be of the same format as a get request with name value pairs

9652030
stateless	stateful
that answer is talking about injecting a stateful in a stateless which is indeed an extremely bad idea

9652030
stateless	stateful
see also this related answer access existing instance stateful inside stateless java ee 6

9652038
min	max	minimum	max
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

9652038
min	max
omitting both the comma and max tells the engine to repeat the token exactly min times

9652039
range	min	range	max	min	max
you can also specify a min max range instead of forcing a specific legnth

9652039
min	max
so if you wanted a min of 4 and a max of 8 the example would change to

9652048
h.264	hevc
mpeg and vceg have established a joint collaborative team on video coding jct-vc to develop the hevc standard. 1 hevc is said to improve video quality and double the data compression ratio compared to h.264 and scales up to 7680 ã 4320 pixels resolution

9652146
internationalization	translation

rubygems	bundler	rubygems	rvm	rvm	bundler
gems can be installed outside of bundler by rubygems gem install gem_name but it s best to use rvm which allows you to install separate versions of ruby and manage individual gemsets for each application as explained in the rvm best practices

9652192
inherited	subclassing
i think the rationale for this claim is that in many situations subclassing doesn t often change the behavior of the existing inherited fields but rather one adds fields and adds new methods that manipulate the new fields

9652223
getter	setter
however getter setter are evil

9652223
getter	setter
getter and setter are an important part of oop from my experience

disk	ram
in any scenario you can specify how often to drop dirty blocks back to the hard disk drive making writes like on the ram drive but the mirror scenario also makes reads like from the ram drive

9652984
folder	directory
when dlls in prism modules are referenced the .net assembly resolution mechanism looks for the referenced assemblies in the bin folder of the hosting application the one with the shell and bootstrapper rather than in the module s bin directory assuming you have set up your modules as separate projects in the solution as i have

9652984
folder	directory
the dll is in fact being copied to the bin directory of the module but some quirk of the way assembly resolution works with prism applications means that the app never checks for assemblies in that folder

it works fine in firefox but it fails in google-chrome

9653694

all you have to do is replace the method used by a request with put and it will use the put method of orders and use a regular get on orders and it will use the get method

9653694

9653751
cstdio	iostream
i just learned of the existence of the ios_base sync_with_stdio function which basically allows you to turn off or on if you already turned it off the synchronization between iostream streams that are used in c++ and the cstdio streams that are part of standard c

9653751
stdout	stderr
now i always thought that stdout stderr and stdin in c were essentially wrapped in a set of objects in c++ in the iostreams classes

9653767
int	chars
typically in the x86 architecture the value is returned in eax register if it is an integral type chars int or pointer

9653792

actually the stdout stderr and stdin are the file handlers of os

9653822
hide	show
when using one pair of #...... ....... in the source code to show hide then everything works just fine

9653822

when adding just one more pair show hide it gives me an error

9653826
equals	gethashcode
the results of gethashcode can change between runs - all that s guaranteed is that calling it on two equals objects in the same process possibly appdomain will give the same hash code

9653835
stdout	stderr
once stdin stdout and stderr are redirected standard c functions such as printf and gets can be used without change to communicate with the win32 console

9653835
stdout	stderr	cout	cin
since cin cout cerr and clog are closely tied to câ s stdin stdout and stderr you would expect them to behave similarly

9653903
awt	swing
as a sidenote i would like add that it would be nice to add such an event directly to the treenode s as i would do in standard swing awt dev by adding a controllistener to a button

stdout	stderr	cout	cin
the catch are the standard c streams stdin stdout stderr and their c++ narrow character counterparts std cin std cout std cerr std clog and c++ wide character counterparts std wcin std wcout std wcerr std wclog respectively what happens when a user reads both from stdin and std cin

9654191
cout	cin
as a result there are special rules on the standard c++ stream objects std cin std cout std cerr and std clog and their wide character counterparts which mandate that they synchronize with their respective counterpart

9654477
post	put	post	get	put	get
the real question is do you use the http verbs delete put post get as part of your api or you are simply exposing methods that are equivalent to your soap methods

9654482
getter	setter
assuming you the field name corresponds to a getter setter methods perhaps you could use the getdeclaredmethods find out the correct method and use it

9654489
put	get
however you may be better off setting up a second virtualhost so you can put your entire public site into holding using something like to get the 503 http status code but still use the wordpress admin and site yourself through a different hostname

google-chrome	safari
it happens only using tinymce and only google-chrome and safari other browsers display it well

9654726
mouse	keyboard
however i run into problems when attempting to test a user interface - my first instinct is for junit to create a robot that object that crontols the mouse and the keyboard to mimic a human working though a test - but that feels both inelegant and not very resilient to change

the default modifier just don t write public private protected gives access from inside the package only

you may have some luck with monodroid but i assume you will have lots of trouble getting an application written for desktop screen size with mouse and keyboard running on an android device

9655061
put	get
means that you always create a new threadlocal call get immediately and put the result not the threadlocal into a map

it it can be altered in a single cycle a boolean or int than you can never know whether the thread you are in is the one that changed it last or another one did which will lead to unpredictable results in most cases

9655160
nunit	mstest
it makes visual studio to see nunit test as mstest

9655190

there is a msdn article on this return values of jscript and vbscript custom actions

9655522
width	height
moreover the way you are hardcoding the width and height with pixels in not a good practice at all

9655522
width	height
if you have to set width and height use dp sp which are mentioned here again refrain from hard coding width n height and switch to relative layout which will help buttons and other elements to better align with each other

9655534

use bitmapfactory.decoderesource to obtain a bitmap object of the resource and then from the bitmap you can easily retrieve the image width height with getheight and getwidth

9655683
implements	extends
i think it would be better to implements the insert method in the document class and override it with an appropriate methods in the classes that extends it

9655694
width	height
the following snippet will resize an image to the specified width automatically calculating the height in order to keep the proportion

9655704

9656450
uitableview	nsindexpath
in order to do so i have created an nsindexpath instance which i am passing to the uitableview s method

9656450

free	malloc
this works nine out of ten times but sometimes it gives a segmentation fault at free tmp it gives a segfault at malloc or it prints

9656604
width	height
edit i sort of overlooked that you don t even need less at all or the height and width in styles.game.css

9656627
free	malloc
since your tmp buffer is temporary i would rather use a stack-based buffer using the maximum space that your convoluted sizeof tries to allocate as a bonus this will be faster than malloc free

9656665
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
aligned_alloc calloc malloc and realloc

9656676

hash	md5
the service that i am sending it to requires that it be an md5 hash of the byte array of the string in utf16le

9656805
hash	md5
basically if i have mystring that needs to be put into a utf16le byte array and then that array needs to be md5 hash

9656827
google-chrome	firefox
if you open the fullscreen mode in firefox and resize it to width less than 546px you will see there is no scrollbar but it is in google-chrome or ie

9656854
post	get
you use post instead of get

9656858
width	height
as long as the grid s height and width make it square the resultant items will be the appropriate proportions

9656858
width	height
you could also set the height of each rowdefinition and the width of each columndefinition to the same arbitrary value and get it proportional

9656926
width	height
the only way i found to be sure that the view is in landscape mode is to test that the view height is less than the view width

9656946
hide	show
you can certainly add multiple subreports and use conditional formulae to show hide each subreport

9656971
folder	directory
-type f -print0 will recursively search all the folder and files from your current directory downwards

getter	setter
in your pq class define getter and setter to manipulate fields of your objects safely conforming to the principle of encapsulation

9657053
getter	setter
these are the two classes i have defined each class contains the respective getter and setter

9657060

the short version i drag out a view from the palette and drop it onto the view controller it automatically fills the entire view controller and trying to move or resize it in any way has no impact

9657064
int	chars
types bool chars wchar_t and the signed and unsigned int types are collectively called integral types.43 a synonym for integral type is int type

9657067
int	chars

its always a good idea to use ceil or floor based on what you want when using float number as int

9657237
accessor	properties
that statement creates the accessor methods for the personname properties

9657237
accessor	properties
the main concern with using the properties accessor in -dealloc is that it can cause problems if your class is subclassed and the accessor are overridden

9657242
integer	unsigned
it s a very big integer which is out of the range of unsigned bigint on mysql

9657258
oncreate	ondestroy
each activity has own lifetime cycle from oncreate to ondestroy

9657264
rdf	owl
alternatively is there an rdf vocabulary or owl ontology which could be useful in such domain

for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead as it will allow you to initialize the increment and adjust it each loops on the same line

9657379
implements	extends
you ll have to implements your own adapter you could extends a simplecursoradapter because you have a cursor with data

9657383
dictionary	map
i am creating a json string with a key of object or dictionary map

9657390
express	node.js
instead of comparing backend servers i think the real future of doing amazing things is in front-end javascript frameworks like backbone.js that use express rails node.js on the backend

9657390
express	node.js
node.js and express aren t putting as much effort to coordinate with frontend javascript mvcs as the rails community is

width	margin
the way i would do it is to set a minimum width on the container and content divs with a left margin on the content div that allows it to slide next to the nav div

9657433
width	margin
the left margin plus the minimum width should equal the minimum width of the container

width	height
set your repeating background in this second div and ensure than the height and width are 100

9657647
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
after a bit of reading it would seem that sortedlist or sorteddictionary is what you need

9657647
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist appears to use less memory and is technically a binary tree where sorteddictionary is faster with unsorted data

9657694
oncreate	setcontentview
or write in oncreate yours activity before setcontentview

9664407
int	chars
each of these int elements would be broken into sub-fields that contain a length and an offset that points into a separate backing array of type chars

9664407
int	chars
if you have no more than 16777216 chars of underlying string data 120 000 strings times an average length of 10 chars 1.2 million chars you can take the low-order 24 bits of each int and store the starting offset of each string into your backing array of chars data and take the high-order 8 bits of each int and store the size of the corresponding string there

9664407
int	chars
your chars data will have your erstwhile strings crammed together without any delimiters relying entirely upon the int array to know where each string starts and ends

9664407
int	chars
the words in the arrays would be sorted alphabetically and your lookup process could be a simple binary search on the int array retrieving the corresponding words from the chars array for each test which should be very efficient

nsstring	nsdata
if you want to save objects instanced from nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary you can use nsuserdefaults

9665996
put	get
i have an assignment at school to build a webserver that handles get head put requests via browser and telnet i have a working server handling get head and telnet requests but i cant find out how a put request works looks

9666007
folder	directory
so here is the idea we thought of storing all user and application settings in the application folder and install by simply copying and pasting the necessary files to the right directory

9666077
folder	directory
for this you may copy your already created database file in assets or raw folder and load it by copying it in a cache directory

9666090
pdcurses	ncurses
i just want to ask on how could i install the cdk library for pdcurses since it was originally for ncurses

usually i d put this in two separate uls and use text align center on the li but i can t get to the html

you can turn .hg patches into a repository and push pull patches around between repositories but it s difficult to do that if you re more than a single developer

9666323
width	height
some images take a while to load and thus have no width or height yet

9666340
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
an example is the implementation of on in the ie-version that uses attachevent which is ie-only maybe also opera and so wouldn t work on firefox safari etc

9666406
int	boolean
at a guess i d say your issue lies in the fact your int to boolean code is incorrect

9666413
int	double
your x range however involves a multiplication of 1.0 and 38 one being an int value and the other being determined as a float or double number

9666475
hide	show
if that s a must be condition then you can simply show hide the upload controls html input type file one by one

9666476
maven	pom.xml
to use jaxb api implementation i given the following dependency in pom.xml i am using maven project in eclipse

9666494

9666505
versioning	upgrade
so upgrade your php versioning and you should be good to go.

9666527
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i have tried putting the content property on the .productname class directly as a copy placeholder and firefox opera and safari will read this but you guessed it ie returns undefined

9666529
min	max
this function should check of a series of integers that there are four they are all different and that the min is 3 less than the max - thus that there are four in a row

9666557
filtering	grouping
essentially its filtering the results based on date ranges and then grouping the results like this

9666627
draggable	droppable
multiple sortable draggable droppable integration can be a nightmare indeed

9666637
google-chrome	firefox
its all right in firefox and google-chrome

9666690
opensuse	linux
on an opensuse linux machine i want to run a script when the machine is booted

spaces	delimiter
also the entire command can be put on one line with spaces as path delimiter

9666740
width	height
with the width and height you want

9666747
maven	pom.xml
this doesn t make any sense since unresolved pom.xml files in the maven repository could and will ensure that other build change for one build to another

9666748
firefox	safari
the problem is that there is nothing in the result in safari whereas its works fine in firefox and chrome.

9666759
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
open in opera and to compare in google-chrome or firefox ie

9666780
kde	gnome
in order to have it loaded by default in gnome and kde programs not difficult to do just set your input method based on locale association

9666787
int	double
if expecting numeric int double float etc leave as that type too or other date time etc

9666794
hide	show
very dirty solution keep a status variable from 0 to 2 included and increment for each tick then show hide each image with that

9666795
button	checkbox
i am working on a project and when the submit button is pressed create either a person or an employee based on the above checkbox

9666795
button	checkbox
when it is asking when the submit button is pressed create a person or an employee based on the above checkbox.would i use what is above the checkbox or below

9666799
firefox	safari
and that seems to work fine in safari firefox at least but as a solution it seems kind of rough messy unlikely to be supported in all browsers

9666815
prawn	pdfkit
use pdfkit or prawn instead

9666824
maven	m2e
m2e is the plugin you need to get for eclipse you can then right click your project and go to configure convert to maven project

9666824
jar	war
once this is done look in the pom file it generates for you and select your output to war i think by default it might be jar

9666870
switching	screens
our page is reasonably fluid - but i need to switching logo s footer graphics for smaller screens - so i inject a stylesheet for smaller versions - seems to work fine in general some phones htc wildfire seem to think they are 320px width when they are only 240 so i m struggling

9666877
portrait	landscape
this should not be possible how can i allow youtube to be in landscape but force the app to stay in portrait mode

9667024
int	chars
it works as usual you allocate - you free it up for int chars and multimaps it is up to them to free memory they have allocated

9667030
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
include avfoundation and audiotoolbox frameworks

9667037
converter	multibinding
you can easily bind to multiple properties by using a multibinding in conjunction with a converter that implements imultivalueconverter

9667045
width	height
if you have those image server side you could assign height and width attributes to those tags and use them to determine the real size of your container a bit faster

9667045
width	height
should i specify height and width attributes for my imgs in html

9667120
google-chrome	firefox
this plugin works fine in firefox but when i click on the same link on the same page in google-chrome it just opens it up as a standard page

9667146
google-chrome	firefox
so two fixes but if i use either they will either break the design in google-chrome or in firefox instead

9667188
migrate	upgrade
upgrade from php 5.2 to 5.3 is easy and native when applications encoded and open source were properly migrate

9667227
wan	lan
as computer a s request packet leaves the router the router actually re-writes lan ip 192.168.1.101 to the router s wan ip of 128.120.196.204

9669054
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
your approach for the mouseout rather use this than mouseleave - same goes for mouseover instead of mouseenter is ok just do the same thing with a different event although you could also use hover which will allow you to bind the functions for mouseover and mouseout in a single call

9669058
submit	submission
so i should handle web form submit for credentials and then also handle another web form data and submission as well as do some minor parsing from resulting pages

9669065

i thought the table-layout property might do the trick but while setting table-layout fixed in google-chrome does make all the columns appear there is no way or at least i don t see one to do the opposite in firefox

if you want to make one view look like it is part of another view place the two as siblings either directly in the cell.contentview as amit noted or if you want clipping so that the label looked like it was being clipped by the image create a uiview container enable the clip subviews setting of that view and place the uiimageview and uilabel as siblings within that container uiview

9669813
centos	linux
i have two linux centos 6.0 machine over here and i need some testing to be done

9669815

the only drawback is that you have to specify a width and height of the element

9669815
width	height
the outter container is required to cover the width and height of the page

9669815
width	height
it still covers 100 of the page s width and height but anything placed inside it will be centred both vertically and horizontally

9669820
grass	proj
my test proj works like this i have n vbo s which are modeling blades of grass

9669869

9670100
maven	cargo
denis s suggestion to create custom builder is probably best solution if you want to continue using pure maven cargo approach with eclipse

9670100
maven	cargo
fwiw i don t think maven tomcat cargo plugins are ideal for real-time web development especially on the frontend side of things

9670100
maven	m2e
use m2e to integrate maven with eclipse

9670100
folder	directory
use maven to do clean builds and generate exploded war directory in target folder

9670100
folder	directory
i think the same setup could be used without jrebel for non-java files only by configuring the web source folder as source folder in eclipse with custom target output path being the corresponding directory in the exploded war directory

9670126
portrait	landscape
setting this information will make the system look for default.jpg and all its variations portrait landscape 2x etc instead of .png

note 6 true in google-chrome firefox safari and opera on os x several linux

9670148
disk	ram
due to the radical difference between disk and ram speeds this could result in a huge performance penalty

9670150

i am trying to add multiple children to a parent

9670158
maven	pom.xml
is there any way i can update the parent pom.xml either via maven or jenkins file if a new version of portofino-war is built

min	max
the major reason for this is that one pre-aggregates data in operations which are easy to combine upwards mainly + - mean std max min and some more

9670186
icmp	snmp
it is typical for an snmp ping to be equivalent to an icmp echo

9670187
width	height
your custom panel should have x and y attached dependency properties like canvas does only that methods should use either relative coordinates 0 to 1 instead of 0 to width and 0 to height or divide by original path width and height to normalize to coordinates

9670228
versioning	upgrade
the code will raise when you try to upgrade to a rails versioning that already includes abstractcontroller callbacks so you will be reminded to remove the conditional logic

9670312

when sending a post request you need to put the authentication information in the header not in the query parameters

9670317

consider a class with a static factory method which gets a csv or tsv line as input variable names renamed for convenience

9670317

these are split of course in the appropriate getter and setter

9670338
post	get
get the result object by calling feed.first then loop through the jsonarray to get the individual post

9670339
symfony	silex
if you don t need a lot of what you see in the symfony tutorials you might be able to get away with silex

9670339
symfony	silex
silex is a mini-framework with alot of the core aspects of symfony but without the extra stuff

9670342
disk	ram
in short unless your private bytes section is pretty well out of control or you have leaks ie undisposed unmanaged resources you and your client should ignore this and let the os manage what is allocated what s in physical ram and what s swapped out to disk

9670392
client-side	server-side
it can be used for gathering usage statistics on utilities plugins eclipse intellij netbeans etc. client-side server-side middleware desktop or any java based applications

9670490

you can also translate those easily to basic javascript but since ie gives you the window height and width in odd ways until ie 9 you can t use innerheight and innerwidth it s a bit of pain in the ass

9670500
qtcore	qtgui
config need qtcore qtgui and qtxml

9670524
flask	django
after our initial project in django we are currently developing in flask

9670524
flask	django
flask is an even better match for classic asp developers than django

9670524
flask	django
django is nice if you want something up and running fast but we were already used to building our own forms datagrids wizards in classic asp and flask gives you much more freedom in that regard

9670528
jobs	cron
i do not want to over-ride any of the cron settings - other cron jobs should still notify root

9670566
width	height
setting a height or width on these do not have any effect on their size

9670568
int	chars
as far as i understand in i should use const chars like sometext instead of int i

9670662
switching	screens
i need to switching between videos very quickly however loading a new clip to a videoview seems to take about half a second of black screens

9670673
subtract	add
your juldate is still a string when you add subtract the 1 as number will return a value - that you never assign - but not convert the passed variable

9670695
required	placeholder
my best guess is that this can t be done without using dynamic items in a target and the workaround will be rather than using items which required a condition to write out a file with a predefined name and use that as output placeholder

9670717
versioning	upgrade
unless you know that you won t need later upgrade versioning then you may keep what s working

9670780
sorting	filtering
you are primarily sorting and filtering search results based on tags

9670815
implements	extends
or should my bean class extends or implements any other class

9670824
getter	setter
standard practice is to make member variables either protected or private with getter setter that follow java bean convention

9670824
equals	tostring	tostring	getter	getter	setter
this tends to be somewhat verbose but there is a very nice library www.projectlombok.org out there that generates the getter setter constructors tostring hashcode equals methods for you

9670826
hide	show
i used the uisearchdisplaydelegate to show and hide the scope bar

9670832
getter	setter
generally i would recommend using getter and setter as it is cleaner more organized and more readable

9670855
inherited	properties
now brand entity is one to many related with vehicle on my conceptual model so the question is how should i make relationships on ef model so i can keep using navigation properties between vehicle and brand but at the same time keep the consistency of the tph inherited on brand

9670867
getter	setter
it is always a good java programming practice to declare the class variables as private and access them with public getter and setter methods unless its really needed to declare them as public

9670867
getter	setter
if you are using an ide then its just a click away to generate getter and setter for class variables member variables

9670879
put	get
well i don t have any idea that reset default wallpaper when user uninstalling your app i recommend you to put another button or find a way to get a default wallpaper

9670910
getter	setter
the rationale for using getter and setter is so that you abstract out the actual representation as a field in order to give you the freedom to start presenting this as a derived value without changing your interface

9670910
getter	setter
if it s part of your first-class public interface then definitely use getter and setter

9670928
getter	setter
and now that you have been told over and over to use getter and setter and because you are in java where ides help you make getter setter trivially and everyone clearly uses them read over this thread to help add some balance to your usage of them

9670928
getter	setter
getter and setter are bad oo design

9670942
children	parent
but children of other parent elements are influenced by their parent first in relation to child of other parent

it s quite common that implementations of malloc free do not return memory blocks to the underlying os immediately after you call free

the next call to malloc may well be most efficiently be handled by returning a pointer to the block that you just free and therefore re-using it

children	parent
the short of it is that by specifying the relationship between parent and children as inverse nh is treating the one side of the relationship parent as the side that cannot exist outside the context of the relationship

9674034
children	parent
so when you clear all the children the parent which now has no children is orphaned and nh deletes it

9674034

9675019
int	chars
you are storing a value having alphanumeric chars into a column specified as int 11 .

9675096
width	height
setting the thumbnail size is fine height 75 width 75 but the size of the opened one is the problem

9675126
width	height
if you get more sophisticated you can build a script and pass it and image name height and width then dynamically build the page to display the image at the given height and width

9675176
int	double
i was supposed to write a method which will perform addition on collection of int float or double

9675213
for-loop	loops
of course you can limit how many tiles if you loops through by using a for-loop and specifying the end condition as i tile assuming your count starts at 0

9675231
post	get
when the number of threads exceed the threshold does the section marked post email processsing unrelated to sending email get executed at all

9675352
mouseover	mouseenter
first you probably want the mouseenter event instead of mouseover

9675367
folder	directory
i ve tried deleting every bin and obj folder in my solution directory and the installer project folder as well

9675371
submit	submission
not sure how much more description is needed but this submission process is tedious so i am adding more details just to submit

9675375
pull	push
the only network communication necessary is for when you want to sync your local repository to some other repository using push or pull

9675380

9675419
calendar	gcal
i tried simply replacing the gcal demo gcal.html with my own calendar url

9675447
innodb	myisam
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam

9675478
width	height
is there some way to keep a set width height for a div and pad the content without the div growing

9675479
alarmmanager	wakelock
you can use the alarmmanager 1 class to fire off an intent that starts your activity and acquires the wakelock

9675496

9675510
jobs	cron
i am trying to get cron jobs to run on alternate days...so if one runs today the other will run tomorrow and so on

9675551
width	height
to change the box model to make borders and padding internal to your width height but margins are still added

9675552
box-sizing	border-box
yes the solution to your problem is box-sizing border-box

9675590
width	height
i have figured out how to change the value of fields like width and height but the one i want is the stylesheet classes field

9675594
box-sizing	border-box
depending on what browsers you need to support you could change the box-sizing attribute on these divs to be border-box

9675594
width	height
that will allow you to set a height and a width on each box without the padding or borders effecting the dimensions you set

9675598
interpolation	splines
curvevertex uses catmull-rom splines to calculate the interpolation curve between the points

9675603
width	height
yes just subtract twice the padding or border from the height and width in other words subtract the padding or border from each side of the div

9675609

9675673
getter	setter
inside of your property definition you can specify getter and setter methods as follows

9675673
getter	setter
you can specify the getter only the setter only or both

9675676
post	get
all it does is forwarding a get request to a back-end serivce as a post request

9675676
post	get
if you wanted to use request body i would suggest adding the following post route rather than get again in this implementation body must be a valid xml

9675711
getter	setter
inside of your property definition you can specify getter and setter methods as follows

9675711
getter	setter
you can specify the getter only the setter only or both

9675720
jar	war
one for the jar with just the classes you want in the jar and second maven project for the war

9675720
jar	war
in the war project jar project should be added as a dependency

9675720
jar	war
also if you want to install war project and at the same time to produce that jar file just in one command line you should define the war project as the parent project and the jar one as a module

9675728
express	node.js
i am also fairly new to node.js and express

9675772
serializable	deserialization
you re forgetting the client side serializable time for the request data and deserialization time for the response data

9675808
children	parent
how do i remove text from the parent s a element but not any of the children

9675818
move	drag
here you would be able to drag and drop to move manually sort nodes of type a but type b would always appear below those nodes

9675876
many-to-many	one-to-many
first of all if authors co-write books you have a many-to-many association and not a one-to-many

9675894
post	get
i managed to get the access token and post data but if i try to post the day after the php script returns an error saying that the acces token is expired

9675901
width	height
however because the c1truedbgrid scrolls the width and height properties are likely to be smaller than the actual width and height

9675901
width	height
i looked through the property values mygrid while in debug mode trying to find anything that looked like what i would expact the actual width and height values to be but with no luck

9675919
icmp	snmp
as you correctly suspected snmp ping is definitely not the same as icmp ping

9675919
snmp	mib
there is no special ping command in snmp - it s just a name for a tool used to scan whether snmp is alive at some target device by retrieving some common mib values

9675922
google-chrome	firefox
when viewing the site in ie8 browser mode which is fine in firefox google-chrome and ie9+ i noticed my anchors were no longer sending ajax calls

9675929
int	boolean
also you don t really need int of int - you could just use an simple int ie an int for int - and i suspect ml has a boolean type that could use instead of defining a datatype for bool in other words you probably don t need to define a datatype at all for either of those - just use what is already present in the language

9675958
mamp	wamp
i d suggest setting up a local apache server with wamp or mamp and trying the paths relative to your local url

9675966
versioning	upgrade
i had this happen on a prior versioning of xcode when i upgrade

9675974
put	get
some console.log implementations put a live reference in the console that s why you get an empty collection in the console console.log this ends up showing this after the reset call

9675978
hide	show
however images are complex formats and often contain meta data and other parts that are not directly show â you can hide stuff in there without affecting the image on the screen

9676026
folder	dir
anyway it seems that vs2010 had by default placed my project dir within the library folder which was classified as network subsequently all files within were unavailable offline

9676027
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am using a specific doctype in my html document to ensure that ie renders arial the same way as firefox google-chrome and safari do

9676136
google-chrome	firefox
finally use a javascript debugging tool such as firebug in firefox or google-chrome developer toolbar in google-chrome to debug your ajax requests and see the requests and responses being sent to and from the server and any possible errors that might occur in between

9676161
hash	md5
the issue was that i added md5 hash as a parameter for each file

9676161
hash	md5
when it requested the content while offline it was not able to find an appropriate file as the cached file name contained the md5 hash as a parameter

9676161
hash	md5
so i resolved it by including the md5 hash as the comment

9676165
google-chrome	firefox
my aplication works fine on firefox and google-chrome but not on ie

9676180
pdfsharp	itext
first i was thinking to achieve that using some pdf libraries like pdfsharp or itext but then i found out that there are other technologies like xps or xsl-fo maybe suitable for my needs

9676215
getter	setter
the interface that combines those two interfaces can declare a read-write property whose implementation would be expected to use the read-only property s getter and the write-only property s setter

9676227
nsview	nsoutlineview
nsoutlineview is a subclass of nstableview which in turn is a subclass of nscontrol which in turn is a subclass of nsview

9676240
width	height
is going to always draw it at 0 0 because width - width will be 0 and height - height will be 0

9676310
oncreate	onnewintent
...and i currently have logic in both oncreate and onnewintent to make sure that the screen is always showing the data delivered by the newest intent that launched

9676312
width	height
java.awt.dimension width 296 height 479

9676312
width	height
java.awt.dimension width 0 height 0

9676328
centos	linux
i attempted to deploy the application to a linux machine centos box running php 5.3.6 -production server only to find that the reflectionmethod getdoccomment function does not return anything

9676342
rss	feed
i ve try to read rss feed from multiple website but some of this exposes your service rss in a strange way like this samples

9676401
folder	directory
it depends is the user that is trying to upload the file s into that directory on the server have permissions to that folder on the server eg read write ect.

9676403
portrait	landscape
api 11 added the method activity#recreate which sends your current activity through the same teardown recreate process that normally happens for config changes such as rotating the screen between landscape and portrait orientation

9676405
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
on google-chrome safari opera i use localstorage

9676409
getter	setter
for details you can visit getter and setter are bad oo design

9676421
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
renders arial the same way as firefox google-chrome and safari do

9676429
getter	setter
yes they are ok however i would also say that you should keep your classes small than you would with say java and what not so you don t end up with types that are mostly getter and setter

9676454
put	get
so this is a pretty embarrassing question but i have a text file and java will read all of the words in it and add it to a array i don t know where to put the text file like what folder so the comp can go get it

9676486
equals	gethashcode
i have tried overloading equals and gethashcode no luck

9676505
public	protected
you could also use an explicit interface implementation and protected abstract method if you don t want otis on the public api

9676509
addclass	removeclass
i am trying to removeclass on a mouse click and addclass on newly click menu item

9676523
firefox	safari
so far we have only noticed this happening in safari mobile safari and firefox

9676535
post	get
i want to get the response from sinatra as json and then post to another route with information from the json

9676545
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
to track their movement i get the current position with touchesbegan and update the position with touchesmoved

9676545
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
occasionally particularly if i ve moved a view very recently and it may still be animating back to its original position if i begin dragging another view the touchesbegan selector will not be called but touchesmoved and touchesended will be

9676545
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
how can touchesmoved and touchesended be called without touchesbegan first being called on the view

9676561
mouseup	mousedown
similarly there are mousedown and mousedownat commands which do the very same thing to the left mouse button until mouseup

9676572
post	put
this will put the api_token in the params hash just the same as post data would be

9676572
post	get
the restful way would be to use get for retrieving data from the api and using post to send data changing data on your backend but if you are going to be returning a user with the request then get is the correct method to be using anyway

9676573
mouse	keyboard
keyboard movement is ok but mouse movement is strange

9676586
typedef	struct
i m defining some struct which reference eachother and typedef ing the struct before using them so each struct is aware of the others was getting compilation errors without this

9676616
post	get
i have tried a get post ajax getjson request from the stand jquery package not jquery mobile

9676653
width	height
this would simply hide the text in your span element if it was longer than the 250px width and or 90px height

9676656
post	get
the viewstate is stored in an html hidden field on the page so to keep the values you would need to ensure an http post rather than a get which will be a problem if you need to say response.redirect

9676664
for-loop	arrays
you could read the data in as float precision then allocate an arrays of doubles and then manually fill the arrays of doubles using a for-loop

9676667
maven	pom.xml
i d consider changing maven pom.xml to declare servlet 3.0 jsp 2.2 so that you can benefit all the new servlet 3.0 features

9676669
setinterval	settimeout
i stumbled upon a show-stopper glitch in firebug wherein if a breakpoint is hit in a javascript callback method and execution is subsequently continued f8 any callback functions previously passed to settimeout or setinterval will no longer be called

9676669
setinterval	settimeout
to clarify in order to trigger the glitch the breakpoint must be located on any line on any event callback anywhere in the program except for in the setinterval settimeout callback itself

9676671
apache	nginx
why not let apache or nginx etc. serve your static files for you

9676698
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i ve found text views and labels but i really need to use radio button checkbox and dropdownlistfor

9676713
button	checkbox
i have 12 checkbox in my view and when i select some of the items and press the submit button the formcollection only has two keys 0 isselected and 1 playlists

9676726
for-loop	loops
is there anything wrong with putting the for-loop inside the while loops

9676735
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i don t believe there are default radio button checkbox or dropdownlistfor which is why you wouldn t have been able to find them

9676803
src	attr
img attr src something .load not supported in ie 9

9676871
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on all firefox and google-chrome and i assume all others

9676907
min	max
my goal is to sync a float text input widget with fixed extremes eg the user can input any double value between a min and b max with a b any_constant_real_number with a slider who can only slide between 0 and 100 to simplify

9676918
hide	show
i have a simple css jquery menu set up which uses jquery ui toggleclass to show and hide sub-menus

9676921
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome offer the property -webkit-mask-image which accomplishes exactly what you want but is not supported by any web browser other than safari and chrome.

9676948
inherited	properties
most if not all modern mobile devices in wurfl have the device_os properties set but they inherited it from their parent devices so you would either need to use the wurfl api to lookup all devices and check their device_os or you will need to parse to xml file directly combining the capabilities of each device with the capabilities of their parents specified in the fall_back xml attribute

9676963
for-loop	arrays
question how can i edit the for-loop to display the numbers in the arrays one after another inside the cloned input field

9676970
oncreate	onstart
i see from android developers that there is a nice flowchart showing oncreate leading to onstart then to onresume and so forth

9676970
oncreate	onstart
my question is what other methods appear in between oncreate and onstart

9676990
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.5+ google-chrome safari but in ie 9 it does not

9677101
getter	setter
support of opacity getter and setter shortcuts has been dropped

9677144
rss	feed
i have an rss feed from zendesk that i need to render as content on a page on my web app

9677163
metaclass	subclassing
so assuming i need c to be the metaclass of b and b will be a subclassing of a can someone tell me what is going wrong here and how i might change what i m doing to remove the error

9677168
oncreate	onstart
the call to onmeasure isn t directly related to the system s calls to oncreate and onstart

9677173
folder	directory
i also noticed that in the code that does work there s a folder structure in the bin directory that matches the src directory

9677173
folder	directory
in my project there is no folder structure like this in my bin directory

9677196
for-loop	arrays
first build up an arrays with indexes representing each hour of your 24hour range simple for-loop with a mktime function

9677206
int	chars
i know that it s better if i have a 2d array to which i would enter the int value of different chars for the gray level

9677241
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to use solaris studio for linux on ubuntu 10.10

9677274
post	get
the microsoft reference appears to be down at the moment but this so post has the basic links you would need to get started on the programmatic front

9677316
min	max
you might also have to reset all the other settings you tried to change policies and min max sizes of the individual group boxes to their default values

9677324
superclass	subclassing
you should not declare name and dataset in both superclass and subclassing

9677330
ordinals	difference
what you think you want is ordinals sorting where strings are sorted based on the first difference in the string based on the relative ordinals positions of the differing characters in the unicode codepage

9677336
google-chrome	safari
- but only works in google-chrome safari

9677376
for-loop	loops
it will basically be a nested for-loop one to loops through the data the other to loops through the sub-array

9677380
onresume	onpause
when show the dialog your activity will be in onpause or onstop state this time the activity dont refresh ui so suggestion when finish notifydatasetchanged you can dismiss the dialog when onresume method also invoke notifydatasetchanged

9677401
post	get
you re using the same input model for your get and your post so when you transfer you get into an endless loop

9677414
google-chrome	firefox
i want it to be further down the page but no matter where i put the document.write that creates it the div remains at the top in firefox google-chrome

9677450
hide	show
and both functions work independently of each other very well i just can not figure out how to tie the second show hide in that it only runs once validated and submitted

9677482
disk	ram
static variables can and will be a lot of the times reset when the user sends your app into the background because the system will serialize everything that it can keep track of to the disk to keep for later use and save ram

9677537
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari will detect when you go offline automatically - meaning that online events and properties will fire automatically when you unplug your network cable

9677537
opera	firefox
firefox mozilla opera and ie take a different approach and consider you online unless you explicitly pick offline mode in the browser - even if you don t have a working network connection

9677542
range	min
now say you want min range a b i think

9677592
for-loop	loops
then instead of a for-loop to read in you would have a do...while loops like

9677602
textview	imageview
as views you can use analogclock button chromometer imagebutton imageview progressbar and textview

9677602
listview	gridview
as of android 3.0 more views are available gridview listview stackview viewflipper and adapterviewflipper

9677619
put	get
the order tracking forms have a set amount of columns of that information can be put in before it get to the bottom of the form

9677620
public	protected
public protected private and static are keywords with specific meanings that change specific functionality

9677627
inherited	subclassing
the is-a relationship refers to a class w which is a class z probably because class w is a subclassing of class z or has class z somewhere in its inherited graph

9677628
folder	directory
i am able to find the grep sort output the output directory i provided but i am not able to find the temporary folder created during grep search

9677664
rss	feed
the output that i am getting is just what is in the date description rss news feed and items in the body section thats it

9677688
backgrounding	multitasking
i would invite you to read the suspended and backgrounding states app states and multitasking

9677701

on google-chrome firefox and safari the css below adds a 100 pixel margin to the top of the page and the margin disappears if you scroll down

9677707
calloc	malloc
other alternative is to use malloc or calloc for the char pointer

9677710
submit	submission
user submit forms - user confirms submission all _post are added to hidden fields - once confirmed the data is submitted and the file is copy to server

9677723
debian	linux
the best python distribution is debian gnu linux -- it comes with multiple versions of python supported hundreds if not thousands of python modules and extensions packaged so their installation is guaranteed to be flawless in 99 of the cases regardless how complex underlying software extension is majority of them are unit-tested against supported versions and 3rd party modules at package build-time guaranteeing lack of head-ache later on

9677723
vim	emacs	cpython	pypy
besides python itself you can also choose there among a dozen of available python ides spyder eric pida and others python-aware editors vim emacs etc alternative python implementations pypy compilers cpython nuitka etc

9677727
folder	directory
user.home returns the home directory of the user not the my documents folder

9677754
put	get
but when i put the form above the list of current comments i get the error undefined method name for nil nilclass

9677781
textmate	sublimetext
afaik sublimetext 2 uses plain textmate syntax highlighting definitions so you should be able to use the one that ships with it

9677784
erd	diagram
i have developed an erd diagram with uml notation in staruml

9677795
iolanguage	lua
there are other languages like lua or a more recent one iolanguage that are prototype based languages as well

maven	pom.xml
my next effort was to get an intellij idea maven project up and running with the minimum amount of information in my pom.xml to enable the auto-generation of the proxy classes

9677828
maven	pom.xml
taking the aforementioned clue i was finally able to get the proxy classes blowing out by including a dependency for aws-java-sdk-flow-build-tools-1.3.3.jar in my pom.xml after installing this jar into my local maven repository

9677828
maven	pom.xml
follow the maven instructions below for setting up the pom.xml

9677829
rubygems	bundler
as long as you specify your dependencies in your gem s .gemspec file and somebody installs your packaged gem they won t need bundler just rubygems gem command the dependencies will be installed as gems along with it

9677837
pull	push
from reading some of these forums i m supposed to have access to git commands now which i have a commit command but no push or pull

9677837
pull	push
i know my issue stems a bit farther then just getting it set up but for now i d be satisfied in knowing that i have it proper and can push and pull from the central repository once i get that set up as well

9677889
implements	extends
you can extends arrayadapter on a custom class and implements your own addall method

i understand that might be more difficult since the malloc free code is already inside .exe and it is even difficult to locate them

9678406

versioning	upgrade
compare it to the current versioning number and you need to execute serval sql files named like appname _sql_v1.sql appname _sql_v2.sql appname _sql_v3.sql keep in mind that each edition will own a appname _sql_v .sql file that contains all the table schema changes and records changes.if your app have been upgrade to versioning 7 you will find 7 sql files in you app package

9679853
versioning	upgrade
let s assume that some guy have installed a app versioned 2 but did not update until one day he she find the current versioning is 7 and then he she upgrade it to 7

9679853

two code versioning number will be loaded when he she started the app for the first time after the upgrade finished 2 and 7 so these sql files appname _sql_v3.sql appname _sql_v4.sql appname _sql_v5.sql appname _sql_v6.sql appname _sql_v7.sql will be execute one by one

9680820
google-chrome	safari
i discovered that google-chrome and safari use different websocket versions

9680820
google-chrome	safari
for example google-chrome uses sec-websocket-key and expects sec-websocket-accept while safari sends instead sec-websocket-key1 sec-websocket-key2 and a bunch of 8 bytes after the header

9680820
google-chrome	safari
the websocket is correctly open from google-chrome or safari both osx windows and ios5 versions

9680820
google-chrome	safari
apparently safari sends and expects messages delimited by 0x00 and 0xff while google-chrome sends and expects framed and masked data using a more recent version of the websocket specification

9680820
google-chrome	safari
i guess i could assume that if the handshake protocol is based in key1 and key2 the client is safari and then use 0x00 0xff to delimit data while if it uses sec-websocket-key the client is google-chrome and then use framed data

if i can generate some httpresponse from view while the request is processed the script might be able to run longer

9680836

doing so might send response even while the request completes. i was told on django irc that even i was able to get print to send message as response it will only throw out when httpresponse is returned. thus it was suggested to use httpresponse with an iterable

9693278
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
i do know that id s can only be used once per page and class as many times as needed but what i m doing is just too much css that must have a simpler way to edit it s styling on a per page basis instead of having to copy that rule and rename it so that i can edit things like padding margin text-alignment float width height etc without fearing that it will break something somewhere else

range	minimum
drawing a picture of the curve corresponding to your starting parameters see below would help you understand this so would recognizing that the curve you get will range from c at its minimum to c+a at its maximum and the range of your data is from 0.6 to 1 ...

9693670
range	minimum
as i mentioned above c is the minimum value of the shifted saturating-exponential curve a is the range and b is a scale parameter you can see that when the curve is 1-exp -1 or approximately 2 3 of the way from the minimum to the maximum

9693698
