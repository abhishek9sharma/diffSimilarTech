so it seems to me that if you re going to use apache or nginx you really don t have to write any backend code because you can just configure some routes and let them handle all the requests

44910412
apache	nginx
so it seems that if your website is just a bunch of pages with some static contents you just do the front-end and let apache or nginx do the rest

44910412
apache	nginx
if yes does it mean that to deploy a website on a host i just have to give them my front end and some kind of a configuration file for apache or nginx that specifies all the routes

post	get
if it works how do you get the name of the file to be deleted into the http post request

44913344
avassetwriter	avassetexportsession
before saving to camera roll you need to export your avmutablecomposition with avassetexportsession or with avassetwriter and after that you can save it to camera roll

44913349
folder	directory
for example can a user put your url with linux commands to go up a folder directory

44913354
cpu	processors
processors intel pentium cpu 6200 2.13ghz 2

44913361
folder	directory
download python_ldap-2.4.38-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl in the same directory that your venv folder is listed under

44913379
put	get
however when i try to build this i get the error incomplete type is not allowed which i am assuming has to do with the fact that property c does not have a definition for a yet but even if i put

44913392
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine when i try in google-chrome firefox browsers any number of times

44913396
int	boolean
digression generally we don t use type classes to do what you might call mere overloading of the sort you find in dynamic languages making + mean concatenate lists or add int or overloading boolean operations to work on truthy values as in your question

44913411
put	get
every time i try to put socket- readall it will get crashed when i debug

44913421
post	get
the post describes how to get the columns and then query for results

44913445
decoder	encoder
the program sets up the filtergraph using av_filter_parse_ptr giving the filtergraph string shown above encoder muxer decoder and demuxer then spawns two threads one that sends frames into the filtergraph and one that receives them

44913445
decoder	encoder
i have also tried having only one frame for the encoder and one for the decoder and calling av_frame_unref in each iteration of the loop

44913471
post	get
by your code it s not clear if the parameter is sent by get or post but my assumption is that you send it as post and that s the reason it s not added to the links

44913478
width	height
what i am trying to do is set width and height for my user control from my main window

44913478
width	height
in above example i am trying to set user control height and width to 100 through dependency properties controlheight and controlwidth respectively

44913478
width	height
if from my main windows controlheight and controlwidth is not specified i want user control height and width take as default value of 45

44913478
width	height
finally in my wpf window setting typical height and width properties are enough

44913519
post	get
but in this case i ve to do a repeatable code on each screen or may be for each get post call

44913556
width	height
at the viewbox it isn t necessary to bind the width or height because the usercontrol will already resize it appropriately

44913556
width	height
your usercontrol s xaml should look like shown below without explicitly setting any width or height

44913556
width	height
when you use that control somewhere in your mainwindow instead of setting controlwidth and controlheight just set width and height

44913594
post	get
the accepted request types are post get options head

44913616
integer	fractions
where denotes integer division any fractions part is discarded truncated rounded towards zero

44913622
versioning	upgrade
have a good look on how password_hash works in php and if using a php versioning that doesn t support it - please upgrade it you can always use anthony ferrara compatibility library for good effect

44913626
listener	eventhandler
if your listener is setup correctly adding the eventhandler annotation to these methods will allow bukkit to correctly invoke them like so

44913635
apache	nginx	post	get
in a lecture i recently had one of the speakers commented that the only methods that apache and nginx actually accept support are the get and post methods verbs

44913635
put	get	apache	nginx	post	get	post	put
the speaker further clarifies that when other methods such as put patch delete and others are used apache and nginx mask the method in other words the methods are converted to get and post and passed to the application containing a flag of the old method sent

44913635
apache	nginx
my question is are the methods verbs really accepted by apache and the nginx or the procedure contextualized in the question is what really happens

44913660
background-image	background-position
you re setting a new background-image on hover - you just want to adjust the background-position on hover instead

44913661

44913726
post	put
i just started learning to program and this is my first post on stack overflow so i apologize if i put this in the wrong place or did something wrong

44913727
children	parent
i played with the combinations of z-index but i read it s not possible to adjust children s z-index and parent at the same time

44913733
google-chrome	firefox
below is an example of how it displays in firefox google-chrome and ie

44913734
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
this question illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception for a null parameter

44913792
addclass	removeclass
or even better for performance and separating concerns use a selecting class with addclass or removeclass

44913805
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you can use java.lang.objects for this but it will throw nullpointerexception with a message your supply instead of illegalargumentexception

44913805
width	height
you can also make width and height final if you want to

44913813
int	chars
one problem that would remain is the field statflag you defined it as an int but it has the chars x maybe you ll have to change its type to be a string

44913836
umbraco	examine
i am trying to add these filters to an already reasonable complex umbraco examine query and have seen that you can t mix the api with raw lucene query so the whole thing might have to be done raw which i was trying to avoid since its a query builder that has quite a few dimensions

44913840
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
arguably throwing a nullpointerexception would be more idiomatic than throwing an illegalargumentexception though

44913862
versioning	upgrade
i would suggest you can upgrade to angular 4 which is most stable versioning and it have backward compatability.you can use componentfactoryresolver as an alternative for compile in angular 4

44913897
istream	getline
you can use istream getline

44913905
width	height
i think i get why because the actual height and width of the div are 0 and what shows up on the page is just the border but how would i make divs that look the same but can contain text or images

44913915
submit	submission
i m not sure about getting historical reviews but you can capture reviews that are created in the review form by adding an additional submit event handler in your script tag and submission the data to your server via xhr

44913918
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
disclaimer all this would be needed just to throw an illegalargumentexception which is less idiomatic than a nullpointerexception

44913923
bluestacks	android-emulator
i m using bluestacks as an android-emulator

44913967
daemons	systemd
so far this works great however as soon as i logout from my session while running the application in daemons mode my systemd freezes for 8 seconds until os kills it

44913991
post	get
my earlier post would have avoided crashed but to get correct co factor condition should have been like edited

44914018
clion	mingw-w64
im using clion 2017.1.3 mingw-w64 5.0 and cmake 3.7.2 x64 with gdb 7.11.1 x64

44914025
background-repeat	background-size	width	height
this gif is then expanded to the desired height using background-size and setting background-repeat repeat-x makes sure that the width is set properly

44914025
background-image	background-color	background-color	transparency
since there is no background-color everything outside the background-image is transparency

44914025
background-color	transparency
if the span inherits some background-color just override it to be transparency

44914103
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
i am a new developer but i can suggest since you are not getting the desired output maybe you can use a stringbuilder and a bufferedreader to read the json and turn it into a string

44914124
serializable	deserialization
note that i used the pattern because the offset +01 00 can be optional when deserializing this information is lost becase a localdatetime has no information about timezones and offsets so when serializing this field won t be found - making the field optional using delimiters make it work for both deserialization and serializable

44914124
serializable	deserialization
if you want different formats for deserialization and serializable you can also create custom classes and anotate them in the field

44914162
daemons	systemd
i decided to write a systemd daemons for this

44914165
mouse	keyboard
tested the keyboard and mouse control and monitor aspects and they work

44914180

you could do this by reflection or you could use libraries like snakeyaml or gson or jackson

44914204
swift	objective-c
for one you ve posted swift code but are getting an objective-c error message

44914246
n-gram	words
feature should be made of words or character n-gram

44914246
n-gram	words
creates character n-gram only from text inside words boundaries

44914293
int	chars
second problem is that every time a new line feed is allocated to the end of chars sequence when the input is smaller than the int n-1

44914330
put	preflight	put	get	post	get	post	put

44914434
rvm	bundler
so i learned a bit more using rvm gems and some on bundler

44914437
int	chars
the c standard only states that enum s are either chars or an unsigned int type and leaves it to the implementation to select an int of a particular size

44914453
post	put
but since the app state api has been deprecated and replaced by snapshots there doesn t seem to be a way to post put snapshots like you do with state

44914479
decoder	encoder
i was trying to run the encoder decoder model provided here which is implemented in theano

i have a table that has two columns height and width

44914559
width	height
what is the easiest way to sort this table incrementally based on either height or width

44914559
width	height
in other words it would pick the smallest value from height and width for each row and sort it based on this number

g++	gcc
although g++ gcc will accept the library as an input when specified with its fully qualified path the library must appear after the program object files for references to be resolved

44915217
int	chars
strictly speaking the compiler is right because chars is not chars and int is not int but autoboxing should take care of this

44915219
put	get
this is my code trying to put everything together and this is the error i get

44915255
put	get	post	get	post	put
in business validations like the customer is not active i normally use the http status code 422 for any http method post put get etc

44915287
integer	unsigned
the general form of the macro used for unsigned integer types with the conversion specifier u looks like

44915325
cos	sin
your conversion function results in very small values which for sin may not change the integer value of y and for cos result in larger values for x

44915328
google-chrome	firefox
then in some explorers specifically google-chrome and firefox it considers linebreak as empty space

ssl	tls1.2
i would like to force firefox 56 to use ssl instead of tls1.2 despite that ssl 3.0 is considered unsafe

44915418
post	get
if you want to avoid that instead of issuing a get request to a different page you should create a post request which has no limits

44915421
exslt	libxslt
you should instead use the exslt functions that are included with libxslt

44916256
post	get
the data will get submitted with post to the location specified in the form s action

44916257
hash	md5
now if the default hashpartitioner is also giving you data skew then you will have to use custom partitioner and apply hash using some good hash partitioner that will surely generate a sparse hash md5

44916257
implements	extends
to implements custom partitioner in spark you will have to extends partitioner and implements 3 methods

comparison is between stored hash value and hash salt + input

44920729

width	height
because the strides on your conv2d_transpose operation are it will result in an output with twice the height and width of the input

44931561
width	height
you set your and the deconvolutional layer expects half the height and width as input and the same batch size and number of channels which means it expects a shape of 1 512 512 1

44931561
width	height
the input you gave it y2 is of shape none 1020 1020 1 because the two conv2d layers each trim off a little around the edges of your data but because the stride is one they do not significantly decrease the width or height

44931561
width	height
to fix this one option is to use a stride of 1 2 2 1 on one of your convolutional layers which will roughly halve the width and height to exactly halve them use

44931615
width	height
unless you specify some height and width in your css your button will remain unaffected

44931658

44939529
mouseup	mouseleave	mouseup	mousedown	mouseleave	mousedown
those three events are mousedown mouseup and mouseleave

44939529
mouseleave	onmouseup
onmouseup mouseleave

44939529
mouseup	mouseleave
when the user triggers a mouseup or mouseleave event those attributes and listeners are removed

44939529
mouseup	mouseleave
i ve had to add the mouseleave listener since the mouseup event must occur over the element to which it is binded for it to be triggered

44939529
mouseup	mouseleave	mouseup	mousedown	mouseleave	mousedown
without applying the mouseleave event the user is able to trigger the mousedown event while avoiding the mouseup event altogether due to the browser s native detection of the dblclick event by double clicking the element and then sliding the cursor off of the element while not letting go of the mouse button until it is beyond the element s perimeter

44939543
jaxws-maven-plugin	jaxb2-maven-plugin
i have seen a lot of developers use the plugin jaxws-maven-plugin in the pom.xml to create java classes from the wsdl file or the xsd file while other developers use some pluggin variation of jaxb2-maven-plugin to do it

don t forget to remove some pixels to height and width to keep some place for the border pixels

44939940
ssl	https
try it without ssl i.e on http if it supports then the problem is at your ssl and make sure that you configured your ssl certificate properly and this problem commonly occurs if your https site is redirecting to another https site by some insecure content so use plugin named wp-force ssl so i could help you

44940250
multiplying	add
multiplying it by the index remember to add one because it is zero based

44940264
hide	show
the idea is to only show the child components and hide all the parents for some conditions

44940304
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass then the method in the subclassing hides the one in the superclass

build.gradle	gradlew
to escape gradlew checking for incompatible com.android.support versions a quick fix is to add following code in app module build.gradle

44940568
outputstream	inputstream
similar applies to nested writer s inputstream s and outputstream s too

44940569
getter	setter
c# s getter and setter is syntactic sugar which remove noisy method names setvalue or getvalue vs just value and increase readability of the code

44940569
getter	setter
some teams have rules that properties should be used only for getting setting values without any heavy logic in getter setter

44940580

postgresql	mysql
however you need to be aware that you can not use subqueries to force the rdbms mysql postgresql or any other to perform the operations in the order you described

44941109
put	get
now here is a program to get image.png and put it in database

44941144
jsonb	hstore
finally some rdbms support different kinds of document types such as postgresql s hstore json and jsonb columns that you could use since the sensor table is essentially a key value store

44941166
put	get
just make sure not to put it in a otherwise the will never get triggered leading to nothing happening at all

44941493
rainbowtable	salt
the reason why we generate a random salt for each password is that one cannot build a single rainbowtable to get all passwords at once

44941493
rainbowtable	salt
instead an attacker has to build a rainbowtable for each salt password

44941493
rainbowtable	salt	rainbowtable	hash	hash	salt
this purpose is fulfilled even if the salt is known one still has to build a rainbowtable per password that s why we can store the salt together with the hash in the database

44941493
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
btw the sha- hash functions are not appropriate to hash passwords instead one should use a password-hash function like bcrypt scrypt pbkdf2 or argon2

44941507
migrate	makemigrations
after that run python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate

44941559

44942011
networkstream	binaryreader
and this networkstream object is in turn being wrapped by your binaryreader object

44942011
tcpclient	networkstream
tcpclient and networkstream don t expose this directly but you can use the tcpclient.client property to get the socket object to do a better graceful closure one endpoint can indicate it s done sending and still be able to wait until the other endpoint is also done sending

44942014

so rest principles don t really care if you use post or put -- as long as you use them in a way that is consistent with the rfc

44951117

rest cares a lot about the fact that you use post and put the same way for all resources and that the representations you send to the client instruct the clients behavior rather than programming in a custom set of responses

44951150
equals	gethashcode
equals may work simply because it doesn t use the same fields that gethashcode does

removing an item from the arrays decreases the number of items in the arrays obviously but the for-loop is assuming that the arrays still has the same number of items as when the for-loop started

44959617
for-loop	arrays
so if the for-loop started with 5 items and then removes one there will be only 4 items in the arrays

44959617
for-loop	arrays
since the for-loop is assuming that there are 5 items it will try to remove the 5th item in the arrays but since the arrays only has 4 items there is no 5th item to remove causing an error

for-loop	loops
what s happening is that the for-loop fires off the async call reader.onload which is added to the js event loops for future resolution and the for-loop proceeds to its next iteration

44960102
for-loop	loops
sometime later the reader.onload async calls return after the for-loop is completed where i is at the max value for loops and appends the resultant img s to #span_ max i

you could easily swap out numbersquares in the two loops for variables that define the width and height respectively

44960966
width	height
for example if you had a 13x13 grid numsquares would need to be 169 -- much more difficult to remember than a width of 13 for a perfect square which can be re-used for both the width and height

44960981

for-loop	loops
every time the for-loop goes through its loops it will go through a while loops which will continue until the tom rolls a 6 once tom rolls a 6 the while loops will exit and the for-loop will run another time and that will repeat 10 times

44961259
for-loop	arrays
my issue is that the splice inside the for-loop is not working properly since every time it splices the for-loop skips the next position of the arrays since that position is then one position lower in the arrays

44961270
hide	show
to position those relative to .panel add position relative to .panel and the paragraphs will hide show with .panel

44961285
for-loop	loops

usually although the c++ standard doesn t specify this uint8_t triggers the chars overload of so you print out the glyph corresponding to that chars code instead of the int

44961521
for-loop	loops
that s where that for-loop comes into play it will loops through and display all of the returned shipping options irregardless of how many there are

44961573
git-cherry-pick	git-am	git-rebase	git-cherry	git-rebase	git-am	git-rebase	git-cherry-pick	git-am	git-cherry

equals	gethashcode
or you can override gethashcode and equals in all classes that you want to store in the dictionary

44962754
equals	gethashcode
then equalitycomparer.default calls the appropriate overrides for gethashcode and equals and you are set

44962754
equals	gethashcode
note that your implementation of gethashcode should be consistent with implementation of equals

44964189
portrait	landscape
i have a report wherein combination of portrait and landscape are in one report

44964189
portrait	landscape
the landscape will start at the end of the portrait

44964189
portrait	landscape
i already tried the suggestion from other people that i must use a main report which contains the sub-report of the landscape page and unfortunately the sub-report renders the size of the main report which is portrait

44964189
portrait	landscape
in here i set the main report to landscape but i need to display this in a portrait orientation

44964201
hive	hdfs
to delete external table data you need to delete it manually from hdfs location hive only deletes metadata in this case

44964204
width	height
a simple input example would be calling gl.teximage2d with a large width and height but a buffer too small

44964204
width	height
a simple output example would be calling gl.readpixels with a buffer to small for the given width and height

44964206
int	double
how can i get int number from double values of modulus

44964258
lxml	beautifulsoup
since you re using lxml why not use it in a more direct manner lxml is believed to be faster than beautifulsoup

44964263
for-loop	loops
the first clause of this for-loop has no effect on the behavior of loops

44964263
int	chars
if instead chars was really unsigned chars then the behavior would be well-defined since overflow of unsigned int types wraps around

44964263
int	chars
but op is working with signed chars and the behavior of signed int overflow is implementation-defined

44964263
int	chars
it appears that op implementation also wraps around on overflow for signed int types so with a signed chars range of -128 127 when i reaches 127 i++ evaluates to -128 wrapping around and the loop continues until i reaches -1 at which point ++i evaluates to 0

44964263
int	chars
d is for values of type int and i is a chars

44964293
ceil	floor
to get 5 out of 5.4 or 6 out of 5.6 you can easily round the number ceil 5.4 if you want to get the higher proportions or floor 5.6 if to lowers ones

44964357
gridlayoutmanager	linearlayoutmanager
you haven t added a layout manager for the recyclerview.just add a linearlayoutmanager or a gridlayoutmanager

i have been using jmeter and blazemeter for my script creation

44964610
jmeter	blazemeter
blazemeter uses the jmeter services to record the script just it provides a better visual interface

44964610
jmeter	blazemeter
for a web application on my pc i will prefer to record it using jmeter but blazemeter is helpful when you are recording a mobile application say ios or android

44964610
jmeter	blazemeter
the main advantage that blazemeter has on jmeter is for for script execution and bottleneck identification

44965002
google-chrome	firefox
i was testing on mozilla firefox and google-chrome it worked on both

44965039
width	height
anyway seems to be supported by all browsers but if you want to animate the scroll like you re using if you can share your html and css code maybe the problem is in the z-index or try to put the width and the height of the .icon-chevron-up also to the #return-to-top

44965105
width	height
this is because you are using percentages to set button width height

44965105
width	height
these percentages will be fractions of the parent element so 8 of width and 7 of height will not necessarily be equal and if the parent width height changes these sizes will as well

44965105
width	height
additionally i would suggest using width and height instead of max-width and max-height on the image so as to remove that white space beneath it

44965122
for-loop	loops
i want my foreach loops to convert into for-loop but i am facing some difficulties in initializing the for-loop

44965152
post	get
you can get comments with just one query since you know post id

44965152

portrait	landscape
this method is called on the ipad portrait mode but not called on the ipad landscape mode

44965346
put	get
the only way that i get it to work is to put my fxml file in my src folder and then set the path passed to getresource to simply peerapp.fxml

44965350
post	get
for post parameters you could include it in the url stateparams and then you could get the parameters in your angular controller

44965361
put	get
you can use put your eyes on the so if you submit your form you will get an array of values on the server which is just awesome

44965380
move	drag
is it also possible to manipulate the coordinates of the drag image during drag move

44965380
move	drag
in my case the x ccordinate of the drag image must be fixed and only the y coordinate can change so the drag image can only move up and down

44965398
for-loop	loops
instead of changing it to foreach loops from for-loop you might actually want to add like exit for or break

44965400
jruby	mri
i m writing an application which i want to keep compatible with ruby version from 1.9.3 up to current and should run under mri ruby and jruby

44965726
width	height
but it still fills the width and height

44965726
width	height
if i give absolute sizes for the layout width and height in 4 3 it does in fact display the full sensor but obviously absolute sizes are not reasonable to use for this

44965744
jsonschema2pojo	gson
you can generate gson pojo definitions with jsonschema2pojo - despite the name it also can use an example json

44965862
integer	unsigned
you do do that easily using type conversions because signed and unsigned are closely related types they are both arrays of std_logic indexed by an integer

44965866
width	height
my app listens for resize events and adjusts the width and the height of my canvas

44965915

44966603
explode	substr
notice for this problem i recommend the generell approach revo posted it s concise and safe and easy on the eyes -- but keep in mind that regular expressions come with a performance penalty compared to fixed string functions so if you can use strpos substr explode ... try to use them don t knee-jerk to a preg_-based solution

44966607
postgresql	mysql
if you do not want to set-up a sql server such as mysql or postgresql you can use a database management system that does not require a server such as sqlite which you can in addition drive from the command-line with the sqlite3 shell program or from a c program if you wish sqlite is actually a c library or by using with a gui interface such as

44973190
keydown	keyup
you can achieve what you want by using keyup instead of keydown and changing your if statement to the following

44973190
keydown	keyup
using keydown means that it will not use the .val that was input but will check the .val before the input is updated because the .val will be updated after the keyup event

44973195
keydown	keyup
you can either go through the keydown event properties and use the property key if i remember correctly to get the value entered during the keydown but if you want to grab the text in the input you ll need keyup

44973199
keydown	keyup
keydown event is fired before a character is typed hence you should use keyup event which is fired after the character is typed

44973205
getter	setter
check properties getter setter etc

44973208
keydown	keyup
also use keyup as keydown is capturing your val before it actually has a value

44973216
hide	show
if you need a callback you do need show and hide

44973221
keydown	keyup
keydown event fires when the button is pressed at that moment your value isn t updated try using keyup event fires when the button is released and the input value is updated.

44974080
int	chars
trying to explain this i assumed it would be obvious an int is a different size than a chars so no block copies would ever help you

44974087
hide	show
so far i understand that i can listen to the window for dragenter and show my overlay and listen to the overlay for dragleave to hide it but the problem seems to be that dragging over the drop zones causes the overlay s dragleave event to fire which makes the overlay hide which makes the window dragenter event show the overlay and so on

int	chars
you can make a helper function that just extracts the chars value casted to an int from the newly created int array hence behaving like an int array

44974369
int	chars
to use this you just convert the chars array to an int pointer and just use it like so

44974646
for-loop	arrays
my current idea was to created a nested for-loop to cycle through both arrays and check for matches and if the matches equal to the amount of correct answers then the student would be correct

44974683
post	get
you need to provide the data to submit with the post request it does not get bound automatically

44974691
button	checkbox
if checkbox is clicked button is visible and vice-versa. note button also fires ajax call the problem which i am facing right now is if i am disabling the checkbox the div is retaining the value of the old key.i know the problem is with design of my code.can any one say how can it be re-designed.i will attach the code for reference

44974779

the values are stored in data so you must use data i in your loop to check for min max and to compute the average

44975315
chown	chmod
this one is readable now and works in browser but i can t figure out why as they both have the same chmod xxx permissions and chown ownership

44975320
min	max
also inside your function use the data from the array to calculate min and max

44975329
min	max
also you need to declare your variables min max and avg on your main function in order to use them when you call your normalizeminmaxavg function

44975376
min	max
you have to define min max avg in your main function before passing them on

44975376
for-loop	arrays
in normalizeminmaxavg for-loop you access i index instead of data i the data under index i in arrays data

44975379

other filetypes work and editors like atom-editor and notepad++ don t have that problem on my machine

44975768

44976385
division	modulo
this can be achieved fairly easily through division again 1 hour is 60 60 seconds so divide the number of seconds by 60 60 to get the hours and the modulo to get the remainder of minutes and seconds

44976593
onchange	onkeyup
the only thing i could think of is that you have to take away the focus from the tu or tt input element in order to make the gpa element display the result because you used onchange instead of onkeyup

44976818
width	height
for some reason when i change their height width from px to the images just dissappear

44976818

when you attempt to free filename_path you are actually attempting to free the static string .. datasets cluster d s which of course as the error message says was not actually allocated by malloc

44976954
strncpy	malloc
to copy your contents into your malloc ed string you should use strncpy

44976958
free	malloc
you re basically throwing away the value returned from malloc leading to a a memory leak and b the error when calling free

44976959
width	height
setting the width this way will work just fine and if you had actual img tags instead of inserting the images using css you could use height auto and it would scale the image as you want

44976959
width	height
so you could define the height of the container div but given that you want it to be relative to the width of the device your best option is probably to use img tags and height auto instead of background-image

44976969
filtering	grouping
use this column in an index so you can filtering or grouping by local date

44977241
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
the simplest solution would be just to change width 40px to width 0px so that the border s width definition is the only one that s used but my preferred situation updated in the snippet is to change the box-sizing property to border-box

google-chrome	firefox
it looks as intended on google-chrome and edge browsers but on firefox it looks displaced

44986154
hide	show
if you do not perform removecallbacks all of these messages will be executed meaning that each of those show and hide actions would be performed which results in such a glitchy behavior

44986154
hide	show
for example if we have a situation when system bars are show then the next click would initiate a hide event to happen after 300 ms and you are explicitly telling that hey if there are some events posted that should show the system bar then cancel them

44986161
rss	feed
the question is simply asking about jquery selectors on xml nodes rather than html the fact that he is using ajax to get an rss feed is irelivant so one can assume that cors is not an issue in this case

all the answers given say about printwriter but the same can be done with fileoutputstream

44986855
fileoutputstream	printwriter
surely use this only of u want to do it with fileoutputstream only otherwise use printwriter

44986860
int	double
i know i d get the same result without the part but this way i m ensuring that double is passed to the function where as doing it without would allow for d to be a int or a bool and the code would still compile silently introducing an error

44986862
for-loop	arrays
here in the for-loop rates 0 will get the first string from the arrays for each element in ratesarray arraylist

i have a problem making a child div taking the whole width and height even if i make it 100 in width and height as shown in the code bellow

44986963
tstringgrid	tdbgrid
lastly you could reduce this entire code down to three lines setting the sql.text assigning a value to the parameter and opening the query if you got rid of the tstringgrid entirely and used a tdbgrid instead

44986963
tstringgrid	tdbgrid
all you do is add the tdbgrid to your form in place of the tstringgrid drop a tdatasource as well connect the tdbgrid.datasource to the tdatasource and the tdatasource.dataset to your query

44986994
width	height
if you observe the height of facebook images may differ from each other but the width is always same

i tried replicating it but all it did was end up showing me the folder structure of my working directory in the browser

44987092
addition	multiplication
you ll see what i mean about the precedence because the multiplication rule appears before the addition rule -- and hence binds earlier -- which is a mathematical convention lacking parentheses to group terms.

44987109
width	height
they probably have their own in house code for doing this however you could use imagemagick to do the same thing including sizing and cropping uploads so as to always maintain the same width to height ratios at least for thumbnails

44987149
width	height
you can get that from tkinter with the winfo_reqheight and winfo_reqwidth methods which return the height and width requested by the button

44987185
portrait	landscape
if your parent div has fixed dimensions you can use css to scale images while maintaining the aspect ratio for both landscape and portrait photos

boost	allocator
yes the allocator provided by boost for use with shared memory can be used by other processes

44987286
for-loop	loops
if that s the case then why isn t it correct to say that in the program above the first iteration of loops will return to the main method s context until the task is finished and only then will the next iteration of the for-loop be carried out and continue in that manner for all iteration of loops

44987299
folder	directory
i can write whole path to the boost_python3-vc120-mt-1_64.lib including file name not just folder name in section additional library directory

when the page in the dialog pop-up i want to access a variable or dom element defined in the parent window that i would normally do using

44988532
128bit	64bit
this has the advantage of increasing memory copy bandwidth because you d be doing 64bit 128bit or larger copies at a time but introduces other disadvantages

44988556
post	get
the problem is when i call this function i do not get the data because this post take a few seconds to finish and i get the promise before the post finish

44988596
post	put
you may understand this with the example that i put at the end of this post

44988597

44988820
post	get
there are many post on this but for whatever reason i can t seem to get the correct sequence of conversions correct

44988833
free	malloc	strtok	malloc
you can either manipulate the bytes in str to insert a 0 after each word overwriting the first whitespace character this is what strtok does or you can copy the words to new strings but then you would have to malloc each of them again and the caller has to free them later

44988847
g++	gcc
my compiler is gcc 4.9 and the way i compiled this program was using the command g++ test -std c++11 -o test

44988896
for-loop	loops
only a for-loop can assign to a new name in a list comprehension so if you need a local variable to reference a calculation you need to find ways to add an extra loops

in my solution explorer there is a resource directory folder

44989214
system.in	system.out
to print output we simply use system.out stream while to take input we have to pass system.in in constructor of a scanner object and then use that object only

44989235
children	parent
one disadvantage is that additional work needs to be done to construct the list of children of a parent node for example by explicitly linking the children.

44989280
dictionary	map
you can use a dictionary object to map the text to the array.

44989305
system.in	system.out
one important difference between system.in and system.out is that - although both are streams - one is a more specialized stream

44989305
outputstream	inputstream
the counterpart of inputstream is an outputstream but the java designers made the class variable out a printstream

44989305
system.in	system.out
this is the reason why you see more specialized methods for system.out than you do for system.in

44989311
google-chrome	firefox
and it s good approach to debug with some graphic browser like firefox before switching to headless mode google-chrome --headless or phantomjs as in your case

44989381
min	max
this gives you per-day min max and quantiles based on the assumption that you have some kind of column with measurements

44989383
entity-relationship	diagram
consider the following example entity-relationship diagram

44989383
entity-relationship	diagram
these overlapping fk constraints can t be represented in entity-relationship diagram though they could be represented logically

44989416
spaces	delimiter
column 2 sometimes has spaces in it so squeezing all spaces and using spaces as a delimiter for cut is not an option

44989450
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
since there are no objects in arr so the for-loop will not have an object to refer to and it will reach the end of the arrays before entering loops thus finishing loops

44989468
build.gradle	gradlew
you only have to provide the location of parent folder of the gradlew and build.gradle and not the files

44989475
hide	show
on window resize show the .submenu if the screen width is less than 766px and hide if more than 766px

44989520

any .java xml etc files i create in android studio are in crlf get converted to lf when i push them into the repo then back into crlf when i pull changes into my local copy

44989590
post	get
how can i get it using graph api when retrieving post

44989639
tunnel	vpn
if you already have a corporate email server and you have a vpn connection to that from your google compute engine instances you can tunnel the mail traffic to your corporate email server and let it handle the mail delivery

44989643
children	parent
the parent is and the children are in order the link with the inside both relative the hidden div absolute and a relative that is the one above the hidden div and must remain like that until it hover and the div appears from the top

44989643
width	height
the social network links should have 30px for both width and height

44989664
pull	push
second approach following the first approach but do not create an ami instead upload your code on a private i suppose repo like github bitbucket install ssm and the appropriate roles for managing ec2 and on every code changes push them to repo and pull them on your ec2 using ssm

44989673
folder	directory
i want to redirect links from a complex directory structure to another domain but there into the root folder

std	ostream
edit it seems the error is occurring from my std ostream write std ostream ostr declaration as well as my int mdays int mon const declaration

44989954
folder	directory
and can be found either in your output directory if it was automatically copied or in the directory packages accord.video.ffmpeg.x.x.x inside your solution folder

44989961
int	double
your quick_sort function expects a pointer to an array of double yet you pass an array of int

44989972
post	get
but this is my take on this.the following code is necessary but i do not know whether the request is a get or post so i wrote both of them

44990011
width	height
it should be noted that 480 and 720 are measurements of video height â not width

44990072
bluetooth	usb
can we bluetooth the apk on the device that is installed by usb debugging to another device and use

44990115
superclass	subclassing
thus i want to achieve that all subclassing call as defined in the abstract superclass

44990122
hide	show
but it can show the old inputs for the search field in a menu and it makes a scrolldown about a half page and hide the kinda whole page behind it

44990141
printf	strcmp
i also already tried to get rid of the i variable and just write printf d strcmp array1 array2

44990170
spaces	delimiter
doing so will split the string with the white spaces delimiter

44990225
put	get
in the callback function of your get request put the html into your bootstrap modal body

44990228
width	height
i can do this with the width but not with the height

44990241
put	get
you need to first get all the texts and put them into an array of string

44990245
for-loop	loops
you can switch to defining it in the for-loop itself with let and each invocation of loops will get its own separate version of the variable solving the async access issue

44990260
public	protected
if you will have a look at source code of this class you will realize that all protected things have public getters

44990287
folder	directory
the current solution i am using is to iterate over the directory i want to compress of which there are currently 2 get the file objects and use the copyhere method to copy the source folder into a zip file with the proper header format

44990287
folder	directory
the first option is easy with one directory but becomes much more tedious with multiple folder not to mention that windows will likely create an object in the target directory before it has finished copying and i am compressing files potentially over 10 gb so that solution won t work

44990336
disk	ram
the above benchmark is performed on a system with an ssd drive and the file 43m fits in ram so the timings do not include much disk i o latency

44990411
getter	setter
i have tried a similar solution to the new error by overriding the speed property in my gkagent2d sub class and providing an explicit setter and getter and even backing the speed parameter by a private float as suggested by kdawg but the same error still occurs when the super s speed parameter is set

44990487
iboutlet	ibaction
if you want to change your buttons image by clicking on it you should not only have ibaction but also iboutlet for that button

getattr	subclassing
when the second argument is an object because the search order is same as that used by getattr except that the type itself is skipped i guessed that the type of the superobject returned by super function should be a subclassing of any ancestry class of the first argument type but i found that it is actually not by testing with issubclass

atomic	interlocked
in order to make sure that your writes are atomic you need to use interlocked functions

44991842
min	max
also you need to ensure that your min max buffers are cleared with a suitable value first that is before to call that shader

44991853
google-chrome	firefox
using the json or text methods instead of arraybuffer doesn t seem to make a difference and this only seems to happen in google-chrome firefox could handle up to 50 000 in a few seconds

44991859
maven	pom.xml
my project uses maven to reference all needed libraries so i don t even need to manually install robot framework i just included markusbernhardt s selenium2library as a dependency in pom.xml

it might be beneficial to redirect the bash output both stdout and stderr to a log file so that you can know why it failed

44992031
min	max
the problem i am having is with the max and min limits of the scale

44992031
min	max
in an ideal world i d like to have a min scale of y 1 and a max scale y 100 and as you roll the phone back and forth it would tween between the two sizes

44992071
for-loop	loops
it should sum 5+10+15+20+25 75 i have gotten it to work with a while loops but not a for-loop

44992078
children	parent
just add min-height 100vh to the parent body and the default value align-items stretch will cause the children to to fill the height of the parent

44992084
width	height
can i not simply vary the width and height variables in the code

44992111
ionic	angular
it s not a full rewrite like there was going from ionic 1 - ionic 2 and they are now using semantic versioning so major releases will be more regular similar to angular

44992146
int	chars
then they d each happily take int argc chars argv as arguments

44992215
for-loop	loops
but follows show the method with for-loop and while loops

44992239
postgresql	mysql
in other rdbms s like postgresql unlike mysql you could use cte s with to avoid repetition

44992259

activemq	rabbitmq
since you were looking at rabbitmq activemq sqs msmq you may be also interested to check out zeromq nanomsg or yami4

44992415
folder	directory
some people said it is because the directory is not a git repo but i checked out the project through git so there is .git folder in my understanding my directory is a git repo already

44992454
hive	hdfs
in fact the underlying hdfs directory within the hive warehouse managing the table s for this query will be owned by the hive user

44992548
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql are trickier as the binary data is kept in multiple files and may not even be valid if you were able to snapshot it

44992604
put	get
when they match you get 1 and you put that 1 into the column current

44992648
width	height
however because this can distort the image on larger screens i want to be able to make the background image cover the width and height of the div container that it s in rather than the width of the whole screen

44992745
getter	setter
this is not as simple as it used to be before the introduction of property getter and setter

44992745
getter	setter
its value can be accessed using the non-enumerable __proto__ getter setter property of an object in netscape flavored browsers microsoft did not implement it when they initially cloned javascript into jscript or using object.getprototypeof introduced in ecmascript 5.1

44992745
getter	setter
named object properties can be implemented as key-value pairs stored in an object or as a combination of getter setter functions supplied for the property using object.defineproperty or associated object.defineproperties method for multiple properties

44992745
inherited	properties
properties values may be located in the data collection of an object reference or accessed by searching the prototype pointer chain the inherited chain set up for the object

44992745
getter	setter
getter and setter for an object property take precedence over the use of key-value pairs

44992745
getter	setter	inherited	properties
if a properties of an object was defined using a setter getter pair the setter or getter function will be called to read or write the properties even if the properties is inherited

44992745
getter	setter
writing a key-value type property without a setter or getter simply writes the value as a local property of the object being written to creating a new property if the name of property being written does not exist already

44992745
inherited	properties
locally writing a key-value properties means that when reading it back the local value will returned without searching the inherited chain

44992745
inherited	properties
so writing the value of an inherited properties on one instance object does not affect the value inherited by another object of the same class

44992745
inherited	properties
if an inherited properties that has been written to is deleted its value reverts to the inherited value

44992745
inherited	properties
attempting to delete an object properties that is being inherited has no effect

44992745
inherited	properties
methods defined within a class declaration are added as properties of the prototype properties of the constructor with effect that they are inherited by class instance objects

44992747
int	chars
write a program in python to prompt user to enter an int between 10 and 3 inclusive and also a chars

44992752
tensorflow	tensorboard

44992772
min	max
for a homework assignment i am supposed to ask a user how many integers they would like to enter and then find the max and min number from the amount without using arrays

44992772
min	max
for the most part my program works however when the user let s say enters -6 -6 the output is min -6 and max 0

44992772
min	max
i want this to say the min and max is -6 but i have no idea how to do this with making the rest of the code work

44992773
elasticsearch	kibana
i am using elasticsearch 5.4.1 and kibana 5.4.1

44992777
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both the html templates but neither render them when running locally

44992792
min	max
set the value of both the min and max variable to the initial input then compare the min and max to what the user inputs each time to check if an update is neeeded

44992800
google-chrome	firefox
i have one form that run always on top and i would like to know if the application running behind my form is a web browser ie firefox or google-chrome and then i want to get some elements from html opened in that browser

i have created a function that can add the values of the checkbox and a function for the radio button but am having trouble combining the two into one working function

44992904
division	modulo
integer division and some modulo arithmetic

44992906
int	chars	width	height
after we ve gotten the int and the chars we need to display a box made up of the chars whose width and height are determined by the int

44992906
int	chars	width	height
the last step is to print a box made of the value of chars that has a width of int and a height of int

44992906
int	chars
now all we need to do is to print a row with int number of chars int number of times

44992906
for-loop	loops
the the reason we used the underscore in our for-loop instead of an actual readable variable name is because we don t need to use the values that the for loops would give us

44992910
superclass	subclassing
i have used wordnet a few years ago as i wanted to build a hypertree of words their superclass es and subclassing es plus a few other types of relationships that are absent in wn i had to drop wordnet and its jargon

44993011
width	height
instead what happens is when i click the button and dynamically assign a definite percentage to width and height elements wrap themselves to take less space which makes the design look very bad

44993038
uilabel	uibutton
i have a uilabel called label a uibutton called button

44993039
swift	objective-c
i have a trouble problem on block on objective-c it works well but i couldn t translate to swift 3

44993060
ubuntu	linux
i m running lubuntu 16.04 with xboxdrv version 0.8.6 built from the git repository as 0.8.5 is the version available in the ubuntu repository using an official microsoft xbox 360 wired controller and running the official version of steam for linux

44993082
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome or firefox use f12 to debug window or simply right click any in page select inspect elements then choose console tabs

44993085
folder	directory
it worked fine when i was opening it from my assets folder but since that is read only i think i need to have it read and write from the output directory or another folder

44993127
min	max
to init min and max with first input

44993169
width	height
rather it should occupy 100 the width with the height scaling according to its ratio

44993169
portrait	landscape
the two images illustrate the mask s behaviour when the parent svg is in either landscape or portrait

44993200
mouseleave	mouseenter
i removed setinterval and everytime the mouseenter event occurs we can append and every time mouseleave event occurs we can remove the the appended div

44993211
width	height
i also added the fillviewport line of code to scrollview and removed the layout width and height and changed it to 0dp

44993238
calloc	malloc
i suspect this is a memory pointer issue related to either malloc or calloc but i have been unable to pinpoint my misunderstanding for several days

44993261
implements	extends
each of the errors is nested so it s difficult to display the formatting accurately here but it appears to indicate that i can t just specify either a woof or meow type when extends the generic because the private properties aren t implements across both types which looks similar to another question here

44993277
ionic	angular
since ionic 3 is built on top of angular 4 i do see a lot of similarities in components modules

44993277
ionic	angular
is there a way which i can easily re-use existing components in my angular 4 components in ionic app

44993277
ionic	angular
can i assume that if components that i wrote for angular 4 works in angular 4 should those components be also compatible with ionic

44993277
ionic	angular
if i can re-use the components would it be possible to maintain angular 4 app and ionic 3 app in the same code base

44993277
ionic	angular
i would love to see example codebase that is compatible with angular 4 ionic 3 but have not found one yet

44993325
for-loop	loops
earlier in the batch as part of the mainline not loops - for instance directly after the echo off or before the for-loop

44993341
int	double
those reductions are only available for built-in types double int etc.

44993374
swift	objective-c
then back in swift land you need to first have a bridging header for the objective-c wrapper so that swift can access it

44993437
hide	show
you can use .prop to added required attribute to input everytime you show it and remove the attribute everytime you hide it

44993460
getter	setter
java users might expect java style getter and setter

44993493
google-chrome	firefox

subtraction	addition
function definition be like void adddiff a b it should perform both addition and subtraction it should not return values and should not use print statement in adddiff method

44993700
folder	directory	folder	dir
if you using angular-cli keep the json file inside assets folder parallel to app dir directory

44993705
uisearchbar	uisearchcontroller
however by iterating through a uisearchbar s or a uisearchcontroller i can t remember clearly subviews one can still gain access to the button s instance and perform necessary changes

44993711
switching	screens
i solved it actually the value wasn t toggling in settings screens the switching was turning off and on but the value remained the default

44993714
folder	directory	folder	dir
if you using angular-cli keep the json file inside assets folder parallel to app dir directory

44993734
required	placeholder
the name field you create should have autofocus placeholder text and be required

44993734
required	placeholder
the telephone field should have placeholder text a pattern to restrict entry and be required

44993783
google-chrome	safari
i tried on safari and it worked properly so i deleted related cookies on google-chrome and it worked

44993795
width	height
when you say width and height i assume you are not referring to the input resolution that comes from the camera but you are wanting to change how it is rendered on your canvas

44993795
width	height
i would revert your code to the original width and height of 640x480 and i would look at your mycanvas class extension for rendering to the screen

44993861
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
date is internally represented as ieee 64-bit 8-byte floating-point numbers where the integer part is the date and fractions part is the time

44993861

currency is also 8-byte but is treated as a fixed-point number with 4 fractions digits an integer scaled by 10 000

44993883
post	get
now when i do a without returning the show view i get the correct post

44993963
initializer	class-method

44993976
jruby	mri
i tested this in mri 2.4 and jruby 9.1.2 on macos x

44994331
width	height
the canvas s width and height attributes are not only the size of the canvas but also set its resolution

44994331
width	height
if you don t set width and height via the attributes or via script the canvas s default resolution is 300px x 150px

44994331
width	height
you have to set the width and the height attributes explicitly on the canvas element

44994340

int	double
this may not be the fastest solution but it does not suffer from inaccuracies in log10 if you use log10 remember to round rather than truncate to an int and beware of large int which cannot be accurately converted to a double because they would require more than 53 mantissa bits and it doesn t require writing out a loop

they are both redirected well but it seems that the all stderr is written and then the all stdout

45006656
stdout	stderr
that said it would probably be a better idea to have an explicit logging interface that just optionally catches stderr and stdout as well

45006664

the problem is that output through stdout is buffered while stderr is unbuffered

otoh for coherency reasons with other integral types int short long ... you may say that the right thing would be that plain chars should be signed

45007070

so when c functions talk about receiving providing chars into int variables the contract is always that the chars is assumed to be a chars that has been cast to an unsigned chars so that it is always positive negative values overflowing into the top half of its range and then put into an int

i realize this might be kind of a basic question but due to the relationship between keras and tensorflow it makes this question very hard to google for

45017278
keras	tensorflow
i realize this is probably pretty basic but any time i search for anything with tensor and keras in the title it ends up being about using tensorflow and much more complicated than what i am trying to do

i am studying nlp and learning to use nltk and scikit-learn for text classification

45017597
versioning	upgrade
i also checked protoc --version which gives me libprotoc 3.3.0 but for some reason apt-get upgrade libprotobuf-dev gives me ibprotobuf-dev is already the newest versioning 2.6.1-1.3

45017629
post	get
following your additional edit i think the issue will be that logout is a post and a link is only ever a get request so mvc is looking for a get action user logout

45017641
getter	setter
since the setter and getter are generated dynamically you could do something like

45017658
dplyr	lubridate
it has nothing todo with dplyr but with lubridate dseconds

45017677
int	double
int and double extends it

45017719
subtract	add
if you really needed to have a graph where some edges have no weight encoded in a matrix then i guess you could do some kind of simple trick like add 1 to all weights when storing in the matrix then subtract one when you want to calculate properties over those weights

45017733
getter	setter
does the parameter type of the setter match the return type of the getter

45017744
client-side	server-side
note when i query in the server-side code or the template helper context which is considered a client-side code it prints all the data in the database perfectly

45017754
post	get
this seems to be an undocumented feature and there are a lot of post on how to get bootstrap into grails 3 which makes no sense if its already there unless they are trying to figure out how to update the bootstrap version

45017763
cos	sin
i m pretty sure the sin cos libraries don t take arbitrarily large numbers and calculate the sin cos of them - they instead reduce them down to low numbers between 0-2xpi

45017763
multiplying	subtract
realistically it should figure out how many times it needs to multiplying 2xpi to get a value just below your number then subtract that out

45017771
versioning	upgrade
earlier versioning of the preceding packages please upgrade to the

45017864

scrypt	salt
rather than using scrypt a great library for securely hashing passwords with random salt in golang is golang.org x crypto bcrypt as mentioned in the following answer

45018051
hash	salt
when storing hash passwords in a database you no longer have to worry about storing the salt for each password hash as well

45018051
hash	salt
the hash produced by bcrypt includes the bcrypt version cost salt and cipher not only the cipher

45018079
hash	salt
for any version 1 passwords to authenticate you do not have to calculate the cosine you simply use the one stored along with the password hash and the salt

45018079
hash	salt
by storing that cosine or pepper along with the salt and the password hash you basically change that pepper into a salt2

45018093
integer	unsigned
for example to reduce a 64-bit unsigned integer a modulo 2 b we can either do

45018101
sorting	filtering
basically there are two sorting filtering on a table - on one of them some of the rows that don t apply are hidden and therefore throwing off the alternating colors

45018133
sequence	permutation
well its the question about creating the permutation can be a generic question as well instead of javascript specific or sequence specific there can be multiple approaches let ma explain one of them what i can think currently in short term

45018135
children	parent
in jquery you can use children and parent and find methods after you choose the selector

45018141
min	max
the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container and thus you can change the order with css and for different screen sizes using min and max widths

45018145
post	get
what i want here is that when i click the button the div displays and then it waits 3 seconds before it keeps the code as it does a post of data then returns to the same page as what i get here is sleep 3 seconds display the div and then it refreshes my page almost instantly which leaves no time to see the message as intended

45018201
postgresql	mysql
if you want an rdbms oltp you might need to look at cloudsql mysql postgresql or spanner

45018242
spaces	delimiter
you can read the txt file as csv and define the spaces between the tow columns as delimiter

45018289

it may be worth looking at other 3rd-party tools like wix to get things installed correctly or even manually writing your own installer to get things put where they need to be

45018330
range	minimum
dates represent the time range to be plotted and gets its first and last date from the minimum and maximum dates in symptoms_hash

45018337

initialize your app the usual way but instead of mainwindow.show you call mainwindow.minimize after initializing the mainwindow then add eventlisteners for the mainwiondw s minimize and restore events to hide or show the taskbar icon for your app via mainwindow.setskiptaskbar

45018346
google-chrome	firefox
the application works just fine with websockets when i run it on a current version of google-chrome but when i try running it on an older version of a browser that doesn t support websockets like firefox 3.6 it no longer works

45018357
children	parent
if the parent node has two or more children then the above solution is not enough

i find myself in similar situations a lot and while it seems obvious to just use int 0 1 2 or 1 2 3 i ve found that in practice this is unclear compared to boolean

45018471
build.gradle	gradlew
for gradlew youâ ll need a minimal android build.gradle file and you can define the properties directly in a crashlytics block the fabric gradlew plugin requires the android gradlew plugin to be applied before it in your build.gradle

45018501
ubuntu	linux
previously i had no problem sshing into the azure ubuntu linux but now when i attempt to make the connection it just hangs at the following

45018534
implements	extends
something that comes to mind is that you should implements your own jlabel class by extends the original and adding a boolean member to denote whether or not it was previously dragged

45018689
button	checkbox
you can setonclicklistener on button on shoppingpage as you dont want to go to next activity unless user presses button and has checkbox is checked

45018689
button	checkbox
if you want to go to next activity on checking the checkbox then why would you need button

45018689
button	checkbox
hence i am transitioning to next activity only when button is pressed and user has checkbox checked

45018689
button	checkbox
if you want to transition to next activity irrespective of the checkbox checked then use the below snippet in onclick of button

45018718
getter	setter
and below the java representation of this two columns only of course with all setter and getter but it has more fields so just adding this

45018788
children	parent
1 you can use input and output properties to communicate between the parent app-layout and the children component-1 and component-2

45018788
children	parent
using this technique the children would each have to communicate with the parent who would then pass along any info to the other children

45018804
google-chrome	safari
but the main demo page does work in safari google-chrome etc

45018828

i think my problem is due to the onfocus attribute being set or maybe the onclick

45018976
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onfocus	onmousedown	onfocus
should i try setting onmousedown onclick onfocus

45018987
versioning	upgrade
this update cycle will give users a big enough window to plan upgrade from older versioning

45018988
subtract	add
often you can cheat and use an actual x-value and simply subtract add a small value

45018988
range	minimum
or if you also have set minimum and maximum you can calculate the range properly in loop see below

45019005

my solution works well in firefox and google-chrome but it does not work in ie

45019223
min	max
another query to get the min max prices by condition

45019223
min	max
you could do these two queries lazily - first display to your shoppers the basic car info and min max new used prices and then when your shopper clicks on the used number like amazon fetch the market offers just for the used cars

45019223
min	max
for the min max sales you are needing to do an aggregation so group by is your friend

45019223
min	max
beware min and max are also reserved db words

45019230
implements	extends
simple answer yes if a class is going to be implements or extends

45019230
implements	extends
no if it is not going to be extends or implements

the above is an example of the description element of the rss feed

45019243
g++	gcc
at this moment using std c++14 in g++ gcc 4.9.2 is still not accepting regex_match

45019245
ubuntu	linux
you can absolutely install coremltools 0.4.0 on linux ubuntu 16.04 i am using ubuntu 16.04.2 lts

ubuntu	linux
i m reading it from a adafruit ft232h chip and i m using python 2.7.6 on ubuntu linux

45019281
cos	sin
the vertex method involves using sin cos to compute points on the edge of a circle as well as how to upload such data into a buffer and use that buffer to render with

45019281
cos	sin
a person who knows how to do point-in-circle does not know how to use sin and cos to compute the points on a circle

45019281
cos	sin
as such if you then move on to doing spheres you have to teach them about sin and cos

45019300
put	get
sorted will get all the elements put them into an array or arraylist depending if the size is known sort that and them give one element at a time to the map operation

45019338
put	get
in where cluse put condition for the document status inactive you wil get inactive document only

45019399
children	parent
one would expect that when selecting a parent in a grouping all it s children would get selected as well

45019438
implements	extends
one solution i could think of was to create progressrequestbody by extends okhttp multipartbody class instead of requestbody but okhttp3 implements multipartbody as a final class making it impossible to extends

45019457
setcontentview	findviewbyid
move the findviewbyid to after the call to setcontentview

45019466
put	get
however i would like to put in placeholders otherwise the actual hashtags get translated and that doesn t point to the same results as the original tweet

45019649
post	get
you can just do self left join with post values and do get results as below

45019755
oncreate	onstart
however when it does this it not starts at onstart rather than oncreate which i expected but what i found is that the getintent does not have data from the notification i clicked on from the documentation it sounds like it has the intent from creating the app

45019760
subtract	add
add or subtract # of days or partial days

45019760
datediff	difference
note you cannot simply use sql serverâ s datediff function instead because it does not compute age as most people would expect in that if the two date-times happens to cross a calendar clock date-time boundary of the units specified if even for a tiny fraction of that unit itâ ll return the difference as 1 of that unit vs

45019760
subtraction	addition
datetime which are prolly the 2 biggest and also at the same time prolly the 2 least likely needed which begs the question why use it when you lose the implicit easy conversions to floating-point numeric # of days for addition subtraction age vs

45019760
min	max
c a standard or at least should be standard ad-hoc query to monitor troubleshoot values in a column that may not be valid ever any longer and or may need to be deprecated is to list for each value the occurrence count and if available the min avg and max date-time stamps associated with that value

45019790
folder	directory
the updated file is in the same directory as the input file one level down in a folder called updated

45019821

problem is i cant get new attached elements to the canvas to fire the ondragover event i put on mypath which is simply

45019829
cdr	cons
remember a list is defined if and only if the cdr part of each cons is also a cons cell or an empty list

45019834
nsstring	nsdata
also find the solution here converting uiimage to nsdata and nsdata to nsstring for posting images to a server

45019928
google-chrome	safari
i ve been trying and searching for a way to increase the native quota on safari both ios desktop and google-chrome i ve tried with no success and searched almost everywhere

cos	sin
for this case just swap sin a and cos a

45020036
post	get
when it comes to make get or post requests to get responses no problem for me but sending a simple cookie seems to be a very weird matter considering that nothing about org.apache.http

45020043
puts	gets
which gets a pdf from stdin and puts the output on stdout

45020065
mouse	keyboard
dev random typically get its entropy source from keyboard mouse input which cannot provide enough randomness on a headless virtual machine

45020074
int	chars
if you have a chars array with int values then the easiest way is to multiply each element of the array by 10 so you can sum the next chars value to the tens that were multiplied

45020093
gridview	repeater
we recently switched from gridview control to repeater and since then the code stopped worked working

45020106

i was able to follow an example and get a constant array to post to my controller normally

45020188
width	height
what i want to happen ideally i d like the flex space to be in the vertical dimension so that the svg sizes to fit the width of the window and the height is scaled to fit

45020227
domcontentloaded	addeventlistener
if you take a look again in mdn documentation they will recommend you in section notes to use domcontentloaded and domframecontentloaded events which can be handling by addeventlistener

45020269
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead or explicitly loops until a certain number

45020286
google-chrome	safari
i want the href of that button to be opened on safari browser if the button is being clicked from an ios device even if the user is accessing the page on google-chrome

45020286
google-chrome	safari
opening the popup on safari from google-chrome this is the tricky part i am not sure if it is possible

45020324
serializable	deserialization
using the same code for serializable and deserialization is even more of a pain i cannot off hand figure out how

45020387

this is because np.reshape doesn t like having data with mixed dtypes and i m okay with having my int expressed as double

45020430
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
you ll have to do this for every uinavigationcontroller uinavigationbar and uinavigationitem in your app and that s painful

45020430

45020464
pull	push
finally i suppose if you want to catch every time your timer isn t called for 10 seconds but you don t want to nest your timing thread could push events onto a threadsafe queue and your notification thread could pull them off and send the events one at a time

45020525
inline	constexpr
as you pointed out c++17 introduces inline class member variables and static constexpr variables automatically qualify

45020525
inline	constexpr
you are not allowed to redeclare inline variables outside the class as you saw in your second example but an exception was made for constexpr because previously you were allowed and in fact required to do so but the syntax is deprecated

45020581
tensorflow	cudnn
tensorflow cannot find cudnn

libjpeg	cimg
i have a problem with libjpeg installation.i need it so as to use cimg library and have posibility to save .jpg files

45020598
screens	tablet
idea is that users keep their tablet flat on the table for sake of simplicity only x and y for now and to scroll the picture one that is too big to fit the screens by moving their tablet yes this app has to use tablet movement sorry no fingers allowed

45020697
ionic	nativescript

you can detect the os the user is using and if it google-chrome then suggest the user to open it in safari and also provide the link where to download it from

45020799
virtualenv	conda
in the cmd terminal use conda create to make a virtualenv in my anaconda package

45020799
virtualenv	conda
in sublime text 3 navigate to the sublimerepl package settings and add the path to the anaconda conda virtualenv folder

45020875
subtract	add
the idea is simply to add or subtract half the divisor value before dividing as this will round away from zero

45020908
portrait	landscape
you map is in square size and most of devices are in rectangular size so you need to keep your map in center of screen either you re using portrait or landscape mode

45020927
int	boolean
a workaround i found to notify when all requests are done is to update an int and a boolean class members for every request s response or fail

hide	show
for this im using show hide and delay which is turning out to be less than ideal as all the stages of the app are queued in seconds making fault finding difficult

45020978
range	minimum
the idea of the code is that we have a range of int s and we want to find the minimum within that range of indexes according to the provided comparator

45021044
min	max
my results need to be grouped by columns a and b the max of last_date and the min of next date

45021044
min	max
in the case where there is an exact duplication of columns a b max last_date and min next_date but the values for columns c and d don t match then i don t care which one is returned - but i must only return one row not multiples

45021052

nsurlprotocol subclasses are only registered globally for nsurlconnection

45043533
nsurlprotocol	nsurlsession
if you want to register an nsurlprotocol in such a way that it would affect third-party libraries the only way i m aware of is by swizzling all of the session creation methods on nsurlsession and wrapping them with code that injects your custom protocol into the configuration on the way in

45043551

has anyone been able to this for tvos not just ios

45043742
boost	allocator
after some performance experiments it seemed that using char16_t arrays may boost performance sometimes up to 40-50 but it seems that using std u16string without any copying and allocator should be as fast as c arrays

45043742
clang	llvm
i m using clang apple llvm version 8.1.0 clang-802.0.42 on mac

45044613
jobs	cron
cron jobs are not specified to run at a particular date but are instead specified to run at recurring times

45044646
width	height
note that comparing offsetwidth and height vs viewbox width and height needs to consider the value of the preserveaspectratio attribute on the svg to be precise

45044646
width	height
be sure to use x and y attributes to place your and width and height values to size it

45044646
width	height
when a foreignobject is added to the list of elements to keep resized its original x y width height values are recorded

45044646
width	height
when the window resizes code is triggered that a calculates the scale of each svg actual pixels versus viewbox size and then b for each foreignobject registered it adjusts the width height to be correct and then scales the element down to fit in the original location

45044690

range	minimum
how can i enforce a minimum value on a range input without setting the start of the range as the minimum

45044742
hide	show
goal turn click here to choose a logo into a toggle button to show and hide image options

45044757
range	minimum
you set current value to be equal to minimum value - so it looks like that you have range start equals to 0 but actually it s indeed 50

45044786
post	get
if you use user.create with the same arguments you will get an id an updated at and a created_at - but this still is not making a post request to your controller its simply saving it to your database

length and percentages values for width and height on this element

i m learning ionic 3 angular 4 and ngrx design pattern

45068701
hash	salt
while it is possible that two different admins could have the same password as long as you created the stored password with password_hash it is improbable that your current code would miss-identify a user because each account should get a randomly assigned salt for the hash

45068701
hash	salt
since the value of the hash password is dependent on the salt - which is effectively unique per row there is no way to optimize the query performance around the hash or the cleartext of the password - you need to use the asserted identity

45068730
getter	setter
you can do it by declaring a getter property but ignoring the setter

45068745
for-loop	loops
i have created a execute sql task to extract the data a for each loops container to loops through the result set and execute sql task within the for-loop container to insert the result set data into another database table

45068771
portrait	landscape
this is needed as the status bar is re-initialized when coming back from landscape to portrait

45068775
hide	show
there is no intricate logic which could show hide or do anything with the background

45068789

i want to be able to put a few tags on each post so that site visitors can click on or search whatever s relevant for them in the archives semicolons geometry etc. and all the relevant post will come up blog style

45068911
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the problem is that it looks like google-chrome and new versions of safari now show the drop down options as the same font size as the select element where as firefox shows the dropdown in the browser-native font size which we prefer

45068911
google-chrome	safari
this seems like a strange behavior on behalf of google-chrome safari because they don t allow other styles to carry over to from font color etc

45068911
google-chrome	safari
we really want to stick with native rather than designing something custom to maintain the native mobile select interfaces of ios safari android google-chrome etc

45068943
factors	matrix
for larger matrix the gain appears to be around a factors 9-10

45068961

testing ajax calls to https endpoints in the ide do not work due to ssl issues since the preview tab is an iframe

45068975
maven	pom.xml
even though i did not originally have this line in my pom.xml maven was still building a jar file with all the resource files despite changing their names

45068987
octal	decimal
the lo specifier means the argument is a long and it should be printed in octal base-8 . this means that you re not printing the value in decimal so even if you d expect to get the value 15 dec you d instead see 17 the octal representation of the number

45069063
int	double
i put something together that seems to work for int float double but will not work for strings

ostringstream	std
the regular std ostringstream is not wide

45069258
post	get
in the meantime to get unblocked you can add the references to the 15063 sdk manually as described in this blog post

45069264
for-loop	loops	for-loop	if-statement	loops	if-statement
one thought is that i could use a for-loop to run through all of the passwords and i will likely end up doing this but that doesn t get rid of the need for the nested if-statement within loops

45069296
hadoop	ambari
and restarted all services in hdfs yarn and mapreduce2 through ambari after restarting my jobs are failing with the same error and checked the etc hadoop conf container-executor.cfg content looks it reset to initial stage as below

45069302
build.gradle	gradlew
however you can use this simple gradlew build.gradle file to get the gradlew api jar files and import them into your non-gradle java project

45069312
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
i m trying to decide between using sqldependency or sqlcachedependency to monitor changes to our database

45069312
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
i ve also read that sqlcachedependency uses sqldependency but you can specify polling time which makes me think it acts a bit differently

45069326
google-chrome	firefox
the same html page in firefox and google-chrome for comparison

45069326
google-chrome	firefox
is this a bug with firefox or is there some specific reason firefox refuses to render these but google-chrome and the others don t

45069336
scenekit	arkit
but visual-inertial odometry isn t an exact science so it s possible that arkit thinks you moved to the left by 10.5 cm â in that case your virtual object will appear to slip to the right by 5 mm even though its position in the arkit scenekit coordinate space

45069336
scenekit	arkit
so even though the real-world position of the plane isn t changing its position in arkit scenekit coordinate space is

45069413
width	height
right now it only works if the width and height are the exact same

45069413
width	height
however my output when the width and height are different is similar to the output that is shown here read write simple bmp image c++ - basically it s skewed incomplete and repetitive not the actual image

45069413
int	chars
also note that bwidth and bheight are declared as unsigned int whereas pixels is defined as unsigned chars

45069417
prng	random
however i would avoid this if possible since various compilers most notably mingw implement it with as a prng in fact producing the same sequence every time to alert humans that it s not properly random

45069417
prng	random
now that we have our pieces with minimal overhead we can generate the desired bits of random entropy to seed our prng

45069441
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
because from what you ve explained in the comments section if i understood it correctly is that when you tap the button the image changes and then you navigate to a different view but then when you navigate back viewdidappear _ and viewwillappear _ will be triggered

45069455
jstl	taglib
if you are using jstl tags on your views use c taglib

45069456
lan	localhost
this is more difficult in that the router in a local lan setting does not typically allow any incoming connection attempts to a localhost

45069492
equals	tostring
difference in equals hashcode tostring

45069492
equals	tostring
the most important difference between definition 1 and definitions 2 3 is that in definition 1 the equals hashcode and tostring methods are overridden for you

45069505
g++	gcc
my first thought was the symbolic files gcc g++ c++ in usr bin which were all pointing to old versions

45069505
g++	gcc
i updated the links to point to the new versions and gcc g++ actively recognize using version 7 but cmake3 still can t recognize it

45069658
min	max
i removed the min and max input attributes and moved your ng-change listener logic into a timeout call

45069706
min	max
you need to remove min and max attributes due to this validation does not allow to change the ng-model

45069706
min	max
alternative if you want to maintain the min and max you can add ng-model-options like this

45069731
width	height
the gradient works almost fine but as you can see there is a 1 pixel height with 100 width light red colored line which shouldn t be there

45069740
post	get
cors does not prevent anyone from sending get or post requests to your application or exposed api url

i m building a mobile application for ios and android using ionic 2 angular 2 and apache cordova with a firebase database and authentication system

45069913
for-loop	arrays
say that integerarray 0 2 the original before sorting was parallel with say namearray 0 greg namearray 1 george if i ran a for-loop to print my arrays values how would i make it so that names arrays would be parallel with my sorted integer arrays

45069920
folder	directory
previously i copied this with a walk and copy function but it ended up creating a directory named filename.asar instead of an actual file named filename.asar this function seems to work on all other files and folder correctly except for .asar archives

45069920
folder	directory
no new files or folder are shown in the destination directory

45069931
width	height
the function at the moment can only change the drawing s coordinates x and y and width and height

45069951
pull	push
from the perspective of english language i think push and pull are symmetric

45069962
post	get
i get the video just fine thanks to the help provided by these two post

45069962
post	get
i have seen a number of blog post that describe how to use quicktime to do the same thing and they all claim that you get video and audio

45069976
cout	cin
btw not related to the question since you are writing std cout and std cin then it would be better if you keep the consistency with std endl instead of endl

45070097
getter	setter
try using a getter and setter

45070117
folder	directory
actually these characters are the ones not allowed for windows directory folder name

45070129
gesturedetector	motionevent

45070186
scikit-learn	word2vec
i have tried training a word2vec model using gensim based on company names only and averaged up the word vectors before feeding it into scikit-learn s logistic regression but had terrible results

45070204
width	height
to complete the answer so you can use the above function with the values of centerx centery width height and angle of 2 rotated rectangles i have added the below functions

45070232
post	get
use post if you get data from form

45070241
dplyr	stringr
i have also used stringr and dplyr for string and data manipulation

45070248
for-loop	arrays
when the variable form_loop with for-loop executes it only executes the last element of its arrays the f14 one i tried console.log the queries and will output like this

45070255
getter	setter
in your model you can set the route key to obfuscate it without having to mess with getter and setter

45070403
versioning	upgrade
the main reason for tfs being unable to upgrade team project collections usually is that their data was already either corrupted incomplete or stuck between schema versioning

45070419
stdout	stderr
print your logs on stderr instead of stdout

45070419
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to your logfile and stdout to a powershell pipe | if you want a redirection - or you can execute the python script within parentheses so the result can be used on command line

45070427
put	get
have you try to change it back to get method and put all of your data array back to the url

45070428
post	get
change your controller mapping to accept get and post requests

45070451
pull	push
of course as you said in english push and pull are very much indeed opposites to each other

45070451
fast-forward	merge
this is because you will have to do the merge fast-forward necessarily to use the updates in a non-detached head state

45070451
fast-forward	merge
when you push you are not implying the need for a merge fast-forward you re only implying an update of the object database on the remote and its list of refs

centos	linux
however when running on a cluster with linux centos 6 it throws out a very long error which includes 500 lines of i guess rcpp code and the last chunk is as follows

45071147
integer	unsigned
the hue is represented as degrees from 0 to 360 in opencv to fit into the an 8-bit unsigned integer format they degrees are divided by two to get a number from 0 to 179

45071147
min	max
that s why hsv is so popular---you can select colors by hue regardless of their brightness or darkness so a dark red and bright red can be selected just by specifying the min and max of the hue channel

45071147
min	max
and from left to right we have the min to max s values and from top to bottom we have the min to max v values

45071147
min	max
the idea behind the function is simple find where the values of each channel fall between min and max and then all the channels together

45071147
min	max
you can create trackbars in opencv and use them to control the min and max for each channel and have the python program update your mask every time you change the values

45071249
post	get
if you call with method post - you get a json return with something like this

45071617
min	max
use min instand of max

45071668
for-loop	loops
they behave differently in that the for-loop produces the expected results waits for 10 child processes to complete however the while loops does not produce the same results

45071688
children	parent
when parent is selected all children will be selected

45071688
children	parent
when all the children are selected the parent would be selected too

45071688
children	parent
otherwise if one of children is deselected then the parent would be deselected too

45071688
children	parent
when all the children are selected there should be only parent s name that showed in the selected filed

the queue is being processed via your magento cron jobs

45071838
jobs	cron
please ensure your cron jobs has been set up and is running correctly

45071873
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i am pretty sure it does nothing other than display the passwd as sudo apparently through an appropriate entry in etc sudoers works without you having to give a passwd

45071873
sudo	passwd
generally speaking you can use sudo -s to make sudo expect the passwd on stdin

45071894
stdout	stderr
these three file descriptors you can think of them as â œdata pipesâ are often called stdin stdout and stderr

45071909
sudo	passwd
try this bin echo -e passwd n | sudo apt-get update

45071909

put	get
iam thinking something i can put in the question mark to get the second line data.anything in format function to goto a particular line and get the data of the line

45072208
division	multiplication
if you do the division happens first introducing error and then the multiplication increases the size of the error to the point that it can t be hidden because 0.35000000000000003 is a different float value than 0.35

45072208
integer	fractions
if you instead pass integer numerator and denominator values to the fractions constructor it will take care of simplifying the fractions for you without any floating point inaccuracy

45072213

here s a solution using modulo and division

45072426
stdout	stderr
joining stdout and stderr output streams works like petseral commented though the syntax is not the most intuitive

45072426
stdout	stderr
the weirdish syntax of means that stderr stream 2 is to be added into the stdout stream 1

45072444

45072696
getter	setter
also the getter and setter should than changed

45072749
width	margin
if the measurement of 1ch was actually equivalent of the width of 1 character in the font then i would simply count how many characters there are in my old content and use that as a negative margin for the new content

45072814
margin	height
if you need a vertical line that spans the full height of your div and you have no concerns about needing a margin a css border could do the trick

45072903
screens	tablet
i want to make simple app with cordova jquery i want to generate width of div based on width of screens oh phone tablet

45072937
button	checkbox
if you want to edit the data by way of update insert delete then you could add some checkbox below that gridview which also has button labelled insert update delete which would have the necessary queries pointing to your database on what action to take

45072944
getter	setter	inherited	properties
your problem is that you are using the deprecated __proto__ properties which is a getter setter on object.prototype - but your objects don t inherited from that so it s undefined at first and the assignment creates a standard properties with the name __proto__

45072949
width	height
so in theory from given coordinates in config i need to subtract half of div s height and half of div s width width depends on text inside div and height depends on font size

squash	merge	squash	branch
at the end we end up with merge request that contains tens of commits and i want to squash them we are deleting the branch after the merge so rebase is an option too but it is a painful and long procedure with a lot of conflicts to resolve

45073172
squash	merge
the easiest way is with merge - - squash but then the merge request is not closed automatically and doesn t keep track of the merge

45073196
joystick	keyboard
by default your project should be able to detect both keyboard and joystick input

45073219
hide	show
if backclick is true it show the 1st div otherwise hide it and show the 2nd div

45073246
width	height
given internal bitmap size which is not same as original bitmap height and width

i could just stop there and say there is no reason whatsoever for base 2 to be different than base 10 from base 13 from base 27 you just put a period between two numbers to indicate where the last whole number is and the first part of the fractions

45078777
base	fractions
now this may have been in grade school or later in middle school but they eventually taught us about scientific notation and or other ways to represent numbers by moving that decimal point around sort of the decimal still represented the boundary between the last whole number and the beginning of the fractions but off to the side we had a multiply against the base number to a power

45078777

in my above case with a 2 to the power 4 the binary for 4 is 100 using 8 bits twos complement that is 00000100 to encode it into the single precision ieee 754 floating point format that becomes 10000011 i simply added 127 or add 128 10000100 and then subtract one

int	double
hardware with ll sc atomics instead of x86-style memory-destination instruction such as arm and most other risc cpus can do atomic rmw operations on double and float without a cas but you still have to get the data from fp to int registers because ll sc is usually only available for int regs like x86 s cmpxchg

getter	setter
my advise covert haspaid to a field and use a setter or getter to set and get the value

45089115
udp	tcp
that should have entries for both 53 tcp and 53 udp

45089117
udp	tcp
this means that if you ask getaddrinfo for an udp socket for service 8081 you will not find anything because tproxy is only defined for tcp and not udp

45089117
udp	tcp
so there are services like xmpp-client that do have both tcp and udp ports defined

45089117
udp	tcp
because tcp and udp are different protocols over ip it makes sense that a service could use a different port number for tcp and udp communications

45089117
udp	tcp
so it is unreasonable to assume that the service database should just return the same port numbers for tcp and udp sockets

45089117
udp	tcp
in other words you encounter the error because you mistakenly assume that because some service uses a tcp port with a name registered in the service database you should be able to use that name to specify an udp port number too

45089117
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are separate protocols and their port number spaces are separate

45089117
udp	tcp
for example tcp port 512 is used by the unix exec r-service whereas udp port 512 is used by the biff mail notification service

instead use the data memory using static or global variable or the dynamic heap memory using the malloc calloc for creating the required memory as per the availability of the processor memory mapping

45089975
memcpy	memmove
finally to equal the speed of raw pointers not only would compilers need to optimize across these two loops they would need to have a transformation which recognizes that the whole thing can be replaced by memcpy or memmove 2

javafx uses a painter s algorithm painting the children of a parent node in order from first to last so that the last nodes will be painted over the first nodes

i can make it work for landscape too with a simple inline-block but then it breaks for portrait

getter	setter
setter getter are a fairly useful global design feature but you don t have to scrap them to introduce the notation

45100253
getter	setter
when the objects you re using are likely to be used in this sort of context streams of data then overriding those operators can make a huge difference to the readability and ease of understanding of your code compared to normal getter setter

45100253

i thought instead of proving a new interface comparator to compare objects with multiple attribute java can simply extended comparable interface to achieve the comparator interface logic

45100521
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
if you want to actually change what object they re using as their prototype you can only do that if you have a reference to the instance s you want to change and only on a javascript engine supporting es2015 features by using object.setprototypeof or in a web browser environment and if the object ultimately inherited from object.prototype via the __proto__ accessor properties not recommended

45100521
inherited	properties
i don t think you do given the question but if you just want to change the state of the object they use as their prototype perhaps by adding y you can of course just set properties on it and because javascript s prototypical inherited is live there s a live link back to the prototype from an instance you can then access those properties on any instance that inherited from the prototype even if they were created before you made the change

these circumstances of x86 32-bit and 64bit platforms essentially mean that ebp rbp register can be used without any prefix in the processor instructions that access memory

45101254
difftime	mktime
you can write a comparison function using mktime and difftime and then use qsort to sort an array of tm structs

45101254
int	double
since difftime returns a double representing a time difference in seconds the return value may not be representable in an int which is the value returned by comparison functions used by qsort

45101254
int	double
where typical of 4 byte int s date differences of more than about 68 years will lead to overflow in the conversion from double to int and thus undefined behavior

45101254
difftime	mktime
chqrlie has pointed out in the comments that this method could also lead to erroneous comparisons for extremely close dates fractions of a second since if difftime mktime date_1 mktime date_2 is less than 1 in magnitude the value will be converted to 0 upon return thus comparing as equal

the cron daemons on linux and the scheduled tasks service on windows are systemd components that run continuously

45101446
daemon	cron
neither the cron daemon or the scheduled tasks service cares much about the command they run

45101446
daemon	cron
it is possible to write a php script that takes the responsibilities of the cron daemon but it is not recommended

45101446

all these apparently minor things are already handled and work properly by the cron daemon on linux and the scheduled tasks service on windows

16-bit	64bit
in general it is faster to use integer instructions operating on 32-bit or 64bit general purpose registers than 8-bit or 16-bit registers

45101480
cpu	processors
although the knights landing is not a general-purpose cpu i anticipate the tendency that on all future processors probably in a next major microarchitecture change namely since the icelake microarchitecture which is the intel cpu microarchitecture based on the 10nm node that is expected to replace cannonlake in 2019 - the 8-bit and 16-bit register operation will be slow and not just write but the read also disclaimer this anticipation of mine is a pure speculation

int	chars
the behaviour of the chars output stream such as std cout is to print the represented chars when you insert an int of type chars

45104867
int	chars
so you can print the int value of a chars by converting it to another int type

45104867
int	chars
hh is for int of size chars u is to for unsigned as you probably are interested in the unsigned representation

45104868

45105557
width	height
it s worth bearing in mind that you are explicitly setting the height of your rows so you can t dynamically adjust the width of the label and expect the table to adjust but if you wanted to always have the text on a single line then you would need to look into adjusting the width of the label and height of the table row dynamically

using an existing installation of nexus repository manager 3 populated with data and configuration as the target repository manager incurs restrictions that make the upgrade more complex and potentially requires re-configuring the versioning 2 instance prior to the upgrade as well as re-configuring nexus repository manager 3 after the upgrade

45111224
int	double
the main advantage of this is that this same syntax works for all numeric types well for int long float and double

45111224
int	chars
you d need a cast for short chars and byte because they are widened to int when you add them

45111231
children	parent
given that you probably have a small number of subcategory levels ie 3 not thousands the simplest solution would probably be to execute a query for every parent to get its list of children

45111278
for-loop	loops
instead of doing a for-loop just use a foreach loops

45111292
hide	show
added some functionality to hide show the sidebars as-needed per page

45111308
post	get
also in your case better to use get rather than post

45111312
min	max
for max min like operations one needs to be even more careful

45111330
realloc	malloc
if you want to take this approach you can realloc arr 0 but the others need to use malloc

45111350
min	max
the idea is to validate each node of the tree as such that it is always between the min and max value

45111350
min	max
start with integer.min_value and integer.max_value as the initial input for min and max

45111359
move	drag
i get same error when i for instance add event and move him by drag and drop

45111398
put	get
if i don t put the function calls in a while loop i get a nullpointerexception error when i try to process the file because the file has a null value

45111417
folder	directory
i have a series of folder under home and have chrooted all users except for one to their home directory - for example when user 12345 logs in then connect to which is actually home 12345

hide	show
i have a second graphical element ontop of this image whose alpha i want to use to hide parts of the image below it while the top element itself isn t show

45111434
scipy	scikit-learn
unfortunately the current implementations of scipy s kmeans2 and scikit-learn s kmeans only support euclidean distance

45111447
min	max
i m creating a tool to modify the rows and columns of a data table based on a couple of inputs min step-up and max

45111454
min	max
the idea is to validate each node of the tree as such that it is always between the min and max value

45111454
min	max
start with integer.min_value and integer.max_value as the initial input for min and max

45111511
postgresql	mysql
note this is sql standard not only mysql or postgresql

45111564
hash	md5
maybe you can generate a md5 hash using hashlib

45111793
prepare	execute
in general making an identifier based on a variable requires that you use dynamic sql like with prepare and execute

45111827
for-loop	loops
because apparently the length of player1cards is always greater than 0 the condition is false at the first loops causing the for-loop to immediately abort

45111837
defaultdict	enumerate
use enumerate and a defaultdict

45111839
int	chars
otherwise ifelse will just give int instead of the chars

45111858
factors	matrix
look at the structure of objects with str - you ll quickly see that your data frame has a column of class factors and your matrix at the end is of class integer

45111858
factors	matrix
probably your text file was imported as a factors class within a data frame and your matrix defaulted to another class

45111858
factors	matrix
when you assign the factors to the matrix it gets coerced to an integer

45111906
maven	pom.xml
3 then right click in pom.xml and choose add as maven project

45111907
instances	transient
you won t have to worry about extra instances or anything of that sort since the service is stateless and the actual objects returned by the factory are effectively transient

45111907
instances	transient
by contrast frameworks like aurelia allow for services to be decorated with a simple transient and consumers to explicitly request a new instances in a similarly simple fashion

45111914
switching	screens
so i ve created a simple component to switching the screens

45111998
folder	directory
test-results folder is getting generated under the project directory instead of target directory

i have tried using the below css the seperate the fitlers from the buttons but there filtering and buttons stay grouping together like this

45112221
width	height
an example object contains an x and y coordinate to begin drawing a width and a height

45112221
width	height
the height and width are initially set to 0

45112221
width	height
what we want to do now if you can imagine is create a height and width of the rectangle while we re dragging the mouse over the canvas and the mouse is down

45112221
width	height
it s easy to manipulate the height and width because as long as you re only able to draw one at a time it will always be the most recent object added to the draw array

45112243
multiplying	add
you might want to add extra column h with formula like h2 if c2 0 1 with 1 0 and multiplying it as well in g

45112286
pop-up	dialog
on my mac it always crashes my extension pop-up and the confirm dialog never appears

int	boolean
things like int boolean nils etc can be passed on the stack while larger things like strings and objects can be passed by reference

45112605
getter	setter
if you want an equivalent to your original c# code you must be aware that properties in c# always translate to methods -- getter and setter

45112605
getter	setter
in your example you re using automatic properties that means as you don t specify a function body for your getter and setter a default body is automatically created for you simply accessing a private field

45112627
kerberos	ntlm
while it may in fact be doing that it could also be failing over to using ntlm and then succeeding on that because kerberos is broken somewhere

45112660
maven	pom.xml
below is my pom.xml i used maven

because opening 100 threads to execute expensive cpu operations on a processors with just 8 cores definitely is not a good idea

45112737
width	height
like height width and file which are never used outside of main

45112755
bash	zsh
in practice it works on bash dash ksh pdksh sh yash and zsh

45112764

45113004
swift	objective-c
when working with swift and objective-c i m always concerned about making things thread safe

45113012

i am trying to convert a float directly into an unsigned integer without any of the implicit conversion math so not the c style or static casts just copying the bytes directly to the other

45113192
integer	unsigned
in windows visual studio 2015 the sizes for a float and a unsigned integer are the same 4 bytes so i don t think there is any problem on that end

45113192
integer	unsigned
every single bit stored in the float should be stored in the unsigned integer

45113202

mp4	webm
here is a full batch script that will convert mp4 to webm and calculate and match the bitrates automatically using

45113390

because chars s have underlying number representations which we can treat like int but since system.out.println looks for string representations of objects when it sees a chars type it knows to print the chars not the int

45113410
laravel	codeigniter
i have worked with codeigniter before but never with laravel

45113444
google-chrome	firefox
i started experimenting with different combinations of windows authentication providers negotiate ntlm browsers firefox google-chrome ie and operating systems linux windows

mysql and postgresql do not

45113573
width	height
i thought about detecting the screen width and height via javascript and translating the into px myself for approxitemwidth and approxitemheight but since this kind of solution seems pretty easy to implement it makes me wonder if there s a reason this is not possible by design

during indexing to wrap a swift value as an opaque objective-c object or convert it to a corresponding objective-c object

45120051
accessor	ivar
if you implement all of the accessor methods the compiler will no longer automatically synthesize the ivar for you

45120051
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the reason is that the compiler is smart enough to know that if you re taking over the accessor methods you may well not need the ivar namely that you might be doing something radically different computing values from some other properties setting getting values from some different store etc

45120051
accessor	ivar
you may want the compiler to synthesize the ivar in which case you add the above synthesize statement but it s equally likely that you ve implemented the accessor methods because no backing ivar is needed in which case you d omit the above synthesize statement

45120051
accessor	ivar
but in those cases that you really need to write your own accessor methods then you have to explicitly tell the compiler whether you need it to synthesize the ivar for you too or not

45120061
width	height
simply calculate the ratios of width and height in your rcdf to your original image then call setscaling

45120305
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will place all of them in the call stack event loops and all of them will be executed after 5000 milliseconds since this is what set time out will so it will schedule the execution of the code to 5000 milliseconds from now for all of them

45120305

cpython	pypy
for the following experiments pypy 5.8.0 and cpython 2.7.12 were used

45120558
cpython	pypy
cpython and pypy use different garbage collector strategies and i think pypy s trade-off is to be faster but to use more memory

45120558
cpython	pypy
the guys from pypy have a great article about their garbage collector and its comparison to cpython

45120558

45120959
folder	directory
had i gotten that question and didn t get any more clarification as to which os or even if i had since i m not intimately familiar how each os stores their folder names i would have answered along the lines of probably the number of characters in the string plus 1 byte for a null terminator or perhaps 1 or 2 bytes for some other way of setting off the file name from the rest of the information stored in the file system s file directory data structure.

range	minimum
however in order to be compliant with the c language standards the compiler would need to use 12-bit characters because 6-bits does not satisfy the minimum range

45121358
128bit	64bit	16-bit	64bit
most hardware component manufacturers have standardized on 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit 64bit or 128bit units

45121358

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
firstly it s not doing anything because your for-loop end condition should be checking loops parameter x against the length of the ans arrays

45121847
for-loop	arrays
arrays do not have a numeric primitive so you want your for-loop condition to read x ans.length

45121851

what i would recommend is that the disable button would call a function that makes some logic about the number of checkbox expanded and the number of selected items and returns the button state true for active otherwise false

45122269
mvp	presenter
i use rxjava and mosby mvp to create mvvm-style connection between the fragment and presenter

45122273
width	height
instead of using fixed width and height in pixels you can create dialog_helper.xml where you define some transparent view in relative units from which you will later copy width and height

45122273
width	height
since this view is contained in activity layout it has measured width and height which can be used as dialog parameters

45122273
width	height
note after screen rotate the same width and height will be used therefore i will recommend to wrap your dialog into the dialogfragment which is automatically recreated when device configuration is changed so dialog will be created with updated dialogdim according to current screen orientation

45122297
hide	show
if you also want to hide it when the user click on it by second time you need to add a ternary comparation show index

45122398
post	put
i put a debugger in the action and it looks like the post is found and deleted properly so i suspect the issue is with the way i m evaluating the test

google-chrome	firefox
as you can see by looking in source code in browser or below the first button fills the iframe with many boxes and immidiately tries to update iframe s height which does not work - it looks like the height is not updated yet in dom or something like that so i though the second button will do - it uses 1 second of delay doesn t really matter how many seconds i tried even 5 sec but no here height is read wrong a little less than should be which results in vertical scroll bar tested on firefox and google-chrome - why

45122662

45122748
range	minimum
assuming that range is meant to limit minimum maximum number of characters in a given string you can use stringlenbetween from the validation package

45122764
put	get
basically you just want to get the text split it and process it and then put it back together and assign it back as that nodes text

45122767

45122930
jobs	cron
however cron jobs may run

45122934
hide	show
we can override the media query with a simple window.onresize event watcher and keep the show element visible or hide it when the screen goes over 1000px

45122934
hide	show
in this solution we can forget about a window.onresize event watcher and simply add a new .shown class to the element which will use a new set of css rules to show hide the element

give us details about the image that is causing the exception what s the width and height of it how much memory does it take

45123122
folder	directory
i want to acess the url of site2 with example 111.111.111.111 8091 because i want to point the dns for some domain and go direct to directory c xampp htdocs site2 not the folder selection

45123160
min	max
i want to select the whole table and add 6 new columns min and max time per deliver_by at a store

45123160
min	max
i could accomplish almost the correct result with the query below the problem is that in case deliver_by px is not present i don t get a null but instead the min max for the delivery at the store

45123160
min	max
i really would like to use a partition by so i wrote this to add the new min max columns

45123196
min	max
you can do it with a case expression in min and max

45123237
hide	show
this skeleton helper will allow you to easily mimic jquery show hide but with in out css3 transition animations

for-loop	arrays
i outer for-loop runs for the nums arrays and j runs for all subsets computed so far and keeps adding ith number to previously computed subsets

45123403
for-loop	arrays
let s say n is the size of nums arrays then the outer for-loop is o n

45123403
for-loop	loops
inner for-loop grows exponentially doubled the size each i iteration thus the inner loops is o 2 n

45123434
mouse	keyboard
since the play button starts the screenreader for the visually impaired blind and blind people do not use a mouse this key must be pressed using a keyboard only method a spacebar or an enter

45123482
width	height
what has worked best is doing some magic to bind the stackpane s scale so that it fills its parent instead of binding its height and width properties

45123492
post	get
now i am trying to post to get on auth token which currently does not work

45123492

this is my route which i call get route works post route does not work

45123519
width	height
i d like to create a method to calculate the optimal width of a multi-line label to attach several labels in a horizontal row of a fixed height

45123519
width	height
this method works well in other direction when we calculate the height of the text with the fixed width

45123580
min	max
i then want to tag each point with its county s min max mean distance

45123580
min	max
getting min max and mean distance over all obs is easy -- but i can t figure out how to get it by county

45123580
min	max
the min max mean for county 1 is 2.2 5 and 3.5

45123580
min	max
the min max mean for county 2 is 22.4 50 and 34.7

45123605
dplyr	tidyr
here is a solution using functions from dplyr and tidyr

45123663
getter	setter
so what i did was create a base class that has the 25 data members and created all the getter setter methods here then created two new classes that inherited this base class and just created a calculation function for each of these new classes that inherit the base

45123746
children	parent
finished parent model children serialization

45123753
inline	inlining
small candidates can be inline into the caller also again the profiler can tell you that the inlining has happened which arguably turns a multi-dispatch into a -1 step process

45123760
int	chars
so all that s happening is printf is interpreting the int value of 66 as an ascii code 1 and printing the corresponding chars

45123763
int	chars
further since printf is a variadic function a chars is converted to an int by virtue of the default argument promotions

45123763
int	chars
the int argument that is passed to printf corresponding to a c specifier is then converted to an unsigned chars by printf before printing

integer	unsigned
note that the conversion of a signed integer type to an unsigned integer type is well-defined in c and does not involve collecting data from only one byte. rather if the new type can hold the original value the value remains unchanged

45123763
int	chars
for example an int value of -1 would be converted to an unsigned chars value assuming uchar_max is 255 of -1 + 256 or 255 which is within the range of an unsigned chars

45123763
int	chars
note that an int with a value of 66 would be unchanged in the conversion to unsigned chars since 66 is well within the range of an unsigned chars

45123764
int	chars
the null chars constant has the same value 0 with type int but is more explicit for the purpose of representing the null byte

45123783
width	height

45123808
width	height
like this width 810 height 456

45123821
width	height
set height and width to relative you don t want to set a static height and width to the icon or else the background will be exactly 10 pixels in height and width

45123828
strlen	strcpy	memcpy	strcpy
a normal addition would be to include string.h and use strlen and strcpy or memcpy instead of a loop to find your length or copy characters to plural note for long strings memcpy will be more efficient but for 10 char -- it makes no difference let me know if you have any questions

45123840

prepare	execute
can t add this as a comment due to not enough rep but perhaps you can do something similar to what fred -ii- was alluding to by getting the column names from the information schema columns table then execute a prepare statement which i think is roughly the mysql equivalent of dynamic sql but i m not certain to create a query that will get you a query result with only those image columns selected

int	chars
while you could use a set of place-holders and set various conditions to manipulate the int values to accomplish a mid-digit or end-digit swap depending on odd even it is far easier to simply convert your int value to a string and then manipulate the chars

45126873
int	chars
given you are working with int the longest int you will have to address is int_min -2147483648 or 11-chars +1 for the nul-terminating chars

45126873

you can simply use a static chars buffer of 12 chars and call sprintf to convert you int to a string while getting its length in the same call

qvboxlayout	qwidget
i made this with using a custom qtreewidget having qtreewidgetitems adding that to a qvboxlayout which a use as layout for a qwidget

45127726
put	get	int	chars
the mistake you made is to pass to that function a pointer to int therefore not only you get a compiler error because you tried to pass an int pointer to gets for which there are none implicit conversions but even if it compiled it would not have worked as you expected because it would put all the chars which have a size of one byte - most of the times in that area of memory encoded as chars

45127726
int	chars
that means that when you try to dereference one using a pointer to int the chars are read like they were an int

45127726
int	chars
there is an example supposing 1-byte chars 4-bytes int and a little endian machine and that there is an implicit cast from int to chars which does not exist and hopefully will never exist

45127726
int	chars
if in that example we input a string larger than 3 chars which are four if we include the null terminator or the int chars type contains less more than 4 1 byte the program would have crashed because we corrupted other areas of memory

45127726
int	chars
you could use the gets function together with the atoi function to parse the string read from gets using a chars pointer to a free area of memory large enough to contain the string which is pretty hard to allocate to an int but scanf is the best approach

width	height
if a glsurfaceview s width is or height is larger than the device screen it will behave like below

45128342
width	height
for width larger than device width but height is same as device height the glsurfaceview will start drawing from top left corner which co-ordinate will be 0 0 and the extra image will be out of screen right side

45128404

git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

45128617
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

45128617
git-svn	svn2git
if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually

45128617
git-svn	svn2git
the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn

45128617
git-svn	svn2git
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

x86	64bit
to reduce your odds of failure start with the largest items first 64bit then 32 bit the 16 bit then lastly any 8 bit items ideally align on 32 minimum perhaps 64 which one would hope arm and x86 do but that can always change as well as the default can be modified by whomever builds the compiler from sources

folder	dir
well you do need to append the user home dir to that path because otherwise it would not be an absolute path and your application would be able to find it only if it s located in a folder which this path can be resolved from in user home in your case

45129805
min	max
but you can get it the same way as you get the lowest price by useing max instead of min

45130010
width	height
i ve defined its width and height as 250dp and 48dp respectively as shown below in my xml snippet

45130010
width	height
that s why both the height and the width needs to be the same 48dp

45130010
width	height
for supporting devices with different resolution initial width and height can be changed to wrap_content

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
so the simplest solution i can think of is a for-loop that loops through each property of the arrays and if it doesn t match a number out of the second arrays push it into a new arrays

45130168
post	get
in my opinionsï¼œyou add the _mainbottomcontraint twice.first you creat a _mainbottomcontraint and retain it when the keyboard change the _mainbottomcontraint.constaints changes and if the view in self.view.subviews change the frame the system will post a notification and the viewcontroller will recieve it and call viewwilllayoutsubviews like the view will call layoutsubviews.so you creat a _mainbottomcontraint so now there are two bottomcontraint and you get a warning

i mean it is quite easy to understand this is a read-only computed property but what i don t understand is why braces is not put after get word because if i want to create my own computed property like that i should put them and describe its return value

45169232
hide	show
does it mean that apple has wanted to hide implementation of that getter and show property s read-only type and nothing more

45169238

int	chars
we use this because there is no charstream class for some reason but we can still use chars s a and z which will be implicitly converted to their int value

45169647
int	chars
it gets a little messy here as there is no single step conversion from int to string we first need the int interpreted as a chars value

45169647
int	chars
so we cast each int named i to a chars and then wrap that in a conversion from chars to string

45169647
int	chars
in java chars s can be treated as int s because below the surface they are both stored as numbers

caffe	mxnet
the diy instructions to build h2o deep water include a section to integrate either tensorflow mxnet or caffe

45174782
caffe	mxnet
i understand from the h2o slide presentations that with using tensorflow mxnet or caffe the h2o dl models can have more hidden layers using larger datasets with more features

45174804
folder	directory
i strongly encourage you to look into tutorials such as for looking in directory folder etc

45174848
comparator	comparable
and by the way your objects should implement the comparable interface and the method should be called comparator

45174848
equals	compareto
this means that your compareto method can return 0 when the objects are not equals

45174851
equals	compareto
this part is certainly not compatible with the compareto contract as if the hash codes are equals the comparison is not equals

45174857
post	get
how do i redirect from a get request to a post request in express

45174910
coalesce	nullif
select cast coalesce nullif bonus 0 as integer as new_field

45174913
int	double
here s one way to round any double or int including negative numbers to a given number of significant figures

45174916
post	get
it s impossible to redirect from a get request to a post request

45174916
post	get
all you can do is to redirect a post request to a post request but even that can be sometimes tricky but you will never be able to redirect to a different method than the original request unless that different method is get

45174916
post	get
that can be used to redirect a post to a post but note that it is explicitly not allowed to change the method so you cannot use it to redirect a get to a post or even a post to a get which is otherwise possible with a simple 301 or 302 response

45174942
folder	directory
adding that gives you a default directory that you can default to say c code or c work but even without it you can navigate to any folder or file location using the browse button available by default

45174946
int	double
the second change is easy to explain the normalfunction implementation actually double an int and then converts it to a double with an fild opcode at the machine code level

45174956
post	get
i wanna try to get this name of the session passed through the request which was send by post

45174962

the question i have is - how do i get the coordinates x y and dimensions width height of the vertices back into the networkx graph

45174965
apache	nginx
decided i would try a lemp install instead using nginx rather than apache

45174995
getter	setter
edit 21.7.17 i understand that getter and setter methods are much more flexible but in this case it won t be needed

45175017

ubuntu	linux
i have intellij java and groovy installed on my ubuntu linux box

45175061
textview	imageview
i have written a service that listens for udp messages then changes a textview and an imageview based on the parsed message from the udp messages

45175061
textview	imageview
i had previously been using an asynctask to fetch this data however i need it to be constantly fetching the data and updating the textview and imageview objects and due to the ping speed using a while loop to do this caused it to run out of memory due to i assume it running on the ui thread

45175061
textview	imageview
alertassignments is simply an enum that binds image files and strings to ordinal array values so that i can easily change the textview and imageview based on the integer value of the parsed message of the original message xxx

45175093
post	get
i know that there are similar post about this but i have not been able to get any of them to work properly so far

45175129
folder	directory
reason i have a directory with various top-level folder directory and files

45175129
folder	directory
to optimize the amount of dvds used i would like to use python to scan the top-level directory and then group the top-level folder and files into optimal fewest groupings of a certain size 4.7gb in this case

45175129
folder	directory
question i can write the directory scan walk but does anyone know of code or a module that i can use that will optimally group a list of folder file into optimal predetermined size groupings

45175131
serializable	deserialization
the xml created on serializable does not have a namespace xmlns but even then during the deserialization method the program throws an error which says here refers to the actual message name

45175151
getter	setter
instead you should create a property with a public getter and setter

45175194
range	percentile
so the high percentile will be in the range where you will end up with a nan

45175270
put	get
when there is two notifications i will go to chatactivity but the extra that is put to intent is sender id of first one s notification not the selected one how can i get intent of selected notification

45175324
regasm	gacutil
the application works fine when i install the samplebars.dll bandobjectlib.dll using gacutil and also registering samplebars.dll using regasm and i can add it to my taskbar then

45175325
post	put
in a nutshell you will need to make a put post request as specified in the documentation

45175325
post	put
with post you create empty files so you should use put

45175335
for-loop	arrays
first i tried to sort the given arrays with a for-loop

45175354
post	get
the post method however is convenient as it allows me to send a request body which the get request is not supposed to do

45175374
folder	directory
to reiterate i need to modify this working directory selector to submit the form with the 4 inner folder maintained

45175374
folder	directory
i also have a version with 4 of these inputs where you select all 4 folder separately which uploads the files in their 4 separate arrays which is what i need but i need to get it down to one directory select because of human error issues that have come up

45175419
button	checkbox
it shows name lastname a button to delete it and a checkbox to display it s state if the user is active or inactive

45175437
pull	push
you should then be able to push pull to your registry

45175454
ubuntu	linux
when i try to access the healthgraphic api using the latest anaconda installation on linux ubuntu 14.04 python 3.5.2 anaconda custom 64-bit i always get the following error

45175490
width	height
the width for the images is exactly what i thought but i can t get the height to be the same or at least cut off any excess images

45175496
hide	show
this can be easily accomplish by placing a colored div behind the image and then using the following simple jquery to automatically hide the div and show it when the mouse is over

45175497
width	height
if this is not what you would like to achieve you d better provide ascii art or a simple drawing of your desired gui at minimum size and with more width and height

45175566
min	max
if you remove the min and max parameters from the aes call your plot should render correctly

45175593
ionic	angular
i am looking to build a simple angular 2 4 ionic 2 countdown timer for my application but i can t seem to find any open-source solutions available so i wanted to see what suggestions you guys had

45175600
lodash	underscore.js
furthermore have a look at libraries like lodash and underscore.js for summing count of number of books

45175618
width	height
after this the only issue left was the height of the toolbar as it was shorter that usual although the width issue was corrected

45175622
stdout	stderr
used to make stderr stream output to stdout stream so it can be accessed via backtrick operator

45175652
width	height
maybe changin the linearlayout width and height to wrap_content may solve the problem

45175709
try-catch	exception-handling
since php7 all errors are exception-handling so you can simply wrap fragile code part inside try-catch block to catch the throwable exception-handling and handle accordingly

45175756
folder	directory
when this is done a folder named media is created in my project s root directory and the files are uploaded here

45175769
width	height
you ll need to specify the height you want then set the image width to auto to keep it proportionately scaled

45175895
oncreate	onstart
one thing you ll notice is that oncreate is called before onstart

45175905
width	height
after that it s working with your figure height and width to make sure there isn t excess white space

45175908
ant	maven
depending on if your project uses maven or ant or something else the way to add it to your project varies

45175908
ant	maven
try googling something like adding a jar in eclipse for a x build where x is the tool used for your build ant maven etc

45175936
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
i use pbkdf2 to create salt and hash for passwords

45175938
tablelayoutpanel	linklabel
or if the above can t be done can i have an example on how to putting dynamic linklabel of array on each row or col to a tablelayoutpanel

45175949
width	margin
while trying to design html emails i ve noticed that on windows live mail the emails are not respecting the container so the email width are gigantic -- thousands of pixels of padding margin whatever on the left and right side of the content

45175957
post	get
i searched online and found several post advising to use dense_rank and keep first but i am struggling with combining multiple criteria pldate and plnr to get multiple records

45176000

you can make requests of get put post delete with or without header

45176000
post	put
method post put delete without header

45176001
skip-lists	tree
the underlying data structure is a red-black tree in qt5 at least iirc it was a skip-lists in qt4

45176033
ceil	floor
replace floor with ceil for the opposite

45176044
equals	icomparable
if this is being done with serialized objects in asp.net mvc using an ajax datasource note that the grouping object must have value semantics overriding equals and implementing as well as implementing icomparable

45176050
children	parent
both maps are children of the same parent element

45176053
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
in google-chrome it works but safari opera or microsoft edge - no

45176079
typedef	struct
with typedef what you have basically done is defined a type chrom of struct chrom type so your chrom.starttime is an invalid access

45176113
min	max
lastly - you can move the min and max variables outside the render function

45176225
width	height
maybe add more height to navi to make it look like full width column navigation

45176231
hide	show
my problem is that i need a div a simple css loader to be show before send the request and hide after it but it is not showing

45176243
folder	directory	inherited	properties
by transforming the folder target properties into something that is inherited from a directory properties of the same name

45176243
inherited	properties
this can be done using define_property to redefine the folder properties as inherited

45176243
inherited	properties
with the inherited option the get_property command will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested properties is not set in the scope given to the command

45176285
put	get	post	get	post	put
you can make requests of get put post delete with or without header

45176350
mp3	wav
though i ve tried this with a wav and mp3

45176350
opera	google-chrome
works in edge and google-chrome and opera - tried that too

45176417
interpolation	splines	cdf	splines
what i am now doing is creating a splines of the cdf values versus rank and trying to set an error bound such that for no rank is the interpolation value off by more than a certain percentage of its value relative error

45176417
min	max
i keep track of the min and max values for the difference and when they differ by too much in proportion to the cdf i assume that the curve has bent too much and i add a new interpolation point and start tracking differences all over

45176417
interpolation	splines
by the way for each splines segment i have tried the following interpolation functions

45176437
multiplying	modulo
compute k k by multiplying and taking the modulo as you go

45176439
width	height
i have a code to get the image width and height and class xmin xmax ymin ymax of the bounding boxes

45176442
put	get	post	get	post	put
in addition you have by default on an odata controller get post put patch delete methods but you also might want custom functions actions that you have to define

45176531
for-loop	loops
since we do not know the required number of iterations it s more appropriate and clear to use a while loops instead of the for-loop

45176535
client-side	server-side
it would catch the error in the server-side validation but client-side stop working

45176564
width	height
it works like this a bitmapdata class takes a png file from the library fontsource loops between every character in a given string and then gets its x y width and height inside the image from a function getoffset and then it uses copypixels to draw the custom-font text

45176568
switching	screens
if you are just printing to your printer lpt1 as a device after entering the code to switching devices from the screens to the printer just reference what line number you want to print on

45176644
qtp	alm
i want to edit test case which is present in alm while qtp script is running on the same machine at the same time

45176669
swrl	owl
i guess it could be implemented in owl or swrl

45176709
hide	show
i want to show and hide a div tag based on an property on an model

45176726
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox but edge is throwing the following error

45176739
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tested it on google-chrome firefox and safari macos and ios and works

45176741
post	get
i get this error in the console when i try to post data with ajax

45176747
uicollectionviewcell	uitableview
currently i have embedded a uicollectionviewcell in a uitableviewcell within one of the sections of my uitableview

45176763
phpstorm	webstorm
it works in phpstorm just in the same way as in webstorm

45176778
post	get
since you re not sending any sensitive data with the form use get instead of post in the method attribute of the form like this

45176787
margin	font-size
i ve played around with line-height font-size and margin

45176801
width	height
the values contained are 185 or 64 frames of video for each frame width is 100 pixels height is 50 3 channels these are just images

45176810
outputstream	inputstream
my first bet was to implement a custom inputstream and outputstream using a common underlying blockingqueue

45176811
int	chars
the cast also expresses your intent better the data is actually an unsigned chars that you move to an int

45176841
width	height
i am trying to get the relation between the height and width from image and then multiply by a fixed width to resize a picture using thymeleaf

45176841
width	height
for it i saved the height and width in a java object called g

45176841
width	height
using a fixed width 270px i want to scale the height using the relation between the sized saved doing that

45176843
ienumerable	icollection
the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection

45176858
ssl	https
so the issue did originate from the fact that i had just implemented the ssl certificates and automatic redirection links so the users are always using https

45176859
int	double
you get a double in both cases but you wont get back your int

45176911
post	get
it can t just call and execute the javascript in place and on my server like my javascript does with real users and button clicks so instead it will execute on whatever server or computer their script is running on and insert the values it got from screen scraping and make a get request or post to the correct url and that computer or server ip address that the script is running on should show up as the http referrer

45176923
put	get
when i put the page in compatibility view i get the error object doesn t support property or method tabs on line 110 which below is where it says

45176923
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine in google-chrome firefox and utilizes two .js files

45176938
ubuntu	linux
i have a problem when i consume a weservice soap with php from my instance in aws ubuntu 16.04.2 lts gnu linux 4.4.0-1022-aws x86_64

45176978
width	height
since both width height are integers it s doing integer division

45177003
children	parent
the in parent children

45177007
post	get
angular http check get and post methods

45177010
filtering	grouping
however i wish to filtering out irrelevant grouping before joining them to my table

45177090
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
call the onclicklistener from an onitemclicklistener

45177144
post	put
works fine for me allowing me to put a mailchimp signup form into every google blogger post simply by adding the html block

45177222
post	get
you need to use a modal mechanism to create a modal window and get or post your partial via ajax and use the result to display in the modal window

45177260
dlsym	dlopen
not sure if i am asking at the correct place but does anyone know a correct way to generate dlopen and dlsym commands based off a .h file

45177260
dlsym	dlopen
don t ask why am i unwilling to just link instead of using dlopen and dlsym

45177377
keras	tensorflow
chances are that keras depending on a newer version of tensorflow has caused the installation of a cpu-only tensorflow package tensorflow that is hiding the older gpu-enabled version tensorflow-gpu

45177377
versioning	upgrade
i would upgrade the gpu-enabled versioning first

45177404
spaces	delimiter
the idea is to read the data from a .csv file either directly into an array or read the data as a string and then parse it using spaces and commas as delimiter followed by an array

45177429
put	get
the part i m stuck on is what to put in the editor template to display the userpart fields so that the values get to the userpart driver and ultimately the db

45177527
ng-view	ng-app
please help with why ng-app ng-view and ngroute do not work for me

45177552
width	height
instead it has two size concepts the view box and the height and width attributes

45177552
width	height
if your svg file has width and height attributes you can safely use those as the x and y dimensions respectively

45177552
width	height
however you can use its third and fourth numbers as width and height if you need to

45177552
width	height
in that case one could potentially compute a height and width based on the elements in the file but that s trickier than anyone really wants to do given the full capabilities of the format

45177584
min	max
and now i want to change min and max after init object

45177661
fast-forward	merge
in these situations git defaults to a fast-forward merge which can essentially be thought of as taking all of the new commits from newversion and appending them to the most recent commit on master which does not separate the commit history that was done on newversion

45177692
int	boolean
int boolean string

45177692
int	boolean
int boolean string

45177692
int	boolean
int boolean

45177692
int	boolean
as you can see in the visualization the only thing which is necessary is that the entries always have the same order relative to each other int must always be before boolean and string and boolean must always be before string

45177694
folder	directory
you can also configure the hive-site.xml in spark_home conf the context automatically creates a metastore called metastore_db and a folder called warehouse in the current directory.fixing the permission issues in the directory from which you are launching spark-shell can solve your problem

45177703
folder	directory
it s designed to rename certain files whenever a folder of files is copied to a directory called aspera_staging

45177747
squash	branch
note that if you choose the --squash option you can only do this once for each branch since by squash you re losing the information about what s different between the two branch

45177760
post	get
here is parts of code for modelfilter using custom modelbuilder i am going post part of it because there is a lot of code involved but it should get you on right track

45177768
folder	directory
however when a user is manually attempting to access their personal folder such as from a non-domain computer they have to manually enter their user name or just go to storage.server users and then browse through the list of directory for their username

45177792
post	get
i ll post back if i get that working

45177811
width	height
the natural height width of the svg image is 601x601 see source for viz a square.

45177811
width	height
so the max-height or height and max-width or width rules must be the same to maintain the aspect ratio..

45177831
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this gives a simple grey well with a label centered above it

45177834
for-loop	arrays
i ve been trying to take the output of ls applications and put each line into an arrays then do a for-loop of the arrays

45177868
queue	fifo
finally the central problem we re trying to solve is to funnel potentially a bunch of requests into a single fifo queue basically due to a limitation in a third-party library we re using

45177880
midi	osc
it provides libraries for music making image manipulation building graphical user interfaces guis and for connecting to external midi and osc devices such as digital pianos smartphones and tablets

45177883
min	max
my first thoughts were to use two different b-tree indices one for latitude and another longitude calculate max and min values for latitude and longitude based on the desired distance and select points from the database that fall within these max and min values

45177889
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
then in code behind or vm it would require implementing the icommand interface and inotifypropertychanged

45177960
interpolation	splines
i am trying to interpolation between 4 points using a hermite splines

45177960
interpolation	splines
however my splines seems to always start on the second point and only interpolation to the 3rd point

45177965
width	height
i have surfaceview in fragment_main.xml it is set to 50dp width and 50dp height

45177965
width	height
and when i run this app surface view is on entire of screen it is not dependend of width and height

45177965
width	height
i tried changing the width and height but nothing changed

45177966
width	height
for desktopwidth and desktopheight is the total width height of the bounding rectangle of the current desktop including all displays in their current arrangement

45177966
width	height
so if you have two 1080p displays arranged exactly horizontally then the total desktop width and height is 3840x1080

45177985
typedef	struct
if you want to use a struct you always have to use the keyword struct .â¹ however typing this extra struct everywhere gets annoying so you can typedef it to a regular type name

45177985
typedef	typename
in particular you can declare multiple typename with a single typedef statement

45178004
hide	show
editor - issues - select errors only or completely show hide errors and warnings using hide all issues or use shortcut ctrl + cmd + m enter image description here

45178099
perl	tcl
i generate a few variables in my tcl script which are actually used as switches for a perl script

45178099
perl	tcl
i use exec to run the perl script in tcl like this

45178101
children	parent
basically you can have parent and child components but if you ever have a component with over 2 levels of children you should consider using redux or flux to handle state between unrelated components

45178109
versioning	upgrade
you can easily upgrade your npm versioning using npm install -g npm

45178111
mp4	webm
you ll need to convert to webm ogg mp4 etc then re-upload the asset and reference the new one with the correct format

45178119
erlang	elixir
additionally because functions defined with multiple heads are pervasive in erlang which a good deal of elixir code is written with reference to straightforward translation preserves a disproportionate amount of code without

45178140
int	chars
my current issue is the function seems to return a large int either positive or negative instead of the chars pointer i expect it to

45178190
width	height
reset the body and html tag then you can use 100 and get true 100 height and width

45178200
swift	objective-c
as you can still use the swift do catch with the call in a natural fashion the next best thing to swift actually catching objective-c exceptions as it should

45178234
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux 16.04

45178237
floating-point	integer	integer	unsigned
given the constraints on programming language it will be best to use memcpy to transfer between floating-point and unsigned integer representations and perform the required bit-level operations to set clear test custom nan payloads in integer space

45178237
floating-point	integer
many optimizing compilers will optimize the memcpy away and replace it by hardware instructions that transfer data between x84 floating-point and integer registers but you would want to double-check the generated machine code to make sure of that if the performance of these operations matters

45178248
migrate	staging
i have tons of data in staging tables in sql and i am working on a task to migrate that data to destination sql server

45178279
width	height
where the shape represents frame id width height rgb channels

45178279
width	height
we keep the video size the same 100 width x 50 height x 3 rgb channels

45178279
width	height
so i suggest we reduce this video to 60 frames by averaging the rgb channel values in 3-frame batches - for all pixel positions along width and height

45178289
filesystems	hfs+
number of blocks and actual sparseness will depend on os filesystems the above was on debian buster ext4 -- sparse files are not supported on hfs+ for macos and on windows they require the program to do something specific i don t know enough about but that does not seem easy or even doable from java not sure

45178323
put	get
i process that information to get the first revid associated with x user and then put that into this request to get the full article text of when user x last vetted the article

45178331
dplyr	tidyr
i used dplyr and tidyr

45178358
next	except
i can solve first function using closure in fact for the second function also i can check the arguments and if arguments length is zero i can again make a call to sum to except next parameter

45178363
width	height
where width and height happen to be the size of the screen

45193586
post	get
for example if i want to show that my app makes a call to a specific service passing a set of data and getting back a different set of data there s hardly enough room on the line out and the line back to show all this data and to point out that it s a get or a post and without this information the diagram is minimalistic to the point of not being very useful

45193586
diagramming	flowchart
it seems more a way of diagramming something like a flowchart

45193688
many-to-many	one-to-many
i understand many-to-many relationships pretty much necessitate it given a concern of duplication and consistency as well as certain scenarios with multiple one-to-many relationships â such as the following example from the docs .

int	chars
every pointer type i.e int chars each have a null pointer value of its own

45193818
sorting	filtering
the reason for this is that it is very much a non-trivial problem in how this would interact with filtering and sorting for example how would you sort a column which has elements that span multiple columns - which column would that data belong to

45193880
post	get
now the code only runs when a post request was sent whereas simply loading or reloading the page would be a get request

45193971

i ve searched everywhere and i know that the designers aren t too fond of making graphing this way so it s tough but i have seen it done with multiple line graphing scatter plots using two y axis

45194259
min	max
i have obtained a single value by sum txs where this could also be a single value of the min txs or max txs depending on your needs

45194277
hex	binary
looking at this question on quora here are data stored in registers and memory in hex or binary

45194277
hex	binary
i think the top answer is saying that data persistence is achieved through physical properties of hardware and is not directly relatable to either binary or hex

45194277
hex	binary
in this case would the internal representation of information in memory registers be in binary or hex

45194305
folder	directory
i am looking to create a function that when ran it creates a new time-stamped folder in my current working directory with two subfolders input and output

45194365

after looking into documentations i found that to use tensorflow c++ api you need to create a project inside a clone of the tensorflow github repository then build it with bazel who is not possible in my case

45194459
google-chrome	firefox
supported by firefox and google-chrome

45194492

you also need to agree with server which http method post or get the server expect you to use this will determine where you will send the data post method - on body or get method - on headers

45194545
knuth-morris-pratt	rabin-karp	boyer-moore	rabin-karp	boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
you can possibly do better using the rabin-karp boyer-moore or knuth-morris-pratt algorithms

then you will be able to interact with this web service which will access database from your xamarin application using urls and http get put post and delete

45194566

45194612
margin	height
i tried putting them in a container div and playing around with the height margin padding and stuff but i couldn t fix it

45194617

versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade an ancient versioning of the timber plugin on wordpress to the most current

45195105
inherited	properties
it seems like you have pretty similar classes and you can create a base class like person for example with properties id and then override it in inherited classes

45195215
implements	extends
it does not extends to the code blocks of methods â this includes comprehensions and generator expressions since they are implements using a function scope

45195246

bindings are https with a fully qualified hostname and a self signed ssl cert i have added the self signed cert to the trusted ca authority list on the client workstation web browser

45195578
for-loop	loops
if you were to try the following example it would successfully complete a ui update after each foreach iteration because when it completes it s initial task it wants to return out of the for-loop and hits our main thread invoke which has to complete before loops can iterate again

45195614
put	get
this works but i don t like it because it depends on id being numeric and my being able to put a negative in front of it to get descending ordering

45195718
post	get
any idea why i get this error when i post my data to the controller

45195779
int	chars
the format string ptempformat is like the one used in printf of unknown number of in it maximum is max_params_num and i populate the paramslist accordingly and then i use vsnprintf to create a string from the format string i got and the values populated in paramslist. those values can be anything from int to hex to chars aka strings and any combination of them according to the format string received from the server

45195825
versioning	upgrade
first of all i would advise you to upgrade your elasticsearch versioning if possible

45195825
sorting	filtering
so if sorting is not based on the elasticsearch _score you want to use boolean filtering queries

45195825
children	parent
this would also apply if you want to sort only by _score of parent matches then you could put the query for children into a filter

45195869
postgresql	mysql
how does this compare to other databases like mysql mongodb postgresql cassandra

45195927
ubuntu	linux
the source code make files and libraries are exactly the same the only thing that differs between the computers is the os arch linux and ubuntu

45195953
folder	directory
maybe it s because the outer directory which your initial url refers to contains only the readme.md.your html file to be displayed is in the folder rgb game files.i would suggest you to either bring your static files in the outermost directory or change the name of your directory into something url friendly read not containing spaces and then enter the url filename

45195984
folder	directory
let s say i want to display an image called boldedrow.png and boldedrow.png happens to be inside view folder and my main java file is in src directory then i can get the image url in the following way

45196127
mousemove	mouseup
i m pretty sure that i am misunderstanding the documentation for the mousemove or maybe even the mouseup method

45196127
mouseup	mousedown
so far with my current code my mouseup and mousedown calls seem to work as expected

45196127
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
this is my mousedown mousemove and mouseup methods

45196129
post	get
the form itself is contained in a partial view coincidentally called _maintenanceform which has it s own get post methods to submit the form

45196129
post	get
essentially the problem i m running into is that in chrome after the maintenanceform post method the maintenance get method is called which re-renders the view

45196153
integer	fractions
there are better ways to get the fractions part of an integer x than x-int x such as math.modf x and numpy.modf x but this requires no package imports

45196154
for-loop	arrays
i use the following for-loop to try to output each item in the arrays

45196155

this solution uses dplyr and purrr

45196175
folder	directory
i moved the files under the directory certs into the conf folder of the deployment in my machine

45196180
typemock	moles
though there are some ways to unit-test code that depends on static typemock or moles i recommend you depend on abstractions instead

45196225
puts	gets
now this is executed from a uicontext performblock calls this master save within a block and because its not blocking the next code to run is a tableview reload where it gets the fetched objects accesses the properties and puts them on the tableviewcells

letter-spacing	font-size	padding	overlapping	width	font-size
i tend to use css media queries to change an appropriate combination of padding between menu items letter-spacing and font-size so that you cn reduce screen width without overlapping

45196413
int	boolean
where would be translated to bool in c++ but to boolean in java workaround would be to use int in that case but most likely not in all potential targets

45196416
cos	sine
i m trying to create a nn to approximate functions sine cos custom... but i m struggling with the format i don t want to use input-label but rather input-output

45196474

maven-javadoc-plugin	pom.xml
in that parent pom.xml i define the maven-javadoc-plugin

45196497

and file_console has been declared as a chars so the assigment is wrong since null is the null pointer macro not an int type

45196558
inherited	properties
is there any way for an instance of class two to inherited that properties value set by the parent

45196560

so if i want to git pull from upstream master into master and git push back to origin i shouldn t use --rebase then

45196724

the subdirectory inside the workspace folder will not always be your project name but a randomly generated directory name

45196729
pull	push
at the same time i want to create a remote repository on bitbucket.org properly connected so that the push and pull buttons work

45196732
allocator	stl
std make_ should be the only way allocator object on the heap alongside the stl containers such as std vector and std list

45196733
aggregate-functions	sum
i found that by using a window aggregate-functions sum over the partition created by my changeover flags this allowed me to build an appropriate ordered list where i could perform aggregation

45196738
post	get
and then querying dbc.dbqlogtbl and dbc.dbqlsqltbl using something like what s outlined in this forum post either streamed if possible or simply batch queried semi regularly to get real time-ish metrics

45196777
getter	setter
now we have spring entities mapped to the db in my case they are plain old java objects pojo with only some fields and getter and setter which i usually prefer and don t want to put any business logic in there

45196817
box-sizing	margin	width	margin
it s because your box-sizing is content-box the width of the element is calculated without adding the margin padding border

folder	directory
i was able to get rid of this error by having a single vendor folder at the parent directory of transaction-chaincode user-chaincode but i cannot do so for developmental purposes

45196908
min	max
the use of ordered factors that led me here however is in the use of max and min functions in particular inside of aggregation functions

45196962
width	height
here boardpanel gets most of the width and all of the height

45197026
int	chars
i mean just int chars

google-chrome	firefox
for saving html5 canvas as image using fabric js i found the following code which works in google-chrome and firefox browser

45197157
for-loop	loops
also i m fairly certain that placing plt.figure 2 inside of a for-loop will cause you issues let alone the fact that you ve declared a variable outside of the for-loop then called plt.figure 2 within loops as well

45197173
int	double
you re returning an int where you have double and int multiplication

45197206
int	double
try casting to a double in your operations that involve double and int

45197206
int	double
sometimes programming languages will cast a double to an int which causes your numbers to be off

45197237
uninstall	upgrade
we saw where this schema changed to the local db wreaks havoc if you don t completely uninstall the client side local database between upgrade

45197253

spaces	linefeed
basically for non-default non-null values of fields can be separated with either 1 a sequence of one or more characters that are all from the set of ifs whitespace characters that is whichever of spaces tab and newline newline meaning linefeed linefeed are present anywhere in or 2 any non- ifs whitespace character that s present in along with whatever ifs whitespace characters surround it in the input line

45201229
spaces	linefeed
2 even if you were to use this solution with a single-character separator such as a comma by itself that is with no following spaces or other baggage if the value of the variable happens to contain any lfs then read will stop processing once it encounters the first linefeed

45201229
spaces	delimiter
funnily enough just like read general word splitting also uses the special variable although in this case it is implied that it is set to its default value of spaces tab newline and therefore any sequence of one or more ifs characters which are all whitespace characters now is considered to be a field delimiter

45201229
spaces	delimiter
furthermore it can be argued that the comma is really the primary delimiter character here and that stripping it and then depending on the spaces character for field splitting is simply wrong

45201229
linefeed	delimiter
but for a single-character delimiter like the linefeed used in this example it actually comes close to being perfect

45201229
bash	zsh
this is because in bash though not in zsh incidentally variables cannot contain the nul byte

45201229
linefeed	delimiter
this solution will not erroneously split fields in the middle will not cut out prematurely will not drop empty fields will not corrupt itself on filename expansions will not automatically strip leading and trailing whitespace will not leave a stowaway linefeed on the end does not require loops and does not settle for a single-character delimiter

45201378

this answer caters to the comment that a character in dictionary_a may map to more than one character in dictionary_b but two different characters in dictionary_a may not map to the same character in dictionary_b. this was ignored in the other answers because it does not make sense for a dictionary to have two of the same key

box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
to use padding on the s you can set the box-sizing property to border-box so the padding is included in the width of the

45232082
width	margin
but the margin is more difficult to include in the width because it is on the outside of the box

45232082
width	margin
so you have to calculate the margin on the width see example on #leftdiv

45232082
height	border-box	margin	border-box	margin	height	width	border-box	width	height	width	margin
border-box the width and height properties include the content the padding and border but not the margin

45232082
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
the width and height properties are measured including only the content but not the padding border or margin

45232251
width	margin
then in order to have 2 children side by side you can use either flex layout or float layout as you did but again you have assume that width 50 is actually without the margin so real width will be 50 + 4px 2px left + 2px right margin

45232251
children	parent
also have in mind that because the children elements are floated the parent element will have a height of 0

45232251
children	parent	margin	height
in order to make parent element to wrap its children you must either set some height of #center element in your case 204px 200px for children and 4px for its margin or to use the following css which does the trick

45232251
children	parent
the css will add empty block element right after both children because it has propeerty clear and because it is block element the parent will extend

children	parent
so that the children are positioned relative to their parent

45252679
children	parent
this was working perfectly until i noticed that the parent height was not updating from its children because position absolute

45252679
width	height
is there an alternative to absolute positioning that uses x and y coordinates but also keeps them in the flow of the document to allow the parents width and height to adjust automatically

45252679
width	height
or if that is not possible is there away using vanilla javascript no jquery or other libraries to find out the width and height of the contents of the parent div

45252679
width	height
if this is possible i can just set the parent s width and height styles through javascript

45252679
children	parent
however with more than one child the children are not relative to the parent but are now relative to the previous child which messes things up

mongodb keeps all of the most recently used data in ram.if your working data set fits in ram mongodb serves all queries from memory else it will hit the disk to access the data

45258167
disk	ram
now how can you check if the data is retrieved from ram or disk

45258167

hash	salt
the used algorithm cost and salt are returned as part of the hash

45258807
hash	salt
if all accounts in the system use the same salt an attacker can brute-force calculate hash for that salt and break into all accounts with just one computational run

45258807
hash	salt
however password_hash embeds the salt in the returned hash which i believe makes it public so the salt is known to the attacker for every password

45258807
hash	salt
one thing i could think of is that hash created with the same salt would be identical for identical passwords and possibly allow an attacker to make progress through statistical analysis of the hash in the database

45258814

45259185
public	protected
the difference between public private and protected inheritance is in what classes other than a can see when they re talking to an instance of a

45259185
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
with public inherited everyone can see the stuff that was public in b and subclassing of a have access to the protected stuff

45259185
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
with protected inherited only subclassing of a have access to the public and protected members of b

45259185
inherited	base-class
i forget exactly how private and protected inherited work with regard to base-class pointers

45259186

45261484
for-loop	loops
each time your for-loop progresses n is increased by 2 and hence for near the end of loops you have to calculate factorials of numbers as big as 30 and you are using unsigned int that can only store values as big as and this causes overflow in your factorial function which in turn gives you the wrong factorial

45261484
int	double
are already 0 and hence when double s rounding kicks in for int greater than 2 53 these factorials are unaffected

in response to the comment regarding computing the error you investigate the error associated with taylor-series expansions for both sin and cos base on the number of terms by varying depth and setting an max error of emax 1.0e-8 using something similar to the following for the range of 0-360 or 0-2pi

45262039
cos	sin
because some just can t not tinker i wanted to further compare accuracy between the libc sin cos and the taylor-series if computations were limited to 0-90 degrees and the remainder of the period from 90-360 were handled by quadrant mirroring of results from 0-90

bionic	libc	bionic	glibc	stdout	stderr
it s going to come down to how the underlying libc bionic on android not glibc as commonly found on linux implemented stdout and stderr

45263795
stdout	stderr
from what i can tell stdout and stderr are directed through to something called logcat

45263795
stdout	stderr
kinda makes sense - there s no terminal on which stdout and stderr is displayed so why not have it hoovered up by some service

45263795
stdout	stderr
i m speculating but i strongly suspect that all bionic does with stderr and stdout is write data down an ipc pipe with logcat at the other end

45263795
stdout	stderr
so as long as the application s thread s output to stdout or stderr results in a single call to write to that ipc pipe it will be atomic and therefore not interleaved

45263795
stdout	stderr
but if it is correct then you won t get interleaving no matter how many threads simultaneously write to stderr or stdout

ionic	angular
it may be the same from the angular point of view but pages and components have a different meaning in ionic

45282718
ionic	angular
in terms of angular both are just components but in the context of ionic a page is a component that will act as an entire view it may have nested components

45282718
ionic	angular
about when using angular s lifecycle hooks i like to use them when working in nested components but i prefer ionic lifecycle hooks when working on pages

45282718
ionic	angular
that being said i also used some angular lifecycle hooks on pages like the ngondestroy i used it to remove all the subscriptions from a page when that page is going to be destroyed but just like you said ionviewwillunload seems to be the right way to do it if we want to use ionic s lifecycle hooks

45282718
ionic	angular
i guess that most of the ionic lifecycle hooks are more related to the way the user interacts with the page as a whole will enter to a page will leave from a page can enter to a page can leave from a page... and angular lifecycle hooks are more related to the different stages of the life of a single component the inputs has been initialized the change detector has checked if there where changes in this component ... which as you can see may not be directly related to the user interaction at all and usually are things that the user is not aware of

45282718
ionic	angular
i think it make sense to use ionic lifecycle hooks in the components that are pages and use angular lifecycle hooks inside of nested components but you can use a different approach as long as you do it consistently in the entire app

45282722

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if your subclassing provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializersâ either by inheriting them as per rule 1 or by providing a custom implementation as part of its definitionâ then it automatically inherited all of the superclass convenience initializers

45284530
inherited	subclassing
inheriting all of the superclassâ s api is the default for subclassing so convenience initializers should be inherited as well if possible

45287442
disk	ram
the old disk were so slow that this was no problem also some block devices had simple enough logic to be controlled by dma chip which stands for direct memory access this allowed the cpu to just set up the transfer with initial values then the dma chip finished it waiting for all the data coming from the device and writing it directly to ram chip without further cpu intervention

after validating the int input range it casts the input to a double precision floating point number on the buffer and then uses the union to gain bit access to the value and calculate the binary string based on the unbiased binary exponent and fractions bits

45289850
width	height
when either width or height is set not both the one that is not explicitly set will automatically adjust to keep the image in the correct proportion

jobs	cron
if you are just running docker standalone single host and need to run a bunch of cron jobs without thinking too much about their impact on the host then making it simple running them on the host works just fine

45291598
daemon	cron
then you trigger docker run commands from the host s cron daemon and override the command entrypoint

45291598
daemon	cron
having 12 containers running in the background with their own cron daemon also wastes some memory but the worst part is that cron doesn t use the environment variables from the parent process so if you are injecting config with env vars you ll have to hack around that mess write them do disk when the container starts and such

45291623
maven	pom.xml
tag should be placed on your maven pom.xml

45291643
width	height
i am trying to increase decrease the extension s width and height dimensions

at this point from the console i trigger the function to maximize minimize the body width height with transition animation and there is a visual bug which is shown in google drive video which is a streaming service no need to download any file

45291658
next	except
here is my final solution which works nicely - except it prints the name of the image file next to the image

45291660
versioning	upgrade
i would like to know if i should install 2.3.8 or if i should upgrade to the latest versioning

45291735
hide	show
it s recommended that you use the isbusy flag to show hide loading or waiting indicators

45291794
put	get
we need to prove that you get out what you put in and that you can put in what you get out

45291824
prop	classname
you can provide a custom classname prop to the component which will be added to the base .select classname for the outer container

45291860
versioning	upgrade
we don t versioning every .dll so we need to do every upgrade as a major upgrade

45291863

put	get	post	get	post	put
although the axios readme says that data is specifically only for put post and patch requests i didn t see anything in the code that enforces this and a simplified test shows that the request body is indeed sent for get requests

45292091
post	get
changing ajax method post to method get showed the data on the server side with the code

45292108
google-chrome	firefox
even ie11 is handling this nearly the same as google-chrome and firefox

45292131
min	max
the problem are the initial values of both min and max

45292131

the httr package is a wrapper for libcurl

45292213
libcurl	httr
in this case we wish to modify the libcurl behaviour by modifying curls configuration via the httr abstraction

45292213
libcurl	httr
httr by default handles automatic connection sharing across requests to the same website by default libcurl handles are managed automatically cookies are maintained across requests and a up-to-date root-level ssl certificate store is used

45292213
libcurl	httr
hence we can modify libcurl s default behaviour via httr config to reduce the number of simultaneous ftp requests

45292213
libcurl	httr
interrogate httr libcurl ftp options

45292213
libcurl	httr
you either can modify the httr global libcurl configuration using set_config or simply wrap your request using with_config

45292244
accessor	properties
individual parameter values can be fetched using properties accessor bracket notation

45292250
glfw	glew
i have a very minimal project using cmake glew and glfw3 but for some reason glfw when running cmake in clion return with an error shown below

45292259
folder	directory
if that was not your issue the only advice i can offer is that imp.py should be in the base directory of your lib folder in your python install and you should probably re-install python to fix it

45292265
sorting	grouping
when searching sorting grouping on columns that are kinda-sorta related such as zipcode and city tell postgres to study the data for greater efficiency by the planner

googletest	gmock
i am writing unit tests for a c++ class using googletest and gmock

45293296

45293558
exponent	modulo
first for rsa to work the public exponent must be coprime with the cardinal number of the set of integers between 1 and the modulo that are coprime with the modulo see rsa algorithm to understand why

45293558
exponent	modulo
so choosing a primes is a good way to have a chance for this number to be coprime with the cardinal number of the set described above this is why people choose primes as public exponent most of the time and if it is not the case they compute a new modulo instead of changing the public exponent

45293558
primes	modulus
since the cardinal number of the set described above is even you can not choose 2 if the modulus is the product of primes p and q this set has p-1 q-1 elements that is obviously an even number

45293597
getter	setter
in order for the window that will use the jpanels to be able to get the data from the jpanels i was instructed to make setter and getter for my defaultlistmodel and jlist

45295795
accessor	properties
first a declared properties is mostly just a shortcut to declaring accessor methods

45295795
getter	setter
likewise a thread calling the getter will never see a mixed value even if it happens simultaneously with a call to the setter

45295795
accessor	properties
next accesses to the properties using dot syntax self.sum are really just a shortcut for calling the accessor

45295798

45296121
put	get
no matter where i put in vue component i get this error

45296134
width	height
now you need to change the modal_content css with you expected width and height

45296134
width	height
change youe_expected_height and youe_expected_width with your expected height and width percent

45296158

phpstorm	webstorm
i am currently working on a project which requires phpstorm and webstorm to work in a single directory

45296610
width	height
you need to remove width 100 for the images and the columns will be equal in height

45296638
width	height
this means that the image will keep it s ratio and the height will be defined according to the set width

45296638
width	height
so what happens here is that you define the 3 images to have the exact same width all 100 of a col-md-4 but since they do not have the same height width ratio their height differs

45296638
width	height
now to find solutions to this kind of problem you could use the pictures as background images css backgrounds offer different ways to handle how they resize and you could easily achieve a same height same width design with rules to auto truncate the overflowing parts

45296681
children	parent
duplicated object has different parent name and same children name

45296687
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction

i ve removed the float from the css and added a parent border just to make it obvious where the children are.

45296988
setinterval	settimeout
i ve been looking through the push.js source hoping to find a settimeout setinterval or something similar that might make angular think it s waiting for something but i can t see anything

45297221
folder	directory
or move the prog_1 folder down into the folder directory

45297259
getter	setter
the only thing to keep in mind then is that in the initializer you access them with _ivarname underscore notation and rely on the getter and setter elsewhere usually dot syntax except some edge cases where you need to avoid some key-value observing stuff but as i see it from here you don t even have that

45297296
post	get
when i try to copy the column value i get the error i mentioned above and in my last post

super	implements
that already does away with the convenience of implicit call to the default super constructor livable but how do you implements it

45298403
superclass	subclassing
it s formally impossible the halting problem to write a compiler that can statically determine if any or exactly one constructor will be called so at the very least there s run-time checking which could result in new exceptions secondconstructorcallexception and noconstructorcalledexception as well as dealing the prospect of probably superclass objects not being initialised before at the start of the subclassing constructor

45298403
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
implementation inherited already suffers from the problem that it exposes implementation details of the superclass to the subclassing but this seems to be even going the other way
