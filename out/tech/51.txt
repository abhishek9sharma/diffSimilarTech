6502000
for-loop	arrays
one option i have is using arrays and for-loop for displaying the values

6502004

6502091
freebsd	linux

6502109
mef	prism

6502115
free	realloc
whether the realloc will free the 20 bytes or not again completely depends on the os library implementing that realloc

6502121
free	realloc
if the size given to realloc is 0 together with an allocated pointer then it will free the memory the pointer points to and will return null

6502144
int	chars
i think returning -1 is error prone because you do a casting to int and moreover 255 is also a valid chars

6502153
free	realloc
so if your implementation is one of those that doesn t return null for a zero-size allocation and it requires some housekeeping information for each allocation and the memory arena is so full that you can t store even another housekeeping header and it s not smart enough just to split the current allocation and return most of it to the arena it may fail a zero-size realloc and hence not free the original memory

6502290
boost	stl
the stl has an auto_ptr but that cannot be used in a standard container.boost smart pointers would be a best solution but as you already said you can t use boost so in your case you can use your compiler s implementation of smart pointers which comes in tr1 namespace remember though that there is some disagreement on the namespace for tr1 functions visual c++ puts them in std while gcc puts them in std tr1

6502291
google-chrome	firefox
you may be able to use resize none but there are extensions for firefox google-chrome and grease monkey that will bypass that anyway

6502307
free	realloc
so if realloc returns null then the new object could not be allocated and the old object must not be free

6502307
free	realloc
but if realloc returns non-null then you still have the object that must be free or some new memory object that must be free

6502307
free	realloc
implementations do free the block when realloc ptr 0 is called regardless of what c99 might have to say about it

sfx	zipfile
the info-zip version of zip allows you to remove the sfx stub from a self-extracting zipfile with the -j flag converting it back into a normal zipfile

6504442
sfx	zipfile
making a self-extracting zipfile is a matter of prepending a zipfile with the sfx binary code then appending the size of the binary stub to the resulting file - but i m not sure how the data is represented - but a bit of reverse-engineering the available code should make this clear

6504445

int	chars	free	malloc
already free is only one of the cases other include address not allocated by malloc the data is not actually an address some int or chars string casted to pointer data corruption etc

6504960
free	malloc
if you are interested in the already free case only you could try to track every memory allocation and deallocation by using a custom malloc and free wrapper but this would probably only make your code more complicated and even more error-prone

6504968
median	percentile
the 50th percentile is same as the median

6504968
median	percentile
nb the median query has been around for a long time but cannot remember where exactly i got it from i have only amended it to compute other percentile

6504982
google-chrome	firefox
i have a script that works fine in firefox ie but not in google-chrome after f5 refresh only

6505023
qtableview	qtablewidget
you could use the setspan function of qtableview which qtablewidget inherits to achieve something like that for rows and columns

6505029
width	height
you can draw the table like graphics.drawrect int x int y int width int height

6505076

6505254
hide	show
there two options show and hide for that i wrote this condition

6505260
tstringgrid	tcxgrid
you could think about a tstringgridtocxgrid facade class which replaces the tstringgrid and translates your legacy code to tcxgrid

6505275
hash	md5
there are documented problems with the nsstring built-in hash method so if you do not want to rely on it you can use the md5 hash instead

ubuntu	opensuse
i have tried ubuntu and opensuse

6506200

note that you can only extends one class while you can implements multiple interfaces

6506436
pull	push
how can i setup a repo so that it can only push to a certain repo but not pull from it

6506471

you will use an abstract class if you want to provide a partial implementation for the subclasses to extends and an interface if you only want to provide signatures of methods that must be implements

6506471
subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
there is however one limitation of abstract-class in a subclass you can only extends one abstract-class but you may implements as many interfaces as you like in a single class

6506988
put	get
if you look in the projects json you see that i put a tasks array with ids in it -- thats how the internals know which tasks to get

6506988
children	parent
so to answer your first question you dont need the id from child to parent you need the parent to load with all the children so the json does not match the fixtures exactly

6507032
stdout	stderr
since you say that i m still seeing all my virtual hosts listed i suspect you need to redirect stderr to stdout as seen below assuming bash out.py is just a pythonscript that writes some output to stderr using sys.stderr.write

6507032
stdout	stderr
now send stderr to stdout

6507035

listview	gridview
if you don t want to add your own insert-functionality its easier to use a listview instead of a gridview

6507574
base-class	subclassing
it does seem a little unusual though not to push this down to the base-class if it is a mandate of all subclassing

6507600
subtract	add
since prefixing characters in roman numerals can sometimes mean subtract this value as opposed to add this value

6507608

6507630
firefox	safari
in the very near future new versions of firefox and safari will start to support the data attributes but given that there s a perfectly good way of accessessing it that works in all browsers then there s really no reason to be using the html5 method that will only work for some of your visitors

6507675

.net 4 has it s own assembly folder c windows microsoft.net assembly which has a gac_32 and gac_64 directory within.

i have also determined that when handling rowdatabound the gridview s databound event never gets fired

6507975
implements	extends
ive read about implements vs extends behavior and things like that but im not quite experienced in oop to deal with that and find the best solution

6508012
width	height
you have statically assigned height and width to iframe and if that is taller than the contact form then it will fill the entire td cell and the contact form will move to the bottom as the default behavior for td is vertical-align bottom

6508034
nhibernate	queryover
it seems as if nhibernate uses the name of the variables in the queryover expressions somehow in its code

6508085
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout events may act buggy in many browsers because they trigger when leaving elements inside the element that has the handler

6508085
mouseleave	mouseenter
the jquery mouseenter and mouseleave events fix this see demo at bottom of page

6508101
mouseover	mouseout
your mouseover and mouseout events are defined on the same id #gallery which means when you hover over the #gallery the mouseover function will be called but because your overlay is now covering the #gallery your mouse is no longer over the #gallery but it s over the #thumbnails thereby triggering mouseout

6508155
google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 firefox and google-chrome this works perfectly fine

6508788
mvp	presenter
in clean mvp view state is kept in the view and not in the presenter

6508810
children	parent
i think the problem is that the parent container won t be able to figure out the height the list should have because there are two children so fit doesn t really have a meaning

6508810
children	parent
if you change the parent s layout from a fit to a vbox give the toppanel a fixed height and the list a flex of 1 the two children should fill the screen

this works for all the items in my adapter-fed gridview although it s turning out to be impossible to then properly adding a contextmenu to the gridview itself which registers longclicks on the empty gridview items but that s another story altogether and i d imagine a listview to work the same

6509095
setinterval	settimeout
also it looks like you want setinterval instead of settimeout and you re not adding the cornerimgfocus class to the next slide when the timer ticks

6509167
children	parent
fi merge from parent to children often

6509179
for-loop	loops
you could solve this problem recursively using a queue of vectors where you have a function with a for-loop that loops over the number of n balls placing each of the n balls in a single box of the m boxes that is represented by a vector of size m

6509228
move	drag
the main thing i am looking for is a way of displaying an image in which the user can pinch to zoom drag to move and click on overlays

6509304
children	parent
right now my code only gets the parent but not the children though

6509363
post	get
1 change post to get or

6509371
pop-up	dialog
the main difference is to use a docked cell instead of a pop-up dialog

6509371
post	get
i know that titles get edited sometimes so this trigger as a new post in that case

6509411
actionscript	mxml
however classa is written as mxml not actionscript code

6509430
width	height
when the android camera opens it fills up the screen in width and height but actually i want the app to open and limit upto certain dimensions on the screen aka barcode scanner but here the catch is that the image taken should limit the boundary of the rectangle that the app shows on its surface

6509433
rel	attr
i thought i could just remove the attr href and rel from the anchour and add them again when i want it enabled but it still works even after i remove the href and rel

6509439
jar	war
however if your deployment package is an ear you need to have an application.xml where you will specify that you have a war or jar as module inside

6509449
memcpy	strncpy
i don t see any practical difference between strncpy and memcpy

6509475
memcpy	strncpy
so memcpy would always copy all the data but strncpy would often be faster because of the check

6509479
memcpy	strncpy
so if the string to be copied is shorter than the limit strncpy pads with zero while memcpy reads beyond the limit possibly invoking undefined behaviour

6509485
memcpy	strncpy
no strncpy is not a specialization since it will detect a 0 character during the copy and stop something memcpy will not do

6509488
getter	setter
note that this method is both a getter and a setter

6509502
width	height
yuvimage preview new yuvimage data imageformat.nv21 width height null

6509502

6509502
width	height
imageutil.decodeyuv420sp data width height

6509504
width	height
so at the moment your image plane is 2 width x 2 height and your triangle occupies only a pixel actually even less due to perspective distortion

6509527
int	chars
that is i can copy a 4 byte int to 4 consecutive chars of 1 byte like this

6509527
memcpy	strncpy
another difference is that memcpy does not look ofr any characters such as null by strncpy

6509529
post	get
one common pattern is post redirect get

6509529
post	get
your question is more about design than technology so gwt doesn t really change the picture except to note that the gwt history mechanism is intended to mimic the behavior of static pages connected by links which the post redirect get pattern does also

6509539
memcpy	strncpy
when using memcpy the source and destination buffers can overlap while in strncpy this must not happen

6509539
memcpy	strncpy
according to the c standard the behavior for overlapping buffers are undefined for both strncpy and memcpy

6509539
memcpy	strncpy
according to the c standard the real difference between strncpy and memcpy is that if the source string is less then n value then null characters are appended to the remaining n quantity

folder	directory
i want to strip the base directory of the unpacked dependency have my own base directory at the top and exclude some of the folder e

6509974
min	max
no joining to itself the obvious solution of getting the min and max in one query and then joining to those dates to get the values

6509974
min	max
i ve done this explicitly to demonstrate why a single group by which takes the min and max of both dates and values isn t going to produce the expected results

6509983
textview	imageview
use framelayout if you want to display a textview on an imageview and don t worry about different handsets

6510008

min	max
please note this is a general question my dataset is much larger and i may want to use different functions last first min max variance st

6510393
allocator	stl
although the std allocator does not guarantee contiguous stl deque adresses perhaps we could use a custom memory pool allocator to get a chunk of contiguous addresses

6510393
boost	stl
also do boost or other c++ frameworks implement contiguous doubly linked lists which offer random access just like stl deque

6510401
put	get
if you try to put something with a derived type into an array of base it will be sliced and all you ll get is a copy of the base part

6510411
put	get
no matter where i put and i get the string undeclared identifier error

use sudo pip install virtualenv it will upgrade incase you are using 1.4.x versioning

6510629
uiview	subviews
yes a uiview owns its subviews so it releases them when dealloc is called on it

6510654
put	get
the funny thing is if i put a cout in the copy constructor it does not get called if the code is templated

6510656
uiapplication	nsnotification

postgresql	mysql
i was just porting one application from mysql to postgresql and ms sql server and i found strange at least to my knowledge definition

6510793
swt	swing
i would have thought that eclipse should have the upper hand in universities since it also supports swt in addition to swing

6510963
firefox	safari
i m using a joomla driven site and i m having problems with safari and the new firefox caching redirects

6510963
firefox	safari
in safari and the new firefox it caches the redirect so it doesn t redirect back to the original page after login and stays on the login page

6511204
post	put
put vs post in rest

6511204
post	put
the put method though not as widely used as the post method is perhaps the more efficient way of uploading files to a server

6511204
post	put
put seems like socket to socket connection such as telnet mail server so using post may provide more of an underlying framework to uploading multiple files in a single batch as you already have the boundaries built in my the post method

6511222
post	get
what baffles me really is that i can send standard html form post to this url and get a xml response but when i try doing this with javascript with or without jquery or with php i always get error code 500 exactly the same message i get when i change the url to i ve tried using the same php code on some other server url it didn t give any response as the arguments supplied were all wrong but i didn t get error code 500 as with

the only way is to override the setlayout method and determine if the screen width and height has been changed

6511241
for-loop	arrays
...to the above for-loop i get the appropriate arrays value and null for the controller value

create a webservice rest is probably best and serialize your sqlite mysql data and put post get it to from your web service

6511545
vbscript	vba
under the hood there is exactly one file system and one filesystemobject so if c c++ programmers are allowed to use stdout or cerr a vbscript vba programmer has the right to a global filesystemobject you can t do anything to a singleton filesystemobject that changes its workings in other subs functions - except zapping the holding variable

6511548
folder	directory
the problems is that when i compress them the entire directory meaning all the folder + the files are compressed rather than just the files by themselves

6511946
mouse	keyboard
i am thinking about monitoring keyboard and mouse usage using win api

6511972
getter	setter
i say maybe because just because c# doesn t let you treat a getter or setter like a real method it doesn t mean that some other .net language can t

6511973
opera	firefox
in firefox internet explorer and opera assuming you ve unblocked pop-ups for the domain the code works as expected

6512026
serializable	deserialization
including the impact of serializable deserialization if using xml

6512052
children	parent
relationships between the parent and its children tables are done using this primary key and creating what is known as a foreign key constraint

6512070
profiler	xperf
however i m using a paid profiler so the question will remain open until i take a look at xperf or someone comes up with something else

6512071
serializable	deserialization
the code and json you posted serializable and deserializes as expected for me without any custom deserialization

6512085
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization does not magically make the same object instance accessible in multiple jvms but it just creates new object instances which are copies of each other

6512094
width	height
in width but not in height

6512166
mkmapview	mkannotationview
therefore you get crazy behaviour if you attempt to animate a mkannotation before its corresponding mkannotationview has been added to the mkmapview

6512241

even if a password dialog would pop-up a lot of users would not understand why it pop-up and simply enter their passwords

6512614

googletest	gmock
i ve got googletest and gmock compiled linked and successfully working

6512772
serializable	deserialization
well i am not sure if i am getting enough context from what you are saying but i think you could write the metadata upon serializable deserialization of objects passed to and received from the server

6512791
post	get
i am having a problem where the ajax post doesn t even get triggered when ie is launched by waitn

6512802
width	height
that won t help you with getting them all the same height but it would help with getting them all the columns the same width

6512815
google-chrome	firefox
i have decided to put the tag on them to improve performance on google-chrome and firefox

6512815
google-chrome	firefox
i then removed the async attribute from all of the scripts and it worked fine again in google-chrome and firefox

6512846

6513314
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
setting processors affinity to some specifically-selected arbitrary cpu core doesn t seem like a good idea if that core happens to be busy there s no reason all threads shouldn t be able to migrate to some other core provided there s a full cache flush first

6513316
for-loop	loops
a for-loop should be used when you know the range of your loops in advance for

6513316
for-loop	loops
but then there s the other line of thought that uses only one kind of loops and at that the for-loop because it s more versatile

6513352
cpu	processors
even locked operations are relatively cheap on modern processors - the cpu simply obtains a lock on the cache line when it begins the read part of the operation which it has to have on any write anyway and refuses to release the lock until the locked operation is complete

6513365
pull	push
this is how every push and pull will behave from now on

6513365
pull	push
you push and immediately you can pull the same changesets back with new hashes in a parallel branch to yours

6513365
pull	push
you fix a bug and you re not yet ready to push everything to the server so you allow me to pull from you and now i have outgoing changesets with your name on it and a server that will enforce my name on them all

6513373
rss	feed
there is an app that displays news from the rss feed

6513398
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome opera has a slightly different line-height issue and even ie all render submit buttons without adding any extra space

6513410

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m developing an npapi plugin for mac and it works and registers properly in both firefox and safari but not with google-chrome

6513475
firefox	safari
the info.plist for the plugin is adequate enough for firefox and safari to acknowledge that it exists in their own plugin listings

6513478
submit	submission
i ve tried adding the simplemodal-close class to the submit button but then it simply closes the modal without submission the form

6513481
width	height
i believe that the view.getleft and view.gettop functions offset by the screen width and height can be used to specify a rect that can be virtually moved around within the constraints of the world and block further deltas from being argued to the view.scrollby method

6513484
loops	while-loop
some prefer to use a while-loop when you do not know when loops will terminate

6513524
sortedlist	sorteddictionary

6513533
google-chrome	firefox
there are some small syntax errors that caused some errors if you are using firefox you should try taking a look into using either the built in javascript error console for firefox or firebug or if you use google-chrome the built in console and that should help you debug you re script

6513538

adding subtract and multiplying are relatively straight forward

neither nscell nor nstablecolumn will display tool tips because neither is a subclass of nsview

6513961
post	get
to get you on the right track since magento is especially cryptic in this part of itself you should read the inchoo programmatically create order in magento post and by the same author programatically create customer and order in magento with full blown one page checkout

6513965
apache	nginx
i ve tried running with django 1.3 + nginx + apache + mod_wsgi and i m getting 3 as well so it s not a webserver problem but i don t get the 404 error

6514220
redmine	chiliproject
as far as code and features go chiliproject was forked in january so there are quite a few changes between it and redmine

6514220
redmine	chiliproject
i also used google spreadsheet to track what i pulled into chiliproject from redmine 1.2

6514220

keeping compatibility is a big focus of mine right now since i don t want to have to go and update all of my plugins whenever there is a new release of redmine or chiliproject

6514246
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would suggest rewriting the function to trigger off of mouseenter mouseleave events i think this would help you making sure the events only fire once

6514303
internationalization	translation
if followed to its logical conclusion any remaining string literals in the code should be natural language and thus the task of identifying strings to be wrapped in an internationalization translation layer is made a little easier

6514341
super	self
if self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil

6514386
mouseover	mouseenter
the reason why mouseenter instead of mouseover is recommended is because the former event fires when you enter the boundary of the selected element while the latter fires when you enter the child of the selected element too multiple triggers

6514386
fadein	fadeout
i also recommend using .stop true true to stop the fadein or fadeout animation queue or else when a user enters and leaves the selected element in rapid succession he she will cause the animation queue to build up flickering of the element

6514398
setinterval	settimeout
both request types either use setinterval or settimeout which shouldn t halt the browser

6518483
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
use uigesturerecognizer to add a uitapgesturerecognizer on your imageview i would recommend this solution

6518503

or b in your for-loop you re iterating over an arrays so it shouldn t have its own property

6519601
ssl	https
also note that using no-store makes very little sense unless the connection is encrypted https ssl

6519681
post	get
in this case i would suggest a web service as you can easily write the business logic rules inside the service and the client will just do a request response process to get post data

6519761

this code for example will work fine with ie but not on firefox or google-chrome

6519960

6519990
mouse	keyboard
it s a list of items that you can hover over with the mouse or navigate around with the keyboard

6519990
mouse	keyboard
if the mouse is hovering or if the keyboard navigation has the item selected they will both do the same thing set that particular item model to be selected

i m using the stock embed code that flex provides i tried to edit the css style for the div which i think is #flashcontent and give it a min width and min height but it didnt seem to work actually anything i did to #flashcontent didn t seem to do anything maybe its not the div i need to be adding that attribute to.

webclient	httpwebrequest
you can do it using httpwebrequest in place of webclient as like below

6520557
int	double
if you want 8 significant digits for your coordinates single precision floats are probably just not enough so your records would have two double precision floats and a 32-bit int which is twenty bytes in total so 60 million records would need 1.2 gb of memory

6520636
implements	extends
create a class extends org.hamcrest.typesafematcher and implements the methods given

try with the following code to get width and height of screen

6520790
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tried with firefox google-chrome safari

6520827

in this case min or max are going to avoid the null value for doing their aggregate whereas if you put 0 the min or max function will take the value

6520861
implements	extends
today this menu is implements as a custom view extends a linear layout also this menu will be expandable and collapsible so the way it is i have to store the menu state through the activities

6520866

6521237
google-chrome	firefox
edit this approach works in google-chrome but not firefox

6521286
hide	show
what i want to achieve is pass the null or some value and then jquery should hide or show the div depending on the value passed for instance something like below

6521305
width	height
one problem i see with this is that if one of the items change height or width i will have to adjust the x and y coordinates of other ui items so maintenance will be a challenge

6521364
draggable	droppable
i made a test page for ui draggable droppable with a simple html table that worked fine in all browsers

6521364
firefox	safari
i applied something similar to an asp.net page but it s not displaying properly in firefox or safari

6521364
draggable	droppable
the draggable and droppable areas are tags that are dynamically generated in a grid view

6521364
firefox	safari
this function still works in firefox and safari however when i drag the column headers i cannot see the moving on the screen it just stays in place even though in firebug i can see it s coordinates changing with my mouse movements

6521461
gridview	repeater
maybe you re thinking of gridview repeater or other item-like controls

6521507
width	height
i have a text field with a set height and width and that allows word wrapping

6521509
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

6521564

there are known issues with jquery 1.6 and any versioning of the validation plugin below 1.8 i suggest you upgrade to the latest versioning as i don t see any apparent errors in the code you have provided and as you see it is working fine in the fiddle

6521638
vb.net	vb6
i find a lot of vb6 examples out there and a few c# examples but no concrete solution in vb.net

6521638
put	get
simply put i need to get the next available drive letter in as few lines of code as possible

6521685
spaces	linefeed
it seems like the linux method just using linefeed makes a lot more sense saves spaces and is easier to parse

6521693
put	get
if i print this out directly in php it displays correctly but if i put it into mongodb and call it back i just get ã â ã â ã â ã

6521696
put	get
if you ve got c# code then put it through the developerfusion coverter - that should get you close although you ll probably have to tweak it

6521706
hash	salt
an integrity key would be a server side generated hash of some of the data plus a salt that you would check against on the server on a round trip

6521717
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the page works as expected in firefox safari google-chrome even in ie7+ â but it does not do so in the latest opera

6521717
opera	google-chrome
i even re-wrote it all using tables â that helped for opera but this way i lost dynamic image height functionality in google-chrome which is essential for me

6521743
hash	md5
the best way to do this was by using md5 hash

6521764
phpstorm	webstorm	phpstorm	rubymine	rubymine	radrails
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm

6521791
inherited	subclassing
worse if the referenced method is inherited from a parent and not overridden in the current subclassing the program will die because it doesn t exist in that package

6521830
portrait	landscape
but when i change orientation from portrait to landscape

6521831
width	height
set a max width and height for the div and it should work

6521831
width	height
if it happens that you are forced to support ancient browsers like ie6 you need to use width and height instead of max-width and max-height anyways or it still won t work

6521843
width	height
you need to define a width and height

6521863
post	get
in the high throughput scenario i d start making bucket documents for small groups of post say one per get more page

just tested this craziness in ie8 google-chrome firefox and safari

6522155
int	double
generally in c the lack of a protoype is not an error in itself - if the compiler sees a function call without having seen a prototype it will assume that you re passing the right parameters it will apply default promotions to paramters basically convert things to int ot double as appropriate and will assume the function returns an int

ant	maven
this could be ant or maven i personally prefer maven for it s dependency management

6522323
hudson	bamboo
the latter is the enterprise way of doing it because it s easy to run mvn clean install war and you can attach the script to an automation engine like hudson bamboo teamcity etc which can then compile test deploy everything something is committed to your source control

6522364
post	get
i d attempt to decouple the page into the independent partials give each one a pair of controller methods get and post and assemble the page by requesting each partial with ajax type calls

i have the following code to show a progress ajax icon and then run a bunch of javascript and then hide the progress icon

6522483
width	height
i would like the page to fit 100 height width in the browser

6522499

6522515
portrait	landscape
it will scale every image based on the mobile client in landscape format the class is used for re-scaling to portrait

6522526

ggplot2 works best if you work with a melted data.frame that contains a different column to specify the different aesthetics

6526170
rss	feed
parsing html with regular expressions is normally seen as a very very bad idea so i d second abizern s suggestion of using the rss feed

6526170
lxml	beautifulsoup
if for some reason you can t do that and have to use the html then as the block has no further structure ruling out something nice like using lxml or beautifulsoup then the following python works for this single example...the regular expression is probably very fragile and frankly cludgey and would need tweaking to handle further examples exceptions

6526219
cruisecontrol	jenkins
otherwise if you need more feedback for your clients you should consider using a real continous integration tool like jenkins hudson cruisecontrol

6526225
typedef	struct
i can t pass a pointer-to-const struct around using the typedef so some functions look like

6526260
post	get
please send an advice about how could i get my facebook wall post info etc

6526276
pull	push
but from then on i could use tortoisehg against github push and pull just fine although pageant needs to be running for authentication to work

6526287
super	self
in your code you are not passing any of the parameters of __init__ to super chef self .__init__ and hence the parameters defined in __init__ are more or less meaningless

6526287
super	self
rem you can take more parameters in the __init__ method then you pass to super chef self .__init__ function

6526290
typedef	struct
just typedef the struct not the pointer

6526306
jar	war
all files in the resources directory get added to your jar or war without being compiled

6526335
onresume	onpause
onresume and onpause are the best for this

6526348

post	get
assuming you get these pieces to work correctly you should post your resulting code

6526424
width	height
alternative inefficient approach store an array of width height lists

6526447
instances	transient
but you would get transient address instances rather than attached adress entities

6526466
put	get
my understanding is that static variables get put in the uninitialized variable section of the binary the bss section and so those are safe to assume as being initialized to 0

6526512
post	get
but if i combine the two with inner join technique i get the same count for post and messages

6526516
profiler	yourkit
this morning i got my hands on a profiler yourkit and started looking for problem spots in my server

6526614
sproutcore	cappuccino
as backbone only enforces the mvc structure of your app unlike frameworks like cappuccino or sproutcore this was a perfect fit for us

6526614
backbone.js	zepto
however it seems like backbone.js is trying to take a library agnostic approach for instance you can use zepto instead of jquery if you like

6526627
pyopengl	pyglet
is it possible to do this using pyopengl or pyglet

6526675
map	quadtree

6526687
rtsp	rtmp
i m trying to convert some h.264 aac rtsp live streams from ip camera to rtmp streams

6526687

6526783
post	get
using left joins instead of inner joins will also let you get users without any post or without any message

6526785
width	height
followed by its width and height

6526785
width	height
and the width and height are set to the width and height of the window into

6527018
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is the same behavior on safari google-chrome and firefox

6527036
next	except
the readline call should be using next to nothing when it s not actually reading something except when you first call it

everything worked fine until i wanted to render an image jpg gif png with a texture

6527092
gif	png
is there any reliable way to check if uploaded file is in fact the jpeg gif or png

6527109
udp	tcp
general question does sockets programming means udp or tcp

6527149
gif	png
you could check if the file has jpeg gif png s file signature

6527151
mouse	keyboard
your best bet for long-running ui tests are two machines and a keyboard monitor switch or use terminal services to run the test app in a session of its own so it can have its own view of the world focus mouse keyboard state that won t interfere with the desktop you re working on

6527151
mouse	keyboard
the fundamental issue is that some ui resources - notably the mouse pointer and keyboard focus - are shared among all apps on the desktop

6527186
charindex	substr
set qty ship qty convert int left size charindex x size -1 convert float substr size charindex x size +1 charindex size -charindex x size

6527188
hide	show
i ve devised a workaround to hack a views exposed filter to hide and show products with a stock count of 0

6527189
innodb	myisam
myisam also does table-level locking on insert and update so if you are using myisam for instance for read speed instead of innodb the first approach is also more problematic

6527217
udp	tcp
neither a socket uses a transport protocol but it could be udp tcp or whatever else

6527228
udp	tcp
for #3 the term sockets programming can refer to either udp or tcp

6527237
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

6527274
udp	tcp
serversocket socket is tcp datagramsocket is udp

6527283
hide	show
...and i used the toggle docs method to show or hide based on whether or not any matches were found

6527283
hide	show
0 means hide greater than 0 means show

6527299
udp	tcp
you can decide if you want it to be udp or tcp

6527310
udp	tcp
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

6527333
put	get
if you have only put and get get must also remove the element otherwise you won t have access to the nth element for each n

6527333
put	get
for example you can create a adt with put get and pop where get will only return the element

6527337
ubuntu	linux
im compiling with g++ on ubuntu linux

6527356
posixct	read.table
as far as importing csv files read.table s colclasses argument will accept posixlt or posixct as known types

6527363
filtering	grouping
a good grouping to choose to filtering out is the one described by w3c as not suitable for use in markup

6527367
public	protected
it has none of the warm fuzziness of the public private protected hierarchy of member visibility and i ll be the first to admit that it makes me nervous

6527384
gmail	hotmail
as has been stated above you can t force a browser to open an email client-- furthermore many users use gmail hotmail yahoo mail and may use the browser as their client

6527430
cos	sin
implement a user-interface for choosing whether the operand to sin or cos is

6527430
cos	sin
in my sin and cos cases i do the following

6527430
post	put
i realise this is perhaps better suited for math.stackexchange but since there was some code i wanted to post i put it here

6527430
cos	sin
it s been a while since i even worked with cos or sin radians and degrees

6527449
hash	md5
it looks like it could be an md5 hash

6527449
hash	md5
i suggest googling around for hash md5 etc to learn more if you are so inclinded

6527465
hash	md5
while the md5 hash guess suggested by others is quite plausible it could be just about anything.

6527498
range	max
not an answer so much as a workaround having been unable to successfully implement max s solution i copied the emails in the date range to a separate folder and modified my code to act on the new folder

6527502
inherited	properties
inherited will make the min-width properties take the same specified value as the parent s min-width properties

6527503

when i create a new usercontrol and make it inherit the groupbox i can t get a groupbox that i can put and position stuff in it

6527537
post	get
imagine the cache update if some post at page 1 get deleted

6527541
children	parent
for example with one database engine the implementation may define foreign keys with cascading deletes and delete the parent object but for another engine it may delete the children of an object separately before deleting the parent

6527547
hash	md5
instead split the cached files into subdirs by some abstract value like the last digit of the thread id or the first two characters of the md5 hash of the thread id

6527597
profiling	instrumentation
it seems that the ants profiling does instrumentation and sampling of code at exactly the same time which i find very interesting

6527603
client-side	server-side
the stack trace you get in this instance from soapfaultbuilder is entirely misleading as it s the stack trace of the code that is creating a client-side representation of the server error rather than the server-side stack trace showing the actual problem

6527636
trie	tree
trie akin to van emde boas tree

6527643
width	height
how big can width and height be

6527645
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
while you could try viewdidappear instead of viewwillappear i think it should already work in that regard

6527651
profiling	instrumentation
the xcode 4 allocations profiling instrumentation may list memory tag 70 as a type under the vm tracker

6527692
superclass	subclassing
you can solve this problem by using two different viewmodels in which you derive the one from the other the superclass can be used for editing the subclassing is for inserts with remote validation

6527698
punctuation	words
i ve never personally wanted to move to a punctuation char when i move through words and i just realized this is really bugging me

6527704
chunked	transfer-encoding
the useful response was that the sitecore media request http handler sitecore_media.ashx delivers the media responses in chunk http transport transfer-encoding chunked which conflicts with the apple protocol response must be delivered in one chunk to the client

6527762
uilabel	uibutton
in particular i group a number of uibutton which are similar to buzzers in a quiz game and a group of uilabel which display the score

6527798
post	get
cases where you are trying to prevent the user from submitting a form multiple times are best handled using the post redirect get pattern

6527836
nginx	lighttpd
lightweight web servers lighttpd nginx do a pretty good job of serving content from the filesystem

6527846
profiler	aqtime
aqtime have a free version of their latest profiler it supports .net 4 but i doubt it can do a mixed profile of native and managed

6527846
profiling	instrumentation
if you are really serious about it you might look into the microsoft xperf tools they have a steep learning curve but they are free and i doubt any commercial profiling can do what xperf can the instrumentation is in the os not in a separate process thus either vista win7 or win2k8 are required

6527857
oncreate	onnewintent
the problem is onnewintent is only called if the task is already alive forcing me to handle the intent from oncreate too

6527857
post	get
this is a similar pattern to how web servers redirect you to a get page after a post page to avoid redoing an operation as result of refresh

6527858
clang	llvm
you can either use clang llvm 2.0+ to compile your code as is or put your block variables in the global name space int n and use gcc

6527858
clang	llvm
note that using the global name space in this case is not valid c++ and clang llvm 2.0+ wonâ t compile it

6527921
interrupt	wakeup
this may be from the timer interrupt or from a wakeup call

6527921
cpu	irq
eventually the cpu returns from do_irq in the original interrupt and proceeds to the irq exit path

6527957
spaces	delimiter
use spaces as a delimiter with cut command

6527981
nunit	moq
i am using nunit and moq to test a class that has some events and i am trying to find the best way to test whether or not an event was fired

6528010
width	height
currently in director each game window in the user interface like small alerts or large windows with lot of elements in them is drawn upon need - meaning that the actual window s graphical image is being put together from configuration all sorts of properties like width height and all elements and their properties from numerous pieces of graphics window background is made from 9 small pieces like the 4 corners 4 middle pieces between corners for dynamic width and height and 1 central piece to fill the window and then added to stage

6528053
google-chrome	firefox
this is how the button looks like on google-chrome firefox and ie8+ no left float and no superfluous space between text and edges within button

6528075
lz77	lzw
as far as i know zip compression is based on lz77 or lzw you might even look it up somewhere and implement it yourself

6528086
slideup	slidedown
i m using the slidedown and slideup functions to have different s appear and disappear if needed

6528088
for-loop	arrays
when poplist is called the for-loop runs through twice and works fine putting the first index of addstrings and addtranslation into the first class in the arrays

6528109
pop-up	dialog
you have 2 options really - if you want it to pop-up and fill the page you can create a jqm dialog page even dynamicaly and switch to it

6528109
pop-up	dialog
another option if you want it to pop-up over the existing content modal mode from ui dialog this plugin will do that

6528137
config	ini
i m looking for an ini style config parser in python that supports section inheritance similar to what zend_config_ini does in php

6528160
folder	directory
i also tried putting both dlls in the bin directory by including a lib project with a folder for version 3.1.3.42154

they re launching requestfactory as a mean of sharing the same protocol and even the same code between your web app in gwt and your mobile app for android

6528239
submit	submission
i ve tried running the insert query from the _post data on pressing a submit button however because i assume ivew interupted the flow between the original form submission and the insert query all i get is a list of erros for unrecognised variables

6528279
folder	directory
i was hoping to get a list of all files and folder in a directory using java without using system calls

6528326
client-side	server-side
it d be much easier to parse on the server-side but i m guessing you are doing the site entirely client-side

6528355
rubygems	bundler	rubygems	ruby-on-rails-plugins
i just discovered the ruby-on-rails-gems tag as opposed to the tags rubygems gem bundler and ruby-on-rails-plugins

6528372
put	get
it has been suggested in blogs as a hack to put content in the element knowing that it won t be evaluated then use dom methods to get the content as a string and either eval it or insert it in a new script element

6528401
min	max
probably a combination of min max using keep will work

6528407
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
if you care about performance there is xsendfile available in apache nginx and lighttpd as module

6528417
hex	binary
the secret.txt contains binary instead of the expected utf-8 hex

6528435
execl	fork
to get around this you could call execl after a call to fork

6528435
execl	fork
this example explains how to use fork - in the second example there you d put your execl call inside the child process section

6528470
awt	swing
adding an extra layer of super ultimate priority might look ok but it s a hard to understand design concept for any regular awt swing ui mostly developer

6528472
int	chars
first of all int strcmp const chars str1 const chars str2 compares two c-strings chars pointers

6528473
execl	fork
if your parent program has no interest in capturing the output then you ll want to create a child process using fork which then calls execl

6528499
getter	setter
therefore there s no point in adding getter or setter to complicate the interface and direct access should be favored for its brevity

6528515
hide	show
create public init show and hide methods and a private build method

6528524
folder	directory
how would i find the oldest folder in a directory

6528545
getter	setter
the idea behind using getter and setter is to be able to perform other behavior than just setting a value

6528545
getter	setter
representation the field is not stored in the format published as getter and setter

6528545
getter	setter
if you think your code will never ever use or require any of the above then writing getter and setter by principle is definitely not good practice

6528545
getter	setter
edit contrarily to popular belief using getter and setter is unlikely to help you in changing the internal representation of the class unless these changes are minor

6528552
width	margin
i can resize the column larger or smaller then double click to autoresize and it pops to this width using the margin illustrated by my awesome paint skills

6528561
google-chrome	firefox
i have a problem with a form that i made it is working in firefox but in ie and google-chrome it doesnt

6528602
getter	setter
getter and setter are really only an important design choice if they get set an abstract value that you may have implemented in any number of ways

6528627
hide	show
how can i hide the selectboxes after i show them

6528628
int	boolean
while using the boolean check for the int num this loop doesn t work

6528633
put	get
put the url for the report in said location header and use a get to actually get the report data or return the report data right away

6528650
int	chars
one chars not two and not an int as num appears to be defined as

6528656

6528731
ant	maven
basically i am looking for the maven equivalent of ant s task

6528758
profiling	instrumentation
the ants profiling offers several different profiling modes some of which use sampling and some of which use instrumentation the instrumentation modes are only available in the professional edition and the sampling mode was introduced fairly recently

6528758
profiling	instrumentation
in instrumentation mode the profiling will inject additional instructions into the program s instruction sets

6528762
nsstring	uifont
nsstring has a method that returns the size given a uifont that size plus the origin of the label should help your find that point you are looking for

6528764

6528764
ant	maven
anything done in ant can be done in maven

6528787
verilog	vhdl
in the vhdl verilog world you find yourself naturally adopting the dataflow mindset much more readily

int	chars
each and every java.lang.string includes a chars and some int to hold the start and end indexes

6528974
webkit	gecko
you can fairly easily identify the rendering engine and version in many of the browsers gecko webkit msie presto and then decide how much more detail you care about whether it s firefox or camino from there

6528984
firefox	safari
but for me only in firefox and safari

6528986
hide	show
in this event handler you d show hide the controls you need at that point and set the properties you need at that moment as well

6528986
hide	show
if you want to show hide certain controls depending on the parent of a selected node you can do something like this

6529024

i just didn t understand the concept of getter and setter methods

6529071
children	parent
because collections always own their items and parent always own their children

6529094
google-chrome	firefox
update i noticed that while the output html works fine in firefox it takes a long time for mathjax to operate in google-chrome and then it gives an error

6529094
google-chrome	firefox
i believe the reason is while firefox supports mathml google-chrome webkit really doesn t yet at least not fully

6529094
mathml	tex	mathml	mathjax	tex	mathjax
because i have no need for mathml just tex i use the corresponding mathjax version and it now loads quickly in chrome without any errors

6529111

6529144
rss	feed
i m using a listview component to list up some informations at a rss feed but when the user clicks the row i want to change into a detailed view of that rss item so far i ve done this

when using the netbeans grails plugin most source files follow the ides tab rules in the options java and groovy files are 4 spaces but when editing a grails gsp essentially html the tabs default to 2 spaces and not the 4 spaces set in the options

6534488

width	height
i am seeking an android solution to calculate the distance to an object and then determine the size height width length

6534684
width	height
instead it just uses a python tuple width height

6534706
google-chrome	firefox
remember that unlike what anyone could presume both google-chrome chromium and firefox use direct3d as the underlying technology for webgl on windows

6534738
mouse	keyboard
the computer does not even have a mouse or keyboard connected to it

6534740
setcontentview	findviewbyid
my solution is setcontentview has to be used with findviewbyid android.r.id.empty but if like me you have two different listview in your activity which need different empty views you will have to find it inside different layout

6534748
highcharts	raphael
if raphael is not a hard requirement you could take a look at highcharts

6534811
min	max
i m also assuming the answer would be the same for functions like min max avg correct

6534837
int	chars
the unpack compiler pragma comment asks ghc to store the raw unboxed value alongside the tag instead of storing a pointer to the int or chars

6534837
int	chars
your c example has no way to tell whether the value was constructed with an int or a chars while myunion in haskell can tell whether the value was constructed by an i or a c

6534837
int	chars
the c type you wrote is also quite dangerous as if i write to the single byte chars and read the multi-byte int the rest of the bytes in the int are likely undefined

6534849
gridview	objectdatasource
i have used entity framework with objectdatasource for gridview

6534950
nexus	artifactory
if you ll be using it in your company you ll need to be able to deploy it to a maven repository such as nexus or artifactory in order for other people to be able to download it

6535026
hide	show
provide all the data to the client in the first place then use js to decide which of them to keep delete show hide etc

i d like to use special css rules for firefox google-chrome and safari under mac os but i don t know how to write the conditional in the page s header

6535113
clang	llvm
use clang and an llvm c backend - the latter will give the most unreadable code but it is still useful in some cases

6535152
folder	directory
in your .m2 directory copy and paste a new copy of the 1.1 folder

6535310
jsf	jspx
because the first answer did not tell you important almost all tags in jsp jspx jsf pages whether thought to be proprietry server internal or custom built are actually a custom tag

6535340
post	get
i m trying to submit a simple jquery ajax call but using the delete method instead of get or post

6535340
google-chrome	firefox
i m using the latest version of google-chrome and firefox 5

6535349
implements	extends
like mkorbel has pointed out the better way to customize a jtable aspect and behavior is implements your own table model extends abstracttablemodel

6535374
children	parent
it s possible to inflate your own views for both parent and children in it

6535423
int	double
so in summary if you put a literal of type double or long double or some int into a float the compiler will implicitly convert that value if it can be converted exactly

6535587
button	checkbox
or let s say you have some checkbox and realize that the options are mutually exlusive then you can simply morph them to radio button

6535590
inline	inlining
if you really need inlining it s possible to write a script that extracts inline assembly from source files and prepares it in a way that follows the pattern above

6535604
children	parent
the usr1 or graceful signal causes the parent process to advise the children to exit after their current request or to exit immediately if they re not serving anything

6535615
width	height
for example it can put it s new height width there into the parameters

6535615
width	height
this way it can redirect the width and height it received to the mainpage

6535617
inherited	properties
anyway i ll suggest you to model active passive state like a properties in your class rather then use inherited

6535640
mp3	flv
i m trying to convert an mp3 to an flv for use in a custom player we already had built

6535682
hide	show
try using the textbox s enter and leave events to show hide your button

6535781
portrait	landscape
as an aside i believe the iphone specifically rotates photos that it s taken in landscape orientation by setting a flag in the image metadata rather than actually rotating the image data so if you re rotating images taken on an iphone make sure that you test with images taken in both portrait and landscape orientations and check that your image rotation is doing the right thing in each case

6535781
portrait	landscape
if i recall correctly the photo data is always in portrait orientation and just has the landscapeness set in the exif orientation data if the photo was taken with the phone held in landscape orientation

6535793
int	chars
but if that can help you the chars primitive type uses 16-bit unicode chars to store the data and int uses 32-bits

6535843
wxpython	pygtk
i don t think you can mix pygtk with wxpython

6535850

onresume	onpause
i ve tried various ways of opening and closing the database including moving the close from the ondestroy to the onpause methods and also adding another open to the onresume

6535908
put	get	oncreate	ondestroy
no matter where i put this in the oncreate after i get the data i need or in the onstop or ondestroy it will produce this error

6535923
onfocus	onblur
you need to bind to the inputs onfocus event and restore your default with the onblur if it was left empty

6535966
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
tag file can be used in many source code editors notably emacs vim notepad++ ultraedit etc

6536074
loops	if-statement
i have heard that there s a limit to 2-3 nested for while loops but is there some standard for if-statement

6536106
int	chars
in that case byte short chars int float and references take up one slot

6536115
move	drag
i also want to be able to drag the black box and move it into the pink box but i can t figure it out

6536117

post	get
i m currently playing around with the pre and post build events in vs2010 trying to get my svn version number into the assemblyinfo.cs file and hence compiled into my build dll

6536181
uiview	subviews
the way i d do it is to separate the right curve of the button as images and make a uiview that has the left part of the button and the right curve as subviews

6536184
versioning	upgrade
doing so would also let your beta users get notified of an application upgrade that is the release of the final versioning

6536187
post	get
if i get a chance i will post a test sample tonight

6536241
nettcpbinding	net.tcp

6536321
google-chrome	firefox
here is the code i m using that clicks the correct link in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

6536336
post	get
after reading this post looking for the same solution as you i found a solution using the .any and .all methods for linq are a nice simple and elegant way to get matching results for arrays

6536346
post	get
instead of saying it is wrong post the compiler errors you are getting and you will get better answers in return

6536351
width	height
and a width and height just to be sure

6536365
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you could put your views inside uiviewcontroller and those uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller then use the uinavigationcontroller handle that for you

6536402
accessor	properties
note that synthesize generates the accessor for your properties it does not initialize the backing instance variable

6536471
put	get
thus what i really want is a pivot method if i put an object into the queue when the queue is full i want to get back the lowest priority object rather than blocking

6536504
folder	directory
if i properly understood you are trying to save the uploaded file in a folder which is inside the default files directory isn t it

6536519

6536788
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is fairly intelligent about maven dependencies

6536789
post	get
- the most common reason is it allows you have two actions with the same signature see the get post delete actions of any scaffolded controller

6536835
screens	tablet
even among tablet devices the difference in screens size and screens resolution can require different fonts size and link spacing for legibility of the font and the accurate touchability of the links

6536851
maven	pom.xml
i m not sure if you can point to a directory that has a pom.xml in it but at least you don t have to deploy it into maven

6536852
implements	extends
you then extends that generated code by implements your your customizations manually in another partial class

6536912
public	protected
the document for itcl stated that the keywords private public protected can be placed in front of method proc variable or common so the answer is yes we can do that

6536913
post	get
if i understand you correctly and please post some code if i m not then all you need is indeed a set get combination

6536913
width	height
where pos is the output array of x y width height

6537004
width	height
try adding height 300 width 250 when creating the popover

6537022

6537109
opera	firefox
this little piece of code works like a charm for firefox and opera

6537134
user-controls	elementhost
although not being a direct answer to your problem have you tried to add just one elementhost and hence just one wpf user-controls to your windowsform

6537135
post	get
shouldn t your post be a get if you want it to send the form values via the querystring

6537145

6537196
installation	upgrade
do you think that entity framework contains installation dvd to upgrade your sql server 2000 to sql server 2005

php is executed server-side and generates javascript code which is executed client-side

6537287

here is the content of my pom.xml with some slight naming changes as i said before i m new to using maven so i d say this is a pretty ugly pom.xml file

6537293
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you must add the uiviewcontroller s to the uitabbarcontroller using the viewcontrollers property

6537361
ready	each
because the event is tied to each matching element in the document ready

6537387
mdpi	hdpi
android has several folders for different resolutions ldpi mdpi hdpi and when using api-level 10 or higher xhdpi

6537387
mdpi	hdpi

6537394
jar	war
in the case that the jar that contains faces beans is already bundled in an ear because it contains ejbs then you also have to put the same jar in the web-inf lib of the war on top of adding the faces-config.xml in the meta-inf directory so that the container recognizes the jsf 2.0 annotations

6537413

i m running linux ubuntu 11.04 and python 2.7.1

6537459
fseek	ftell
but i m not exactly sure how you plan the get the file size via fseek unless you also use ftell eg

6537459
fseek	ftell
fseek to the end then ftell where you are

6537504
debian	linux
server is running linux debian if it matters

6537533
portrait	landscape
if you have 2 layouts portrait and landscape and the order seems to be reversed on the tablet then switch to using getrotation instead of deprecated getorientation

6537607
google-chrome	firefox
the process of making these determinations is called profiling. you can find profilers built into the google-chrome developer tools and firebug for firefox

6537632
folder	directory
there is no gl folder in urs include directory and i have not acces to opengl headers

6537684
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox 5 and google-chrome 11.0.696.68

6537725
width	height
and therefore it was not able to determine the width height of the image

6537725
width	height
in this case i found a simple solution by hardcoding the height width into the flickr-loader - and the initializing orbit once that was done

6537743
children	parent
it should always work the other way around where the parent manage and keep track of the children

6537806
spp	dongle
if for example you happen to be trying to talk to a car obd2 to bluetooth dongle then it s most probably exchanging serial data over spp

this works in firefox as well as to round the corners in google-chrome before the hover however on hover my corners square up

6537853
openrowset	openquery
duplicate column names are not allowed in result sets obtained through openquery and openrowset

6537877
rss	feed
this may or may not be a silly question but i know little of the mysterious ways of rss feed so hopefully someone can put me straight

6537877
rss	feed
i have a website with an rss feed of news items

6537877
rss	feed
i m ashamed to say that i don t use rss feed much personally so i don t even really know what it implies for one to be updating too often - i can see how it would be annoying if you keep checking an updated feed only to find no new content or even worse if you are receiving continual alerts of non-existent updates

6537877
rss	feed
but as i say i don t have a clear picture of how rss feed consumption generally works

6537877
rss	feed
the next question is if the way our site is generating its rss feed is a problem what can i do about it

6537877
rss	feed
rss feed how do they work

6537877
rss	feed
if it s relevant the rss feed is being generated by standard cakephp helpers for the purpose

6537877
rss	feed
edit okay i subscribed to the feed using safari as the default rss reader and indeed over the course of the afternoon i had two identical copies of each news item in my inbox

6537890

post	get
well you could use the function shown in this post to get your parameter

6537948
int	chars
built in objects like int chars etc

6537955
put	get
my thought is that if i can get relativeview working that i can then put it inside a tableview and get 3 rows of 4 inputs accross or 12 total parameters

6537956
google-chrome	firefox
this is working in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie7

6537956
google-chrome	firefox
i think at one point or navigator.cookieenabled was supported by ie but it appears that google-chrome and firefox support it as well

6537975
width	height
is because of the width height of the slides

6537975
width	height
make sure all are the same exactly size and also make the #slider to be the same width height

6538012
jlist	jtable
it makes working with dynamically changing data and sowing it in jtable jlist jtrees etc very simple

6538021

monadic functions you write for the core of your application should all use the newtype d stack so won t need lifting either

6538037
stdout	fflush
if you fflush stdout during your try except you should catch the error

6538052
goto	break
this is why you can t use goto or case like that -- it break the invariants

6538095
rss	feed
like for example this wiki page about rss has an example of a feed

6538140
children	parent
it s not a huge pain it s just something to need to take into account - you d typically create your own parent view controller that could pass these events down to its children

6538168
rtsp	rtcp
imo if the playlist resides on the client it would make more sense to await the rtcp bye packet at the eof and then to do a setup and play for the next file rtsp uri in the playlist

6538185
hide	show
i want a simple text navigation that has the option to show and hide products that are either for men women and all

6538193
super	self
the first point as others have mentioned is that you must always use the current class in your super call not the superclass - in this case super secondclass self

6538193
inherited	subclassing
let me repeat that because i suspect that this is the missing piece in your understanding the whole point of subclassing is that anything you don t specifically override gets inherited anyway

i m in sh but maybe bash ksh zsh has an answer to this

6538249

google-chrome	safari
i tested in both google-chrome and safari both webkit browsers and setting that property directly in the dom had exactly that result

6538526

folder	directory
it works in hosted mode but only when i copy the war folder after compiling to tomcat webapp directory and rename the war folder correctly

6538733

the sql server is set with a minimum memory seting of 2048mb and a max of 4096mb

as i understand it the canvas is a holder for draw requests which get executed when the post is issued

6548748

which seems to do what i expect in msie6 firefox and google-chrome - the nthrow tr elements below the initial tr are made visible previously style.display none

6548764

also note that the min max memory levels only affect the buffer pool - memory is used for many other things in sql server though the buffer pool is by far the largest consumer

if you have to have it like that then consider using a dependency injection framework such as unity or spring.net or ninject

6549218
hide	show
so if you use the sql as i ve written it that will ensure that grname is always populated and so on your asp side logic to show hide controls isn t necessary

6549218
hide	show
of course there are reasons to show hide controls as well - but if you can eliminate unwanted rows from the data being sent to the server that s less traffic overall and as little as necessary and possible is always a goal when it comes to data transmission

6549219
post	get
also i did not post the query because i don t think it is very useful it is just a simple select query and i am sure you get the idea

if you want to load different resources in landscape and portrait mode like a layout although it could be anything in your res folder then put the pertinent resource files in res layout-land and res layout-port under the same filename

6549244

if you want portrait to be your default orientation then put those resources in res layout and put your landscape resources in res layout-land

6549596
ant	pom.xml
even though this is kind of old another alternative with jetty 8 is to simply include the jetty jars as dependencies in your pom.xml and add the following in your pom.xml versus an ant script that unpackages the war and repackages it

inherited	properties
anyway it would be trivial to implement yourself - create a class that inherited from linklabel add a string url properties you may need an attribute to make this show in the designer properties panel if you want to set it that way and provide an event handler that opens the browser with that url

6549854
serializable	deserialization
once you finished implementing the serializable and deserialization function either you can write using operators or functions

6549896
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
the problem with doing .stop then slideup slidedown or fadein fadeout is that the animation can end prematurely and keep an incorrect height opacity

6549918

the fadein fadeout slideup and slidedown move from the current state to a new one and then revert to that - not to the original css

6550070
getter	setter
it is only if getter setter methods are provided otherwise it is not

6550070
getter	setter
indeed the property synthesize directives are facilities meant to declare and define default getter setter methods

6550070
getter	setter
it is not necessary that every ivar has a property nor that it has getter setter in order to be used inside of that class implementation

6550070
getter	setter
synthesize will provide implementation for getter setter for anotherclassobj so you can use syntax

6550070
getter	setter
when you have no getter setter either auto-generated or custom you can assign directly to an ivar by using the syntax with the semantics of simple pointer copy

6550070
getter	setter
anotherclassobj notwithstanding you can still refer _anotherclassobj directly in your .m file like in bypassing getter setter if you ever need it

6550070
getter	setter
one thing you should have clear is that getter setter are not only a way to make an ivar public

6550072

in my case hive stores data in user hive warehouse directory in hdfs

this can be done in c with fflush stdout

6550369
int	chars
but it s east to figure out that it s neither a byte nor is it a short or int so logically the last permissible data type left for the switch block to accept as a variable is the chars data type but i believe that chars only takes single values like c or 3 ..so how do such big values like hello get evaluated

width	height
in the example above i defined the height of the containing element .box as 2em and the borders of the contained span elements as 1em making the overall height 2em had i given the span s their own height or width the shape would have become more intricate

using both width and height allows for a partially-dissected box

6551850
chron	lubridate
we can use lubridate s year month day or chron s month.day.year

6551850
zoo	chron	zoo	lubridate	chron	lubridate
we can just use aggregate.zoo directly with the original zoo object z using lubridate or chron or just using yearmon from zoo depending on what it is that you want to do

6551850
zoo	chron	zoo	lubridate	chron	lubridate
then we need neither chron nor lubridate but rather can use zoo s yearmon

6552248
mouseover	mouseout
to ensure that i is the value you want when the mouseover and mouseout events are fired wrap them in a function

6552249
inherited	properties
it looks like trying to apply class object structure in objects where producttype is a class and product is an object that can be an instance producttypes and inherited properties and available values from each of associated product types

6552435
getter	setter
in an attemt to display the image i changed my getter and setter methods to the following

6552442
post	get
i ll gladly post mine for all to use if i could get it to work

6552443
servicebehavior	was
i have some wcf services using datacontracts and i wanted to i was hoping to pass a exception with custom dictionary string object data in the data property but when i add any data on this array before throwing i get the following error in the errorhandler of my custom servicebehavior

6552456
getter	setter
see this post for more details john resig javascript getter and setter

6552513
width	height
to do this i got the intended size from width height viewbox depending on which is available made the viewbox equal the size of the available viewport the containing tag and changed the x y values of the viewbox attribute so that the image appears to be in the center of the viewport and removed width and height attributes if they were present

6552517
min	max
how to select min and max values of a column in a datatable

6552517
min	max
i am searching for code that could find the min and max or first and last values from a column in a datatable

6552517
min	max
i have stored the datatable with four column values i want to find the min and max values from the third column index 2 and display it to the user

6552525
superclass	subclassing
in java a subclassing will either override or hide superclass members fields methods types of the same name

6552562
pci	iommu
an example for iommu is graphics address remapping table gart used by agp and pci express graphics cards

6552562
vmware	virtualbox
products from vmware citrix and virtualbox etc

6552597
min	max
answer is available on stackoverflow how to select min and max values of a column in a datatable

6552614
min	max
if you are looking for min max you d need to write a loop such as this

6552619
ssl	https
let s get back to the webservice scenario if you want to invoke a webservice located on a webserver which uses ssl and https there is a problem

6552644
hash	md5
hackers can and have created rainbow tables whereby they hash using md5 sha1 sha256 sha512 etc. a list of the top 1 000 or so most common passwords

6552646
memcpy	memmove
seems like the library code is using memcpy when to be strictly portable it should be using memmove

6552694
int	double
my psychic sense tells me that eyex is declared as an int not as a double as it should be

6552694
floating-point	integer
alternatively if you don t control the definition of eyex et al say because they re part of a structure for a third-party library then what you should instead be doing is printing them out with the d modifier to print them as integers not with f and you should also assign them integer values such as -1000 and 0 not floating-point values such as -1000.0 and 0.0

6552704
hash	salt
they take these values concatenate a random salt to each then hash them

6552704
hash	salt
they record the salt and pass the hash to their opponent

6552704
hash	salt
the opponent concatenates a salt of their own hash again then shuffles the hash and passes the deck back to the original player

6552706
filesystems	ntfs
the windows filesystems ntfs doesn t store any metadata for a file beyond the trivial stuff like name extension last written date etcetera

6552713
org.json	gson
android has the org.json parsing classes built in and there is a separate jsonreader based on gson in android 3.x

6552715
subtraction	add
for instance if you add debug code to your program you ll see that this exclusiveor area only pops up in the 6th subtraction

6552741
disk	ram
mongodb tries to keep the indexes in ram and every io needed to look up an index on disk will slow down your query considerably

6552743
hash	salt
the reason as i found in this article is that you actually need the salt to check an incoming password with the salt and hash one in your database

6552754
width	height
as you can see i m initializing the variables for width height etc

6552770
hash	salt
as said above unique secret salt for each password will prevent anyone from pre-computing the hash in a rainbow table

6552791
nsurl	nsstring
chris when you create the nsurl from the nsstring store that in a local variable and log that

6552794
gtk	gdk
if you want to render gtk with opengl i d start by creating a new gdk backend x11 opengl or something like that that re- implements all the gdk drawing functions using opengl

6552868
websphere	ibm
these are quite a number and i searched them with a little grep and unzip -l magic and figured that the file opt ibm websphere portalserver wcm prereq.wcm wcm shared app jdom.jar contains jdom without the jaxen stuff

6552904
atomic	interlocked
there are special cpu instruction like lock which must be executed together with other instruction like cmpxchg to ensure atomic interlocked ram read write or modify some instructions are atomic by default

6552904
atomic	interlocked
remember the atomic interlocked ram access can be only 1 2 4 or 8 and 16 under 64bit cpu bytes long

6552941
move	drag
in wpf the pod being move does not move while you drag the mouse but the other pods still get out of the way as you drag the mouse around

6552961
int	chars
using printf converts the int into a series of chars in this case 4

6552961
int	chars
using fwrite causes the actual bytes comprising the int value to be written in this case the 4 bytes for the chars w o r and d

6553071
converter	multibinding
so i don t have multibinding converter out of the box and binding to the parameter doesn t work which i think it does in wpf

6553099
google-chrome	firefox
if it s for an intranet and you can control what they ll use firefox or google-chrome or ie9 then yes you don t need to worry that much

6553162
google-chrome	firefox
the user only has ie7 at his disposal and cannot use firefox google-chrome etc

6553192
ssl	https
ssl is really well supported it s used in https afterall

6553232
folder	directory
i want to provide them with folder with tk and tcl .tcl source files that would be located in some directory relative to my app like extras tcl and extras tk

6553253
onclicklistener	ontouch
should i use in same time ontouch and onclicklistener

6553265
nstextfield	nsslider
how nsslider live update value into nstextfield

6553267
hash	md5
instead of trying to reconstruct the hash which is a md5 checksum over the method s definition as parsed by doxygen see memberdef setanchor in the code

6553268
addclass	removeclass
it should be as suggested as above addclass and removeclass

6553301
inherited	properties
this properties are part of some interface and the generic param is constraint to inherited from the interface

6553302
redmine	chiliproject
chiliproject a fork of redmine uses bundler you might be able to use that gemfile instead

6553343
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i am using touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

6553363
hash	salt
i think it would be smarter to salt and hash passwords directly on the client s machine

6553373
hide	show
the secret sauce to hide them in conjunction with the show all code is

6553378
google-chrome	firefox
this information is likely available via the extension mechanism of various browsers firefox add-ins google-chrome extensions etc. but that would be only for a browser extension which requires an explicit install from the user and currently requires writing one for each browser vendor where not all vendors offer an extension mechanism

6553416
pop-up	dialog
i have a swing app that has a dialog pop-up and ask for a username and password

6553417
superclass	subclassing
so you ve got a superclass called entity which has subclassing user building and hotel

6553418
getter	setter
i haven t think much on the design but the first simple runtime approach would be refactoring all the existing code so that instead of accessing the fields directly they do so by means of accessors setter and getter and that map the arguments to the storage types

6553429
hash	salt
the trouble with that is that the salt hash password then travels over the network and if anyone intercepts it they can use it

6553429
hash	salt
what might work is if the server sends the salt to be used to the client and the client then sends back the salt hash password using the server-created salt

6553429
hash	salt
and the classic way to do that is to have the server store the salt hash password and the client sends the password to the server which validates what the client sends by salting and hashing the sent password and comparing the result with what it has stored

6553430
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview inherits from from qwidget because it inherits from qabstractscrollarea

6553455
cos	inverse
to get the angles themselves you ll need to use the inverse cos function

6553556
rss	feed
there is a rss feed link

6553562
onresume	onpause
instead you should design your activities to consume free resources in the activity lifecycle methods like onresume onpause onstart onstop etc

6553564
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsview reimplements keypressevent and will forward events to the qgraphicsscene

6553564
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
by default the qgraphicsscene will forward that key press to the current qgraphicsitem through its keypressevent function

6553564
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsscene	qobject	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsitem	qobject
besides implementing qobject installeventfilter you could also subclass any of qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene or qgraphicsitem and override the keypressevent function

6553615
aggregate-functions	sum
sum is an aggregate-functions which only make sense over a group of rows

6553642
width	height
in the above replace scan0 with the pointer to the bitmap data in bytes which i believe in your code is pbitmap and the rest of the information regarding the height width pixelformat etc from the m_format variable

6553656
folder	directory
s3 doesn t have the concept of directory the whole folder file.jpg is the file name

6553657
maven	pom.xml
you could create a dummy pom.xml with the necessary properties and make those calls through the maven plugin

6553657
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml sitting in your current directory has the correct maven coordinates in its definition

6553678
post	get
check that the form was sent via post and not get

6553736
serializable	deserialization
it s my understanding that the official c# driver can perform serializable and deserialization of pocos

6553746
children	parent
from here a node at position i j has children at i + 1 j and i + 1 j + 1 and parent at position i - 1 j and i - 1 j - 1 assuming those indices are valid

6553855
hash	md5
there are also issues with md5 so depending on your purposes you might want to use a more-secure hash function sha-256

6553883
nswindow	nsscrollview
i have an nsscrollview inside an nswindow but it seems to be disabled

6553944
qwebview	qtextbrowser
qtextbrowser qtextedit and qwebview

6553966
int	double
dates in access jet ace are stored not as the text representation but as a double where the int part is the day since 12 30 1899 and the decimal part is the time

6553968
range	min	range	max	min	max
- as belisarius says you can find the range of area ratios for each of the above situations but simply taking the min and max is incorrect

6553974
inherited	properties
and of course it inherited from an object too that is the internal __proto__ properties

6553974
inherited	properties
an empty object always inherited some default properties but it does not have own properties

6553982
perl	tcl
python perl jruby lua beanshell javascript tcl and shell are currently supported and we re planning to add more.

6553988
inherited	properties
those are methods and properties inherited from the object class

6553999
portrait	landscape
adding and removing each uiimageview for landscape and portrait

6553999
hide	show
having both on the view and hide show the appropriate one

6554024
superclass	subclassing
constructor injection ist not very subclassing friendly as the subclassing constructors will have to redeclare the superclass dependencies

6554043
google-chrome	firefox
instead of firefox or ie i use google-chrome and i superficially feel google-chrome is responding better

6554074
portrait	landscape
i have an app that is in portrait mode but some screens should have a landscape mode for phones with physical keyboards

6554125
onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onkeydown	onmousedown	onkeyup	onkeyup	onmouseup	onkeyup	onkeydown	onkeydown	onmouseup
associate this function to the onkeyup onkeydown and onmouseup and onmousedown to get the location tryit out over here

6554158
octal	decimal
you want to use 777 octal not decimal

6554158
octal	decimal
777 decimal turns out to be 1411 octal which will give you the bitmask 1 100 001 001 which is why you re getting those strange permissions

6554158
umask	mkdir
also keep in mind that mkdir is subject to your umask setting and may not give you the permissions you ask for your umask setting gets removed from the permissions you ask for to give you the actual permissions

6554158
umask	mkdir	umask	chmod	chmod	mkdir
you re better off using mkdir to create the directory then chmod which isn t affected by your umask setting to change the permissions

6554163
glassfish	weblogic
once you re ready to deploy lift apps are packaged as war files and can be deployed on any common servlet container jetty tomcat glassfish weblogic etc.

6554180
umask	mkdir
mkdir is also affected by the current umask see example #1

6554229
accessor	properties
the accessor of a properties contains the executable statements associated with getting reading or computing or setting writing the properties

6554235
accessor	properties	put	get
simply put get and set accessor are the functions called on a properties

6554235
getter	setter
generally speaking you ll only want to compare the hash of a password instead of storing things plaintext so you d have the getter variable retrieve the stored hash and the setter would take the provided input and hash it for storage

6554236
getter	setter
in this case bar is a public property that has a getter and a setter that allows access to the private field _bar that would otherwise be inaccessible beyond class foo

6554240
accessor	properties
properties are language elements that allow you to avoid the repetitive getxyz accessor and setxyz mutators techniques found in other languages like java

6554240
getter	setter
getter setter access modifiers in c#

6554240
getter	setter
multiple getter or setter not in c#

6554245
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i haven t really tested the html css beyond mac os but it works fine on safari firefox and google-chrome

6554247
public	protected
they can each be public protected or private

6554247
accessor	properties
similar to accessor and mutator methods they allow some computation when code tries to access mutate the properties

6554248
accessor	properties
properties act as accessor to the internal state of an object hiding the implementation of that state

6554297
width	height
you can either load a bitmap from a file with bitmap.fromfile or you can draw an image using the graphic class by creating a new instance of bitmap using the width height constructor new bitmap 100 100 and then use the graphic.fromimage method

6554307
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if the gesture recognizer does not recognize its gesture the window delivers these objects in an invocation of the viewâ s touchesbegan withevent method and possibly a follow-up touchesmoved withevent invocation to inform it of the touches current location

6554330
folder	directory
i m kind of new at compiling from command line but i put them all in the same folder and while i was in that directory

6554331
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
as you know caliburn.micro uses convention-over-configuration to locate views for viewmodel and vice-versa which means we need to follow the conventions

6554424
unix	bsd
general network programming is system dependent but you can start with unix networking and the bsd sockets to get the idea

6554444
width	height
why not wrap the content in a div set that div s height and width to match whatever you want the table cell to be

6554496
put	get
basically you just want to put the sidebar first float them both left and get rid of the width defined on the main content

6554521
maven	m2e
if you use eclipse and maven m2e offers fairly complete integration between the ide and the dependency management tool

6554525
udp	tcp
given that tcp sockets are client-only in mango i wonder is udp sockets might only work after something has been sent

6554541
ant	maven
ant and maven are both prominent offerings

6554541
ant	maven
ant is very flexible whereas maven attempts to dictate a common layout

6554554
rss	feed
what would be the easiest way to go about combining multiple 3+ rss feed in php

6554563
google-chrome	firefox
this happens only in ie 8 and firefox 3.6 but google-chrome behaves wonderfully

6554569
cos	sin
but i have to multiply by cos a sin a a lot of times where the value of a keeps changing during the course of the program

6554569
cos	sin
which will be currentx+velocity cos a and currenty+velocity sin a

6554607
pull	push
edit if i could maybe broaden this question and just ask for a word of advice on how to proceed ie suck it up and use putty with something else for visualization clone the repo and push pull or do something different like svick s x server suggestion

6554628
width	height
header fixed width and height

6554628
width	height
left div will be fixed width and flexible height

6554628
width	height
footer div fixed width and height

6554647
width	height
the default for a div is to fill up the available width but not to fill up the available height

6554693
for-loop	loops
since this seems to be your second attempt to ask a question involving a really complicated for-loop may i just emphasise that you almost never need a for or do loops in mathematica in the circumstances where you would use one in say fortran or c

6554745
inherited	subclassing
first off you don t have to subclassing nstextfieldcell to achieve this since as a subclassing of nscell nstextfieldcell inherited -setattributedstringvalue

6554766
min	max
then sort the result by date to see the max min file time

6554767
factors	mean
one factors i still am ambivalent about with this approach is that adding another searchable attribute would mean adding a new column

6554771
int	chars
what makes no sense to me is that occasionally this supposed resetting of the arrays would cause some or all of the values in keys to become two- or three-digit int therefore always evaluating true and making the player chars move uncontrollably until one or more of the keys that were apparently down were depressed

6554771
int	boolean
anyone got any ideas on how i managed to turn some boolean into int

6554780
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux

ant	maven
is there a right way to do this with gwt or should i just roll something myself with maven ant and property files

6554810
post	get
the first iteration works fine but after the first contact nothing seems to get passed back to the model on post

6554824
versioning	upgrade
but when i upgrade the jars to the latest versioning of jersey this issue was resolved

6554855
pop-up	dialog
running this lead to a strange error i have never seen before i get a stackoverflow error and then the dialog box pop-up multiple hundreds of times and won t stop popping up

6554936
apache	lighttpd
use a faster server architecture lighttpd instead of apache simply store it in a finalized form on a hard drive

6554943
google-chrome	firefox
i have the same issue with iceweasel4 firefox 3 and google-chrome 12

6554943
google-chrome	firefox
test1.html shows fine in firefox iceweasel google-chrome

6554954
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
just like more basic java classes you often use mutators and accessor methods also known as setter and getter to change the state of an object

6554957
decoder	encoder
decoder or the encoder provided by the

6554969
inherited	subclassing
when you override a method by using inherited you re inside a subclassing you can just declare the method again like you have done

6554987
post	get
now there s a few better ways to really get into this if you have the resources and i ve detailed them in other post

6555006
min	max
take min max avg etc value

6555012
nsmutablestring	nsstring
objective c is loaded with mutable immutable distinctions to the point where there are both nsstring and nsmutablestring for example

6555025
children	parent
then i need to select the parent from that row and do the same thing..over and over until i get to the very first ancestor and there are no more parent or children to update

6555067
portrait	landscape
so you would use the landscape version inside your primary controller and then add the willanimaterotation... to the modal controller to handle the portrait rotation state

6555069
inline	inlining
you probably won t make it faster by adding the inline keyword since your compiler is probably already inlining the function anyway and if it isn t it probably won t do it even if you ask it to though it might

6555085
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade gtk2 to versioning 2.22

6555102
put	get
displayintent.putextra id_tag ids.get index of activity1 not using bundle object to put bundle object you need to use putextras bundle bundle method instead of it.since you are trying to get the bundle object in actvitiy2

6555110
mouse	keyboard
plus of course the ui is different between multi-touch and mouse keyboard menu window interaction

6555112
inline	inlining
the inline keyword has very little to do with inlining of generated code

6555114
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so i tried a css html method and it works beautifully in firefox google-chrome safari and opera all latest versions but does not in you guessed it ie8

6555124
post	get
you ll notice the pagination links don t use any get or post query string parameters and instead use a url segment variable of p5 p10 p15 and so on where p# is a multiple of the limit parameter and the current index of the paginated result set

6555132
post	get
i am using sax xml parsing for parsing the url but how to use http post method in my code bcoz in my code i never use http post or get method .so how to use http post for getting web servises parsed response.means pls can you stuff in my code how to use http post method.

6555215
pop-up	dialog
pop-up is a modal dialog with iframe ajax content

i ve used both artifactory and nexus 2 of the most popular maven repos and found nexus to be much more flexible and full-featured

6555303
children	parent
i have a table consisting of parent to children mappings

6555307
pull	push
you may feel it s inefficient for the client to poll the server to pull the data and you d prefer push but the design of the server gets simplified

6555327
width	height
you may then need to alter andreas file to expose the anchors visible top left width and height properties

6555373
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu red hat suse mandriva arch annvix openwall pld etc. all have their own little idiosyncrasies about how software should be best packaged

6555486
rss	feed
also it may be possible that they have an rss feed of their reviews that you can consume easily of your site so check that out too

6555519
portrait	landscape
if your layout is totally different in portrait and landscape then you need to set frames in willrotatetointerfaceorientation

6555519
portrait	landscape
for example if you want your button on top left in portrait and in center in landscape than you need to set frame in the above delegate method

6555533
cassini	iis
the solution works great with cassini but as soon as i make it run into iis 7.5 on windows 7 64 it stops working

6555566
post	get
i usually use post and check that the is post because most modern browsers will use get for any requests made by the url bar that s my experience anyway

6555566
hash	md5
a somewhat safe way is to create a unique hash md5 and store it in the db with a timestamp

6555599
int	double
why doesn t the compiler just make d and int since double can be converted trivially and it has already decided that is the type based on the result for i

6555600
google-chrome	firefox
but if you save it to disk you can open in google-chrome firefox etc.

6555617
post	get
also is there any way in the above code to get the data of http post as received by the web server retrieve http headers

6555623
anjuta	gnome
example templates can be found in the gnome anjuta shares on an ubuntu install at usr share anjuta project

6555623
anjuta	gedit
i think i ll go back to eclipse and gedit if it doesn t look like anjuta has documented a decent auto-completion project build and syntax-highlighting template format

6555645
put	get
you put your xml in an object structure and get it from there

6555647
folder	directory
hosting companies used to provide data directory outside of the root folder as a safe place for things like access mdb databases

6555647
folder	directory
the only reason you would want to use this kind of folder nowadays is if you want to apply some kind of authentication prior to serving the contents of the directory

6555714
rss	feed
i d prefer to solve this with xml rather then using the gdata api to process youtube seems overly complicated just to get a simple value in an rss feed

6555752
lwjgl	jogl
java application can be integrated inside the browser which have opengl interface using jogl or lwjgl

6555756
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox running but not google-chrome .

6555820
post	get
i think when forms finishes post then it will redirect or books list so that can be the reason why i don t get any data back to jquery

6555829
children	parent
and parent nodes values calculated from children average values of children parent percent value

6555832

6558022
width	height
this view could just contain 1 child view and force the height to equal the width when its onlayout method is called

6558022
width	height
the basic idea is to measure the child with the width height parameters set by the gridview in my case it uses numcolumns 4 to calculate the width and then do a second pass with the final dimensions with height width.

uitableview	reloaddata
according to apple s documentation of uitableview reloaddata method

assuming this point was for rotating from landscape back to portrait

6558747
width	height
and show x 20 y 0 height 480 width

6558747

6559106
hash	salt
nobody talks about the salt being hash because the salt can t be hash

6559106
put	get
if you put the salt in you can t get it out

6559109
hash	salt
since you need the salt to compute a password hash in the login script you can t just store the hash of the salt as this would be an irreversible operation the original salt would be lost

6559109
hash	salt
this makes absolutely no sense however as the hash salt will still need to be stored in the database - in plaintext if you will

6559119
hash	md5
you can use a function such as md5 in order to calculate the hash of the password and compare the hash and store the password as a hash in the db

6559121
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade a tool check in the upgrade versioning so the source control history includes everything that is needed to build a particular versioning of your project

6559123

6559134
hash	md5
a popular hash algorithm is md5 php provides a built in function to make a md5 hash md5

6559134
hash	salt
it is best practise to salt the hash of the passwords you store

6559134
hash	md5
then you would hash the user input with md5 and compare that value with the password-hash stored in the database

6559163

you could also run that inside of another for-loop that would run through the entire arrays giving you ten-element increments

6559815
width	height
width height 4 will get you close

6559861

your imageview and relativelayouts have exactly the same layout sizes width and height so the relativelayout can t really be centered in the imageview

6560002
getter	setter
i am unclear whether i am accessing the backing ivar or going through the getter and setter in using the following syntax i will include my assumptions as to what i think it s doing

6560078
implements	extends
it s a shorthand way of implements an interface or extends an existing class usually an abstract adapter or helper class without bothering to name it

see the link below in firefox and then in google-chrome

6560141
google-chrome	firefox
the text login is verticaly centered in google-chrome but in firefox the text is higher up

6560194
for-loop	loops
if you want to break loops use a traditional for-loop instead or write a custom foreach type of method that can be broken based on the return value of your function argument

6560253
fadein	fadeout
i am trying to put a fadeout and fadein on the css backgrounds to coincide with the appearance and disappearance of the forms but can t figure out how to combine fadeins and fadeouts with css elements properties

pop-up	dialog
a selection dialog pop-up asking if i want to open this map in the maps application or the browser

6560348
int	chars
you can create a static int array that has 256 cells and increment proper index according to chars

6560357
int	chars
second chars actually being int you can subtract letters from letters

6560370
width	height
on an ideal camera that would be the center of the image so you can use width 2 height 2 for a start

6560407
onfocus	onblur
onfocus onblur would allow you to find out which one is currently active inactive

6560530
postgresql	mysql
fyi lastval is more or less the postgresql version of mysql s last_insert_id

6560530
postgresql	mysql
i only mention this because a lot of people are more familiar with mysql than postgresql so linking lastval to something familiar might clarify things

6560600
range	max
as rsapru suggested a max object maximum value is recommended to bound the graph to your preferred range

6560600
min	max
if you want to specify the graduations of the ticks you can do so manually by specifying ticks with the ticks object or have jqplot calculate tick spacing automatically nothing other than min and max objects would be needed in that case or by your specific number of ticks using numberticks object

6560629
google-chrome	safari
i ve run into a problem with webkit browsers google-chrome safari css3 media queries display and float on my site

6560673

6560798
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you continue to have issues with the webclient try justing using a plain old httprequest httpwebrequest

6560802
min	max
you need group by if you use min max i think

6560820
stdout	stderr
since you want to either see it as it runs and not capture it or capture everything and do something with it only at the end you can change the way it works in interactive mode by leaving stdout and stderr to none

6560857
google-chrome	firefox
if your primary user base is using ie6 7 or even 8 the page speed is going to be significantly slower than firefox or google-chrome

6560875
width	height
to get an nspoint of the center you can just get the x-coordinate of the origin and add width 2 and get the y-coordinate of the origin and add height 2

6560889
versioning	upgrade
a few days ago i upgrade the java sdk to the newest versioning 1.6.0_26 on my mac snow leopard 10.6.8

int clip double value

6560949
put	get
but i have this tickets which return a list of tickets get a ticket id which get a particular item get and an activate method put that change the ticket status from not activated to activated

6560949

something like a get put at the same time but without knowing before hand the id for the put

6561051
carrierwave	paperclip
but the idea is same for both paperclip carrierwave

6561110
maven	pom.xml
when you invoke a maven goal from the command line it will only pick up your pom.xml s configuration element if that configuration was made directly under the element and not under any element

6561166
tiff	png
those images need to be converted to the same image filetype png jpeg tiff whatever as your placeholder images renamed to the same name as your placeholder images and placed in the same directory as the placeholder images that were referenced in your after effects project

6561172
folder	directory
additionally creating this directory gives a simple and easy-to-use folder for saved games and other such data.

6561186
children	parent
just deleting the parent didn t delete the dependent children from the datastore

6561191
folder	directory
just one thing on linux it is preferred to keep settings in a hidden folder in user directory

6561203
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so far i have been successful with google-chrome and firefox but not with safari

6561236
int	boolean
you can t convert an int to a boolean in java

6561245
int	chars
the input consists in three unsigned int and a string of punctuation chars

6561308
jscrollbar	jscrollpane
and you can use getverticalscrollbar and gethorizontalscrollbar to get a jscrollbar from a jscrollpane

6561333
int	chars
chars to set the value type in this case int to a nullable value type

6561351
implements	extends
this site has examples of how threads get run either through extends thread or by implements runnable

6561385
onclick	onmousedown
this is the correct onmousedown not onclick

6561388
width	height
alternatively you could do the math and calculate the difference in width height and rescale the image on the report accordingly the result is the image on the report will appear smaller

6561428
passenger	unicorn
i m using unicorn instead of passenger but the vhost part of the structure is the same for any backend

6561465
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox are good ones

6561467
getter	setter
the idea of getter and setter are to allow developers to execute other required logic to derive the value for a class field

6561521
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to the new versioning of your library you will have just broken all of my code

6561538
int	chars
int open unix2003 const chars pathname int flags mode_t mode

6561580
jar	.war
for instance a class in an .ejb jar can t see a class in your .war but the reverse is ok

6561581
tiff	bmp
such a format more likely is bmp with rle compression or the tiff image format with zip or rle compression

6561630
calloc	malloc
should malloc or calloc be used to avoid this garbage value

6561699
pop-up	dialog
for the first pop-up it s recommended to use pure jqueryui and for your problem there is the element dialog

6561725
int	chars
in your first example you treat a pointer to an int like if it was a pointer to chars s

6561725
int	chars
incrementing a pointer to int adds 4 to it incrementing a pointer to chars adds 1 to it assuming 32 bit int and 8 bit chars

6561725
int	chars
dereferencing them makes an int and a chars respectively

6561725
int	chars
in your second example you treat the unsigned chars variable called sample as if it were a pointer to int and dereference it

6561725
int	chars
you are also passing a 1 byte chars and a 4 byte int to the second printf instead of 4+4 bytes that messes up printf reading 3 bytes more from the stack than you have given him

6561729
uploadify	swfupload
again i tried uploadify and swfupload

6561746
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux rails version is 3.0.9

6561768
accessor	properties
if you don t want that you will need to alter the base model to have a properties accessor by string with reflection but that is not very clever and fast to do on the datamodel

6561774
width	height
usually you do it in layout.xml setting appropriate layout parameters width height and scaletype

6561800
next	except
for example this question create a label in subversion indicating what files should be in the next release the 5 vote answer seems close but not quite there and this question using subversion tags to deploy to development staging testing server are similar to mine except the people attempting to answer don t seem to fully understand the subtleties

6561821
sqlparameter	oledb
read here for oledb samples using sqlparameter

6561823
width	height
first the css height width left and top properties take lengths

6561823
width	height
likewise you need to account for the unit on the values for the width and height

6561823
width	height
finally this will only work if the element has its width and height defined using inline style or if those properties have been set via javascript

6561855
kde	gnome
afaik you can t have wine applications look native on linux neither with qt or gtk+ the standard toolkits for kde and gnome respectively as wine emulates the win32 gui directly to the xserver libraries so there is no way that wine can talk to these toolkits however you can kinda use the colors

6561870
x86	64bit
im compiling to x86 tao wont run in 64bit

6561877
mongodb	bson
mongodb used bson a binary form of json

6561899
width	height
for the imagecontrol just set the height and width for the imagecontrol and the image will scale

6561899
width	height
if you dont set any height and width the control sets the appropiate height and width itself

6561907
width	margin
the main column might have a width of 100 but also a margin set in pixels for the secondary column to float in

6561918
width	height
the theory is that the function measures the browser viewports width and height and the video s width and height subtracts the video from the browser then divides that by two and applies it as left and top values in css

6561931
width	height
i believe it works when the width height are percentages too seems to but i m no css guru.

6561973
width	height
as the width and height styles are not set on the video element you have to pick up the size that is calculated for it

6561973
put	get	width	height
it s put in the width and height html properties so you can get those values and parse them

6562000
button	checkbox
if you are able to use win32 api try exploiting nm_customdraw notification not ownerdraw as i do yes button do send it including radio and checkbox

6562009
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if i will try to resize my browser window both maps will be displayed correctly i ve tried this in firefox opera google-chrome

6562021

awt	swing	swt	swing
swing awt swt if you are using java or other jvm languages

6562128
google-chrome	safari
this works fine on all the desktop browsers including safari and google-chrome which use desktop webkit

6562144
put	get
gmail for example lets you put a + sign in the address to fake a different email someone gmail.com will also get email sent to someone+else gmail.com

6562178
post	get
this is my current query to get all post tagged with a specific category which is determined by the category s id

6562205
wordpress	joomla
yet if you are using any cms or framework wordpress joomla

6562207
udp	tcp
caches should be run in a separate process and can be called via tcp udp

6562273
hazelcast	terracotta
i would start with terracotta ehcache or hazelcast

6562292
dictionary	map
dictionary is obsolete so you should use some kind of map instead usually a hashmap

6562333
hash	md5
md5 hash are now considered broken because collision might happen

6562358
min	max
select a.id s.classes count p.id max p.date as last min p.date as first

6562385
dictionary	map
as kilian foth mentioned you should use map instead of dictionary

6562411
google-chrome	firefox
right now i m using google-chrome 26 and firefox 20 to test.

6562413
dictionary	map
basically use two dictionary one containing a mapping from operator names to boolean functions and another containing a map from the property names of the user type to propertyinfos used to invoke the property getter if public

6562433
implements	extends
another way to do this is to extends baseadapter and implements spinneradapter to create your own adapter which knows that the elements in your arraylist are objects and how to use the properties of those objects

6562469
cassini	iis
in my case i just decided to use cassini dev web server v4 and run the tests on that web server instead of iis

6562507
superclass	subclassing
the problem is i m misunderstanding something about the use of super in superclass methods that are called by subclassing or some other subclassing detail

6562507
superclass	subclassing
so get_defining_fields is defined in the superclass and the super call within it uses self.__class__ in an attempt to pass the correct subclassing name to the call in each subclassing

6562507
super	self
when called in bar it resolves to super bar self .get_defining_fields so that the list returned by foo.get_defining_fields would be prepended to the one returned by far.get_defining_fields

6562507
super	self
edit as per daniel roseman s answer i tried replacing the super call with this form return super foo self .get_defining_fields + self._defining_fields

6562523
junit	cactus
i have some junit test classes and some cactus tests which need to work on myapptestdb.currently what i am doing is replace all db related parameters in local.properties and hibernate.cfg.xml with the testdb values

6562533
int	double
it looks like you need double -division and not int -division

6562540
free	malloc
if you run the malloc 3 library function will request 100 megabytes of storage from the operating system or handle it out of the free lists

6562559
post	get
in javascript you make an xhr request either get or post to your php script

6562559
post	get
update in your case with the form onblur when they move out of focus of an element you could run the ajax request sending the value of the input and then in the ajax.php script as a get or post request you could run your validation query to check if the user exists already or if the username isn t valid or whatever

6562567
portrait	landscape
i m assuming you re trying to close popover of rootviewcontroller in portrait orientation because in landscape it doesn t make sense

6562588
folder	directory
i am developing a cms in which i hav to show the administrator the directory structue of root folder

6562618
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is also quite interesting to compare how google-chrome safari opera and firefox draw

6562637
jobs	cron
anything with the word task in it are generally meant to be run from the command line or as cron jobs so you shouldn t be looking at those for the normal running of your application

6562650
junit	testng
for example i use java hence i could make use of either junit or testng i prefer testng now testng lets me create suite decide what is a test what should not be executed during test run test reporting and much more

6562667
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m unsure if this works in every browser but on modern browsers firefox 3.6+ ie8 9 i think safari google-chrome with cache enabled simply adding the elements to the dom loads them and caches them put them on the page in a hidden div so the next time they re requested its from your cache not the server totally eliminating the flash

6562676
post	get
i ve searched and read other post and still can t get it to budge

6562725
macdeployqt	qmake
how do i make apps smaller with qmake and macdeployqt

6562725
macdeployqt	qmake
i have set qt core gui in the projects .pro file and run qmake and macdeployqt on the resulting app

6562729
folder	directory
what is solution that i want to create directory in program files windows folder

6562735
post	get
if not please post the error or command output you get while doing so

6562746
folder	directory
the c program files folder is protected by design in vista and windows 7 and windows server 2008 2008 r2 - normal user accounts do not have any permission to create directory in there - it s a system folder

6562746
folder	directory
either you need to run as admin - then you have permission to create directory even in protected system folder - or you create the directory elsewhere and not inside a protected system folder

6562770
mybb	phpbb
i ve checked out some forum software phpbb mybb and smf for inspiration and they all tend to link to different pages of the website via a main index.php file containing a switch statement

6562785
toggleclass	slidetoggle
this toggleclass active .next slidetoggle 50

6562797
jboss	glassfish
after installing jdk 5 you just have to tell jboss to use that one instead of the glassfish system java version

6562904
post	get
then if you want to avoid caching problems you could use a post request instead of get

6562954
prepare	pdostatement
for more information see the documentation for pdostatement the class of prepare statements

6562955
google-chrome	firefox
that should work fine in firefox and google-chrome

6562959
width	height
the problem before the zooming i can get the width and height of holdview but after scaling it return zero

6562987
folder	directory
i opened the workspace directory and did not find the folder

6562989
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the former accesses the ivar directly while the later goes through the accessor of the properties testlist if you have one

6563020
disk	ram
relational database systems do their own disk swapping of course partly because they were designed when ram was more expensive and partly because they still sometimes deal with unusually large volumes of data

6563072
spweb	spsite
just a thought but you could always instantiate your own spsite spweb objects in your repository layer using the site web url like a connection string and the spsite spweb objects as connection objects

6563072
spweb	spsite
there may be a slight performance issue with creating your own spsite spweb objects vs the current spcontext objects but not sure how much

6563078
for-loop	loops
the for-loop never loops anything at all because objects don t have a length property and aren t indexed by number

6563084
gridview	rowdatabound
then inside rowdatabound event of the gridview add controls to the placeholder

6563100
mongodb	bson
imo storing user data in mongodb is fine -- you can do atomic operations on single bson documents so operations like allocate me this username atomically are doable

6563119
post	get
and yes you should be worried about sql injection if you use data directly from a post or get http request

6563156
eventlet	gevent
perhaps an easier way would be to just rely on gevent or eventlet to let you open lots of connections to the server

6563173
disk	ram
i would do my best to read the files in order as they appear on the disk minimize the amount of seeking across the device since files may be fragmented and read in large blocks of data into ram where it can be processed very quickly

6563218
children	parent
your controls should be children of your class derived from wxpanel not children of the panel s parent

6563267
children	parent
that is you can first jump to parent then to next then to children like this

6563312
hash	salt
you can store it salt and hash in a user settings file

6563316
hash	salt
you should one-way hash it using a good hashing algorithm such as sha512 preferably using a salt

6563348
hide	show
i need to made one uilabel thats show and hide intermittently likes information message in the main view.

6563399
versioning	upgrade
you either need to use the j2ee 1.4 sample app or upgrade your jboss to versioning 5 or 6

6563405
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
after checking reigels idea and this one i wrote this simple solution to the common problem of styling a input field tested it on firefox safari and google-chrome

6563433
min	max
if you have more specific requirements you can limit the number of characters allowed by replacing the plus sign with or where min and max are the number of times the preceding match is allowed

6563449
for-loop	loops
the for-loop doesn t create a new scope so you re always referring to the same i variable which will hold the latest value after loops

6563519
distance	polygons
-- distance for polyline area for polygons

6563538
wordpress	joomla
some oss projects joomla wordpress etc. use a constant to verify that a file is actually being called from within the application

6563557
post	get
when i watch in firebug i see the comment is created and there is a get called on the post which returns a success - even though the page doesn t update.

6563570
uiview	subviews
i have two views view a huge scroll view map with scrolling zooming etc. and its subviews b with same size as a subclass of uiview only for drawing of routes

6563606
nsbutton	nsmatrix
assuming your matrix of radio buttons is named matrix and is of type you find the selected nsbutton via nsmatrix s selectedcell method and then access the button s state via nsbutton s state method like this

6563621
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but does not work in google-chrome or safari even though the alert works

6563670
for-loop	arrays
so if you have to process a rather long arrays in a for-loop you can do something like this

6563676
post	get
now this loop is not executed if i use load but executed if i use .ajax or post or get

6563689
bmp	png
for example they might have a console application that will convert a bmp to a png and the gui calls this console application and passes the arguments etc to it

6563742
selenium-webdriver	remotewebdriver
does anyone have any instructions for a .net dev to run htmlunit and htmlunitdriver as a standalone server so that i can connect to it from .net tests using selenium-webdriver s remotewebdriver

6563743
lxml	beautifulsoup
i d recommend using lxml or instead of beautifulsoup among other great features you can use xpath to grab your links

6563760
google-chrome	safari
this also works with google-chrome safari developers tools

6563767
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you re using firefox you can use firebug or if you re on safari or google-chrome you can use their developer tools console

6563776
int	boolean
create_constraint if the boolean is generated as an int smallint also create a check constraint on the table that ensures 1 or 0 as a value

6563829
post	get
the page that it post s to should us get to get the selected attribute from the drop down and then retrieve from the database or where ever the options that go into the second drop down based on the parameter

6563829
post	get
the jquery ajax call has a way to get the response and let you define a custom function to be run once the post returns

6563859
setinterval	settimeout
is there a minimum allowed delay for setinterval and settimeout when being run on a tab you re not currently looking at

6563892

edit the following works in firefox google-chrome

6563986
accessor	properties
automatic properties have no use if they only have one accessor

6563999
post	get
like the get the selected item changed post

6564006
public	protected
but instead create one public non virtual method representing the consumer interface and one protected virtual method representing the implementer interface

6564012
post	get
i have tried with datatype html and type post and get

6564014
int	chars	range	min	range	max	min	max
check if the first chars is - to allow for negative numbers if you need them and add a try catch block to protect from numbers exceeding the range int min max value

6564014
min	max
if you don t have to deal with numbers approaching min max consider setting a max length maybe 6-7 digits and simply check string.length instead

6564309
pull	push
if this was permissions public key issue i wouldn t be able to push pull to from the repo

6564322
innodb	myisam
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

6564322
innodb	myisam
it s also worth mentioning that innodb supports row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking - which is to say that for many common situations innodb can be dramatically faster due to more queries executing in parallel

6564322
innodb	myisam
the bottom line use innodb unless you absolutely have to use myisam

6564394
ienumerable	ilist
in general foreach must support any ienumerable which only support forward enumeration of items in the collection as an alternative to reverse you could write your own optimized implementation that works on an ilist which provides an indexer

it has 2 restrictions that i want to remove so it works like malloc free

6564516
free	malloc

i guess this question is less about endianness and more about how the chars pointer and int work type conversion

6564581
int	double
one thing that boggles my mind about fstream is how can it decipher spaces and end of lines and intelligently read strings int double and place them into the appropriate data type

post	get
actions in asp.net mvc don t distinguish betweed post and get as far as the parameters to the actions are concerned

6564584
post	get
now to the second issue you need to change all your links so that you use post instead of get you can do this by using ajax check out in jquery for that

6564585
post	get
however this doesn t really solve your problem as a sufficiently interested and knowledgeable user can just as easily craft a post as a get

6564597
getter	setter
i m wondering if there s a way to effectively force a type on instance variables rather their setter and getter that s easier than manually defining them

6564597
getter	setter
i could write my own getter and setter as class methods but if smarter folk have already done the heavy lifting i d rather not have to trust myself

6564615
sorting	filtering
see bea stollnitz s article for a very good introduction to why collectionviewsource is needed and how it works. once the collectionview exists you simply call refresh on it every time you modify the collection that it s based on and the view takes care of sorting filtering and notifying the ui

ah found the problem myself had another function which was using keyup event there the input length was used to show hide the submit_twitter button like if len 140 hide button else show button this function was responsible for showing the button all the time as the len was ofcourse less then 140 characters

6565112
operands	scalar
vs2008 is notorious for doing all it s calculations in registers and i guess there will be some hazards that the cpu cannot skip like xor reg move mem- reg xor mov mem- reg mul mov mem- reg which is a dependency chain while the scalar code might be move mem- reg mul with mem operands mov. you should definitely look at the generated assembly or try vs 2010 which has much better support for intrinsincs

6565167
post	get
the code of the html+css would get a bit too long to post here

6565167
width	height
the image on the right is what you get after changing font size to 16px and making the color box s red width and height 1em and moving it down by 3px top 3px - the question still is all this could have been avoided by just having the content vertically center in the div in the first place

6565494
put	get
get rid of the whole block and put the following in place

6565498
free	malloc
when i call malloc it only allocates memory and put it s address to the pointer also free only frees the memory that pointer is pointing to

6565511
google-chrome	firefox
i m not actually sure if that s necessary because i haven t found anything in the java php and mozilla javascript regex docs that say hyphens need to be escaped like that and my tests in firefox 5 and google-chrome 12 show that it works either way

6565512
google-chrome	firefox
i looked at the reference video here which is encoded in three different forms ensuring it can play correctly in firefox which supports ogg google-chrome which supports webm and whatever supports m4v

google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome played perfectly

6565514
width	height
if i recall correctly from a video from google i o setting the width or height of a listview to wrap_content will cause it to measure the first 3 items and base its dimensions off of those

6565515
avro	thrift
the drivers are also not very mature or well documented from what i ve seen so far and everyone seems to be squabbling about whether thrift avro or cql is what should be used and that has changed from 0.6 to 0.7 to 0.8

6565515
put	get
it seems tried and true but as with mongodb you have to watch out for sharding issues you must put some thought into your keys or you get into trouble

6565625
children	parent
as far as i can see from the code you posted the absolute div you created is the child of one of the children of the brother of your user-3 div d this means that it floats on top of the last relative positioned item in his parent

6565641
mvp	presenter
as for your multiple views question if you have complex logic in that part of the form but i don t see it in your example you could probably separate that in separate user control mvp triad - this helped me to reduce and simplify the code of the presenter

6565724
ostream	istream
it inherits from iostream which inherits from istream and ostream which inherit from ios which inherits from ios_base

6565731
jboss	glassfish

6565805
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in the first case the variables should be nsmutablestring and i should cast them to nsstring using the copy method whenever they need to be arguments of functions that require nsstring objects

6565861
post	get
you could bind your read only columns to hidden fields so that the model you get from post back will be complete though this could be a security problem depending on why you chose to hide the other columns

6565870
width	height
is it possible to calculate the height and width of an image at the array stage then pass it through to the css html to position it centrally

6565871

6565905
width	height
now i am not able to resize the image based on the specified height and width

6565912
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in the first case the variables should be nsmutablestring and i should cast them to nsstring using the copy method whenever they need to be arguments of functions that require nsstring objects

6565912
nsmutablestring	nsstring
remember inheritanceâ an nsmutablestring is an nsstring just with some new stuff tacked on

6565923
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the only difference between nsmutablestring and nsstring is that mutable string can be changed

6565923
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you don t have to cast anything since nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring nor take different memory measures so you are right

6565925
width	height
i would suggest placing a single div on your page with fixed width and height

6565960
maven	pom.xml

6566002
free	malloc
you wrote you are looking for ideas so i am attaching one of my projects i ve done at university in which we should implement malloc and free ..

6566018
int	chars
the only valid explanation i can come up with is that the tag at the start may contain chars from the extended ascii table and since java doesn t have unsigned int a 1111_1111 255 byte might be interpreted as -1 when converted to int

6566027
qscrollarea	qvboxlayout
i m trying to put a qvboxlayout inside a qscrollarea in order for it to be scrollable vertically

6566030

6566136
portrait	landscape
i got idea to put some overlay on camera view and if iphone is in portrait mode to put some label with text use landscape mode instead of portrait

6566159
findwindow	postmessage
you probably need to wrap findwindow or similar so that you can govern which window will receive the keystrokes and you will need to use postmessage to inject wm_keyup and wm_keydown or whatever they are it s been a very long time since i did this sort of thing into the message queue for the hwnd of the target window

6566233
inherited	properties
both of these inherited from itemviewmodelbase and implement the appropriate properties

6566240
google-chrome	firefox
you can paste any of the three code samples above into the edit control and can see what happens with each version of the postcanvastoblobstore function the first sample will work in google-chrome the second will work in firefox and is the version the debug app defaults to and the third should work from all three but works for none of them when using this production website probably because of a blobstore bug.

in c you have to either use struct keyword where you use struct types or use a typedef like this

6566500
for-loop	arrays
then in the second for-loop you are treating it as an arrays

6566504
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve used tabs to create wpf applications using xaml and c# where i just have to use the tabcontrol and tabitem in the xaml code

6566527

this was especially nice for kde and gnome explorer.exe clones -- allow directory listings to update immediately when new files are added or removed without a busy-wait constant re-polling for directory contents.

6566632
put	get
when i put the fmod_result fm_result line and all that follows i get an error stating error c4430 missing type specifier - int assumed

i don t think super would work in this instance because i m overriding the function not extends it

6566685
google-chrome	firefox
well as you said you wanted to know whether this is a problem with firefox or not so i went and tested in google-chrome and it worked fine

6566685
google-chrome	firefox
my conclusion being that the lastmodifieddate attribute of a file object is not implemented in firefox 5 but is in google-chrome

6566685
google-chrome	firefox
here s a jsfiddle with it working in google-chrome and firefox 5 at least

first hash the password and then hash the hash of the password with the salt like this

6566724
hash	salt
take the password and the salt and hash them together like this

6566761
hide	show
that way you can just set remove the left property when you want to hide show them and the dimensions of the element are always available

6566761
width	margin
as for answering your question you should use offsetwidth and remember to add the padding border width and margin values of the element to the offsetwidth too

6566780
addclass	removeclass
if your .alerts element has a different css style when it has the .active class you should run the addclass and removeclass functions after the slide events have completed like so

6566799
sigkill	multitasking
when i double tap the home button and quit out of my app from the multitasking bar and open the app again xcode reads thread 1 program received signal sigkill and freezes my ipod

6566845
g++	gcc
i finally found gcc and g++ in developer usr bin but now it can t find the include directories

6566860
google-chrome	firefox
i believe that attribute works in firefox 3.6+ and google-chrome but not in any of the other browsers

6566876
portrait	landscape
however i have a uilabel in the bottom left of the screen and when i rotate from portrait to landscape the label seems to get cut off

6566946
hide	show
i remember reading on some tutorial forgot which that it s possible to show or hide a field based on if it is filled out or not

6566975
multiplying	add
sure i believe that multiplying by two is twice as fast as multiplying by two and add one

6567000
stdout	stderr
given your constraints would it be sufficient to redirect stdout and stderr to files

6567009
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome or firefox + firebug you can call the console.log method and then drill down into your object

6567033
client-side	server-side
as you can see we created a custom http header called db_success to be used as metadata so we can assign it server-side php and read it with client-side javascript to know if there was an error

6567039
ant	maven
use ant or maven or command files or anything else that doesn t have a lot of secret sauce that you re likely to accidentally stir

6567040
geocoding	geocode
so you have two choices - either build a timer which checks if geocode your placemarker function finished before you make another geocoding request

6567052
serializable	deserialization
the last answer seems to be the best option using a manual deserialization and serializable approach

6567059
client-side	server-side
works server-side and client-side without requiring you to draw a map like google.

6567065

6567112
folder	directory
the app folder ends up in this directory which i found by searching the windowsazureproject2 directory tree

6567112
folder	directory
update after doing some more reading it appears to me that what s really happening is that the approot directory is not being created and my app folder files are not being copied over either

6567121
integer	unsigned
the comparison will try to promote the integer value of d -1 to an unsigned long which will result in something like 0xffffffffffffffff and that s greater than 7-2 5 the result of total_elements-2

6567126
button	checkbox
it s a radio button not a checkbox and maybe another radio button in the same group with the same name is already checked

6567129
width	height
you can resize on the fly simply by changing the width and height of the image tag

6567129
width	height
however performing client-side resizing by changing the width and height parameter is viable if necessary

6567158
crypt	salt
to attempt to generate the literal key iv salt i used crypt cbc to generate the values like so

6567203
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage

if successfully complied this will create a .sys file in some folder in the current directory

6567369
ubuntu	linux
most would agree that linux ubuntu or other will give you much better results in performance and stability to run an app server like glassfish in any environment

6567390
folder	directory
in iis7 if it s a virtual directory you are not using the files from that folder to compiled the app instead from the root websites executable folder

6567390
folder	directory
so - your app in iis 7 needs to be an application in order to compile and search the bin folder for those resources - othewise its just a virtual directory which is some path on the url that points to some path on the disk

i can see the option in bamboo to select the output of the test results but it has to be a junit xml and jbehave reports are only generated in plain text or html

6572555
sorting	filtering
that way queries can make use of this index when sorting and filtering on both columns

6572568
translation	localization
other option is to create localization table with primary key based on string identifier and culture identifier 1033 1036 etc. containing translation texts and get translation data with appropriate query this would require joining...

hash	md5
the first is the hashing algorithm md2 | md4 | md5 | sha | sha1 and the second is the value to hash

6573277
post	get
so i have the hidden form element in my code and am using json to encode the data variable the assign it to the data hidden input on the form this form post to a page called save_price.php the trouble is when i print_r or var_dump the data variable i get null as an output i think it might be something to do with how i am using php to add the content into the data variable either that or i am doing something really obviously wrong hopefully you can see what the problem is there isn t a great deal of documentation online about retrieving saving to a db with php so i m kinda stuck banging my head against the wall on this one here s my code

the first approach that came to my mind was to create an imagefield and some meta fields on my model to store the crop ratio width and height of my selection

6573325
implements	extends
i am trying to implements a custom valve in tomcat say myvalve which extends basevalve

pop-up	dialog
is there any way to stop it from intercepting the messages so that the dialog that pop-up has all the info

6573582
ubuntu	debian
it is part of the normal repo for debian so i guess that is true for ubuntu as well just apt-get install nullmailer should suffice

6573605
google-chrome	firefox
and i say google-chrome because the stain does not appear neither in firefox nor in explorer tried all combinations in three different computers

6573611
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux

post	get
some dates might be a post and some a get and this is causing the date to switch from gb to us and i don t know how to differentiate

6573746
for-loop	loops
i m not sure why hard-coding the 1e8 into the for-loop prevents the removal of loops in case 3 or makes things slower in the other cases however the basic premise of case 2 being significantly slower is even more true

6573792
uitableview	reloaddata
when cell s textview grow bigger then cell height you need to call reloaddata method on uitableview instance and heightforrowatindexpath function must return the correct height for the extended cell

6573805
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and in case of other browsers like google-chrome firefox safari new file is created with the actual size of uploaded image

6573816
client-side	server-side
if you look at xsltforms you will see that it is based on an xslt stylesheet which can be applied either at client-side or at server-side

6573820
uitableview	reloaddata
you can trigger this by calling uitableview s reloaddata

6573882
integer	unsigned
what i am not able to understand is the flag update for unsigned integer addition for 2 integers a b where a and b are not both 0 and the result is i.e between 0x7fffffff 0x100000000

6573888
width	height
you can also check for other things like if contents don t have width height inner text and html don t match etc.

6573896
int	chars
note in particular that c must be an int and not a chars

6573919

6573963
width	height
i am creating popup windows using window.open and setting the height and width of the created screen

6573963
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is in ie firefox the navigation bar is excluded from the height i define which is good but in google-chrome it is not so my popup ends up being undersized with a right scrollbar

6573979
put	get
the funny thing is when i put a sleep 1 between every async_write i get mostly good data with a little gibberish something like that

6573979
put	get
here s what i get when i do not put sleep 1

6574092
subtract	add
the processor does not care whether you add or subtract signed or unsigned numbers - the resulting bit pattern is the same in both cases

6574092
division	multiplication
signedness is important for multiplication and division that s why those instructions have two mnemonics

6574105
gif	png
i m currently writing a front end for a php script not written by me that resizes images png gif jpg and saves them as jpegs

6574105
gif	png
its very simple and works fine when inputting jpegs but seems not to work for png or gif images

6574105
gif	png
can you see any reason why the png gif options are not working

6574235
opensso	openam
when using centralized agent configuration the configuration is stored in opensso openam server and the agents only contain a reference towards the server

6574308
int	double
the size of size float and sizeof double tend to be some multiple of at least sizeof short and often sizeof int to meet different needs even the ieee floating point standards allow multiple floating point formats

6574308
int	double
printf d sizeof double n int sizeof double

6574308
int	double
printf d sizeof long double n int sizeof long double

6574315
ubuntu	linux
i m running g++ ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5 4.4.3 on 64-bit linux

6574315
multiplying	multiplication
my conclusion from this is that floating point multiplication on the x64 architecture must take a variable amount of time depending on what values you are multiplying

6574321
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
in my application i need to pass existing sqltransaction and sqlconnection to the objectcontext

6574323

6574402
move	drag
i have an un-ordered list and every list item has an id...when i drag it up or down and place it i need to know the new position vaguely speaking like the id of element that move to make room for this new element ...is that even possible

6574426
iboutlet	ibaction
i have found can you hard code ibaction and iboutlet rather than drag them manually in interface builder

6574437
versioning	upgrade
there are some problems when i try install the newest versioning in other folder major upgrade

6574459
google-chrome	firefox
google instant sends ajax requests one after the other without your firefox google-chrome becoming unresponsive

6574465
google-chrome	firefox
so firefox and webkit first have to support the feature then firebug and google-chrome can respectively and in turn support the feature

6574471
unsigned	short
unsigned short st_mode

6574471
unsigned	short
st_mode is _mode_t and not unsigned short

6574471
filesystems	ntfs
time is expressed as a _time64_t and not a time_t so it has the same range that can be expressed by the ntfs filesystems and is not crippled to the 32-bit time_t

6574473
post	get
you can pass to it either via get post or cookie

6574489
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are popular and are available in several forms for os x

6574505
uiview	subviews
if the latency from doing everything from the catiledlayer thread is too high you can manually create a bunch of tiles as uiimageview subviews to a blank uiview which is the main subviews to the scroll view

6574540
width	height
for a simple wallpaper it s usually enough to scale your artwork in onsurfacechanged where you are given the width and the height as parameters

6574573
many-to-many	one-to-many
i m not sure now why i thought many-to-many but mapping it one-to-many with a join table is likely fine

6574601
button	checkbox	submit	submission
if a checkbox is not checked i alert and prevent form submission either submit button click or enter with bind false

6574602
accessor	properties
what this means is you have a coding convention for differentiating between properties access via accessor and direct access via a pointer

6574602
accessor	ivar
this simply indicates that the synthesized accessor should use the ivar named _foo for storage

6574615
winpcap	wireshark
i tried and no tools found anything wireshark and winpcap cannot loopback

6574650
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it looks totally ugly but in firefox this looks fine

6574650
google-chrome	firefox
i have latest google-chrome and firefox 5

6574676
client-side	server-side
there are two kinds of validation you need to consider client-side and server-side

6574676
client-side	server-side
note that you must do server-side validation even if you also do client-side because you can t trust the user to submit valid data

6574722
children	parent
i want to have children processes write to the parent s array

6574739
integer	fractions
the key point is that you use a fixed point table index so that you can specify an accurate delta for each sample - you use the integer part to get the table indices and then optionally interpolate between adjacent samples using the fractions part of the index

6574762
bash	subshell
are there actions in bash other than pipes and command substitution that start a new subshell

6574780
pull	push
if you want to pull in your production server or push to your production server from the central server and if you are using a hook like update post-receive or post-update you can easily make them pull or push only if you commit to the stable branch

6574780
pull	push
by checking the name of the ref to be what you want stable and then doing a push or pull to the production server will help you achieve the selective update that you want

6574793
equals	gethashcode
to improve these classes you might implement equals gethashcode iconvertible serialization validation etc

6574817
for-loop	loops
my question is when a for-loop is executed does the compiler read it once and then begin executing the loops with the values saved

6574817
for-loop	arrays
what i want is if an object is removed for the condition to be reevaluated so the for-loop doesn t try to do anything with arrays objects that don t exist but i don t want it to add to the count because if it does the for-loop will never end as it will keep adding objects that add more objects etc

6574834
np-hard	np-complete
hence in most of the cases the decision problem is np-complete to find whether the set of cities contain a tour while the optimization problems are np-hard finding the minimum length tour

6574850
for-loop	loops
the condition in a for-loop will be evaluated each time through loops

6574868
srp	principles
it appears to be violating the srp principles

6574946
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
both version seems to work in ie8 ff4 google-chrome opera and safari

6574948
hide	show
does anyone know of a simple script to have a list of items and show hide one at a time without engaging all of them in the list

6574970
openrowset	openquery
you can openrowset opendatasource or openquery as shown below second option doesnt need any linked server creation

6575002
client-side	server-side
please consider that you whatever you do in client-side you should always check the values at the server also have server-side validation as there are multiple hacks around like form-spoofing

6575035
post	get
therefore they don t get passed via get or post to your something.php file so you can t output them in an array

6575045
width	height
you can t set a width and height for a background-image in css afaik

6575047
mouseover	mouseout
w3c says that event.relatedtarget is the element where mouse comes from in a mouseover event or the element that the mouse goes to in a mouseout event

6575047
mouseover	mouseout
however ie uses two separate properties for those two cases event.fromelement is the element the mouse comes from in a mouseover event while event.toelement is the element the mouse goes to in a mouseout event

6575056
children	parent
or if it s not important that the children can pass their results back to the parent in realtime you can use forkmanager s ability to pass data back to the parent on exit through the finish call which would look something like

6575065
put	get
i have an instance of the above class called mstate and use the following to put it in and get it out of a bundle

6575075
lxml	libxml2
or use lxml which wraps the libxml2 in a pythonic xml classes

6575077
getter	setter
one trick that comes to mind is to put any fields like this into an abstract class which provides the necessary getter setter methods

6575102
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as the title suggests when i layer an swf over html with all the good stuff in place wmode transparent z-index i can t access the html elements in firefox google-chrome safari

6575128
portrait	landscape
the code above works fine if all the video clips were recorded in the same orientation portrait or landscape

6575168
cos	sin
it has the sin and cos functions in it

6575168
cos	sin
both sin and cos function accept one argument of type double which must be in radians

6575168
cos	sin
so to find the sin and cos of 30 degree say

6575170
hide	show
if valid the button click hide its panel and show the second panel for step #2 which contains another customvalidator

6575179
submit	submission
do you want to stop the normal submission of a form when user hits enter or clicks the submit button

6575198
pthreads	fork
there is no portable way to implement a variant of fork that preserves all threads using the interfaces provided by pthreads

6575208
hash	md5
edit - another option is to use the existing format and create an md5 hash the code would be something like

6575221
getter	setter
or you could put the logic that populates childrennames into a non getter setter method and invoke it manually after the query

6575225
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox and google-chrome but i have spend the last 1 hour trying to get it work with ie9

6575250
qmainwindow	qwidget
i created two new qwidget form classes in addition to the qmainwindow

6575255
uiview	calayer	uiview	caanimation	caanimation	calayer
in general rather than using caanimation s on calayer s you can use uiview animation

6575261
glog	gflags
i use gflags with glog and if you run --help the option logbuflevel might be what you are looking for

6575275
superclass	subclassing
having not used mkmapview before but you might be able to subclassing it and in your drawrect method first draw the superclass and then use standard cg drawing methods to draw your heading angle on top of it

6575282
width	margin
whereas the right y-label isnt shown is there a way to show it by decreasing either the margin between the left-edge and the left y-label or by decreasing the width of the actual plotted data without resizing the figure window

6575294
folder	directory
split them by 1000 in folder or by 100 take first second and third symbols of id string and put in separate directory

6575304
folder	directory
navigate to the utilities folder inside the flash builder 4.5 installation directory and find a file called adobe flash builder 4.5 plug-in utility.exe or similar if on mac

6575334
hash	md5
so now when i try to authenticate a user by looking up their email and md5 hash password it will fail every time

6575334
hash	md5
i can even hardcode it to the actual md5 hash of the string password and it works

6575340
int	double
i ve had no problem storing int and various pointers as void pointers but i get an error when trying to cast a double as a void pointer

6575340
int	double
i understand that double are stored differently than int and pointers at the bit level but i don t understand why i can t place whatever bits i want into the pointer assuming it has enough memory allocated and then take them out later casting them as a double

6575421
getter	setter
i can put the getter and the setter on separate interfaces like this

6575421
getter	setter

my guess is that the md5 hash function lacks additivity for this to be possible but maybe it can still be achieved by some clever construction

6583576
portrait	landscape
i ve used media queries to target ios and it looks fine in portrait orientation but doesn t fit to width 100 in landscape

proper use of - void viewdidload - void viewdidunload and - void didreceivememorywarning will allow you to maximize memory and performance

6583987
httpresponse	request
one way of doing this which i got working was to use httpresponse to execute a new request and then get the page content and search through that to get the title

6583998
width	height
better idea is to resize the image to max 480 in width or max 800 in height and the show it with with appropriate padding

6584004
width	height
i would like it to wrap around the image to have the same width and height

6584004

that way the anonymous function will be called only on mouseenter change the order of the params if you want it called on mouseleave

6584051
hlsl	glsl
today the term is mostly associated with glsl hlsl or cg which allow convenient hardware agnostic high-level programmability on consumer gpus

6584096
width	height
basically the code below is executed in ie6 and opens up a window of the width height i would expect

6584096
width	height
however in ie 8 or i guess ie 7 given that on intranet apps it will be forced to compatibility mode the dialog is opened with a larger width height

6584096
width	height
i ve a vague idea there might be a minimum width height being enforced but i can t find any documentation to back this up.

6584135
free	malloc
i think you cannot free the memory because free doesn t know how much memory to free.your program has information about the address malloc returned and not for every address in this space.so you can free s1 but not free s1+3 .also you can handle your pointers as an array in this example

6584137
pop-up	dialog
so say the dialog below pop-up my goal is to automatically click save file and then hit ok

6584143
mp3	ogg

6584421
rss	feed
the problem is that you are trying to parse rss tags in an atom feed

the workaround would be to use xmlreader.readouterxml to get the whole xml as a string and put it in a memorystream

6584547
post	get
my problem is that i have an ajax post the make dropdownlist will do an ajax posting on change and get the model based on the make i want to call the method in the lookupcontroller right away from the view and not passing through the vehicledetailscontroller which knows that my lookupcontroller has a lookupservicesql i want the contrainer to know that i want the lookupservicesql not the lookupservicesolr

6584651
uilabel	uibutton
all i have set initially is so you can t see the uilabel but the uibutton below it won t work anymore

6584673
inline	inlining
those rules might take account of whether the function is marked inline or not but quite likely don t unless you re using compiler options to force inlining or whatever

6584684
opera	firefox
ie6 netscape 6+ firefox and opera 7+ copy the following script in your page

uilabel	uibutton
when you want to hide your uibutton with your uilabel

6584848
multiton	singleton
this singleton is not thread safe if a thread is trying to get an instance while another is also trying to do the same race condition it may happen that before that the thread number one finishes the creation of the instance the second has already had access to the getinstance method and created his own instance of the singleton which means that at a t time we should have two instances of the singleton called multiton at that time

6584861
inherited	subclassing
why not build subclassing which inherited from xmlmodel then the decision between the classes is just at one point in the code

6584872

6584902
post	get
your question seems a little confusing -- i assume you must be doing get rather than post as there s no real limit on post

6584902
post	get
so the first thing i would do is make sure you re using post and not get

6584953
google-chrome	firefox
i have a horizontal menu that works fine in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie8

this was easy enough under ie firefox google-chrome plugins

6585108
clang	llvm
i don t really know about llvm clang but since clang has an option -wsystem-headers to enable warnings from system headers i d assume it does something similar to gcc for system headers suppress warnings for them

6585112
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like there has been a change to some recent version of google-chrome and firefox and now javascript execution seems to be different when the tab it is being run in is not the currently focused one

6585112
google-chrome	firefox
at the very least it s happening now on firefox 5.0 and google-chrome 12

6585117

6585163
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox do this now maybe safari too

put	get
from these notifications i get the height of the keyboard and that tells me where to put the bottom edge of the search bar

6585271
domcontentloaded	onload
if so - the domcontentloaded event might have already been fired even window s onload might and there is no way to actually call the code on domready in such situation

6585277
folder	directory
rubygems tries to install gems for system-wide access in a system-wide folder by default but it has a mode that lets you install them in a directory in your home directory

6585282
rss	feed
that page has an associated rss feed in atom format at - that d be more reliable to work from than scraping the html

6585299
joomla	typo3
we re better than the other guys like drupal typo3 mambo joomla because.

6585301
put	get
i really just stumbled through this until i put enough puzzle pieces together to get this to work

there are some custom configuration sections used for configuring examine and various other elements of umbraco and the relevant declarations in the web.config need to be set which they re not in the default .net3.5 config

6585371
linkbutton	selectedindexchanged
you need a buttonfield or a postback control such as a button linkbutton imagebutton with the commandname select for the selectedindexchanged event handler to trigger

6585389
margin	height
i wanted a percentage height and top-margin for my container div but the body would take on the margin of the container div

6585393
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried the following code in firefox and google-chrome which work fine

6585446
beyondcompare	winmerge
for 1000 lines this shouldn t be too hard with a simple visual diff tool like beyondcompare or winmerge free

6585545
folder	directory
when i build my wix project it creates a bootstrapper folder in the output directory bin debug bootstrapper

6585545

is that folder actually needed by the installer or is it just an intermediate directory

6585576

each question can be any one of the types checkbox radio button etc with multiple options

6585602
width	height
the 2nd argument is the bounding width and height imgscalr will use to scale the image -- keeping its proportions correct even if you passed in invalid dimensions -- there are many more detailed methods but that is the simplest usage

6585633
accessor	properties
you re not using the properties accessor mutator to set your class properties and you re releasing them in a method other than your dealloc method which is going to cause issues

6585633
accessor	properties
at the least you re violating the basic memory management rules by allocating eventstring detailsstring and date in initevent which is then the owner because you don t use a properties accessor mutator and releasing them in the eventdictionary method which is not the owner

6585643
parsley	robotlegs
with that said my 2 personal choices are robotlegs and parsley

6585643
flex	robotlegs	parsley	robotlegs
parsley is more robust and adds a lot more features than robotlegs which is why its been used in the world s largest flex applications

6585660
google-chrome	safari
the problem only occurs when the user is managed for parental controls. it does not happen for standard or administrator users and it does not happen in safari or google-chrome for any users

6585662
hash	md5
md5 is intended to be a one-way hash

6585668
hash	md5
an md5 hash password is not reversible

6585668
hash	salt
generate a token maybe hash a timestamp with a salt and store it into the database in the user s record

6585668
hash	md5
when you hash a value like a password using the md5 function in php the final value is going to be the same for that password no matter which server you run it on

6585668
hash	md5
you md5 hash a bunch of dictionary words weak passwords in order to get their md5 hash values

6585668
hash	md5
now when the rainbow table is run against your database it s not as easily reversed because the md5 hash of password is different than password384746

6585668
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

6585729
getter	setter
this could be dangerous as you might have logic in the property setter getter but if they don t have logic you could say

6585734
scikit-learn	pybrain
i ve been reading the documentation of different machine learning libraries in python pyml scikit-learn pybrain but i haven t found anything useful

6585739
move	drag
i know why i m getting these messages it s because i am changing the left property every time the mouse is move but this is the behavior i want because it is a drag operation

6585874
modifiers	sealed
the sealed modifiers only applies when a method is already an override of a member in the base class

6585875
move	drag
the 3 cards below should be move via drag

6585879
hash	md5
first of all i would suggest moving off of md5 to a stronger hash function such as the sha2 family

6585879
hmac	pbkdf2
therefore you will get your client to do hmac data pbkdf2 somesecret 1000 and the server will just store pbkdf2 somesecret 1000 then do hmac data storedresult

6585885
win64	windows
the sad fact is that our grid needs to be hosted on win32 since all the test pcs run windows xp 32bit with an option to upgrade to win64 at sometime in the future

6585925
post	put
here are a couple post put together by jeff and me explaining the reasoning and better alternatives

6585989
put	get
if you have img tags inside a container div with class .div1 they will of course get the styling you define in .div1 img but if you want lets say 2 images out of 8 in that div to have another style which i believe is why you made class .myimg you need to put

6585999
getter	setter
unfortunately in this case the method of calling getter setter from the base which is a friend would create more problems than it solves - the code should be as clean as easy to follow and as connected to the physics as possible in the implementation of the tool itself a user should not need to be an expert in either c++ or the inner workings of the program to create a tool

6586040
post	get
if i delete all the entries in the post model i get an error when i try reference the first item in the post list ordered by date which i did like this

i m working with a table item which has the field aprovado and it s an int that checks if the item is approved or not 1 for yes 0 for no not my table i would have chosen proper boolean

6586119
gif	png
you can t easily resize an image from one file size to another but most jpg png gif etc

6586150
hash	md5
you could for example calculate the sha1 or md5 or any other hash of the coordinates + seed and use it in the prng

6586187
inherited	subclassing
if you re performing the same basic html modifications you could subclassing system.web.ui.page implement your custom rendering and then have all of the emails inherited from your new subclassing

6586196
jcomponent	jdialog
is so hard to manage focus between two jframes better would be create only one jframe and other top-level containers would be jdialogs create one two jdialog s and reuse that by removing all jcomponent

6586391
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome and firefox w firebug

6586405

the problem is when i go back into portrait orientation to show view controller a view controller a is stuck in landscape orientation

i suppose that ms equation editor can produce a png jpeg gif or bmp windows format image for the equation

6586516
profiling	instrumentation
there s no way to tell whether object allocation and deallocation are performance bottlenecks in your code without some work in the profiling shark or instrumentation

6586608
folder	directory
you must have the entire path to this folder in the from directory field

6586608
folder	directory
so for example if the project folder you are reconnecting is named common the from directory should have something like c xampp htdocs common in it

6586608
folder	directory
select the check box next to the folder displayed in the window below from directory to specify that you want to import all files in the folder

6586626
keydown	keyup	keydown	keyevent	keyevent	keyup
just as an addendum to chad s response which worked almost perfectly for me i found that i needed to add a check on the keyevent action type to prevent my code executing twice once on the keyup and once on the keydown event

6586640
inherited	properties
the context class inherited from objectcontext and exposes my poco entities as public properties

6586670

update 2 i understand i just wonder how v8 and the firefox js vm implements the object.properties getter setter

6586673
put	get
when i run this code i get the exception ora-01426 numeric overflow. i am not doing any calculations and i put the whole thing into a string before i submit the query

6586732
dsn	pervasive
the timberline system uses a pervasive database and my app communicated with it via and odbc driver using a dsn

6586738

this will however also mess with the background-color of the parent and not allow you to select the text underneath the transparency div

6586743
ant	maven
the manager-script role is the designed way to go for ant maven scripts

6586766
junit	testng
there is only one difference between testng and junit in this specific area junit will create a brand new instance of your test before each test method testng will not

6586770
entity-relationship	diagram
an entity-relationship diagram showing all of the tables they use and their key relationships would help ensure that they always use the correct keys

6586791
entity-relationship	diagram
assuming the database has the proper pk s and fk s in place it would probably help a great deal to generate an entity-relationship diagram

6586825
int	boolean
the most common types are string int and boolean but you can also store values as color object or as a connection string

6586830
post	get
i know i can override onactionexecuting actionexecutingcontext filtercontext for each controller- but it sounds crazy to have to handle each action seperately get the id or object depending on if its a post or get and then check if the operation is allowed

6586853
uicontrol	uibutton
another note if you want to intercept touches to that shadow view you can either make it a giant button subclass uiview to override one of the touch methods like touchesended or change it to a uicontrol which can receive touch events like a uibutton but without the extra options for text shadows states etc

6586914
min	max
i can calculate the min and max lat longs and find the center point on where to center the map but i also need to calculate the zoom level programmatically

6586933
min	max
if you have an outlier in your data the standardize filter might hurt your data distribution as the min or max might be much farther than the other instances

6586954
versioning	upgrade
the reason for this setting existing is to allow companies who have internal sites designed for older versioning of ie to upgrade to a new versioning without breaking those sites

6587028
getter	setter
you can weasel your way around this by having auditinfo as a nested inner class within product and add getter and setter methods to product which set the fields on the auditinfo

6587042
post	get
and should i use get or post method to send the json messages to from my app

6587059
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both require key events to be followed by blur event in order to call onchange

6587059
google-chrome	firefox
my understanding as to the reasoning for the blur event on google-chrome and firefox is to save resources but i disagree with that

6587077
width	height
essentially i am trying to create a simple web based image viewer using css3 transforms for rotate and scale and would like a containing div with fixed width height to be able to scroll to see the full content of the image it contains

6587085
width	height
hovering over an image would display a dot on the right side of the image which can be dragged thus changing the width of the image height would update proportionally

i am trying to add rows to my repeater using jquery using below script.it is working perfect in ie but not in firefox google-chrome and safari

6587297
fileoutputstream	printwriter
if the printwriter constructor was to throw you really should release the fileoutputstream anyway which precludes just closing the printwriter

6587341
super	self
btw self means the current instance of my object while super means the current instance of my object but use the methods as defined by the superclass

6587367
width	height
those blocks can be laid out with css s display inline-block where the elements behave like block level elements which means you can set width height etc. but display on the same line as each other

6589707
getter	setter
if you are synthesizing properties then it is a lot easier to use the getter and setter and let them do the memory management for you

6589707
getter	setter
the exception being in your init dealloc methods where you should try to directly use the ivars to avoid any potential side effects of using the getter setter

6589707

you seem to be assuming that there is some change in the behavior of delete rules between one-to-many and many-to-one but there isn t

6590002
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you think about it it has to be that way because a one-to-many is just the reciprocal relationship of a many-to-one

this leads me to believe that the problem is not with the gjs implementation of cairo but with the gjs introspection methods for clutter cairo implementation

6594089
width	height
i have a defined fixed width and height to resize an image

6594089
width	height
in this case fixed width and height cause a problem

6594089
width	height
i want to calculate width and height in a smarter way

6594089
width	height
for example lets say i have defined width 1024px and height 768px

6594089
width	height
and i want to resize an image which is vertical height 1100px and width 200px

6594089
width	height
lets say if the above example image should be resized to maximum height of 768px but then what about the width

6594089
width	height
similarly if the image has the height 200px and the width 1100px

6594089
width	height
so the width should be decreased to 1024px but what about the height

6594089
width	height
the third problem is that let s suppose if both height and width are more than the maximum height and maximum width let s say width 1100px and height 4000px

6594089
width	height
now since width and height both are more than the maximum width and maximum height but the image is vertical it will make it horizontal

6594089
width	height
so how can i check if in this case if i should resize the image according to maximum height or according to maximum width

6594117
inherited	properties
because of this i d create a view model that inherited from the actual class and then override the properties that needs remote validation

6594135
width	height
what you need is to maintain the width height ratio

6594135
width	height
originally you have an image of size wxh 500x1000 this width height ratio is 0.5

6594135
width	height
assuming you are changing 1000 to 768 in height your result width would be

6594135
width	height
another example 1800 x 1200 and your new height is 200 then your new width is 300 because 300 200 is 1.5 and 1800 1200 is also 1.5

6594798
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
since nsmutablearray is a subclassing of nsarray it inherited all its methods and declared properties so it publicly behaves like nsarray

6594829
gridview	repeater
you may have some code to bind data to the gridview control but this will not automatically bind anything to the repeater within the itemtemplate

6594837
width	height
than both the width and height of the

cpu	processors
creating and drawing a bitmapped image in memory is a cpu and memory-intensive task and so your absolute performance values may be skewed by the performance or lack thereof of the processors and memory subsystems causing inconsistent results across multiple platforms

6595003
width	height
you can assign any desired + - signs to those four points by choosing the appropriate rectangle. and 4 is a good guess for a number of dimensions for rectangles since you can specify any rectangle with x y of a certain corner along with width height

6595045
width	height
i agree with the image in absolute div with 100 width and height

6595045
width	height
make sure you set 100 width and height for the body in the css and set margins and padding to zero

6596353
onclick	onchange
i was using the above code and when i clicked the second radio button i thought i should get two events one from the button that got unchecked and other from the button that got checked because logically speaking both buttons got their state changed and i have binded the onchange event not the onclick event

6596356
width	height
according to that article you might need to set an explicit height or width width 100

6596361

i got the post correct for posting statusses but i want to get the users mentions but im receiving could not authenticate with oauth the whole time

6596369
getter	setter
then if there is any custom logic in the getter setter i know it will be run

6596369
getter	setter
it is much safer to let the getter setter worry about all this logic any time you set your ivars

6596445
children	parent
i ve tried various combinations of views relationships and arguments with no luck other than getting the correct price tags on the parent pages but not on their children

6596445

groupbox	panel
i found out that am placing the control in multiple controls on the form is a panel inside the panel is different groupbox these group boxes have the controls am trying to trap their events

6596448
yacc	bison
for that you need a yacc bison program which does not come included with visual studio 2010

6596488
mouseup	mousedown
if you are looking for an event that fires repeatedly while the button is held down you are out of luck but you can use the mousedown event to repeatedly perform an action and stop when the mouseup event is triggered

6596488
setinterval	clearinterval
for example you could use the setinterval function to repeatedly call a function while the mouse button is down and then use clearinterval to stop when the mouse button is released

6596500
post	get
because when it wants to send the post data or get data back to the server it simply uses the name attribute as the key of the parameter and the value of the currently selected radio button which has that name attribute as the value of the sent parameter

6596532
queue	fifo
does nservicebus make sure messages are drawn down from a queue in a particular order like fifo or lifo

6596584
mouseup	mousedown
mousedown mouseup click

6596584
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
what you probably want to do is receive mousedown set a timer and if neither mouseup or mousemove occur within some time invoke some behaviour

6596605
serializable	deserialization
your passed message looks more like some deserialization of xsd it can be possible because datatable can transfer its description as part of its serializable data

i have seen lots of post about how it s not possible to set the position but nothing on whether or not it s possible to get the position

6596841
width	height
however without specifying the width and height these won t display

6596841
width	height
this would have me specifying a fixed width and height for each of the images which i guess would work for a static webpage

6596841
width	height
however because these images are generated dynamically with jquery and are user submitted images differ in width and height each time

6596841
width	height
my question is if there is a way to do this with css only to have the width of containing the image being passed on to the before on this li so that the before and after pseudo-elements inherit the width and height of the orginal element

6596861
filtering	grouping
you are already grouping by what i think are the right fields and your where clause will apply the categoryid filtering for you

6596981
actionlink	redirecttoaction
i could specify direct urls like customer 23 approve instead of using actionlink and redirecttoaction but would rather stick to functions provided by mvc

6596993
webclient	httpwebrequest
the simplest way would be to create a webclient object and call its downloadstring method although if you need anything other than a simple request response you may have to use httpwebrequest to craft your request

6597023
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can use httpwebrequest class or webclient class its in system.net namespace

to decrypt the stream you first need to remove the header added by crypt cbc s salt mode

post	get
edit this has been answered i no longer wish to post the url to my site.hoping this is ok and it does not get voted down to much -

6597171
post	get
the traditional way would be to pass a session identifier in get and post requests though that suffers from serious security risks

6597171
post	get
i could think of a more roundabout way of using ajax and client-side storage to request session-specific bits of data from the client s runtime but it d all boil down to url parameters in a get post request.

6597177

folder	directory
to add something to meta-inf you need to create a folder of this name in your src the source directory spi

6597464
sequence	permutation
permute the bits in a non-obvious way a fixed permutation is probably fine but if you want something more sophisticated you could use something like george marsaglia s xorshift algorithm that produces a psuedorandom sequence of integers that only repeats after a very long cycle

6597489
opera	firefox
on another note if your having troubles with only firefox or only opera you can do something like this to code css for each specific browser may be helpful once you better know the issue

6597493
express	node.js
i have a node.js express app that queries a mysql db within the route and displays the result to the user

6597505
textview	imageview
in my xml layoutfile for the listitems i have an imageview and a textview

6597515
client-side	server-side
it does not matter if you are doing it server-side with php or client-side with javascript -- you must escape any input you receive before you turn it into output

6597551
carrierwave	paperclip
i recommend the usage of an external plugin such as paperclip or carrierwave

6597561

same reason as this question - jquery text slidedown slideup overlay on image keeps bouncing

6597587

6597685
int	chars
the other is to use the slice operator to get the last 4 chars and interpret that remainder as a hexadecimal int

6597689
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should probably use mouseenter og mouseleave for each function

6597692
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox 5 ie 9 google-chrome 12 and safari 5 and opera 11.5

6597692
versioning	upgrade
i ve written a workaround to use in my application until i can upgrade to a more recent versioning of jquery

6597696
hide	show
keyword and have it hide them all except the current one that was clicked and then show the current one by using the this keyword

6597707
int	chars
though perhaps it can be made more efficient to store chunks in int long and do int arithmetic than store it in chunk of chars

6597731
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

6597783
doc	rtf
for example our dxrichedit control is able to work with rtf docx doc and many other formats

slideup	slidedown
in jquery mobile page transition effect is accomplished by setting data-transition properties i.e slideup slidedown etc

6597847
profiling	instrumentation
i used instrumentation to profiling the performance and this is what i got the functions which drain the most performance are either from the physics engine farseer or the exen xna wrapper functions they call notably vector2.max vector2.min

6597865
nginx	lighttpd
nginx and lighttpd have similar solutions.

6597877
unbind	hoverintent
first you oculd use the hoverintent plugin which will ignore quick mouseovers or you could unbind the mouseover action until the animation is complete

6597912
hide	show
you show your real target and hide its siblings which aren t needed

6597929
websphere	ibm
which is it trying to recover but can t see ibm - websphere application server fails to start with xaexception xaer_rmerr xa_recover

6597975
margin	word-spacing
if the design is incredibly pixel perfect you can remove the actual word-spacing between the inline-blocks by removing the whitespace in the html or by giving them a negative right margin of about 0.25em

6597999
rvm	bundler
the problematic server is using rvm bundler so i m assuming it s somehow related the other one is vanilla ruby

6598005
post	get
i tried to get all changes to the root node only before and had to post process it

6598007
width	height
i would recommend setting specific height width in your css and then using jquery to replace the images as the page loads

6598059
submit	submission
but i ve got an html form submission data to a java backend which handles the data and submit it to the database

6598068
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it leads me to believe it s occurring because you shouldn t use a uitabbarcontroller as a viewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller stack

6598163
post	get
is there a better way to handle the model in the view state so during the post of the form submission i can get all of my fields

6598176

i don t need more than atomic read operation and atomic write operations i have no use for fetch-and-add compare-and-swap etc.

6598202

and the performance will reach 100 on that core in case your program only do a for-loop or other kind of loops

6598214
ant	maven
using ant the classes get built to the correct folder webapp web-inf classes but it fails to do so with any maven configuration i ve tried to far

6598265
integer	unsigned
i am using mpir 2.4.0 on windows msvc 2010 and i was trying to add an unsigned 64bit integer to a mpz_t number

6598267
folder	directory
copy views-view-field.tpl.php to your theme folder from the views module directory under theme

6598327
fontfamily	font-size
for example in a css file when you type font omni completion could show the expected values font-style font-variant font-weight font-size line-height fontfamily

6598336
post	get
you may have to fiddle around with it some more to get everything working exactly as you want but i was able to create wcf service for biztalk to accept a very simple http post

6598338
maven	m2e
personally i use maven and eclipse with the m2e plugin

6598354
post	get
if you had access then you could have post a message to get access to the events

6598389
google-chrome	firefox
it displays perfectly in google-chrome 12 and firefox 5 but in ie 9 it looks like this

6598483
uiview	subviews
for uiview subviews in self.subviews

6598524
icmp	udp
i asked about icmp packets but another alternative would be udp packets if i could set the ttl

6598537
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller - uiviewcontroller - uiviewcontroller

6598636
maven	m2e
you may want to look at the gwt maven plugin which says integrate nicelly into eclipse thanks to m2e and google eclipse plugins.

6598711
post	get
the reason is because mvc s model binding only looks at the get or post parameters to bind the myfield to the action s model and if the get post parameters don t have a myfield value then it has to keep that property as null how else is it going to know what the value shouldbe

6598711
post	get
in order for the model binder to see your myfield value is to pass it in the get post parameters and to do this you have to explicitly tell your view s form to pass the value in via html.hiddenfor

6598711
post	get
there s no way for the view to automatically know to send that property in the post get parameters

6598711
post	get
it is better to re-retrieve this data from the database if this data is going to be used for anything in the controller because even though it s read only on the html form users can still set this value to anything they want by manipulating the post get data

6598731
pull	push
for xml streams saxon has its own internal push pull interfaces receiver and pullprovider respectively and there are classes that map both of these to from the corresponding java and .net interfaces

6598740
vb.net	vb6
visual studio has a wizard that allows you to convert vb6 into vb.net which you could then reference in your c# project and use

6598764
for-loop	arrays
and i d like to use a simple for-loop to load images from the values in the galimgs arrays like so

6598786
google-chrome	firefox
for example this code works fine in firefox but breaks in google-chrome 12.0.742.112

6598801
openssl	opensc
i could use the openssl library but to support pkcs11 you need to wire up through an engine opensc have one but then it starts getting very big

6598835
getter	setter
right now i m writing a class that will provide getter and setter methods and am stuck on a design issue

6598854
interpreted-language	compiled-language
php is an interpreted-language as is not as efficient as java c or other compiled-language

6598893
getter	setter
in python you should prefer not to use getter and setter at all

6598893
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter in other languages is for encapsulation and for future-proofing in case you need to add logic to the getter or setter

6598946
fadein	hide
and voila when the div makes the fadein effect it starts going up and down of course the cpu usage goes up so when i press the button again to hide the div i revert the css to reduce cpu usage and improve performance

6598947
getter	setter
generally in python it s very bad style to use explicit getter setter methods

6598975
int	boolean
mostly the language deals in strings but i need to support boolean and numbers int and decimal as well

6598982
opera	firefox	post	get
in firefox and opera one can create a custom search engine but it passes along the search as a standard get or post variable

6598988
maven	pom.xml
i am using the eclipse plugin for maven to generate eclipse projects from maven pom.xml files

6599012
post	get
another approach to consider would be using the post method rather than the get method for your request

6599066
width	margin
you need to set a width to your div and add the margin css property shown below

6599098
post	get
when you get or post this

6599103
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i can capture all the events for touches on all the subviews when i put touchesbegan touchesmoved etc in the uiviewcontroller class

6599153
uiview	subviews
the image can be zoomed in out so the line has to respond to that as well which is why having another uiview as a subviews won t work for me

6599161
submit	submission
i would suggest you use the submit and not the click on the button as you can place preventdefault and return false in the function to stop the button from submission

6599262
filtering	grouping
the filtering of your search objectclass grouping

6599303
pull	push
since binaries aren t stored in delta for most of them and aren t compressed as well as text file if you are storing rapidly evolving binaries you end up quickly with a large repository which becomes much cumbersome to move around push pull

6599343
portrait	landscape
i have a navigation controller within the same nib that can be set to landscape but this ends up looking awkward in interface builder as the nav controller is set to landscape but the containing window is in portrait

6599363
versioning	upgrade
it still works in ie7 ie8 so i m trying to find out if i just simply need to upgrade my versioning of extjs or if it is a configuration error on my part

6599364
google-chrome	firefox
ps if this would be easier more efficiently done in firefox or some other browser rather than google-chrome that is fine as well

6599383
versioning	upgrade
i m in need to have more than 1 synonym for a search term in magento versioning 1.4.2.0 - can t upgrade it for now but all my attempts to add multiple synonyms have failed

6599413
easymock	powermockito
i could not find any objects that could be mocked using easymock or powermockito in order to similulate a stale connection so i was there any properties we can set on the connection cache to expire a connection

6599416
min	max
while not strictly mathematical operations you can use the javascript math object s functions max and min to do this

6599437
actionscript	mxml
flex also includes mxml which is declarative language and may be easier to digest if you don t know understand actionscript

6599499
uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
basically you have one instance of uiwindow that s hosting all your uiviewcontroller and uiview as part of the view hierarchy

6599499
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
for more information read up the developer documentation on uiwindow and uiviewcontroller which provide a great explanation on the differences

6599535
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in all of the browser i tried ie8 google-chrome firefox ..i tried with clearing cache restart apache server..but problem is still there

6599548
unsigned	short
i have plenty of indices that would fit a unsigned short but they are represented as int in java

6599581
put	get
depending on your needs you can search replace those tags or put the string you get from the server into uiwebview

6599596
unsigned	short
in java an unsigned short can be represented as a char

6599596
int	chars
just cast the int to chars and use putchar on the bytebuffer

6599613
pop-up	dialog
and thus to trigger a new pop-up dialog

6599620
oncreate	ondestroy
i handle the oncreate ondestroy events and initialise tear down any global variables in those functions

6599620
oncreate	ondestroy
my implementation is slightly different in that i have a java activity which then calls into the ndk code during the oncreate ondestroy functions but you may be able to directly override nativeactivity oncreate but i don t know as i haven t tried this

6599738
rss	feed
i have a php script that generates an rss feed using some external data it retrieves

6599740
cos	sin
in mathspeak that would be ob oa cos theta + oaxn sin theta

6599743
folder	directory
i managed to solve a similar problem by making the entire path to the database at least from your home directory readable and executable in addition to making the folder the db is in readable and writeable

6599794
macports	homebrew
i installed clojure and clojure contrib manually through homebrew and macports all of them gives me this error

6599797
traceroute	packets
when i do traceroute from one solaris m c to another using 10 gig network interface it takes 0.073 ms for 40 bytes packets

6599815

google-chrome	firefox
as you can see between help and the margin in google-chrome are 33px and in firefox 57px

6599835
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works on google-chrome and safari but try it on firefox

6599852
screens	tablet
i m looking into writing an application to act as a joypad on a touch screens tablet running windows 7 written in c# .net

6599859
pull	push
once it s done push pull will be exposed by objective-git

6599874
hide	show
this whole form is in a table format and that is not about to change so i guess the easiest approach would be to show hide a cell but i have no idea how to connect that to a specific option being selected

6599889
retaincount	dealloc
this will end up with an instance variable with a retaincount of only 1 so when you dealloc the object it won t leak

6599900
getter	setter
it is often recommended to access the ivars directly in the init and dealloc method to avoid any side effects caused by setter getter

6599900
getter	setter
throughout your class you will want to use the kvc setter getter or dot notation to set objects like this

6599901
icmp	tcp
icmp and tcp are way different protocols

6599904
google-chrome	firefox
pop up your javascript console shift-ctrl-j in google-chrome firefox and you ll see the error

6599910
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a javascript application that works in firefox and google-chrome but breaks in internet explorer 7

6599913

if my java app is running under windows i can call runtime.getruntime .exec rundll32 shell32.dll shellexec_rundll + filename

6599931
width	height
specify a height and width for the image in the img tag

6599931
width	height
this way you will be able to restrict the height and width of the image

6599934
installation	upgrade
to automatically remove older msi installation you can use the upgrade element with your old msi upgradecode

6599948
solaris	aix
gwt application not runs on windows linux solaris aix etc

submit	submission
however when you submit a form the page is torn down and replaced with the result of the form submission

6599989
submit	submission
alternatives are to avoid doing the ajax request entirely or to cancel the form submission wait for the ajax response even though you don t care about it and then submit the form programmatically via htmlformelement#submit mdash

serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
now this serializable fine but in deserialization uses getteams presumably because jackson sees a getter with a mutable list and thinks it can use it as a setter

6600012
getter	setter
so what i d like to do is annotate getteams so that it s never used as a setter but is used as a getter

therefore theoretically only sha1 and md5 should differ in the hash that is produced

6600401
next	except
so far i have written a subclass of my importer that simply intercepts the web requests before it actually calls the url in question and tests that all the inputs are of the right type and form and this works fine in all cases except where the perl script needs to read the response for instructions and then proceed to the next steps

6600410
integer	unsigned
is sign-extending right shift when the left operand is a signed integer and is zero-extending right shift when the left operand is an unsigned integer

6600410
integer	unsigned
so when applied to an unsigned integer the bits at the left are filled with zero whereas when applied to a signed integer the bits at the left are filled with the leftmost bit which is 1 when the signed integer is negative as per 2 s complement

hexadecimal md5 hash

6600658
hash	md5
the md5 hash

6600658

6600926
mef	prism
to solve this simply set the prism container as the default container for mef to use

6600926
mef	prism
the annoying part is that if you choose to use mef2 codeplex you must rebuild the prism binaries and replace all references of the .net 4 mef library with the codeplex mef2 library

6600933

you can declare an activity as being only landscape or portrait in your androidmanifest.xml

6601130
swrl	owl
or is legal in swrl rules if expressed using owl s objectunionof

6601130
swrl	owl
note also that your rule can be easily expressed in owl you don t need swrl at all for this rule

6601130
swrl	owl
stating everything in owl if possible has some benefits you get better tool support there are more owl reasoners than swrl reasoners and you get more powerful reasoning swrl reasoners apply the rule only to known individuals

i suppose i can name different html divs and make them show and hide at certain times as desired

6601225
width	height
well in your case the width is 320 and the height is 400 but for any uiview you can get the width and height with myview.frame.size.width and myview.frame.size.height respectively

6601242
dbcontext	objectcontext
everything i have found uses an older version i use dbcontext not objectcontext etc. and i am having problems writing it myself

6601242
children	parent
unfortunately it caused an exception because the parent comment had the child in its list of children but the parentid of the existing child had not yet been updated

6601256
dbcontext	objectcontext
on msdn you can find the documentation for dbcontext there you can see that it implements iobjectcontextadapter explicitly so cast your dbcontext-deriving context to iobjectcontextadapter and use the objectcontext property

6601351
children	parent
is the issue that the parent and children aren t being differentiated

how do i calculate the minimum scale as in a percentage so that scale of the image meets the minimum width and height requirements

6601420
chown	chmod
as jakub has pointed out in the comments it is generally a good practice from security standpoint that instead of using chmod 755 on all directories it is better to use chown and tie it to a user account and allow group read write permissions

6601424
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
my first approach was to create a new nsarraycontroller bound to an custom property of my nstreecontroller object iderived a class for that but that property only called once and not updated anymore after that

datediff	difference
i have eliminated datediff so the id returned from date difference is directly in where

6601588
gson	jackson
if you re able to use a library other than jackson for your json serialization then you can use gson with a custom gsonbuilder object which may get you close to what you re trying to acheive

6601616
hash	md5
it will always be the output of the md5 hash

6601687
multiplying	add
you can add the bytes or multiplying their ascii values to generate a number which you can the use as your cut-off

6601694
unsigned	short
assuming the two bytes are an unsigned big-endian short i would do the following

6601694
unsigned	short
h is an unsigned short

6601707
gif	png
this is not an exact method as some pictures may be served with the correct mime type without bearing a gif jpeg jpg or png extension

it is neccessary to sort separetely x and y to find a bound not max or min points

6601892
super	implements
use jquery cookie plugin is super simple to implements

6601917
cpu	affinity
do one call with a mask that sets affinity to one cpu and then do a second call to restore the original mask

6601917
cpu	affinity
this code probes one cpu at a time until setting affinity works in this case we now know the original mask

6601992
integer	unsigned
mutablefetchresults count likely is this so it yields an unsigned integer

6601992
integer	unsigned
it will wrap around to the max value of an unsigned integer and your i will also be promoted to an unsigned type

6602036
qlist	qvector
qlist qlinkedlist and qvector provide similar functionality

6602044
post	put

6602307
qlayout	qwidget
use qlayout setsizepolicy and qwidget setmaximumwidth qwidget setmaximumheight to resize according to your wishes

6602313
width	height
when experimenting with designing your path drawing it s helpful to set the path element s height width first

6602320
width	height
for whatever reason it is fine with being toggled by javascript. i could use gsize width height but it cannot handle percentages

6602370
qlist	qvector
so i would suggest using qlist until profiling suggests changing to a qvector

6602372
goto	break
in practice it is sometimes in rare cases useful to use goto to resolve complex flow of control scenarios where normal if else break while for structures would be more nested or convoluted than necessary

6602372
goto	break
the best good use of a goto that i can think of right now is to break out of a deeply nested set of loops without the overhead of additional conditional checks on each loop iteration

6602421
puts	gets
i think the way to do it in qt is to use a timer which fires at regular intervals and connect the signal to the slot representing your function that gets the new image and puts it in the widget

6602427
hide	show
this works for me and i am using show and hide to make my div hidden visible

6602441
sorting	grouping
note that you need the sorting because itertools.groupby makes a new grouping when the value of the key changes

innodb	myisam
if i create the table as myisam and do an engine alter to innodb i get error 121

6602571
google-chrome	firefox
a good way to test that i use is to have a windows install in virtual box and reduce the memory to the common amount users would have 256mb really old 512 old 1024 a lot of users 2gb+ high end users and remember your target if your building a js heavy site do you want to support ie6 if not then your main target is windows vista or newer and as such a minimum of 512mb of ram is required just remember to test in the different browser firefox 3.x.x 4 5 ie 7 8 9 and google-chrome because different browser use different amounts of memory

we have been told by different telcos which data_encoding to use for submitting smpp pdu s to the smsc

6602901
pdu	smpp
the payload of the smpp pdu is submitted encoded and the data_coding parameter is set accordingly 0x00 for gsm 0x03 for latin-1 and 0x08 for ucs-2

6602901
pdu	smpp
question 1 should it really matter what we encoding that we utilize for submitting smpp pdu s to the smsc

6602901
pdu	smpp
shouldn t we be able to submit all messages via smpp as ucs-2 set the data_coding parameter to 0x08 and have the telco take care of the conversion to the sms pdu for us

6602901
pdu	smpp
does the smpp pdu payload need to be modified to contain a udh which specifies the locking shift table

6602929

here s my question before i go and try to build gcc 4.6.0 on my windows machine and make cygwin like it will it work for me or does the ndk use its own versioning of the gcc and my upgrade will not at all affect it

6602934
stateless	stateful
http is a stateless protocol so the only way to fake a stateful interaction is for client and server to send a session identifier with every transaction

6602936

6603189
macports	homebrew
well i couldn t make it work through fiddling with jars or using macports or homebrew

6603219
width	height
or alternatively make it as big as the scroll view width height and simply move it every time the scroll view moves. when the scroll view decides to pass on its touches to its subviews instead of dragging this will be the first thing hittested

6603391
public	protected
change cook to a protected method cookimpl then have a public final method called cook

6603410
hash	md5
i d suggest you create an md5 hash of the json.stringify o and store that in your hashmap with a reference to your stored object as the data for the hash

6603410
hash	md5
if you find a match in the hash map then you compare the incoming object with the actual object that you ve stored to see if they are truly duplicates since there can be md5 hash collisions

6603410
hash	md5
that way you have a manageable hash table with only md5 hash in it

6603415
put	get
also put in a delete menu item on the activity you get to after selecting something from the listview

6603438
getter	setter
change the rendered conditions during action methods only and not inside setter getter or something

6603484
button	checkbox
in my view you should add checkbox to your list view and give a separate button for deleting items from list i mean to say that add a delete button in the layout in which your list view is also present and when user checks the item which he she wants to delete and click on the delete button the item which is checked by the user gets remove from list

6603499
folder	directory
if the executable was the only item in its folder i could get the application directory from the file class and go from there

the mixing of post get variables is considered as a poor form

6603576

what you described here just works one additional web custom folder for each additional virtual directory and add output of the target project to each one

6603712
boost	allocator
boost intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second allocator to hold the reference count

6603851

hash	md5
people much smarter than me have engineered md5 and other hash to make them provably hard to reverse

6604255
hash	salt
that s the idea of a salt is that you make the hash function be slightly different for every user so he can t reuse a single set of precomputed values for all users

6604255
hash	md5
so for example if my password is shittypassword my hash might show up as md5 6n93nshittypassword and if your password is shittypassword your hash might show up as md5 fa9elshittypassword

6604255
hash	md5
when you try to login with the password x the computer can just calculate md5 fa9el +x and see if it matches the stored hash

6604255
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
so the basic mechanics of logging in remain unchanged but for an attacker they are now faced with a more daunting challenge rather than a list of md5 hash they are faced with a list of md5 sums and salt

6604255
hash	salt
they can ignore the fact that the hash are salt and try to crack the passwords with their lookup table as is

6604304
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
instead of using hasnextline method which is non-existent in a file object an alternative would be to access your file using an inputstream class like fileinputstream and wrapped inside a decorator class like bufferedreader which would allow you to read its contents per line using readline method..

post	put	post	get	put	get
post is fully supported by the url your server redirects you to but the client is executing a get request when it behaves according to your setredirecting call curl does the same exact thing with the -l switch the fix is to either put a at the end of url or to grab the location header from the response yourself and then initiate another post request manually

6604583

there are four methods you might consider loadview viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear

6605842
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you set up your animation in viewwillappear or viewdidappear you can be sure that your view s frame will be the proper dimension but you need to be careful with these methods because they can get called more than once after the view gets loaded and you don t want to add your whiteview subview more than once

6605848
min	max
if all the currencyid lendid combinations are guaranteed to be unique within same id groups you can also use min or max instead of sum

if you haven t specified width or height but has specified element shifting on both directions element stretches to fill the available space

6605982
width	height
in case of a specified width or height value for the absolutely positioned element element shifting doesn t stretch the element

6605982
width	height
one of the centralization techniques is absolute positioning if you have a predefined width or height value

6606007
free	strdup	strdup	strtok
if you must use strtok to get the information make sure you strdup it and pass the copies to your other thread remembering to free them when done

6606007
free	malloc
and remember to free both those memory allocations in your other thread when it s finished with them normally i wouldn t advocate malloc -type operations for c++ but since you re already using character buffers rather than strings it seems the easiest solution

6606019
getter	setter
there are lots of people very happy to test their getter and setter and try to enforce that on others

6606045

postgresql	mysql
the same javascript code used in mysql works fine for firefox ubuntu but the buttons do nothing in postgresql version with firefox ubuntu

postgresql	mysql
well javascript is client side laguage - means it is executed in browser - it has nothing to do with your server side technologies php mysql postgresql

6606375
postgresql	mysql
your problem might be from some queries that are mysql specific and are not working with postgresql take a look in apache s error log files and see if some errors are appearing when you press the buttons that are not working

6606380
hide	show
you can hide and show any kind of element using the same method

6606445
width	height
then resize the image width to the maximum width and calculate the height according to the maximum width limit

6606445
width	height
for example image width is 2248 and height is 532

6606445
width	height
the width exceeds but height is less

6606445
width	height
so reduce the width to maximum 1024 and calculate height which will be around 242

6606445
width	height
similarly resize the height to maximum height and calculate the width accordingly

6606445
width	height
height and width both exceeds the maximum height and maximum width

6606445
width	height
if the image is horizontal resize width to maximum width and calculate height according to that

6606445
width	height
else if the image is vertical or square resize height to maximum and calculate width according to that

6607448
getter	setter
you can make special use of properties that are private with getter and setter

6607503
hash	salt
this may meet your requirements but you need to beware that if you use it to store security information it will be accessible to the end user - you should therefore probably encrypt or salt and hash any security information in the context_info to prevent users tampering with their permissions

6607536

should work the chaining of the calls means the after will return the element you just added then you show it and add a callback function to hide it again

6611854
octal	decimal
because if you have a string number like 0700 and want the output to be integer 700 you need to inform parseint that it is a decimal number rather than octal

6611870
integer	radix
you might not always want to parse the integer into a base 10 number so supplying the radix allows you to specify other number systems

6611870
octal	binary
octal would be 8 binary would be 2 and so on.

6611926
public	protected
if your class does anything more than this than you should never use public or even protected fields

6611926
getter	setter
for example in delphi the main purpose of properties is to provide public interfaces to fields and can provide getter setter to them while still working syntactically like a variable

6611953
wordpress	joomla
i ve used wordpress and joomla for the majority of the sites i ve done but i found them a bit too bulky for my liking so i put together a cms called inline content management that is a simple php script that you can install on your site and with jquery front end it allows you to define editable divs and users who are allowed to edit these divs

6611985

i m trying to upgrade the versioning of slf4j from 1.5.8 -- which is what grails imports -- to 1.6.1 so i can use the latest versioning of logback

6612071
octal	hex
the old-fashioned way to check is to look at the output of a hex dump or octal dump and verify that characters like ã are represented by the expected two-byte sequence

6612097
cvs	svn
the first is that it doesn t really strongly support revision control systems outside of cvs and svn very easily integrated into the gui

6612220
rss	feed
the podcast rss feed is managed by wordpress

6612236

put	get
however when i put in jsonp i get a status of 200 ok and a parsererror

6612291

i have to write a rtmp parser which will handle the packets captured form a rtmp stream on wireshark and i will extract the data from the pcap

6612399
packets	pcap
i have gone through the specs ad i am able to understand the handshake process and also able to locate the media in tcp packets but i am confused in case of multiple audio video session which are interleaved within a single pcap how we can handle that in the parsing so as make our parser able to parse multiple stream simultaneously

6612440
post	get
basically mvc will map the contents of a request post or get to a strongly typed object for you

6612441
sproutcore	cappuccino
you could also look at sproutcore and cappuccino again javascript frameworks

6612441
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino is called objective-j and it looks like objective-c and sproutcore was used to build apples mobile me interface but both have moved on since then

6612441
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino has a gui ide but not sure on sproutcore

6612460
ibatis	mybatis
hi there we are starting a project in which we have to make the decision between using spring jdbctemplates ibatis mybatis or hibernate for our persistence layer

6612460
ibatis	mybatis
my preference tends to lean toward ibatis mybatis because it looks easier to use and we do not need a real or mapper

6612481
folder	directory
i have written the function in go using recursion to scan all the files and directory rooted at that particular folder

6612548
setuptools	pyinstaller
now i ve googled around and enstaller or distribute seem like alternatives to setuptools and py2exe pyinstaller also seem usefull

you don t need background-repeat nor -webkit-background-size because you are giving it a height width

6612569

using natbib latex bibtex in the references section i get references with full first names like

6612614
g++	gcc
i would like to know how can i install developement tools such as gcc g++ etc.

the pkgin pkgsrc package manager originally from netbsd has also been ported to solaris

6612713

i m converting from wmv to flv using ffmpeg and my problem is that the flv videos are so big

6613185
portrait	landscape
if i understand the spec right icap_orientation should return if it is landscape or portrait or different rotation

6613185
portrait	landscape
the one scanner i try it on always returns twor_rot180 whether i set landscape or portrait

6613252
gridview	objectdatasource
in my asp.net web page i ve got a gridview control that is data bound to an objectdatasource

6613278
hash	md5
i suspect i have the same questions for other broken hash functions like md5

6613357
realloc	malloc
you don t really need this though you could malloc an array and realloc as necessary or use a std vector thing if you re willing to use c++

6613366
clang	llvm
make sure that you re using xcode 4.2 or later and that you have the project s compiler choice set to clang â œapple llvm compilerâ

6613387

consider attempting to open the file that you saved c temp debug.zip to see if it is listed as corrupt

6613423
x86	mips
this is typically 16 kb for x86 and somewhat bigger for mips and itamium

6613432
postgresql	mysql
well now at my company we are switching from mysql 5 to postgresql 8.4 because the front-end of the project is php but the server part is lisp which has problems with mysql prepared statements

6613432
postgresql	mysql
while i use php pdo in the frontend there are lots of queries that go like this which worked fine in mysql but in postgresql they have to be eighter or the tables after the migration should become with low case in postgresql then it would care for the double-quotes

6613444
post	get
in particular i m confused as it seems using restful methods makes it very difficult to interact with the service through a client webpage since you have to use ajax to submit anything other than the get post queries and if your service lives on a different server then it s nigh impossible because of the same origin policy

6613457
width	height
boost.multiarray might be of interest since you appear to be indexing points in a space here dimension of your 1d array comes from height and width

6613468
vim	emacs
in general many linux enthusiasts use emacs or vi or vim for their editing

6613468

i m taking the md5 hash of the string id and based on the first few chars creating subfolders so not too many files end up in any one directory

6613609
cakephp	yii	cakephp	kohana	kohana	yii
i would go with a mvc php framework and after having used a lot cakephp zend kohana and few others in the past i would recommend you to go with yii

make a classes directory where you can save core functionallity in a core folder

6613693
folder	directory
furthermore in your classes directory create the two folder controllers and models

6613717
folder	directory
have a directory element that is just a placeholder for the folder name

6613717
folder	dir
this will then allow you to keep the root dir as c intetpub wwwroot and allow them to specify a custom folder

6613775
put	get
if you get modify put you have no guarantee that the put applies to the same value as the get

6613804
gridview	rowdatabound
what you need to do is get access to the underlying dataviewrow object through the gridview s rowdatabound event

6613814
put	get
after building put cv.exe into web root but get error message and get return value 0xc0000135 in

6613834
children	parent
and it fails because when the object is mapped it maps the children which maps their parent making a circular reference to occur

6613839
width	height
another example could be something that adds a compute_area method to anything which itself contains width and height methods

6613870
g++	gcc
developing environment gnu gcc g++ 4.1.2

6613914
range	min	range	max	min	max
if your key is simple an integer you could just create a random integer in the range min max using and get the map s lower_bound for that

6613958
ndepend	fxcop
there are tools ndepend fxcop that can help detect inappropriate dependencies and i would generally tend to favour their use over assembly segregation when inappropriate dependency avoidance is the only reason for segregration

6614001
min	max
as you suspect begin and either end - 1 or rbegin will get you the min and max values

6614058
width	height
you might also be able to stick an image in the fields in tags set a low z-index and set the height and width properties to 100

6614069

width	margin
you can define that with a fixed width or for liquid layouts set it to 100 width and adjust it s margin

6614272
width	text-align	width	margin	margin	text-align
or since you have a width declared on the input you can remove the text-align center and use margin 0 auto 1em auto

6614298
google-chrome	firefox
we tried ie firefox and google-chrome

6614344
nsubstitute	moq
you could go the route of using a mocking tool rhino mocks moq nsubstitute to create your fakes instead of doing it by hand but that is really a matter of personal preference and your personal comfort-level with the tools

amazingly i switched a qwidget to be a qglwidget and now my qpainter drawimage calls are 5x faster

6614615
width	height
this way the only layout table will give me is the vertical order but i ll control width height background etc of the divs by css

6614622
children	parent
your supposition is that every item directly knows both its children and its parent because the children collection and the parent reference are stored locally in fields

6614622
children	parent
it need not be the case that every item knows both its children and its parent

6614622
children	parent
another solution would be to have the universe contain a hash table that maps items to their parent and a second hash table that maps items to a list of their children

6614622
children	parent
in the real tree every item knows its children but not its parent

6614622
children	parent
when you ask that node for its children it makes a new facade node wrapped around each child and sets the parent property of the facade node to the node that was queried for its children

6614635
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a fairly common model for ios apps seems to have a single uitabbarcontroller where each tab essentially holds a uinavigationcontroller a stack of controllers and pressing a tab switches to the top of the corresponding stack

vb.net	jscript.net
you can use the c# vb.net or jscript.net languages in your templates and your templates can output any ascii-based text based language

realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
what the c standard says is that you cannot use free for a normal pointers.it says free function performs its action when it is used with the dynamic memory allocation functions like malloc calloc and realloc .even though if you try to use a free by passing a normal pointer which is not involved with malloc calloc and realloc it results undefined behaviour it may lead to core dumped error or crash and the code is working with your compiler because the compiler might be developed in a different way example a student learning compiler that code works even with the turbo c but it really fails when you work on the cygwin or gcc compilers.i suggest you to work on cygwin and gcc compilers rather than other compilers because they give you very vast experience and knowledge even you can learn the concepts of multithreading

6614834
yacc	bison
i need flex to find eof and return a token indicating that it has found it so it can tell yacc bison that it has reached the end of an input source file and can report a successful parse

so my question -- is there ever a case in any browser ie7+ firefox webkit opera that anyone knows of where a span can not act like a div

6614915
content-disposition	content-type
you don t need all those cache controls just a max-age with expires set in the past does everything all those headers your using does ... many of those cache controls headers your using cause problems for safari ... lastly some browsers don t understand filename the only understand name which must be included in the content-type header line never in the content-disposition line

modern browsers html5 compliant support all the appropriate http verbs get put post delete

6615044
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
the reason i told you before but now let me tell you more clearly.remember these arpita the free does not work with normal pointers it only works with the pointers that are involved with malloc calloc and realloc .the free was developed in a way that it works only with dynamic memory allocation concepts.if you try to use it with a normal pointer it results segmentation fault or core dumped in linux based os it is because the function is defined in that way because you are trying to free a memory pointed by q but q is uninitialized you don t know the address it is pointing to and you don t even know the size of memory to be deallocate.so their lies the error.i hope you understood

post	put	post	get	put	get
the problem with rest is it s not always easy to map all operations of an object on the common http methods get post put delete options

6615130
post	put	post	get	put	get
obviously crud can be implemented by assigning the 4 crud operations on to the get post put delete methods

6615130
post	get
but you can also codify in the http body of the post method the kind of operation which is the minimalistic get post style of doing rest

6615130
post	put
the solution advocated by the crud style services is to emulate a put request by annotating a post request with a special http header

6615130
post	get
roy fielding who coined the term restful api mentions also that he think it is well possible to design a perfectly restful system with just get and post

6615130
post	put
adding rest to an existing mvc web application requires at least the implementation of an extra restful controller which translates the http method verbs put post delete into operations on the model object identified by the request uri but often also the implementation of a more machine-friendly view json xml ...

int	chars
iff the first criteria of your sorting function is based on an int of maximum size s be it an actual int or a chars in a string such that this int or chars fully defines the highest level of your sort then i think there s a very fast and easy solution

6615255
int	chars
its performance would also be heavily dependent on the entropy of the int chars used to define the classes

6615270

you would need to put those inside a element and you need to also submit the page to get the from the php side

answer to question #1 if you extend a class with another all public and protected methods will be available in the sub-class without re-defining them

6618799
strlen	strcpy
i m willing to bet that your strcpy 3 calls here have written outside the bounds of the memory you ve allocated strlen 3 does not account for the 0 terminator at the end of c strings so your and are allocated one-byte-too-short

6618813
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
any ideas as to why it works in firefox safari and google-chrome but not in internet explorer

6618826
int	chars
riff subchunks have an 8-byte header 4 bytes for an identifier name field which is traditionally filled with human-readable ascii chars fmt and a 4-byte little-endian unsigned int specifying the number of bytes in the subchunk s data payload -- the subchunk s data payload follows immediately after its 8-byte header

6618836
hash	salt
i assume this to be related to the same principle that is applied in password-based encryption pkcs#5 - because the domain of passwords does not provide enough entropy simply hashing passwords doesn t add any additional entropy - that s why you need to salt passwords before you hash them

6618836
prng	random
one simple example that finally convinced me suppose you have a very bad prng that will always produce a random number of 1

6618871
profiling	benchmarking
just write your code as you feel comfortable and benchmarking profiling afterwards to find any possible optimizations

6618885
sse	avx
if you re using gcc note that the -o3 option will enable auto-vectorization which will automatically generate sse or avx instructions in many cases

6618898
profiling	debugging
ants memory profiling is an invaluable tool for debugging these types of problems

6618930

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works in the latest versions of firefox google-chrome and opera

6619161
inline-functions	inlining
inlining - code side cpu usage virtual dispatch complicates the compiler s job of working out when to inline-functions calls and could therefore provide worse code in terms of both space bloat and cpu usage

6619161
serializable	deserialization
crude-but-practical pointer size based serializable deserialization comms code would also be made more complicated and potentially slower

6619217
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i am using a simple boxlayout i didnt want to waste hours with gridbaglayout

6619221
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
this will check older passwords which were just an md5 hash of the plaintext password without a salt and i also added in the prefix p to be allowed

6619222
cos	sin
from what i understand you take the vector of where you want to go say x direction no rotation that would be 1 0 0 and multiply that with sin cos matrix then you get how much each particular motor should be powered to generate motion in that direction

6619222
cos	sin
in order to double check the results i calculated for velecoties for 1 0 0 that gives me a b c d 4 motor speeds and i have 4 î s when i add each wheels sin and cos components i think i shoudl get back to 1 0 0 but i actualy get back something like 2.5 0 0

i would chose a development profiling for all release debugging modes clean the simulator clean xcode then i would launch instrumentation

6619776
hide	show
when you want to switch from one to the other use showwindow to show one dialog and hide the other

6619776
hide	show
in win32 hiding a hwnd also hide all the child controls with it so you can easily hide and show groups of controls by grouping them in sub-windows like this

6619790
haskell	ocaml
though the same could be done using ocaml s and haskell s record syntax that kind of approach somehow feels out of place in fp

6619794

i m writing a phonegap application no cross domain restrictions for ajax that needs to parse rss feed extract information i was looking for an easy way to do this

6619961
filtering	grouping
now with this in mind i cannot work out how to filtering out which users get rendered into the index view based on which grouping the users not the the currently logged user belong

6619977
dlsym	dlopen
in c you would build with -fpic -pie then use dlopen 3 and dlsym 3

6619979
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
therefore it looks great on a 320x480 mdpi screens but not as much on an hdpi screens

6619979
screens	hdpi
now the system normally should scale for this on an hdpi screens by a factor of 1.5 unless you supposedly you set a density in the bitmap object but i don t really know how that works but since you used the method setimagebitmap the bitmap is not scaled leading to your problem

6619985
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
i have released all the memory allocations in didreceivememorywarning and also in dealloc

6620015
squash	merge
if you want to keep a - b - c in the history don t squash - just git merge

6620015
squash	merge	squash	branch
if you want to get rid of the intermediate commits well go ahead and squash but then you have to throw away those commits and git reset --hard master on the feature branch to get back to a history that can be merge with the master

6620025
children	parent
even the parent is cast form the 2 different children as

6620068
width	height
i tried using width and height values instead of scalex and scaley but its the same result .

6620071
disk	ram
you can drastically speed up some algorithms by using caching making them cache-oblivious avoiding bottlenecks by working with ram instead of disk using parallelization or doing work ahead of time -- these techniques are often independent of the order-of-growth big-o notation though you will often see the number of cores in the big-o notation of parallel algorithms

6620071
quicksort	mergesort
in practice even among algorithms which have the same or similar asymptotic performance their relative merit may actually be driven by other things such as other performance factors quicksort and mergesort are both o n log n but quicksort takes advantage of cpu caches

6620100
ring	hiccup
noir uses a combination of ring compojure and hiccup to get the job done

but i do not have iboutlet i have ibaction

6620228
width	height
an easy solution for maintaining a ratio is to use width height and scalex y together

6620279
iboutlet	ibaction
simply create an iboutlet in the class where your ibaction is and bind the iboutlet to you button

6620337
folder	directory
is there a way to directly access the sqlite database from the assets folder or is it always necessary to first copy this db to the device data directory in the app s database folder

6620339
width	height
i think you should add css style for #popupcompare before getting its height and width

6620401
width	height
is there any image inside popup as resizing popup width would result in resized width of image and eventually resized image height

6620422
pop-up	dialog
pop-up is just a simple modal dialog overlay if you wish to interact with user for a simple purpose something like editing a simple record

6620427

i want to hide show the table on every event

6620515
hide	show
this should be good to show hide the tables

6620565
filtering	grouping
i cannot work out how to filtering out which users get rendered into the index view based on which grouping the users not the the currently logged user belong.

6620575
width	height
the problem is that the height and width of the component are apparently not available until after being rendered by the popup manager

6620575
width	height
but i do not know any way of finding out when the popup is actually rendered and therefore the height width values available

6620575

post	get
now i request use post method and get response code 411

6620665
range	minimum
minimum blog range is a constant that i set

6620678
post	get
if you can use a get instead of post to send the user s values to the server i d hijack the default html post form submit by using jquery to attach a click handler to the submit button and in that click handler read your form values append them to some url var and then call this to actually perform the redirect

6620685
put	get
to put this character in a url using java then yes you use urlencoder and you will get e5 a4 a7

6620733
width	height
for setting the location of component i have used the height width left top property of components

6620749
width	height
the first method could be made into more flexible one by using actual tag so that you force the image to be specific height and width

6620756
tinyint	boolean
tinyint 1 will map to boolean

6620756
tinyint	boolean
bit will map to boolean as well but when exporting bit with mysqldump will look like 0 so i recommend tinyint 1 which will look like 0 or 1

6620757
tinyint	boolean
you can use bool boolean in mysql which is a synonym for tinyint 1

6620808
initializer	class-method
i would like to make a data manager class that retrieves data from plist and i wonder if i should make a class with all class-method which read plist every time when the method is called and returns requested value or create a class initializer which initializer an array instance variable with the plist data and all methods are instance methods which get data from the array

6620905
rpm	yum
nexus is an open source repository manager for maven and other repository formats like p2 nuget static sites rpm yum npm nuget rubygems and more

6620971
ready	each
side note if you don t want to block waiting for each to terminate in turn you can instead install a signal handler for sigchld and then call wait to collect the return code once you know it is ready

6620978
ssl	https
i am new to https ssl

6620983
alarmmanager	wakelock
best solution for running some task every 2 minutes is alarmmanager and do not use wakelock except you don t need to hold device in work mode like mp3 player for example because it will spend battery

6621003
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
in closing i d strongly suggest in agreement with mimisbrunnr that you look at using either bash or zsh as they ve incorporated the best parts of tcsh along with the power of the bourne shell sh leaving out all of the weaknesses of csh

6621031
inherited	properties
and then i inherited from that class to wrap a success properties with the result

6621041
for-loop	loops
break is used to immediately terminate a for-loop a while loops or a switch statement

6621160
gif	png
the div with the content and background color should span the entire other div and have an opacity or you can create a 1x1 transparant gif png of the color instead

6621162
bugsense	acra
you could also use acra or a service like bugsense that solve this problem

6621164
postgresql	mysql
i use postgresql a lot and the code is different from when you re working with mysql

6621164
postgresql	mysql
this makes sense though as postgresql works with named sequences while mysql works with auto increment which is a sequence per table

6621177
google-chrome	safari
i have a video tag which working fine in safari google-chrome but not on ipad iphone

6621194
width	height
you could also try binding your width and height

6621194
width	height

6621270
spaces	delimiter
you should be able to nominate any character including spaces or tab as the delimiter

6621315
squash	merge	squash	branch

6621411
equals	gethashcode
overriding equals and gethashcode call

6621477

6621523
content-length	content-type
content-length 1 content-type

6621543
google-chrome	safari
the html css below does a couple of things i find strange and it does them in ff4 5 google-chrome 12 and safari 5 so at least this strangeness is consistent across browsers

into a variable and put it after bulk i get incorrect syntax near variable expected string or text_lex

6621607
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer means non-negative value at least

6621607
integer	unsigned
not sure if this is what you need but you can try to convert signed integer to 4 bytes unsigned integer as your ipconverter does

6621616
portrait	landscape
when i load it it looks fine but when i turn it to say to landscape from portrait it doesn t go where the coordinates tell it

6621620
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
open the inspector google-chrome safari or firebug in firefox - do not rely on ie developer tools and see if you have any javascript errors that can cause the page to stop

6621628
fuzzy	stemming
unlike other types of lucene queries wildcard prefix and fuzzy queries are not passed through the analyzer which is the component that performs operations such as stemming and lowercasing

6621633
hash	md5
use a hash method like md5

6621663
fadein	fadeout
use the fadeout or fadein function

6621733
ilist	icollection
it turns out that the problem was that i declared the percentages collection as an ilist instead of an icollection

6621787
.htaccess	httpd.conf
into a .htaccess or into your v host definition in the httpd.conf

6621799
stdout	stderr
this script works fine write to stdin read from stdout and from stderr

6621848
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

6621848
stdout	stderr
similarly to get anything other than none in the result tuple you need to give stdout pipe and or stderr pipe too

6621850
hide	show
what i want is to hide the inherited methods from the handle class so that only the function the user is allowed to use is show under methods

6621876
int	chars
my problem is when i use this schema.ini the 9th 10th and 11th column of the second row of the csv file doesn t read properly if there s a special chars in it it supposed to be telphone number i think because the row above is returned as a number int because it s pure numeric

6621882
int	double
there was already a perfectly good way of doing int powers with double and then simply converting back to an int giving you the ability to check for int overflow and underflow before converting

6621884
hide	show
i am trying to implement a simple trick which would hide span label inside textbox when user starts entering text in respective textbox and show it on blur if textbox is empty

6621908
equals	gethashcode
you must override both gethashcode and equals to indicate equivalence

6621927
for-loop	loops
the for-loop counter i should be declared inside loops so openmp can split this loops according to the number of available threads

6621943
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization doesn t work cause it also copies the read only part

6621980
width	text-align
since a is an inline element it never takes up more width than it needs and text-align is rendered useless

6621981
cpu	processors
cpu id is unique to each processors type - can not be changed

6621987
width	text-align	width	height	text-align	height
so the attributes width height text-align will affect the object

6622034
express	node.js
found a solution here node.js with express importing client-side javascript using script tags in jade views

6622039
equals	gethashcode
if you have no way to override the required methods gethashcode and equals on your items class there is a constructor for a dictionary where you may provide an to perform the comparisons

6622067
width	height
f is used because the width and height properties are of the type float

6622075
int	chars
why do you need variable to be either a chars or an int depending on something that happens at runtime

6622075
int	chars
what bad thing tm happens if we just make it an int and then we never end up assigning it a value that wouldn t fit in a chars

6622078
google-chrome	firefox
trace your http requests responses using firefox firebug or webkit google-chrome developer tools and check which cookies are exchanged

6622105
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-dependency-plugin
if your client can not download dependencies from maven m2 repo on the fly like behind firewall or no internet connection then you also need to package the dependencies using maven-dependency-plugin to copy all dependencies and maven-assembly-plugin to assemble dependencies

6622127
google-chrome	firefox
i have a dynamic table which works in firefox 4+ and google-chrome but does not display the table contents in internet explorer

6622191
textview	imageview
if you do not need to show an image in the imageview i suggest to use a textview instead

6622338
folder	directory
just name it slightly differently and put it in the same directory that the pre1.0stable version is in so that the themes folder is in the right place

6622374

tcpdf	fpdf
but problem is i cant make it work with fpdf or tcpdf

6622514
tcpdf	fpdf
with fpdf or tcpdf

6622519
width	height
then the height of the label is larger or smaller in height than the text about 10 point varying with the text s length thus giving me blank areas at the bottom of my view after scrolling plus the width of the label is increased by about 2 points

6622546
caliburn	prism

all of this works well in firefox 5 opera 11.5 google-chrome 12.0.742.112 safari 5.0.5 7533.21.1 i personally do not feel it is up to developers to try and fix the problem i feel it is up to microsoft to make their browser more compatibly compliant

6622947
int	chars
it takes an int number of chars

6622960
salt	md5
how about putting all the images in a public directory configured not to have directory listing and use very long and random filenames generated with md5 for example from an id and some salt that is tracked in a database and the filename changed after each access

6622962
int	chars
the type of the member variables are not the same mainly int bool chars etc no need to overload operator and the member variable name could be named with anything no rule to follow

6622977
width	height
uiviewcontentmodescaleaspectfill makes the image fill the view so extra width or height not both will be cropped off

6623003

i could also recommend having your images stored in a non public folder that the web server has write access to and then creating a symlink without write access and directory listing in the public folder to this image folder and load the images from there

6623017
hide	show
use 2 different datagrid controls one for apps and one for servers and hide show when needed

background-color	transparency
but the background-color of #foo may return transparency even if one of its parents declared a colored background

6623307

if you need variable column types the simplest route is to include multiple columns and show and hide them appropriately

6623532
fadein	fadeout
depending on how complex is the class if it has images in the background different font types etc.. i think a way you can achieve this effect is by duplicating the element leaving one hidden and then use the fadein and fadeout effects

6623535
jar	war
the new war has the same layout as the old war the only difference is that the ejb jar s can now be placed inside the web-inf lib folder of the war

6623564
versioning	upgrade
my xcode versioning is currently 4 and i want to upgrade to ios 5

6623581

6623592
tablet	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi

6623769
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried simply to use though that doesn t work in firefox google-chrome

6623771
innodb	myisam
yes the data should be consistent in the db if many threads are writing at the same time - anyway you will have to take care in code of managing the transactions correctly - and of course use innodb as the storage engine for mysql because myisam does not permit transactions

mousemove	mousedown
how can i combine the mousedown and mousemove events so that when i hover and hold down the mouse button the textbox value dynamically changes as i move

6623812
stderr	fflush
by default stderr is unbuffered which is why you don t need to fflush it

therefore if you want the circle to remain circular as the content expands you need to dynamically adjust the height to match the width

6624161
width	height
in this case you should fix the height and width of the circle and give the content position absolute

6624161
svg	vml
various scripts exist which can convert between svg and vml so you can produce a cross-browser solution with svg plus javascript

6624161
svg	vml
my suggestion for this would be raphael which generates svg or vml graphics according to the browser it s running it

6624209
respond.js	modernizr
my attempted solution is to use modernizr and respond.js

6624221
width	height
you need to set both width and height to the maximum of these both in order to render a square that with 50 radius corners results into a circle

6624434
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
just remove uinavigationcontroller and add uitabbarcontroller

6624441

width	height
1 the head take a specified height of the browser for example 50px and take 100 width of the browser

6625645
width	height

6625645
hide	show
3 when the toggle_bar1 clicked the left should be hide show once it is not visible the main01 and main02 if main02 is visible will take all the width of the browser

6626092
cvs	svn
also on a rightclick on my projects as in cvs svn plugins - team i find git support as well

6626134

6626146
octal	hex
for the octal and hex values i m a bit rusty but looking around should guide you to samples you may adapt

6626171
onfocus	onblur

i am retrieving data from sql server using sqldatasource control and displaying it in asp.net gridview

6626294

g++	gcc
i don t know why they chose to use g++ instead of gcc but i believe it shouldn t matter as any valid c program is also valid c++

6626432
submit	submission
the jquery serialize method won t serialize and therefore provide a value for any submit buttons contained within the form but submission the form using one of these will do so

for-loop	arrays
i have implemented like storing whole string in an character arrays and then for-loop processing each index of char arrays to get the char by char by that string

6626728
textarea	textbox
i would like to know how to retrieve the value of a textarea box that was initially hidden but when a checkbox is ticked it reveals the textbox for input

without an actual page to experiment with i d guess at .fire_event onchange or .fire_event onkeydown or .fire_event onkeyup being able to enable the button you wanted to press

6627032
portrait	landscape
i can rotate from portrait to landscape and back again over and over without any problems

int	chars
now the problem is that c99 defines bool as _bool and _bool is even not necessarily same size as int in fact in my experience on most platforms in nowadays it is often same size as unsigned chars not to talk about being same type which is actually impossible as _bool is a builtin type of the language in c99 but defines false and true as 0 and 1 without any typecast and preprocessor definitions without a typecast will default to int

since all the boolean operations still evaluate to type int all the pre-c99 compilers can be updated to support c99 without having to change their type-evaluation code for all the basic operators and the standard-writers can be more confident that the new boolean feature hasn t accidentally introduced inconsistencies to parts of the standard that had previously been fine

this might be messy but on the pop up component you could add an event listener after complete is fired if the height or width then you settimeout to a function after say 100ms until you get valid data

6638695
apache	nginx
personally i prefer nginx to apache but you can do this with both

6638695
apache	nginx
first the bad news - you cannot do this with a single installation of either apache or nginx - passenger is compiled against a single specific ruby interpreter that you are using

6638695
apache	nginx
you need to have two separate http server apache or nginx installations - one will be the default and answer on port 80 and the other will need to answer on another port this will not be publicly used

6638695
apache	nginx
you need to compile passenger for one ruby and http server apache or nginx and another passenger for the other ruby and http server both http servers can be apache both can be nginx or if you want to make things interesting you can have one of each

6639105
decoder	encoder
there doesn t seem to be an online decoder encoder although there was years ago

6639106
getter	setter
the above answers summarize the role of getter and setter better than i could however i did want to add that your code should ideally be structured to reduce the use of pure getter and setter those without complex constructions validation and so forth as they break encapsulation

6639106
getter	setter
this doesn t mean you can t ever use them stivlo s answer shows an example of a good use of getter and setter just try to minimize how often you use them

6639106
getter	setter
the problem is that getter and setter can act as a workaround for direct access of private data

6639106
getter	setter
moreover you introduce coupling for every getter or setter you write

6639140
post	get
within the http context there are other protocol methods other than get post but that s a limited option for many reasons as evidenced by its infrequent and specialized use such as submitting form data

post	put
if you need all that interfaces it s diffcult to say to me just by reading your post i would personaly suggest put them all in dataaccess and also conversion utilities too

6639585
free	malloc
you need to include stdlib.h to use free and malloc

6639585
free	malloc
it just happens to not matter what free and malloc actually do in your code above so it still works

6639602
width	height
the autosizing clamps to the edges and has flexible height and width so it should be

6639607
free	malloc
this is important because if you dont free memory you can reach in a situtation where your ram is full and calls to malloc fail

6639739
int	chars
in particular given that an int has 32 bits of information and a chars has 16 bits of information requiring reversibility means you can only have strings of zero one or two chars and even that s assuming that you re happy to encode as 0 0 or something similar

6639772
hash	md5
as far as one-way goes - an md5 hash would be considerably more unique but by no means unique than the simple hashcode - but might be verging on unwieldy depending on your definition

subtraction	addition
for some operations addition and subtraction the same instruction is used for both signed and unsigned types

6641012
division	multiplication
there are also separate instructions for signed unsigned multiplication and division mul imul and div idiv where imul and idiv are used for signed values

6641016
unsigned	short
the rules about promotion to at least int or unsigned int in arithmetic expressions are pretty much designed to avoid this happening when you multiply say an unsigned short by 2 the result is an int or unsigned int if short and int are the same size

6641016
unsigned	short
the only time a mask might be required is if when you convert the result back to unsigned short

6641016
unsigned	short
even then i think that with care an implementation can sometimes leave additional irrelevant bits in the top of an int -sized register used to hold an intermediate unsigned short value

6641016
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	subtraction	addition	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
you know that those extra top bits don t affect the modulo results of addition multiplication or subtraction and that they would be masked off if the value is stored to memory assuming an instruction that stores the bottom 2 bytes of an int -sized register to 2 bytes of memory the modulo basically is free

6641024

the best for me would be an extension rewrite of mason for compiling into joose javascript instead of moose perl

6642108
moose	mason
like in mason - the source is compiled into perl moose object and executed with perl .

6642111
profiling	debugging
if this passes i would be confident that it s a problem with the database and i would move on to profiling reviewing the logic of my stored procedure including debugging the procedure with the value being sent to the proc from the code

postgresql	mysql
you didn t really specify what the login credentials were used for but i d recommend you take a look at implementing a sql database mysql postgresql etc for this

6642422
setcontentview	findviewbyid
i don t see it in your code - you should call setcontentview before you can call findviewbyid otherwise it will return null

6642435
onclick	onmousedown
note you should just use the function in onclick it s not a link so it will only excute the javacript bit so no onmousedown just

preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
i can use an edittextprefence in the preferenceactivity but that s really not preferred it will work if it has to and i could just use a dialogpreference with checkboxes in it but i really like the summary capability of a checkboxpreference so i would rather have a dialogpreference that opens and then shows a preferencescreen of checkboxpreferences

6642552

thus keydown or keyup would tell you that they pressed the backspace key but keypress is what you get after the result of the backspace key

i have a java application under tomcat connecting to a postgresql and a mysql databases

6642705
postgresql	mysql
i suppose the problem is that the postgresql mysql database was idle for too long but when i access the database with java i open a connection and always close it when finished so i do not understand why the connection should remain open for so long

6642732
ocp	principles
hence violates ocp open closed principles a static method is not extensible

6642735
put	get
now circumflex supports matchers which can be put right within the get specification

6642754
folder	directory
your css and jsp folder should be out of web-inf directory as this directory will be locked when you want direct access to your jsp files which i think you want and you don t need to map jsp files

6642799
width	height
that site isn t doing anything special simply setting the height and width of the application and slapping it on the page - no resize is happening

6642860
width	height
increase the width height of your element and you should see larger infowindows automatically

6642860
width	height
i solved it by creating a cloned div containing the infowindow content measuring that div s width and height and then setting the infowindow content div to have that measured width and height

6642875
width	height
you could let the image stretch to the size of the monitor if you use an image tag to display the image and specify its width and height properties to be 100 but that will result in a stretched image depending of the device used.

6642901
post	get
same goes if i use post instead of get

6642901
post	get
also should i just leave it as is in the event that it is indeed a good fail proof mechanism that correctly catches all get and post variables or should i disable it if that s even possible

which is clearly different conceptually even if practically you use it the same way put in nothing and sooner or later get out a t

6643089
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
we are in the midst of implementing a labeling functionality exactly like gmail for our webapp - you can select the posts checkbox and select which labels to apply delete from a dropdownlistfor of labels which themselves are a set of checkbox

6643089
post	get
output given a set of selected post and the set of selected labels get a array of items for the json with the following values

6643089
post	get
get current number of selected post var selectioncount 5 say 5 post selected

6643089

min	max
i ve created a custom data source for autopoco below that returns a random datetime between a min and max date

6643215
post	get
i think you can try do it by using hidden fields in forms but you have to create hidden form and make all links act as submit button with some short javascript code setting proper value in fields responsible for target but imho it is not the best solution because all the requests will be using post method and get all disadvantages of it

6644062
typedef	typename
in typedef typename t type type type t type type requires use of the typename keyword because its nested-name-specifier t type is a dependent name and the standard says same section

6644075
hash	salt
don t persist the user s password take a hash and be sure to salt it

6644078
free	malloc
i m not totally sure what you are asking malloc minus free is less than the actual usage because of the memory fragmentation if you really need that number you have to use custom allocators which are tiny wrappers around existing ones everywhere in your code which is going to be painful

stdout	stderr
that s because of netbeans internal handling of stdout and stderr the output is not deterministic i suppose they re both handled in two separate threads as you already suspected

6644746
stdout	stderr
but this happens independently of using ruby or not - when i run junit tests for my java projects the same happens stderr and stdout output gets mixed indeterministically

6644832

also the x86 instruction for calculating logs includes a multiplication automatically and the constants required for the different bases are also available via an optimized instruction so i d expect the 3 different log functions to have identical timing even base 2 would have to multiplying by 1

just make your httpmodule inherited from ninject.web.httpmodulebase and then you are free to use properties injection within your module like this

6656293
map	quadtree
you simply create a grid of fixed size squares like a chessboard and you map each point into the grid and you create a list of the objects witch belong into each of the grid-boxes -- if you adjust the size of each box correctly you should on average have 5-50 points in each square -- this is in principle a quadtree but without the tree for simplicity

6656489
portrait	landscape
then make your default portrait layout in one and a landscape version in the other

6656511
tinyint	boolean
unfortunately for me it seems that this is no longer the case and tinyint is now mapped to boolean

6656541
post	get
more than likely the previous request was a post rather than a get and the post requires that you repost the data

6656577
width	height
since screens aren t square the width of your plane is different to the height

6656577
width	height
more exactly the width is the aspect ratio times the height

6656590
ienumerable	ilist
i think you will need to change the ilist to ienumerable to make this work but not for sure on that

6656594
post	put
that leaves put delete and post

6656594
post	get
if you use post when get is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since post usually means you are sending a payload

6656800
screens	mdpi
on a screens with a density of 160dpi mdpi 160 dp will equal 1 inches

6656807
cassini	iis
here s a reason for a third way although uws pro is probably closer to iis than cassini although inspired by cassini and is from the vendor of the ultidev cassini fork its main purpose is to be redistributable along with asp.net applications

6656818
maven	m2e
if you have added the maven nature using the m2e plug-in to the project then you must know that m2e has the tendency to revert any changes that might conflict the ones that it generates

6656818
m2e	pom.xml
for instance m2e would set the version java facet to the source version specified for the maven-compiler-plugin in your pom.xml

6656847
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
int or bigint or short integer or unsigned integer causes the

6656848

if you maintain two accumulators one for and one for then these are trivial to update for each new value subtract the effect of the oldest value and add in the effect of the newest value

6656867
folder	directory
by pointing a virtual directory to your areas folder you are indicating that this is a separate asp.net application but that s far from being the case

6656948
versioning	upgrade
also try idea 10.5.1 since you are using an old versioning upgrade is free for you

6656966
children	parent
how would you cleanly get a parent process to create multiple children where each child has to do it s own thing

6656966
children	parent
also the children have to communicate with the parent using unnamed pipes so i don t think execv can be used here

6656974
int	boolean
an int used in a boolean context would call the extension method on int check to see that

6656999
post	put
i am regenerating forms to return to the user in an ajax way so i need to put the token into the html i return to the client otherwise when they post back again the antiforgery stuff will still work

6657225
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and ie everything is fine but in firefox scrolling is choppy

6657225
google-chrome	firefox
i found out that the scrolltop and scrollleft value in firefox do not increment or decrement fluently like in google-chrome and ie

6657229
google-chrome	firefox
execute js firefox addon doesn t seem to work doesn t do more than the console in google-chrome already can do

6657242
onresume	onpause
you should bind and unbind onresume and onpause

6657270

6657290
google-chrome	firefox
via a javascript console there s one built into firefox google-chrome and newer versions of ie

it seems to be written in an imperative style but all the examples expect a declarative syntax

6657375
getter	setter
this has the effect of making the user of my class use the getter setter provided and i can change the internal data structure anytime i want

6657385
post	get
you can get the number of post per month like this

6657385
post	get
this will get the average number of post per day during the calendar month of the post

6657385
put	get
if you want real averages during the current month you have to put in a conditional to get the true number of elapsed days

6657386

google-chrome	firefox
by the way this code seems to work fine in google-chrome and firefox but only sometimes in ie8 and never in ie6

6657570
integer	unsigned
for cases where the value is assumed to be an unsigned 4-byte integer such as for addresses it equals 4 026 531 840

from what i understands its not as easy as adding next and prev buttons as the cycle plugin doesn t except div id s as an option for advancing and pausing the slideshow

6657587
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
what you can do instead is subclass the uiscrollview and override the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods

6657587
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
when i would detect that a touch landed inside the dial inside touchesbegan i would disable scrolling on the scroll view then in touchesmoved i would pass them to the dial

6657636
128bit	64bit
it is a 64bit and 128bit non-cryptographic hash similar to the default ruby hash function murmur_hash 1 but is a bit more recent and more importantly allows setting the seed on the hash

6657674
google-chrome	safari
both safari and google-chrome use webkit yet google-chrome renders regardless of the semicolon

6657798
git-rebase	undo
when i try to git-rebase my stream in clear case i get the 2 options resume git-rebase and undo git-rebase

6657804
move	drag
windows will not snap if their resizemode is set to resizemode.noresize therefore the trick is to determine reliably when a drag move begins and ends

6657806
pull	push
from there it s up to you to decide whether it makes more sense to push or pull the data into the uiview subclass you re designing

6657834
google-chrome	firefox
right now the css for the div is set like this which works only on google-chrome firefox

6657841

if you are looking in the source code i d start by looking for a settimeout setinterval jquery effect slide maybe

6657858
ceil	floor
i am not interested in floor or ceil simply because it doesn t do the job i want

6657887
organization	naming
our organization has just migrated to ms ad and with this migration came a new user account naming convention which of course changed everyone s email address

6657893
mouseup	mousedown
you might want to look into the mousedown and mouseup events and write your own double-click event

6657962

eventually i fixed this by making one image with a fixed width and height which i then cut up in 3 separate images

6657981

so it seems that i need to scale back my approach a little because i cannot live without these pop-up dialog

6658490

this blog post does a great job of explaining how to get it set up

6658632

6677722
ienumerable	iqueryable
should i return ienumerable t or iqueryable t from my dal

6677722
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m primarily concerned with the ienumerable vs iqueryable question and more specifically the coupling between the dal and it s consumers

6677722
ienumerable	iqueryable
i can then return iqueryable from the function because it inherits ienumerable and i get to keep the deferred loading

6677722
ienumerable	iqueryable
as i understand it if your function returns ienumerable but you return iqueryable the iqueryable is reliant on an underlying datacontext

6677722
ienumerable	iqueryable
it seems the deferred loading of both ienumerable and iqueryable are subject to maintaining the underlying provider should i be using a unit of work pattern or something else to handle this

6677777
width	margin
your js would be mostly the same except that you will need to -5 from the calculated total width because we will be removing the 5px margin from the last image

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome safari triggers the domcontentloaded event before font-face is applied thus causing the problem

6678869
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
the solution is to not listen for domcontentloaded but instead go oldschool and listen to onreadystatechange and wait until the which is always triggered after font-face is applied as far as i can tell by my tests - which is of course what always happens in ie since it doesn t support domcontentloaded

6678873
disk	ram
if the files you read are copies then you can read them from a ram disk -- so you may have a background process that copies the files into a ram disk and then your program can read them from there

6679326
hide	show
on click i want to hide show some html code which is obtained via a get request to another page

6679368
hide	show
for your second idea if you really wanted to go that way you could create an object which show a pause button on top of your layout panel and hide show it when you want to indicate it is paused i suppose although it may look a little clumsy

6679378
pop-up	dialog
what you are saying a pop-up widow in android it is known as dialog which stays on the screen until user interacts with it

6679386
width	height
you could calculate these fixed values at runtime by trying to figure out what the height of some text will be in a given cell at a given width using a given font

6679408

6679497
joptionpane	jdialog
you can use either jdialog or joptionpane

6679500
sorting	filtering
you should use the cust variable instead to apply the sorting on the filtering set

6679502
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome and firefox but not ie8

6679502
google-chrome	firefox
however if i take the height attribute completely out it doesn t appear as i would like in firefox or google-chrome

6679549
ant	maven
one option to avoid what i mentioned above is to have some ant or maven task to assemble classes from different jars into a new jar which contains the final persistence xml

6679592

6679711
client-side	server-side
you can t handle browser events which is client-side via php server-side

6679739
disk	ram
this will take time as in the case of a 10gb file with less ram it may have to allocate the space on disk

6679771
hide	show
this hide directories from the search view and show only the files which matched the pattern

6679783
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested ie firefox opera google-chrome and solved a lot of thing related to css and jquery compatibility.

6679916
post	get
next oldpage when i login with a correct user i receive an error message which told me that no next variable is passed user password is set as get neither as post but the login works fine as expected

6679931
post	get
zend_form does not automatically populate validate itself agaist get post variables

6679940
children	parent
for parent pointer you have to ensure it always points to the actual parent in the setters for the children in parent so adding an unset to the treenode destructor is comparably simple

6679942
post	get
etc by using gdata and oauth2.0 server side check this link i finished the first step and got the first code and when try to post a request to get the oauth2_token i always got the error the remote server returned an error 400 bad request.

6679951
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox and google-chrome and it works

6679954
jar	war
you can separate java classes into several jar submodules but if you split the war project into several smaller wars using some kind of overlapped packaging things get complicated

6679954
jar	war
and converted the whole project to facelets 2.0 to avoid the dependency of jdk tools.jar and custom resource handler the only reason is to change the war submodules to jar submodules and move all webapp pages into class resources

6679954
jar	war
so the conclusion maven does great job for jar dependencies but no war or single war

6680030
inherited	properties
this places the properties of the global object at the start of the scope chain from which all other environments inherited

6680037
post	put
according to restful web services pattern the difference should be in that put is used to update a resource on server while post is used to create a resource on server

6680037
post	put	post	get	put	get
this could be important because browsers do not support puts only get and post natively so web-apps usually simulate puts by putting a hidden form field smth like _method put in web-forms

6680037
post	put
so when user clicks submit then browser does a post which includes _method put param so the server can recognize it is a put

6680037
post	put
if this is your case then just try appending your post params with a required by your web-app param smth like _method put

6680053
centos	linux
on my live centos linux server i get a 2 digit precision 1310564569.41 for example

usual configurations are 8 16-bit int 4 32-ints 4 floats 2 double

6680133
bazaar	git
some reading of the git fast-import documentation and reviewing of the bazaar fast-import documentation examples suggests that the same mark s files should be used when importing multiple related but unmerged branches from the same repository

6680137
width	height
then get the screen size say width and height then and

6680138
realloc	malloc
i have a suspicion that i am not understanding how the pointer is interacting with malloc realloc

when i post an article i get the following error

6680215
listview	gridview
i m using a listview that contains a gridview there s a gridviewcolumn which only contains buttons

6680238
int	chars
essentially you re interpreting an array of chars as a pointer to int

6680238
int	chars
suppose sizeof int is 4 and the chars array contains these bytes

6680244
debian	linux	opera	google-chrome
in debian linux when using a browser such as opera or google-chrome the page loads with a js error

6680266
int	chars
that s not necessarily a good typecast there s a good chance that int and chars are a completely different size and this could lead to some undefined behaviour

6680319
google-chrome	firefox
confirmed working in google-chrome firefox and ie 8.

6680349
mouseover	mouseleave
you would want to use the live mouseover mouseleave events

6680354
mouseleave	mouseenter
also it may be interesting to see mouseenter link and mouseleave link

6680375
gridview	radiobuttonlist	gridview	rowdatabound	gridview	checkboxlist	radiobuttonlist	rowdatabound	radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist	rowdatabound	checkboxlist
for the survey i read values from db and dynamically generate asp.net controls like radiobuttonlist checkboxlist textbox on the form during gridview s rowdatabound event

6680375
gridview	radiobuttonlist
i am able to cast radiobuttonlist from gridview but values are inaccessible even though they still persist after postback

6680379
int	chars
in this case you are packing chars into int

6680379
int	chars
depending on the system you may arrive at an int with the internal bit representation which matches char0 char1 char2 char3 followed by another int with the internal bit representation that matches chars four through seven

6680379
int	chars
odds are good that if you dig through the code enough you ll find that there is another place where the pointer to your constructed int gets cast back into a chars

6680403
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
jsfiddle tested in google-chrome safari and firefox

6680437
xsl-fo	xslt
i m writing an xslt transformation for xsl-fo and need to repeat something for each letter in a string value for example

6680464
int	chars
since it is an unsigned chars it would need to be type cast as int well it does not need to be but it is good practice

6680464
int	chars
as per someone concern over size a size int will for the most part always be smaller than an unsigned chars

6680478
gson	jackson
if this does not work then you could use other serialization mechanism like jackson or gson

6680545
junit	testng
i have a small experience with junit and testng and today i need to do some unit testing for java database code

6680566
centos	linux
i have a spring+hibernate+mysql+jstl architecture running in a linux centos production enviroment

6680571
post	get
this will call the search.php which will get the search string as a post variable like here you process the search string and echo the results which will be get back to the page as data

6680571
post	get
if you want to use get then just replace post in the jquery funstion as get and you can use in the search.php

6680593
post	put
then i saw your post and noticed that you put it in the activity

6680600

6680665
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
the closest what you can get is ajax poll push provided by 3rd party component libraries like richfaces primefaces or icefaces

6680722
javassist	cglib
i ve never tried anything quite like that myself but you should have a look at asm cglib and javassist

6680746
versioning	upgrade
i suspect this later versioning upgrade the serialize function to recognise the new html5 input types

6680777
javassist	cglib
i believe you need some byte code altering tool framework such as asm cglib or javassist

6680868
serializable	deserialization
wcf doesn t support that kind of deserialization unless you configure it for .net serializable by using the netdatacontractserializer instead of the standard datacontractserializer

6680893
min	max
but you can easily get the same result with a complexity of o n by enumerating the collection and keeping track of the min or max value

6680954
post	get
also if there were a significant amount of cpu bound post processing that needs to be done with the data then you could get that going concurrently while another batch of data is being read

6680975
pop-up	dialog
i worked well but had one crucial flaw when i would want to actually use the stt engine a dialog would pop-up telling it when to stop recording

6681044
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak about mysql but in postgresql you could use crosstab function from tablefunc module

6681064
button	checkbox
your form_selection routine should draw a form which has a select checkbox radio button or whatever that will post a string or integer for the switch back to the script you are running from

6681169
children	parent
all of the examples have the primary keys of the parent and children tables with the same name

6681176
post	get
the routes will be constrained to post events only which means you can still add some routing for your get methods on the same route

6681181
google-chrome	firefox
i am using dropdownlist control .net 3.5 in my page and it works fine in ie firefox but does not work in google-chrome

getter	setter
the property combined with synthesize setup the getter and setter methods for your objects

6681263
disk	ram
if you really want better performance i would also suggest maybe looking at changing the disk drives and upgrading the ram on the sql server your table should use about 20gb of space how long would it take on the current disk drives to read 20gb of data off the disk into ram

6681276
children	parent
as jonas alludes to the handlevisibility property of an object will determine if the object shows up in its parent s list of children and thus if it will be returned by functions like findobj

6681276
children	parent
additionally if the handlevisibility property of the parent figure of an object is set to off then none of its children including said object can become the current object

6681314
qapplication	qwidget
judging this page you can set stylesheets into use with qapplication setstylesheet and qwidget setstylesheet

6681485
google-chrome	safari
the header works just fine on the secondary pages for all browsers but the home page is badly broken on google-chrome safari and ie7

6681485
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the image is shifted down out of the header div covers other content and is very badly distorted

6681723
width	height
try setting 100 for width height

6681723
width	height
if that doesn t work you can modify the template directly under html-template directory which is the way i prefer to do it and leave the width height out of the application tag

6681737
multiplying	add
there is no need to use a as some kind of intermediate and using move is imo rather low level and therefore a little tricky it is easy to forget to multiplying by the size of a character it is unchecked it does not add a #0 etc. especially if you don t know what exactly you are doing

6681773
width	height
its because nivo slider here has a specific width and height

a bunch of similar getter and setter responsible for managing the relationships within the user instance

6682164

i could technically also wrap the dao within the entity and put the helper getter and setter back into the entity class where they should be but i am not sure whether if that is a good practice as well

6682178
zclip	zeroclipboard
i m using jquery plugin zclip or zeroclipboard which copies content to the clipboard via a button or link

6682198
put	get
i know this is not the proper eav mvc 1000 lines of xml magento module way of doing it however since this is a straightforward http https problem you can put a couple of lines in .htaccess to get your search box behaving correctly

6682475
width	height
i m stumped i ve already deduced it to being within this merge section of the larger layout edit thanks yes line #10 was sort of obvious the textview on line 10 clearly needed the width and height but there were no crashes using just textview that exists further in the code which i had pasted into line #10

6682476

and it s pretty clear by looking at llrect.createbox that the third parameter to getboudningarea is going to be treated as the full width height of a bounding box

6682600
width	height
then you can show it and get width and height i don t think this is particularly hacky to do if you do it this way

6682601
width	height
usually if you set a default height-width in a css file you should be able to get the width height of an hidden element

6682640
client-side	server-side
you can then call on the model the startupdate and let it run as needed pausing it when it would be inconvenient for a server-side update to run say in the middle of a customer manipulation of the data and restarting it after a client-side change had successfully completed a write to the server

6682656
int	boolean
in your code you have an int strings.len source as the conditional check which is expecting a boolean response so it s failing

6682703
setinterval	settimeout
i have read many examples on settimeout and setinterval but what i continuously see is those only work with a for next style loop where the loop goes for a predetermined amount of cycles dependent upon a variable

6682707
int	boolean
the comparison expects a bool you re providing an int with strings.len source which returns some number not a boolean value like true or false

6682719
getter	setter
your o is not a property at the moment you need to define setter and getter

6682720

6682969
rtsp	sdp
the only official way in rtsp to inform a receiver about the frame rate is inside the sdp of the describe response

6682975
ant	maven
weblogic also has support for ant and maven so if you are using those to build and package your applications then you can automate deployment with them as well

6682982
post	get
instead you could use some javascript to get a list of elements that match particular css classes and then dynamically edit your form submit to get post the contents of these elements to your controller

6682985
button	checkbox	width	height
so when the user selects the checkbox and click continue button the corresponding images should be retrieved by javascript and set its height and width

6682985
width	height
if height width is not specified for a particular image it will be filled with height else it will be filled width the height valuepx

6682985
width	height
i could get the array of images but how do i retrieve the same for height and width of corresponding images

6683004
width	height
in this statement the size width height of the 2 imageviews sssimageview and gaimageview have to be changed

6683004
width	height
for instance if the density of the screen is high i want the width and height of the imageviews to be 200sp

6683011
for-loop	loops
indexof does a bunch of type-checking and validation that the for-loop and while loops ignore

6683076

6683131
width	height
what do you want to do with width and height and what are their values

6683217
folder	directory
to get that to work i believe i had to set my working directory to this project folder

jar	war
i believe that for both war and ejb config files should be in meta-inf of their respective jar if you don t need easier access to them

6683462
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval will continue to run repeatedly until you stop it settimeout will run once

6683464
int	double
first of all by typecasting the double as int s you are automatically truncating their values

6683482
post	get
i was able to capture this by copying all the parameters to an apache http client post request i m using post and not get because get made the url too long and re-executing the request but this is inefficient

6683493
oncreate	findviewbyid
since the onclicklistener constructor will run before the oncreate method getintent will return null and you will not have set your contentview so all your findviewbyid s will also return null

6683513
folder	directory
as files are created and put into the network share folder my program will take those files and move them to a local directory specified by the user

6683514
folder	directory
this will add a directory under this project folder named node_modules where unsurprisingly modules for this project are

6683556
division	modulo
the operator you re likely looking for is called modulo or modulo and returns your the remainder of a division

6683560

6684024
jobs	cron
i typically run all my cron jobs through a wrapper script which saves stdout err and prints it all iff the subprocess exits with a non-zero error code so i get an email from cron on failure

6684028
stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio
reassigning and should work fine unless something in your code your gems or ruby itself is using the constants stdout stderr or is accessing the streams directly through c s stdio unix s low level read write with numeric file descriptors or is opening their own access to the streams using io.new

6684030
folder	directory
a short term fix would be to open the file sdlmain.m and modify the setupworkingdirectory method so the working directory is set to your project folder

6684058
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

6684058
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

6684058
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

superclass	subclassing
essentially i have a superclass that gets extra data appended to it through a subclassing

6684630
superclass	subclassing
i m under the impression that when i go to hard copy a bunch of data using the superclass the subclassing data is loss in translation so to speak

6684637
post	get
just not use the get cid but get it out of the post in your customer.php script

6684654
post	get
the reason this is required is that you are submitting the form to your server via post but appending parameters to the url requires submission via the get method

6684691
folder	directory
in all the examples the package directory is relative to the solution folder but i strongly suspect that you could just as easily use an absolute path such as c packages if you wanted

6684739
post	get
just make sure that it is clear to the user that the button post directly perhaps use a dialog to get them to confirm they want to post

6684873
hex	binary
as a programmer sometimes i like to work in hex or binary and also being able to easily move back and forth between hexadecimal binary and decimal

6684901

the basics are obvious never trust user input purchase an ssl certificate and run traffic through https and store only password hashes using an algorithm like bcrypt

6684918
cufft	fftw
i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..

6684951
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the following javascript opens a window as required in ie8 ff4 and safari 5.0.5 but not in opera or google-chrome

coalesce	isnull
you can use coalesce instead of isnull if it makes you happy.

6685003

6685144
spaces	delimiter
i m looking to drill down on a multivalued field that contains spaces delimiter list of words

6685167
post	get
there s just way too much code to post in here and i can t narrow it down to a specific line or even file since i don t get any error output and as i mentioned above debugging it is of no use because it runs fine in the location for which i have access to a debugger

6685168
versioning	upgrade
then i think that your project got somehow corrupted when doing an upgrade from one xcode versioning to another i am just guessing based on my experience

6685241
post	get
and if you get a value for post email then it s a robot because the user won t see that

6685243
asterisk	ivr
asterisk ivr would read this value from agi and then play it

6685287

sorting	filtering
the important thing is the i don t know -- it must be an option for every question because the answers will result in filtering operations remove possible cars from the available cars or ranking operations sorting some as preferred over others

6685320
put	get
if you put a time coefficient on your filtering-and-sorting answers to old questions are increasingly considered suspect and old items that were filtered out or sorted-to-the-bottom are with increasing probability back-into-play then you can get a really interesting and dynamic and infinitely running game

6685344
width	height
to half the figure width and a height equal to half the

6685398
mef	prism
ideablade s devforce product. if you go with silverlight you ll also want to learn about mef and or prism to understand modular application development

setinterval	clearinterval
another reason is that if you want to stop the loop you have to explicitly call clearinterval which means you have to remember the handle returned from the original setinterval call

6685426
udp	tcp
so what s happening now is that the write case prevents the read case since udp socket is always writable versus tcp that buffers outgoing data

6685433
public	protected
however it will only work on private or protected methods and mine need to be public in order to work with zend_json_server

jdom	xom
but don t use dom itself there are much better alternatives like jdom and xom that have much friendlier apis

6685704
post	get
i ve read this so post and this page but still don t understand how i get my driver to be installed

6685743
memcpy	malloc
afaik malloc is not slower than memcpy

6685778
apache	nginx
the only easy way to change the way this works from dev to prod mode is by leaving play in http only and then securing your whole site in prod mode by fronting it with an http server like nginx lighttp or apache

6685787
post	put	post	get	put	get
you basically do a post to the server every time you want put something there and you do a get when you want to see if there were any changes

6685812
free	malloc
if you start mixing low level memory allocation with malloc free and c++ objects you will run into a lot of troubles while making your code almost unreadable

6685828
int	double
even though the api allows you to pass in a double and hence a value like 20.5 dpi values are int

6685864
integer	unsigned
i would check that p_id is not flagged as unsigned integer

6685924
nowjs	node.js
but i would recommend looking into node.js and maybe even the nowjs plugging which allows for realtime updates via websockets

6685937
short	base
it is a short syntax for extending a base class

6685939
gridview	calendarextender	updatepanel	calendarextender
as long as i eliminate the calendarextender it works fine...did i mention this gridview is inside an updatepanel

6686058
sudo	passwd	passwd	visudo
either use sudo preconfigure the web server user to run the exact command without passwd via visudo and prefix the command with sudo or set up a setuid script that executes the command on itself

6686064
post	get
this will generally mean that you will have to do some pre and post processing but allows you to quickly get to individual attributes

6686090
int	double
the percentage method takes a double but the pixel method only handles int

6686148
hibernate	jdbi
store as normalized columns from pojo use jdbi hibernate or even simple jdbc templates

6686203
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a uiviewcontroller that manages a uisearchbar and uitableview

6686220
folder	directory
if there is a change then the directory is further explored to find new album folder

6686235
folder	directory
i recommend using a nfs samba share or similar so that your public directory is actually just a networked folder so when you write to it it s like writing to the remote folder

6686236
put	get
you can put new customcollection into a loop and get the values 1..10

6686273

you can implements the custom behavior for a jaxb generated class basetype in a custom class basetypeext that extends the jaxb generated class basetype

6686279
concave	convex
how would i split up the vertices of the concave shape so in the end the shape is formed out of as few convex shapes as possible

6686281
post	get
get shouldn t have side effects so don t use get to make the reservation itself use something like post instead

6686303
width	height
in the example above the content in div a is hidden due to the width height restrictions

6686348

6686355
post	put
post should be used to extend an existing resource and put for replacing the state of a resource

6686356
tcpclient	sslstream

i want to be able to show hide the rows in a table using jquery

6686381
folder	directory

folder	directory
however if you don t want to allow directory browsing at the folder level they ll need some link or way to get inward to the folder where you do allow browsing

6686392
concave	convex
however in the process the algorithm is bound to be able to classify shape a concave convex so you d likely be interested in the library nonetheless

6686392
concave	convex
since adrian japon more or less suggested that hit testing containment test is of a usual reason to care about convex concave geometries without further ado i ll highlight the corresponding boost geometry algorithm for that within

6686403
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
it has the same effect but this will work on any uibutton at any view depth my uibutton was several views deep and the uigesturerecognizer s delegate didn t have a reference to it.

6686793
mvp	presenter
yes i really have access to that button and it has the needed data even i could add some logic inside the control but to keep the software design web form mvp pattern i need to raise the event up to presenter and that s the mission i m involved in

6686963
width	height
all the pieces of the widget and tabcontainer have the correct width and height values

6686996
post	get
thankfully google s form can be also send using get method instead of post so whole action of adding bookmark maybe performed by opening url like the one below

6686996
width	height
amazingly if everything worked fine google serves back image star - like it was prepared specially for my bookmarklet - so we can use it to check if everything went correct - by checking for example if image s width or height exists and is equal to 15 px

6686996
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
during development of this bookmarklet in firefox 3.6 opera ie and google-chrome i had some versions without timeout using conditions like

6686996
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
different approach it should be very easy to create userscript for firefox with greasemonkey extension and for google-chrome opera that just automatically submits the form in popup - instead of using modified bookmarklet

6687049
getdate	datepart
i prefer using these short forms because to me year getdate is shorter to type and better to read than datepart yyyy getdate

children	parent
as a follow up to this question i have a parent entity that contains a collection of children entities

6687091
children	parent
when updating the parent entity i would like to set the collection of children to the new values without having to manually delete possibly deleting by parent id the old items on the collection

6687091
children	parent
the alternative i see is to wipe the parent that wipes all the children too and then recreate it with the new children but that feels dodgy

6687248
textview	imageview
then create a layout of your custom listview item that includes a textview and an imageview

then you can initialize the textview and imageview in the getview function of your custom list adapter and change the value of the textview and the image of the imageview however you want

6687254
ghci	leksah
i am running some wx demos from leksah which seem mostly good - but they had some weird errors i found an alleged solution to that wxhaskell-labels-cant-display-full-text but i wanted to try some things just from ghci

6687295
for-loop	loops
as i explained in the comments a simple for-loop is the best solution short of loops unwinding in the last case which is only feasible for these small 2-by-2 matrices

6687302
google-chrome	firefox
i have successfully added the jquery cycle plugin to the homepage of my website which looks great in google-chrome firefox and even works in ie9 when i accept the add-ons

configure	libtool
the . configure script will output the libtool script during its execution

6687437
uiview	subviews
if it s the uiview themselves and the view controller has to identify itself first then i d suggest just adopting the delegate pattern wholesale rather than specialising to views and view controllers as you may want to build compound views that tie together logic from several subviews

6687486
int	chars
i m trying to break down an int with c on an 8-bit microcontroller a pic into its ascii equivalent chars

you d just make a php page that does the sql operations you want to occur every x time interval and then set the script to run on that interval via cron jobs

6687714
pbkdf2	hash
for example if you wish to derive a key that is 64 bytes long and you wish to use sha-256 which produces 32-byte hash you will generate 2 pbkdf2 blocks

6687714
hash	hmac
each iteration uses sha-256 hmac again to hash the password p but uses the prior result as the hmac key

6687714
hash	hmac
when hmac is supplied a key your password in this case longer than the length of your hash output it will hash the key to get exactly 256 bits

6687714
pbkdf2	salt
in a sense these details are hidden from your implementation so you need not worry about how long a salt you re passing into pbkdf2

6687714
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2

6687734
g++	gcc
there s also a note in the gcc g++ man that certain kinds of dead code elimination are only performed if optimization is enabled when compiling

6688339
equals	gethashcode
you should not rely on the implementation of string s gethashcode other than the fact that strings of equals value will produce the same hash code - but what the particular value of the hash code will be is only required to be consistent as per the documentation for the current execution of an application - a different hash code can be returned if the application is run again

6688366

folder	directory
i think what is happening is that when you add a virtual directory under a normal windows folder using the iis management console the windows folder needs to be added to the metabase too but it won t have any of its own properties

6697073
folder	directory
the way i found i could add a virtual directory to my main folder whilst it was still an iisobject though was to add the virtual directory as a child of the root folder but change the virtual directory name to include the main folder in its name like so
