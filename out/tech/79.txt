width	height
you get the correct behavior the reason you were seeing the t multiple times is because with the height and width defined with the incorrect values you just happened to be indexing the same point in memory because you were over running the buffer into memory that you had just happened to have correctly initialized

12102709

by the shape of the output you re obviously using height of 10 and width of 26

i don t seem to be able to access them through the formview detailsview itself and i can t seem to access the boundfields within the views

12102967

i m about to start looking into solutions involving the objectcontext and or entitydatasource s tied to the detailsview s but it seems to me that if i m coming at it from that side then i might as well use plain textbox es and just loop through them creating all the entity stuff in code rather than letting the databinding features kick in

12102967
formview	detailsview	formview	entitydatasource	entitydatasource	detailsview

a good practice and a wise thing to do would be to separate the operations directory retrieval list sorting list display in different functions so that you can test them separately and incrementally the folder retrieval does retrieve everything and you can display the files in unsorted order etc.

so if you submit the second form after submission the first one you will have a session variable user_id provided you have commented out the lines that unset and destroy the session

detecting screens orientation might help but afaik on tablet the soft keyboard won t cover the whole screens even on landscape

int	chars
i think all of this originates from the incorrect weird assumption that there are 8 bit int and then there are chars where chars is some sort of magical mysterious thing

12106317
int	chars
the mysterious signedness of chars adds nothing to the language except perhaps a potential for signedness-related bugs caused by implicit int promotions

12106317
int	chars
likely they let chars be signed because they wanted it to behave just as the other int types short int long which are all guaranteed by the standard to alwasy be signed by default

12106317
int	chars
whenever you use chars as operand in an expression it will always get promoted to int

12106317
int	chars
similarly constant chars literals a n etc are of type int not chars

12106317
int	chars
first of all the literals a and b get silently truncated from int into signed unsigned chars

12106361
int	chars
so basically for some reason the input file contains the chars to output stored as int

12106361
int	chars
your least worst bet it to read in each int cast it to an array of chars and output those 4 chars

if you don t want the table header to scroll with the table then rather than add the uiview to your uitableview you can add your uiview as a subviews of the view controller s view at the same level as your uitableview

12106604
int	chars
as for performance values of type chars are implicitly converted in many contexts to int assuming that int can represent all values of type chars which is usually the case

12106604
int	chars
it converts the value of ch from chars to int adds 1 to the result and converts the sum back from int to chars to store it in ch

12106604
int	chars
converting an 8-bit signed chars to a 32-bit signed int requires sign extension

12106604
int	chars
converting an 8-bit unsigned chars to a 32-bit signed int requires zero-filling the high-order 24 bits of the target

12106606
int	chars
unsigned chars represents a byte-sized pattern of bits or an unsigned int

12106606
int	chars
signed chars represents a byte-sized signed int

12106606
int	chars
so forcing chars to be unsigned is far lower on the list of achievable goals than forcing int to be 2 s complement and c hasn t even done that

the itemscontrol now has a stackpanel with a textblock to show the date header the dictionary key and another itemscontrol which is basically a copy of the old one which just listed the items the dictionary value

12106766
inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview
as the control is bound to items and the icollectionview implements inotifycollectionchanged i was expecting the filter to work as it is changing the items list and that the converter would be re-run to rebuild the dictionary

queue	fifo
what i think the author means is that you can simply use a fifo or a lifo queue but better performance can be acquired in some scenarios by using an algorithm that tackles resource-heavy items in the queue first

12106969
children	parent
so when you add some children into the first one this may result in a crappy structure as all children have the same parent some children have the same children as their siblings etc.

12107769
cos	sin
unfortunately no standard tells exactly how sin and cos should bitwise-behave they can be off a few ulp from rounded exact result and differ from one library to another and will give different results on different architectures compilers hardwired in x87 fpu

12107778
folder	directory
if anybody comes to this it s just because in sites all libraries mediaelement the file mediaelement.js should be not be in this root directory but you have to extract all the files and folder so mediaelement.js is in the build subdirectory so sites all libraries mediaelement mediaelement.js

12107841

12107844
getter	setter
i stuck on dot notation for setter and getter

12107844
getter	setter
is the left side is called setter and the right side called getter

12107883
folder	directory
no such file or directory - var folder v8 v8lbbdwcgjmntpbjrzgcfu+++ti -tmp- rackmultipart20120824-71301-1aqop0s

12107932
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
as uitableview is a subclassing of uiscrollview it inherited all of uiscrollview s properties including its gesture recognisers

12107932
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer

12108025
getter	setter
a public field is not worse than a getter setter pair that does nothing except returning the field and assigning to it

12108025
getter	setter
an oft-mentioned advantage of getter setter pairs isn t

12108025
put	get	getter	setter
however adding validation to a setter is a change to its preconditions a violation of the previous contract which was quite simply you can put anything in here and you can get that same thing later from the getter

12108025
getter	setter
this same argument applies to other supposed advantages of these pass-through getter setter pairs if you later decide to change the value being set you re breaking the contract

12108025
getter	setter
if a class has these dumb getter and setter for every field then it is a class that has no invariants whatsoever no contract

12108025
getter	setter
if all the class has is those getter and setter it s just a dumb data holder and dumb data holders should look like dumb data holders

12108025
getter	setter
adding pass-through getter setter pairs to such a class adds no value

12108025
getter	setter
there are reasons to use getter and setter but if those reasons don t exist making getter setter pairs in the name of false encapsulation gods is not a good thing

12108025
getter	setter
valid reasons to make getter or setter include the things often mentioned as the potential changes you can make later like validation or different internal representations

12108083
submit	submission
on desktop browser everything works for submission submit button or enter key

width	height
for that to work they must conform to width and height multiples of one item with appropriate margins applied

12116760
isotope	masonry
with isotope you have masonry plus much more functionality while it is similarly easy to implement

12116760
isotope	masonry
but because of layouting masonry isotope which is the whole purpose here you can not have bleed at all sizes - for that you d need to code boxes with fluid widths also which can be done with some extra effort

12116784
textview	imageview
step #2 create your own pagerindicator implementation probably based on the library s tabpageindicator that uses imageview instead of textview .

12116799

12116848
outputstream	inputstream
i think you need to provide an inputstream containing the image in the response.ok out not an outputstream

12116848
outputstream	inputstream
your jax-rs framework would read the bytes from the inputstream and put them onto the response it wouldn t be able to do anything generically with an outputstream

12116878
post	get
there are several somewhat old blog post out there advising caution when mixing dynamic variables binding and pmap here where we get the following code snippet

12116905
google-chrome	firefox
this code works with firefox google-chrome ie

12116905
opera	safari
i haven t tested using opera and safari

12116938
int	chars
the trouble is that you need to save the value from getchar â in an int â because you are reading two chars for each time you increment the count

12116938
int	chars
the reason you need to store the result of getchar in an int and not a chars is that it can return every possible chars value and also a distinct value eof

12116938
int	chars
if you don t use int you store direct into a chars one of two things will happen

12117017
stdout	stderr
you can capture that easily by routing stderr to stdout s stream and capturing both

12117023
mdpi	hdpi
i know there are guidelines for creating icons for specific areas in android tab list etc. and how you would size them according to ldpi mdpi hdpi etc

12117048
google-chrome	firefox
the oninput event fires for backspace del etc in google-chrome and firefox but not ie9

12117048
google-chrome	firefox
however that onkeyup does actually fire backspace del etc in ie9 but not google-chrome firefox so the opposite

12117070
hide	show
here is the working example of your problem simple show and hide using jquery library

12117082
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear

12117098
gitolite	gitosis
first please don t install gitosis go with the latest v3+ gitolite a much more complete authorization layer see gitosis vs gitolite

12117098
gitolite	gitosis
and why do you need gitosis or gitolite

width	height
as you can see in the image every box has a different height and there are some boxes with double width

12117235
post	get
one caveat about using link_to for creating destroying records is that if javascript is disabled they will fall back to using get rather than post delete

12117237
stdout	stderr
the usual solution is to use nohup or exec the scripts with stdout and stderr redirected to dev null or nul in windows but this often has issues

12117252
put	get	post	put	post	get
i can solve it by throwing get out of the window and just put everything in a post body as a jsonobject mapped with jackson and problem solved

12117252
post	get
but then i m using a post to fetch data while a get should be used in pure rest to fetch data

12117258
stdout	stderr
to do this redirect both stdout and stderr to dev null then background it

12117265
google-chrome	firefox
this is possible in firefox with but google-chrome prevents you from moving a child pop-up outside of the screen of the master page

12117275
punctuation	words
let s say that in my elasticsearch index i have a field called dots which will contain a string of punctuation separated words first.second.third

12117294
cpu	hyperthreading
the use of instead of may also help with the initiation of turbo boost by helping the cpu stay below its tdp thermal design power and hyperthreading for which mwait is the ideal mechanism for not consuming an entire physical core while at the same time avoiding the higher c states

12117299
width	height
you could consider using a div instead of img and using your source image as the background and forcing its width and height

12117346
int	double
ipiv is of course an int array of size 3 and a is an array of double size 9

vim	gedit
i also found this here but changed from vim to gedit

12117531
hide	show
that hide a regular html select and adds a div and a number of child divs as options to show instead

desandro has released a packery layout mode for isotope

12117701
pull	push
finally git push ssh remote.host path to repo my-new-branch-name will push it to the server from which you can issue a pull request

12117704
uploadify	swfupload
swfupload and uploadify are client side - it means it runs on client browser and sends data to a file processor in this case php that file actually uploads the file and not swfupload or uploadify

cfstring	nsstring
revisiting this question if you are trying to separate an nsstring cfstring by line breaks you should probably use

12117736
move	drag
i m using jquery to allow users to move rows one by one and drag and drop

12117743
width	height
this works great for visuals like rectangles where they correctly maintain a fixed stroke width but expand in shape width height as the canvas is zoomed with the layouttransform

12117774

12117805
opera	google-chrome
edit i ve included an image of what i want it to look like it isn t doing this in google-chrome and opera

12117805
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome opera the green div is placed at the lower right corner this is a starting place but the position css class should modify that

12117831

entity-relationship	diagram
if you really want an entity-relationship diagram then each entity get one box and each relationship gets either a line between two boxes or a diamond with lines to the boxes depending

12117845

12117916
jar	war
i have a multi-module maven project with some modules producing war files and some producing jar files as declared in their respective poms

during resizing mkmapview might calculate that the position of the annotation is off-screen and dump or flag the mkannotationview containing the uitextfield that is currently first responder

12117996
mkmapview	mkannotationview
or if this is triggered by the mkmapview calculating that the mkannotationview should not be shown have you tried setting up your animation so that the annotation is never calculated as being outside the visible extent

12118013
google-chrome	firefox
3 ultimately sits on top of javascript which runs on your javascript engine be it ie google-chrome firefox - whatever

12118047
listview	gridview
you can of course use other methods such as a listview and build a gridview for it i d do this if you have large numbers of rows or some other such control but given your specific layout requirements probably you are going to want this method with a grid

12118059
mouseover	mouseout
on mouseover i am trying to remove the class grey which i am able to do and then add another background color as a highlight then remove it on mouseout which i can also manage

12118060
propertychangelistener	jcombobox
how do i use propertychangelistener with jcombobox

12118083
selecteditem	selectedindex
4 remember you can also bind the selecteditem or selectedindex of a listbox to capture what the user has selected just be sure to set the binding to twoway so the view can push data to the viewmodel and not just read like this binding myselecteditem mode twoway

12118103
children	parent
you cannot do this with css children cannot control parent through css sadly

12118131
pull	push
gitolite-shell is called when you are using hgit in your cloning address theat gitolitev3 script will check if you have the right to clone the repo and if yes will call the commands behind the script git-http-backend git-receive-pack for push or git-upload-pack for clone pull fetch straight from the git source itself http-backend.c

12118139
post	get
so i tried to get charlieboy s solution to work and it mostly did but it failed for me in the following case maybe something changed in jgit since that post

12118149
range	minimum
your second query is much faster because it only computes the minimum fail date for units that had a failure within the target date range

12118162
folder	directory
i have a script that is intended to be run by multiple users on multiple computers and they don t all have their dropbox folder in their respective home directory

12118167
superclass	subclassing
in ruby if you subclassing a class you can call the superclass s singleton methods by calling them as singleton methods of the subclassing but that does not work for included extended modules

12118182
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
currently i am basing my project around a uitabbarcontroller with my modules being new uiviewcontroller s and nibs

12118193

jquery and if you want to this with animation you can use fadeout fadein methods

12118197
addclass	removeclass
you can use the jquery s addclass someclass and removeclass someclass

12118201
inherited	properties
here is a good example of using object.create with inherited static and instance properties

12118275
folder	directory
the dropbox folder is probably within the home directory of the user so to save some time you could limit your search to that

12118282
getter	setter
you can always hide all of the messy syntax behind getter setter functions but if the structure is large then that method will not be very maintainable

12118287
folder	directory
one option is you could go searching for the .dropbox.cache directory which at least on mac and linux is a hidden folder in the dropbox directory

12118315
put	get
i feel like i m missing something obvious to get this work but i can t put my finger on it

12118339
uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
another alternative is to use a raw uiview in your main uiwindow directly placed above your normal view controllers without a uiviewcontroller

12118362
slideup	slidedown
set a timer to do the slideup in the callback of the slidedown and on mouseout of .alltabs

what is the easiest way using a graphical tool or command line on ubuntu linux to know if two binary files are the same or not except for the time stamps

12118416
postgresql	mysql
this works in postgresql and mysql

12118501
hide	show
the changes i made are quite simple in each of your click events when you show something the selected class is added and when you hide something it s removed

12118506
min	max
format with max min temperature per month maybe average rainfall and sun hours would be great

12118612
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

12118636
opennlp	mallet
it is implemented over uima and has wrappers for many nlp ml libraries opennlp stanford nlp mallet libsvm etc.

12118637
hide	show
if you want to show a div when the checkbox is checked and hide it when the checkbox is disabled use

12118687
post	get
i added the get action mostly to avoid confusion instead of just telling the user it doesn t exist when they attempt to access the route manually instead of through a form post i redirect them to the post the comment would ve been submitted to

12118687
post	get
the question is whether i can use a permanent redirect result in http get requests and still not get permanently redirected during http post requests

12118697
springboard	tweak
note one more thing that if you are creating an activator listener make a plist like with tweak that filters springboard depending on your tweak and add necessary frameworks to your makefile too

12118699
submit	submission
1.you need to add submit button inside html form or have a way to trigger form submission with javascript something like this

everything works fine in google-chrome and firefox but ie

12118777
put	get
i m trying to get the user to put in a specific word

12118868
post	get
if they re being submitted in a form you could use some onsubmit javascript to a return false and then b submit the form using post or get with the extra data appended

12118869
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

12118870
maven	pom.xml
the js import maven plugin that has the artifactid of javascript-maven-plugin under extensions in the pom.xml of the codehaus sample ria app is responsible for taking the string in the index.html file descending the dependency tree starting with the index.js file and automatically injecting all dependencies into the html

12118910
integer	unsigned
i want to convert a floating point value to a 16-bit unsigned integer without saturating wraparound overflow instead

12118910
unsigned	short
the unsigned short int bigval expression works as desired but it s probably ub right

12118910
integer	unsigned
edit oops i figured it would be normal for 32-bit integer - 16-bit unsigned integer conversion to use wraparound

12118920
viewdidload	viewwillappear
but i realized that even if a physical ipad 2 is rotated to landscape mode self.view.bounds is in viewdidload and viewwillappear

12118920
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if the table is created in viewdidload or viewwillappear using self.view.bounds then the table ends up being 768 points wide and is meant for the portrait mode

12118921
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the webforms for marketers modules is a module that provides a gui for non-developers to design forms with textboxes dropdownlistfor checkbox etc.

12118921
hide	show
followed by either the keyword show or the keyword hide

12118937
post	get
as a developer who wanted to play a long clip i would be hesitant to download 200+ megabytes of project just to get a class who s code is short enough to post on so

12118947
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
element names are case-insensitive in html but case-sensitive in

12118967
hide	show
user selects a value with mouse or arrow up down key to show hide a layer on page

12118967
hide	show
i have a workaround which is to remove the show hide layer in its own function and fire that on change keyup and initial load

12119015
post	get
i need visitors to be able to get back to the originally requested url like www.mysite.com page or even www.mysite.com page post from the m.mysite.com splash page view full version link

12119017
hash	md5
hash are one-way functions that transform a block of bytes into another block of bytes of a fixed size such as 128bit or 256bit sha md5

12119069
hide	show
i haven t hardcoded hide and show into the regex - instead it returns whatever string is after then

12119086
mef	prism
prism contains guidance for both mef and unity

12119091
folder	directory
so i need to create a script that automates the process of building the initial project which depends on other 3rd party jar files residing in its libs directory and creating an obfuscated jar file the .class files from the 3rd party jars don t necessarily need to be obfuscated which can then be copied over to the libs folder of the dependsoninitial project

12119126
mouseout	mouseleave
this is just the difference between mouseleave and mouseout and is expected behaviour

12119132
fseek	ftell
and by the way i am aware of fgetpos fsetpos and ftell fseek but this is not a duplicate

12119132
fseek	ftell
that question asks about ftell fseek and the answer is not applicable to ftello fseeko

12119174
fseek	ftell
in a call to fseek or fseeko on a text stream either the offset must be zero or whence must be seek_set and the offset must be the result of an earlier call to ftell on the same stream

12119182
rvm	bundler
because you re not managing your gems through gemsets like rvm or rbenv will do for you the default version of rake became 0.9.3.beta.1 instead of the version installed by bundler 0.9.2.2

12119277
implements	extends
you implements an interface using the same syntax you d use to extends a class

12119292
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome firefox need to turn the allowjavascriptclosewindow option on

12119300
hide	show
on button click the loading image show up but i am unable to hide the loading image after the map is loaded

12119311
width	height
is there a setting or configuration option somewhere for the display size ios main window height and width in ios points that the ios simulator uses when launched to run an app

12119318
setinterval	settimeout
the knack in this solution is to factor out a gonext function that can be called in two ways - in response to a click event and in response to a 15 second settimeout not setinterval

12119327
width	height
i m trying to place a series of jlabels at specific x and y coordinates on a jpanel and set its height and width too

12119330
folder	directory
there is a packages folder in this directory

12119348
width	height
draw your graphics on the canvas then scale and translate the canvas itself using css properties not the width and height attributes of the canvas which will clear it

12119352
nsstring	nsdata
it won t be a string but that s fine because an nsstring in cocoa represents a sequence of unicode characters while an nsdata represents a sequence of bytes which you could easily store wherever you want including in a database

12119354
width	height
it has a width of 100 and a height of 300px

12119360
getter	setter
assuming you mean that it auto-generates an ivar and getter and setter methods for you even if you omit the synthesize this is variously called default property synthesis automatic property synthesis and property autosynthesis

12119360
getter	setter
if you don t explicitly synthesize a readwrite property and you do include both an explicit getter and an explicit setter then again clang will not automatically generate an ivar for you

12119367
implements	extends
it s more flexible to work with interfaces because if you have bedroominterface and livingroominterface then you can have flatinterface implements both interfaces then flat101 implementation class implements flatinterface instead of extends from flat then implements an interface

12119367
implements	extends
option 2 is to have flat101 extends from flat then flat implements bedroominterface and livingroominterface

12119391
implements	extends
you can not extends more than one class but you can implements more than one interface

12119407
profiling	instrumentation
is it possible to use xcode instrumentation to profiling a third-party app

12119417
rss	feed
drupal does not provide a default method for customizing the core rss feed

12119418
width	height
then you can set the height and width for each of those

12119429
post	get
then after you get a post back from paypal or whatever you could read the cookies from the user s request

12119453
stdout	stderr
a c# app is still an app so as long as its a console app and supports stdout and stderr you shouldn t have any particular trouble capturing the output to stdout

12119466
hide	show
otherwise there is an another option like presentmodalviewcontroller and u can also use hide show view while showing dialog in your original view

12119526
hide	show
in your tableviewdidselectrowatindex method on selection of row just show the particular custom view which contains details of selected row and at that same time hide the table view so u can have the view that u want

12119526
hide	show
and make a back button on that custom view and on that button action hide your current view and show the tableview again

12119532
submit	submission
so i want to block user when he she tries to submit data with this special characters or there should a message on submission the data i mean how to validate that textview

12119534
profiling	instrumentation
using xcode 4.4.1 and my ipad 3 running ios 5.1.1 i m able to use the core animation and time profiling instrumentation on third-party apps

12119539
keydown	keyup
one way to filter the omnibox s false event out would be to check that every keyup has a pair keydown

12119539
mouse	keyboard
remember to use your mouse to focus on the omnibox and type not a keyboard shortcut

12119582
button	checkbox
if i click multiple checkbox they should display their id s and when i click on delete button all the mutiple selected checked nodes should be removed dynamically

12119643
g++	gcc
make sure you are compiling with g++ and not gcc

12119677
min	max
the column in the min or max function must be an indexed column

12119677
min	max
update 2017 06 23 recently this has been updated to say that a query containing a single max or min might be satisfied by an index lookup allowing for things like arithmetic

12119677
min	max
however they still preclude having more than one such aggregation operator in a single query so min max will still be slow

12119677
min	max
queries that contain a single min or max aggregate function whose argument is the left-most column of an index might be satisfied by doing a single index lookup rather than by scanning the entire table

12119682
put	get
you can put that method in your model class and use that in template to get the type of file

12119700
free	malloc
every malloc need a free so you ll need a similar for-loop to free all the inner mallocs

12119701
free	malloc
you need to call free as many times as you called malloc and on the same addresses which was returned by malloc

12119702
free	malloc
for every malloc there must be a free

12119702
free	malloc
you need to iterate in the same fashion as the malloc loop but call and then free tree0 afterwards

take this example for the code suppose the total memory is 10 bytes and 2 bytes is used by the declaration of pointer to type int and ohter 6 bytes by malloc function the remaining 2 bytes is occupied by other programs now when i run realloc function to extend the memory that pointer is pointing to it will search for 10 bytes in memory and when it is not available it allocates 10 bytes of memory from heap area and copies contents of malloc and paste it in new allocated memory area in heap area and then delete the memory stored in malloc right

12119871
margin	height
this 100 height is what makes your content push the footer to the bottom of the window and then the footer worms its way back up into the visible area using a negative margin which is why you need to know the height of the footerâ the negative margin must be the same height as the footer element

12119911
backslash	double-quotes
just found out that double-quotes can be escaped with backslash

awt	swing
swing runs on-top of awt whose underlying event-dispatch thread may be in the process of shutting down too

12120365
awt	swing
trying to use swing or awt while shutting down can lead not only to dead locks but also may just not work at all anyways

12120469
post	get
but that doesn t look that nice if you want a rather long message plus get has size restrictions where post virtually hasn t

12120478

12120564
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve got 4 uinavigationcontroller in uitabbarcontroller

12120564
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
at the start only first uinavigationcontroller with root uiviewcontroller initializes but other 3 initizlize only when i select them

12120565
getter	setter
both the setter and getter are referencing themselves causing the stack overflow

12120622
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
im am pretty sure that the uinavigationcontroller together with their root uiviewcontroller are instantiated as soon as you load the uitabbarcontroller from the storyboard

12120658
range	minimum
i have a vector containing the minimum and maximum of 3 range i.e

12120712
folder	directory
here is ready to use directory lister with returning to parent folder functionality

12120735

in addition even though i gave height width settings to all photos

12120745
post	put
can t post storyboard image as new user but has a tabbarcontroller with 4 navigation controllers coming out - the first is the articlelistviewcontroller menu and each of the others are viewcontrollers - one i hope to put a webview that loads a link local page depending on the menu selected and the others for an about screen and an additional currently blank screen

12120754
slug	permalinks
i noticed that when creating custom post types there is a way to rewrite the permalinks and define a slug for the new page.is there a similar way to rewrite permalinks for custom templates

12120814
apache	lighttpd
apache and lighttpd have the same feature

12120862
exponent	modulo
rsa_key needs exponent and modulo so my question is how can i create rsa_key object from single char buffer the public key

12120862
exponent	modulo
however my question is exacly how to get modulo and exponent from a public key with format thats the bytes representing the public key

12120862
int	chars
ohh i forgot first column is the byte position second column is the byte value typecasted to int 3th column is again value but int unsigned chars so i can see if its +127 4th colums is the hex representation of the value and the last column is chars based on ascii table if its visible chars

12120871
google-chrome	firefox
first of all i would inspect the image request in a network tab of google-chrome firefox

12120878
width	height
however when i use it on a webp image that has transparency it seems that it can t get this info at all returns -1 for both width and height

12120903
calloc	malloc
note i replaced the calloc with malloc simply because i never use calloc so i m not sure whether it tries to play alignment tricks

12120904
super	self
now reading through the code i set the self to the super init hence self is now pointing to super

12120904
super	self
but now i return self which points to the super so how am i returning my subclass

12120967
super	self
and yes itâ s very good to realize that self and super both point to the same object as noted by driis

12120969
sbt	spray
however i cannot have them working it seems that the sbt configuration of spray has changed quite a lot since this documentation was written

12120978

dont try to much check get simple button and addd onclick event in that event put the code below

12120997
mongoid	activemodel
from reading through the code mongoid uses activemodel for the mass assignment protection

12120998
put	get
in the glulookat function and then in a view matrix we put -zaxis or we can write that and then in a view matrix we put zaxis to get the same result

12121001
super	self
both self and super point to the same data structure in memory namely your object that you have allocated

12121001
super	self	superclass	subclassing
in other words slightly simplified super treats the memory location as if it were an instance of the superclass the type you subclassing often nsobject while self treats the memory location as a regular pointer to the type you have defined

12121001
super	self
if you print super and self in the debugger you will see they point to the same memory location

12121013
restrict	shared
given the object-behavior of postgresql i don t think you can restrict access to either function definitions in compiled environments that s not source code though but would include which shared object files the routines are in or type definitions and that includes table structures

12121014
put	get
after you ve put all your objects in you can use values to get the objects in proper order

12121035
put	get
i get the paths of the chosen files and put them to the list

12121041
put	get
is this the best way to do it if i put the distinct on the first observable i don t get the other events on next buffers but items in each buffer should be isolated from others

12121090
width	height
when i give an image a percent width or height only it will grow shrink keeping its aspect ratio but if i want the same effect with another element is it possible at all to tie the width and the height together using percentage

12121151
queue	fifo
queue is fifo

12121162

12121162
width	height
in addition i need the height and width of the navigation bar

12121169
int	chars
without the int it is only the size of th chars

12121172
filtering	grouping
imho using the having clause should be efficient because there would an additional pass on the worktable that contains the grouping results on top of which the filtering criteria is run in the second case

12121189
put	get
the simplest way to get your code working is just put one line in view did load method as follow

12121195
google-chrome	firefox
this works totally fine for me in google-chrome firefox and ie9

12121202

inherited	properties
my viewmodel inherited from a class that inherited from an abstract class that has a properties with a attribute but the rule doesn t appear in the dom and unobtrusive validation doesn t catch the error

12121274
vim	emacs
one could simply replace vim with emacs in this setup but then one would spend most of the time working outside of emacs in an xterm

12121305
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
use a html parser like beautifulsoup or lxml.html

12121358
lxml	beautifulsoup
but if there is you ll need a full-blown html parser like beautifulsoup or lxml instead

12121433

12121931
width	height
width height are optional

12121935
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
not sure that this is a better solution than any of the alternatives you already mentioned but you could create a default handler to attach to the textchanged selectedindexchanged etc events of your controls to keep track of which ones have changed

12121970
sequence	permutation
my code is basically a program to check whether it is possible to use the ordered sequence 1 2 3.. n to generate a permutation of this sequence as specified by the user using a stack as temporary storage structure

12122122
children	parent
in swt the children are added by children no by parent

12122122
children	parent
that means that inside of the parent i do not know in which way and when the children are added to their parent

12122122
children	parent
inside of the parent i need to know when new children are added to the parent

12122178

containskey get put and remove operations

12122232
for-loop	loops
is there a way to do this without calling another method for-loop and strictly using the while loops as the question is only worth 4 including writing loops invariants and javadoc

12122242
put	get
if you got the expression like you can simulate assembly like do a stack and if you get to an operator pop the last 2 elements in the stack and apply the operator put 3 in stack put 4 in stack get op

12122275
ng-app	ng-controller
edit you also don t need to use as you could define myapp in the attribute ng-app that way you could call the ng-controller without prefixing myapp every time

12122283
button	checkbox
im trying to write a script which when i write will automatically convert it to jquery ui button and look like a checkbox

12122348

if you want to see errors like this immediately and unambiguously run it under valgrind memcheck or equivalent

12122576
notepad++	sublimetext	textmate	notepad++	textmate	sublimetext
a good way to avoid problems like these because even expert programmers still get syntax errors every once in a while is to use a good programming editor notepad++ sublimetext 2 coda textmate phpad that has syntax highlighting

12122577
scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	kdf	pbkdf2	salt
if the user entering a single password on startup is fine then you can encrypt the other passwords with symmetric encryption and then use a kdf such as scrypt or pbkdf2 to derive the master key from the password and a salt

12122579
realloc	malloc
realloc and malloc functions

12122579
realloc	malloc
take this example for the code suppose the total memory is 10 bytes and 2 bytes is used by the declaration of pointer to type int and ohter 6 bytes by malloc function the remaining 2 bytes is occupied by other programs now when i run realloc function to extend the memory that pointer is pointing to it will search for 10 bytes in memory and when it is not available it allocates 10 bytes of memory from heap area and copies contents of malloc and paste it in new allocated memory area in heap area and then delete the memory stored in malloc right

12122579
free	malloc
assume that 01 to 06 has been used by malloc func 07 and 08 are free and last 2 blocks i e 09 and 10 are being used by memory of other programs

12122579
free	realloc
now when i call realloc p 10 i need 10 bytes but there are only 2 free bytes so what does realloc do

12122601
for-loop	loops
moreover as you also have a for-loop in the kernel function it means that each thread will be executing the 2 for loops in the mult function several times

12122603
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended
the second touch doesn t cause touchesbegan touchesmoved or touchesended to be called

12122607
16-bit	64bit
then first unpack those 8-bit values into 16-bit values in the lower 64bit of the register interleaving them with 0s

12122613
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
read first the behavioral specifications of malloc realloc free posix standard

12122614
put	get
i want to get the value of the file.size which is calculated by plupload and put into my database via php _post

12122624
oncreate	findviewbyid
because of this order any attempt to access the views of the fragment in the activity s oncreate method using findviewbyid produces a nullpointerexception as the fragment s oncreateview only gets called after the end of the activity s oncreate

12122624
oncreate	onstart
basically i have been forced to put the problem code in the activity s onstart method instead of oncreate as onstart happens after the fragment s oncreateview

12122719
opengl-es	glkbaseeffect
i m on the way to move my code from glkit to opengl-es 2.0 because glkbaseeffect leaks

12122732
put	get
when you use explorer.exe the redirection gets triggered and you see the file right where you think you put it but when you use ruby.exe the redirection does not get triggered and it sees the directory as it actually is

12122751
realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc relation how does it handle when the required space is not available in memory

12122751
realloc	malloc
take this example for the code suppose the total memory is 10 bytes and 2 bytes is used by the declaration of pointer to type int and ohter 6 bytes by malloc function the remaining 2 bytes is occupied by other programs now when i run realloc function to extend the memory that pointer is pointing to it will search for 10 bytes in memory and when it is not available it allocates 10 bytes of memory from heap area and copies contents of malloc and paste it in new allocated memory area in heap area and then delete the memory stored in malloc right

12122751
free	malloc
consider this as memory blocks assume that 01 to 06 has been used by malloc func 07 and 08 are free and last 2 blocks i e 09 and 10 are being used by memory of other programs

12122751
free	realloc
now when i call realloc p 10 i need 10 bytes but there are only 2 free bytes so what does realloc do

12122756
unsigned	short
false making wchar_t a typedef to unsigned short which makes

12122756
unsigned	short
functions overloaded for both unsigned short and wchar_t like the

12122775
textview	imageview
you can have an imageview overlapping textview unless there is a specific reason for using linearlayout

12122792
hash	salt
it somewhat looks hash salt

12122795
unsigned	short
typically wchar_t is defined as an unsigned short

12122796
prepare	pdostatement
if you create a pdostatement object through pdo prepare or pdo query and invoke an error on the statement handle pdo errorinfo will not reflect the error from the statement handle

12122814
activemq	rabbitmq
often built supporting standards such as jms and amqp typically websphere mq activemq azure messaging hornetq rabbitmq etc.etc.

12122814
websphere	ibm
there might be confusion here since the main esb product of ibm is called websphere message broker while it rather an esb used side by side with the mom product - websphere mq

12122814
activemq	rabbitmq
usually most mom call themselves brokers such as rabbitmq activemq qpid etc

12122854
post	get
then you will get the post ordered by your ordinalposition

12122898
mvp	presenter
the key of the mvp pattern is to separate the concerns between the view and the presenter

12122898
gridview	repeater
the presenter only has to set the list of entities and whether the data is presented as a table using a gridview repeater etc is the concern of the view

12122954
inherited	subclassing
when the runtime calls mybase.print it can easily check the inherited of the classes and see that subclassing has overridden the print method and calls the subclassing implementation

12122956
int	double
the solution is to use input.nextline after getting your int and double in order to swallow the eol token

12123055
free	realloc
if size passed is zero to the realloc function then it will just free the old memory block and return null

12123055
free	realloc
realloc ptr 0 is equivalent to free ptr

12123055
free	realloc
there are only 2 free bytes so what does realloc do

12123057
min	max
it s c++ no need for any macros especially not those that are already given as functions to you by the standard it always bothers me when including and getting complaints about their stupid min and max macros

12123104
versioning	upgrade
you ll need to recompile your build of 3.6.19 or upgrade to a newer versioning

12123118
postgresql	mysql
i m interested in solutions for mysql sql server oracle postgresql and other dbms that handle timestamp with time zone

12123123

12123150
mouse	keyboard
i am interested in simulating a mouse click event keyboard stroke on mac os x without actually moving the mouse

12123150
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to send keyboard mouse events to non-key windows

12123163
ethernet	wireless
a the ethernet cable from say a cable modem connects to your wireless router wan port and then wireless router sends out radio waves which your laptop catches

12123163
ethernet	wireless
so the wan port of one of the routers will connect to the cable modem same as a and from that router s ethernet ports usually there are 4 ethernet ports on a wireless router ethernet cables will connect to other routers ethernet ports and now these routers will send out radio waves which your pc catches

12123180
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
browsers tested google-chrome firefox ie safari

12123281
getter	setter
i know that i can create a bean form and inside it i can create respective setter getter also but i am just looking for any other option if available

12123312
super	self
when a super method is called the self pointer is the same as it was for the instance of the subclass which called it

12123312
super	self
even if you use super to call the first method the second method will still be called on your subclass since self still points to the subclass

12123313
folder	directory
the default output folder option only seems to allow me to output to any directory inside a given project not to other projects

12123326
post	get
you can get more information about this in this blog post

12123348
junit	testng
if you really need an order of your tests than you should use testng instead of junit where you can define dependencies between tests and based on that a particular order of tests

12123377
int	chars
can be applied only on intergral types such as int short chars etc

12123379
folder	directory
the java update folder contains spaces so you have to quote the entire directory path

12123976
mouseleave	mouseenter
the textfields come from a custom class that extends jtextfield and uses an overriden paintcomponent method along with a mouselistener so that when mouseenter on a textfield area the gradient color slightly changes and changes back again when mouseleave the textfield

12124016
equals	compareto
so in theory it is possible that a class in the jdk had a compareto not consistent with equals

there could be many files and the directory structure inside public folder can vary

12124253
super	extends
if you add the same attributes accross all your controllers you could consider adding them in a super controller a spring controller can extends another controller without problems

12124257
super	extends
but note that interfaces don t implicitly extends any super interface or class unlike classes which implicitly extends the object class

12124342

then when a coupon code is received we extract the counter and hash the counter + salt and compare it to the hash found in the code

12124463
inherited	properties	equals	gethashcode
the equals and gethashcode methods on anonymous types override the methods inherited from object and are defined in terms of the equals and gethashcode of the properties so that two instances of the same anonymous type are equals if and only if all their properties are equals

12124590
g++	gcc
you re probably compiling with gcc instead of g++

12124590
g++	gcc
the actual compiler is the same but g++ tells the linker to use the default c++ libraries were gcc only tells it to look at the c libraries

12124594
g++	gcc
also you need to compile this with g++ and not gcc

12124604
public	protected
i can speculate though as to the cause of your problem it is likely that you are using this colormap or its type as a public or protected member of a public ref class or that you are using it in some way that its type ends up being the type of a public or protected member

12124614
vaadin	wicket
as far as measuring like feedback there are services such as sharethis such that one could integrate with roller at the presentation level - perhaps using wicket or vaadin at that same application level

put	get
get the next 200 000 rows from the text file etc and put into excel below previous data

12124777
equals	gethashcode
the works because the implementation of equals and gethashcode for anonymous types works on the basis of field-by-field equality

12124777
equals	gethashcode
if we do change it we can change it for just equals and gethashcode or for them and also

12124777
union	distinct
very often with linq groupby as we saw above but also distinct union groupjoin intersect sequenceequal todictionary and tolookup and often with other uses it s not like we weren t doing the things linq does for us with enumerables in 2.0 and to some extent before then anyone coding in 2.0 would have written half the methods in enumerable themselves

12124777
equals	gethashcode
the default implementation of equals and gethashcode has an optimisation that let s it use a binary match in cases where it s safe to do so

12124932
move	drag
as the nodes are move that is .on drag the code that calculates the hulls is fired

12124936

this can be done with little trick with keydown and keyup events a flag

12124973
rational-numbers	base
a rational-numbers x can be exactly represented in base n if the prime factorization of the denominator of x contains only primes found in the factorization of n

12124977
inherited	properties
instead they inherited the default value of auto for both properties

12124981
for-loop	arrays
with the help of excray s comment i manage to figure it out the answer what we need to do is actually write a simple for-loop to iterate over the two arrays that represent the train data and test data

12124982
integer	fractions
where 1.m is a binary fractions and e is a positive or negative integer

12125009

12125022
mouse	keyboard
now what i want to do is when the user select some index for example index 1 in the listbox and only if he clicked enter with the keyboard or clicked with the mouse left click it will call use the function parseanddisplayxml

12125042
equals	gethashcode
override the equals and gethashcode on menuitemaction and each time you want a collection of distinct items- use the set collection

12125121
folder	directory
after some inspection i came to the conclusion that eclipse isn t putting the .class file on correspondent folder in the ouput directory it s simply ignoring it

12125130
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this suggests that the tab bar is a subview of the main uiviewcontroller which contains an array with 4 uinavigationcontroller one for each tab

12125130
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when a tab is pressed the main uiviewcontroller removes the currently visible uinavigationcontroller from its view and adds the new one as subview

12125130
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
they probably use one uinavigationcontroller with the main uiviewcontroller + tab bar as rootviewcontroller

12125143
client-side	server-side
anyway what i m trying to do is generate input fields in the server-side code bound to observables on my client-side code then set the initial values of the observables through the value of the hidden fields

12125209
punctuation	words
the function currently adds spaces after punctuation removes spaces before punctuation and capitalizes the first words of each sentence

12125210
iboutlet	ibaction
i m not sure what you re asking but by ibaction and iboutlet for a button is definitley possible

12125211
width	height
my tiles are all squares with a size of 40 by 40 pixels so this constant is used to help calculate anything that needs to be adjusted by the image s width and height

12125274
integer	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
expressing the representable numbers using an integer times a power of two rather than the more common fractions significand simplifies some number theory and other reasoning about floating-point properties

12125297

i m guessing you ve got your width and height of the canvas set to less than the rectangle s dimensions

12125301
udp	tcp
is it possible to send complete tcp or udp packets including headers and etc programmatically

12125303
bash	tcsh
despite the comments there s no direct problem with tcsh and believe me i m no fan of c shell nor is there a problem with bash per se

12125303
bash	tcsh
the problems would be similar in fact if you replaced the tcsh with bash

12125303
bash	tcsh
in the bash script you are trying to create a single string that will contain a valid command line that tcsh will interpret correctly including preserving spaces in arguments

12125334
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
an implementation might decide to implement realloc in the most primitive way by doing an unconditional malloc for a new memory block copying the data and free -ing the old block

12125349
free	realloc
for example if a particular implementation uses different pools per object sizes realloc may actually allocate a new block in the pool for smaller objects and free the block in the pool for larger objects

12125364
int	double
columns of j don t evaluate to consistent types for each group result for group 4 has column 1 type int but expecting type double

12125381
bash	tcsh
you would need a instead of your on the tcsh side just like on the bash side

12125381
bash	tcsh
so to correct your assumptions in your original script it is not tcsh which receives only a single argument from bash but it s ls receiving only a single one from tcsh

12125387
google-chrome	firefox
vertical and horizontal alignment and height percentage not working correctly in firefox although it works fine on ie and google-chrome

google-chrome	firefox
i tested both with firefox and google-chrome and the behavior is the same

12125467
accessor	properties
to implement ifeature a class must have a decimal properties called price with a get accessor like the garden class above and the pool class below

12125475
pop-up	dialog
the reason you don t see the loading dialog is that you call a blocking function in your gui thread main thread.when you set your dialog to visible you should let the gui thread to keep running so it can draw the dialog on the screen.moreover after 5 seconds that the gui thread is blocked the user will be presented with force close wait pop-up

12125492
dbcontext	objectcontext
assuming that myentity is your objectcontext or dbcontext you could bind to the local property of the dbset which is an observable collection that supports sorting

12125532
hide	show
in the following code on click of the button i want to hide the relative layout rl1 and show rl2 but my app crashes down after on button click.what am i doing wrong

12125544

rss	feed
i ve made myself a class that reads rss feed and returns them to my main class

12125588
rss	feed
i m assuming it s because that s how long it takes for the application to request the rss feed network latency and so forth

12125598
post	get
this code only works if i do a simple post or get request

12125655
integer	fractions
for numbers it does so by chopping off the fractions portion numbers that do not fit 32-bit integer range loose more than just the decimal portion

12125778
boost	stl
i d prefer an stl compliant circular buffer like for example the boost implementation

12125841
postgresql	mysql
it s like offset x limit 100 in mysql postgresql query or top 100 in mssql

12125864
min	max
again thanks for the info i will be marking as answers however if anyone could explain the need for all the calls to min or max or whatever i would appreciate it also seeing what it looks like with my real data is this still the way i should go

12125882
int	double
median trips up data.table because --- even when only passed int vectors --- median sometimes returns an int value and sometimes returns a double

12125882
int	double
but then right away or in your case in group 4 it gets passed a value of type double which won t fit in its int results vector

12125917
min	max
if it did cause more than one sql call again i d be surprised then try max or min instead of first

12125948
keydown	keyup
as there does not appear to be any modifier information in the event args you could keep track of the state yourself in some fields and handling both keyup and keydown to update them accordingly

12125950
put	get
if i don t put cvwaitkey i get the same error i get when writing video frames with avfoundation library without using

the scikit-learn library refers to the scikit-learn package specifically this method for calculating a graph laplacian from a sparse scipy matrix

12125964
cos	sin
if so just take the arg to sin cos to be 0 to complete the loop

12125970
button	marquee
you could use the rectangular marquee tool cut out the button you want then create a image based off the button you just cut out

12125993
chunked	transfer-encoding
during testing we discovered that some of their clients expect the response to always be chunked transfer-encoding chunked

12126015
width	height
is there anyway to do this without knowing the height width

12126015
width	height
i am familiar with the absolute positioning centering techniques when you know the height and width left 50

12126015
width	height
but again can i do this without knowing the height width

12126016
cobertura	jenkins
since this is possible for other coverage tools like cobertura via a jenkins plugin you could either

12126029
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
create a property to hold a uiviewcontroller and another one to hold a uipopovercontroller

12126042
post	get
you will get a typeerror object has no method objectat if you try to get the json data for the post model using approach 1 and you will get typeerror cannot call method objectat of undefined if you try to get the json data for the embedded model using approach 2

12126059
gentoo	linux
i ran across the following in gentoo linux s wiki about dynamic jumphost list

post	get
i have a main file witch is included in all other pages on my site can i turn that file to a simple php script that can capture requested data through post get

12126176
width	height
dynamically get width and height of .hiddenbox and properly position it using technique you are familiar with

12126176
width	height
but in this example you need to know the exact width and height of parent container .hiddenbg in your case it won t work with units

12126224
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock
my best suggestion would be to use a readwritelock but as you specifically state that you don t want to use any locks btw concurrenthashmap will probably use them internally you could try the following

12126251
rss	feed
i m wondering if it s possible to create some kind of feed that will automatically notify me whenever that variable is changed from its current numbers because rss or at least page2rss is incapable of doing that

12126251
rss	feed
if this isn t possible an alternative method is the facebook page i found the rss feed for it but that feed doesn t include wall posts by other people even if i add everyone to the end of the url which is a problem because the author currently posts to the page from his own facebook account when he updates the site

12126254
google-chrome	firefox
the problem in google-chrome but not in firefox when moving the mouse cursor along the black div there is a whole area in which the cursor goes back to default and click events aren t triggered

12126261

realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc
if you don t want to rely on glibc s memory management function malloc ... you could roll your own memory management library and force your process to use it with a ld_preload trick that way you could define a malloc calloc realloc free using sbrk implementation matching your own requirements

12126639
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve always found the best policy is to test in ie google-chrome firefox and safari latest versions then install a service like google analytics to find out what other browsers you are popular on

12126641

i can also confirm problem on firefox latest version as well as google-chrome

12127500
int	double
the original index the int must be attached to the double that was in that location in the original vector so that you can recover the location

12127500
int	double
note that if you sorted only the double within the pair then the value of the int would be the location in the array.

12127500
int	double
create a single vector of int that is initialized with values in the range where n is the size of the vector of double

12127500
int	double
then sort the vector of indices using a comparator functor that instead of looking at the value int passed in will check the value in the original double vector

12127502
qtkit	quicktime
the only way i manage to get hold of this information is using qtkit and quicktime via tcgetcurrenttimecode on qtmedia of the timecode qttrack

12127526
put	get	post	put	post	get
there is no way you can actually stop is behavior people have removed the back button disabled it but the user would still have controls from short cut for any browser my suggestion would be that for all those pages where you want the users to be logged in put them on a post method instead of a regular get use post

12127526
post	get
it is a bit crude using post where get might work but it solves this issue of yours

12127567
post	get
as to how to get around this problem unfortunately i don t see a clean way of doing it at the moment if anyone does find an elegant way to handle this please post it

12127611
put	get
you also define the syntax and parse rules in one file when using antlr with flex and bison you have to create .l and a .y .ypp files which can get really confusing when it comes to know what to put in each

12127646
hash	md5
you might be able to guess what the plaintext of an md5 hash is by using a rainbow table or brute force guessing but it is expensive and not really what you re looking for

12127726
superclass	subclassing
via the use of abstract methods and final methods on the superclass they allow you to restrict the manner in which your class is subclassing which can be useful in a wide variety of circumstances see also the template pattern

12127763
post	put
as per the suggestions of other post i put the gradient in a view over or rather containing the scroll view

12127801
put	get
you can put orderby clause on lastupdated field in query and get the top 10 or more latest record accordingly as follows

12127815
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
in order to have a nsmanagedobjectcontext you also need an nspersistentstorecoordinator and an nsmanagedobjectmodel etc

12127888
accessor	properties
make sure you use backing field s name as string argument in getsetting method in properties s get accessor

12127889

12127992
width	height
i have to get the height and width of the pdf file s first page and have to calculate the thumbnail s height and width accordingly

12127992
width	height
if i have to create the thumbnail from an image i can use getimagesize function in php but is there any function like that to get the height and width of the first page of the pdf file

12128087
portrait	landscape
but that d be true only for a portrait image being viewed in portrait or a landscape image viewed in landscape

12128095
super	extends
create a super class say for example masteralbums and extends your cdalbum and dvdalbum from it.place the methods getartist gettracklist in the super class.do not override it in the subclasses.now when you call system.out.println albumcollection.get number .getartist

12128135
implements	extends
as said above you are using where e extends comparable means your selection sort can take the argument who implements the comparable interface

12128141
switching	screens
a new imageview which gets the content of the old imageview when switching option without removing it from the superview just yet as a premature removal results in black screens when the new image hasn t loaded quite yet

min	max
32 20 20+20 40 min 23 max 32

12128181
min	max
45 24 24+18 42 since 42 40 so here min and max will be same that is 43

12128181
min	max
56 6 24 +10 +6 40 so here min 45 and max 56

12128181
min	max
then first key of the map from where the calculation started and he key where exactly it reaches to 40wilkl be choosen as min and max also explained above

12128181
min	max
besides this care need to be taken the at if sum reaches more than 40 then we have to ignore it and taking the previous value itself as min amd max in tha case min and max will be equal

12128199
post	get
i am able to use ajax get method to post data to a php page but i have a problem adding more parameters to the post method

12128206
post	get
get the post data as stream and read it to a string

12128270
free	malloc
glibc uses them to implement malloc and free

12128271
hide	show
the code meant to show a popup when button pressed and hide it when pressed anywhere else

12128341
width	height
for example if i set the width 80 and the height 30

12128341
width	height
it initialize to wider than 80 and higher than 30 which i set previously then in a flash it shrinked to the width 80 and height 30

12128343
nsview	nsoutlineview
nsoutlineview is a subclass of nstableview so both of them got the upgrade to be able to use nsview objects as cells in mac os x 10.7

12128343
nsview	nstablecellview
beginning with os x v 10.7 nsview instances most commonly nstablecellview instances or a subclass are supported for rows and columns

12128362
median	rank
because 1 3 is rank 1 in the list dates the set called rp1 is retrieved combined with response days for the items in the set jim and fred and the median is calculated

12128369
hide	show
if you want to make it such that clicking the button show the popup if it is hidden and hide it if it is show and clicking anywhere else hide it it s this block of your code that is causing the issue

12128396
width	height
this means that you can ask identify to print out width and height for the first page of a pdf with this command which you should have no problem to translate into php syntax

12128405
put	get
the trick then is how to put the right data in the data section so that you can send get variables to the curl script but ill let you solve that if you want a ruby sinatra example here is one

12128409
ubuntu	linux
he said sometimes you need to restart it in some linux systems like ubuntu for it to work again

12128413
getter	setter
i think having an abstract class for your objecttype with appropriate getter setter methods might help

12128420
hide	show
that is on a click on the document check if the target source element was your button if so show the popup otherwise hide it

12128420
hide	show
that is prevent clicks within the popup from bubbling up such that they don t reach the document-level click handler that does the show and hide

12128434
switching	screens
i am in a process of optimizing item renderers that display a character in a rect i notice that the action of dynamically setting the text is slow now i am thinking of creating premade objects with text hard-coded in them and inside the item-renderer have a switching to select the proper text object instead of using does anyone have any other idea on how to optimize the renderer it is a tile layout that displays about 100 renderers on screens

12128444
mouse	keyboard
along with the usual mouse keyboard messages and apis windows also has various techniques and apis eg a href rel nofollow raw input for getting input information defining additional input devices and i think also associating additional information with messages and one of those techniques might be more appropriate here

12128462
cos	sin
i m porting some code from matlab to c++ and discovered that matlab s sin and cos functions produce slightly different results from the sin and cos functions in the c++ library

12128462
cos	sin
to eliminate these differences i would like my c++ code to call the sin and cos functions from the fdlibm 5.3 library which is what i think matlab uses for sin and cos operations

12128462
cos	sin
do i need to modify the fdlibm source code so that the sin and cos functions are within a namespace

12128509
hide	show
if you want to hide the keyboard why to show the cursor

12128528
for-loop	arrays
a think it will be good idea to make an arrays of 10 boolean values and every time your button has been pressed - you just need to toggle corresponded value in your boolean arrays and update your label using for-loop

12128545
postgresql	mysql
additionally there is nothing similar to the rowid in sql server or mysql in postgresql it would be ctid

12128600
button	checkbox
i have an application in mind that involves presenting the user with groups of checkbox and radio button with each group on a seperate page and arrived at from a menu

the original problem of course is that i d like to be able to work with my interactive python session while having it control a terminal screen using the ncurses ncurses module or urwid for example

12128691
switching	screens
and switching to another window or screens session you can run

12128691
atexit	main
i ve tried calling them in main after the call to curses.wrapper and i ve tried registering them with atexit

12128691
stdout	stderr
also if want to do more interesting work in curses and before calling the embed_kernel function then i can t see the text which was printed to stdout or stderr by that function

12128697
accessor	properties
if you don t synthesize the properties with synthesize in the implementation file the compiler doesn t generate accessor methods automatically in this case you have to write accessor methods on your own or you will not have them

12128697
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
anyway the ivar is created by the properties so even if you don t have the synthesize you have the ivar related to the properties otherwise how could you been able to write your own implementation of accessor methods without the ivar

12128697
accessor	properties
with the new version of xcode 4.4 the compiler will generate automatically accessor methods even without and synthesize statement for properties

12128741
getter	setter	int	boolean
standard java bean convention is to name your properties your int and so on with camelcase so markquiz rather than mark_quiz and your getter and setter as getmarkquiz and setmarkquiz the 1st letter after get set is now capitalized for boolean properties use isxxx rather than getxxx

12128900
distance	polygons
minimum distance between the border of a circle and a rectangle polygons etc minimum of all distance for each separate segment

12128930
button	checkbox
the first idea is to enter some stuff in text input fields set checked unchecked checkbox click some button links etc

12128934
int	chars
this method should work in array of chars or int but does not work in array of strings

12128934
for-loop	arrays
then i tried to use for-loop and wanted it to stop when reaching total number of string elements in arrays stored in count variable

12128937
typedef	struct
our c programming god linus torvalds strongly encourages not using typedef for struct except if there s an explicit need for hiding the actual fields and type behind an opaque struct as it diminishes readability

12129003
post	get
i m looking at the codex for registering a custom post type and i don t quite get what this parameter does

12129063
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested your code and it works in google-chrome ie 8 and mozilla firefox

12129063
google-chrome	firefox
the following solution has been successfully tested in google-chrome ie 8 and mozilla firefox

12129063
google-chrome	firefox
the following implementation has been successfully tested in google-chrome ie 8 and mozilla firefox

12129075
implements	extends
on the main activity you extends fragmentactivity and implements the interface mylistdialogfragment.ondlglistclick

12129114
post	get
at first glance this seems like a logical choice use dapper or another other micro orm s for get and nhibernate for any post action methods on controllers

12129114
post	get
to tidy this up you could utilise the post redirect get prg pattern so get controllers use dapper and post controllers only have access to nhsessions

12129114
post	get
now your get and post action results would look like this -

12129125
informix	firebird	informix	ingres	ingres	firebird	ingres	postgresql	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql	postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
ignas you can take a look to web2py dal database abstraction layer it supports sqlite postgresql mysql oracle mssql firebird db2 informix and ingres and partially the google app engine sql and nosql

12129129
folder	directory
as long as you re building a website there is no other option to save a file on the clients computer then to let him her download it which will as stated in my comment go to his download folder or present him a dialog to let him choose a directory

12129205
put	get
in case you want to put the content in textarea to be a string gotten from server you must call to the server to get the value by ajax from your javascript code

12129241
ssl	https
wcf provides a lot more security by providing a lot more capabilities and options out of the box it supports not only transport security using ssl and https to secure your link like asmx but also supports message encryption and messages are by default encrypted and digitally signed

12129276
getter	setter
however by doing this you run into an issue where you are creating dto s with lots of setter getter

12129300
children	parent
but that s not a parent node just the children of the parent node

12129331
versioning	upgrade
if i simply upload the versioning that i had locally which i upgrade with the periodic updates -- then i will lose the files database changes made by the worker on the cloud versioning of the previous versioning

12129341
switching	screens
after switching the screens resolution to 1024 x 768 the blinking is gone and the animation works fine

12129403
google-chrome	firefox
so looking at your intention it seems that google-chrome gets the hit area right but both firefox and google-chrome are rendering it wrong

12129459
children	parent
the children of the parent node that are to the left of the hole left the path further up up and the children of the parent node that are to the right of the hole right

12129478
g++	gcc
i tried overwriting the default g++ gcc boost version like this

12129554
int	chars
why is it int instead of unsigned chars

12129559
post	get
i ve looked at several resources which i ll post below mercilessly copy pasted code and the closest i can get is one of two situations

12129580
int	chars
with the cast to int the expression is first converted to int then to unsigned chars

12129942
cos	sin
two you want the sources to match the c++ standardâ s specification for declaring sin and cos

12129942
cos	sin
otherwise you may have to modify the sources to wrap the sin and cos definitions inside the std namespace or otherwise modify the sources

12129942
cos	sin
you can simply compile the source file s containing sin and cos to produce an object module or modules then link that object module or modules with your other object modules

12129942
cos	sin
if you wish you can instead create a library put the object module s with sin and cos into the library and link the library with your object modules

12129942
cos	sin
another note about linking when you supply your own sin and cos the linker has two implementations to choose from your implementations of sin and cos and the standard library implementations of sin and cos

12129942
cos	sin
usually standard libraries are linked in after any user-specified files so merely specifying your object module or library will suffice to ensure your sin and cos are used not the libraryâ s sin and cos

12129947

12131975

if not defined temp set temp tmp

12132033

width	margin
therefore i was wondering if the margin is affected by the document layout and if it only takes the width of the containing element

12133222
width	height
yes even though it may seem counter-intuitive vertical percentage margins are relative to the width of the containing element not the height

12133223

vagrantfile	berksfile
i ve included some snippets from my setup there s more to the berksfile and vagrantfile of course but these are the relevant bits. the only truly tricky part is that the local name of the chef-rbenv cookbook has to be rbenv if you want to use any of the off-the-shelf recipes that include other off-the-shelf recipes from the cookbook as it refers to itself as rbenv

12133317

dictionary	map
this gets to the crux of why we map database values as python objects so that they can have interesting behaviors instead of just as dictionary s which are merely bags of attributes

12133925
post	get
use wp query or get post instead

12133927
disk	ram
first if your data is relatively small and your queries are simple save yourself some hassle and make sure you re querying from ram instead of disk

12133927

this is generally okay for value-types like int double float and even for immutable reference types like string

12134085
public	protected	inherited	properties
in first case when you use class it s inform xcode that you will be using coredataclass somewhere and you will #import header for example in .m file in second case you re inherited from coredataclass you will get access to all public and protected properties

the hours control the height and the minutes rounded to the nearest five control the width

12134299
width	height
i have put a test alert to show me the text it should be putting into the window.open method and this looks fine - in fact if i copy and paste the text from the alert into the code and re-load the page then the height and width both work perfectly

12134328
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc

12134328
realloc	malloc
the function realloc only works correctly for null or values obtained from malloc realloc

12134333

if realloc doesn t get a null it will try to expand memory starting from that location or may try to free and malloc another part of memory

12134411
button	checkbox
i have a few checkbox some already checked through html checked attribute on a page and a submit button

nginx is a lightweight webserver that can act as a replacement for the ubiquitous apache webserver

12134583
realloc	malloc
there are those who argue it is better to use malloc for the initial allocation and realloc thereafter

12134583
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
there is some justice to the suggestion not least because you probably wouldn t use to free the memory even though you could do so so you don t really need malloc or free because realloc can do all three operations

12134583
realloc	malloc
but the c90 standard requires realloc 0 new_size to work equivalently to malloc new_size and i know of no c library that behaves differently but there might be some

12134589
getter	setter
such code also has an abundance of getter and setter because the data objects are too dumb to do anything by themselves

12134590

3 for sandbox solution i saw this but the major question is that i have something like a virtual disk and when user ask to list a directory this operation will ask a server what files this user has in this folder

12135401
google-chrome	firefox
the code above which works very well in google-chrome will not remove the cookies in firefox 14.0.1

bluetooth	usb
plug in your usb bluetooth dongle

12135445
google-chrome	firefox
hard to explain why google-chrome is unsetting the cookie but it s google-chrome s behavior that appears to be aberrant not that of firefox

12135445
client-side	server-side
storing that info on the server-side is probably more common with the client-side only given his the session cookie

12135451
getter	setter
i would then make setter getter for all the relevent information you need to get and update

12135472

the includes for maven-surefire-plugin are defined like test testcase whereas maven-failsafe-plugin are defined with it.java it .java or itcase.java

12136905
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
so you don t need to define includes for maven-surefire-plugin or maven-failsafe-plugin use the defaults

12136956

it may be because the table field is declared as transient so that it s not part of the persistent state of the hashmap object

12137629
min	max
if your answer is 1 the solution is pretty straightforward a greedy search for all numbers whose length is the same as your min and less than or equal to your max you can then parse the matches and filter based on the min and max ...if its one of the others then your solution is going to be a bit more complicated you are basically going to have to create a sliding window to evaluate all the possible combinations in the string

12137711

12137751
getter	setter
as long you are sure you have no costumized getter setter both is the same with a very small performance penalty for getter setter

12137751
getter	setter
however in general you should use the getter setter approach except in getter setter themself in case you will change your code later

12137756
width	height
or else if you want to remove a part of an image you can use either g.clip shape or g.cliprect x y width height which will remove a rectangle

if you want to load the library dynamically from your code have a look at the functions dlopen 3 and dlsym 3

12138504

12139450
folder	directory
using it you can try to zip folder in the main directory ie

12139459
16-bit	64bit
at first i thought this is because you cannot call 32-bit dlls from 64bit processes unlike the 16 32-bit case where you had thunking between 16-bit and 32-bit and vice versa there is no such thunking in the 32 64bit case

12139506
children	parent
for multi-depth inheritance ie tablec inherits tableb inherits tablea you have to extend that via a recursive cte or a loop in pl pgsql using the children of the last loop as parent in the next

12139833
awt	swing
from paintng in awt swing

12139833

will it affect my data on server if i change mysql engine from myisam to innodb

12140103
qtcpsocket	qiodevice
however this rate controller is operating on qtcpsockets to be exact on peerwireclients so you need to change the type of the peers to be qiodevice which i hope isn t that hard since peerwireclient inherits from qtcpsocket which itself inherits from qiodevice

12140103
post	get
the methods get and post return a which you can also just add to the rate controller

12140152

flac	ogg
at least if you want to be able to add support for less common formats like flac ogg mod sid.

12140178
hash	salt
besides the actual hashing phpass transparently generates random salt when a new password or passphrase is hash and it encodes the hash type the salt and the password stretching iteration count into the hash encoding string that it returns

12140178
hash	salt
when phpass authenticates a password or passphrase against a stored hash it similarly transparently extracts and uses the hash type identifier the salt and the iteration count out of the hash encoding string

12140178
hash	salt
so if a understood correctly phpass stores the salt used in the same hash so it is able to use it when comparing passwords and check if valid

12140178
hash	salt
if the hash is compromised the attacker has the salt used to hash the password.

12140188

but somehow firefox and google-chrome positioning background images differently

12140230
hash	salt
if i understand correctly salt are primarily used to thwart precomputed hash rainbow tables attacks

12140245
hash	salt
therefore in practice when the attacker gets the password hash he s typically also able to get the salt anyway

12140257
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
look only the border-radius property is supported in ie9+ firefox 4+ google-chrome safari 5+ and opera

12140268
hash	salt
a salt is not meant to be secret instead a salt works by by making sure the hash result unique to each used instance

12140268
hash	salt
this is done by picking a different random salt value for each computed hash

12140269
int	double
there are plenty of kalman filter implementations where developers simply use vectors and matrices of int floats double etc but i d like to keep track of dimension of every values used and then the issue appeared

hash	md5
i want to calculate md5 or other file hash rfc 1321 conform within matlab using the java-security-implementations

accelerometer	gyroscope
i have read many tutorials and examples and i made sample applications but the amount of data i get back from both the gyroscope and the accelerometer are overwhelming

12140521
accelerometer	gyroscope
would i be better off using just the accelerometer just the gyroscope or would i need both

12140563
min	max
this solution uses only one if else statement and max min functions for the rest

12140576
mouse	keyboard
however if you want to catch the change occurring as it happens then you will need to subscribe to a variety of events to handle both keyboard input and mouse input as well the case where the user might paste something into the textbox

12140613

12140936
int	chars
the expression points to a function taking an int while the function is defined as taking a chars

12140936
int	chars
the case with variables is also undefined behavior because you are reading or assigning an int to from chars

12140988
int	chars
in your case the chars parameter might be passed as an int like in a register or even on the stack to keep alignment or whatever

12144654
bindparam	bindvalue	bindparam	pdostatement	pdostatement	bindvalue
if you don t need the ability to keep the variable in sync with the bound parameter before the query is executed which is the case 99.9 of the time in my experience it s probably better to simply use pdostatement bindvalue instead of pdostatement bindparam

12144675

the way i implemented a process to gui when i had unfortunately not thought about the design to include the gui was to use a posix threaded process one to run the code for the application and one for the gui with global variables hacky shared by the parent parent ran the two children processes in a one-way manner to avoid a race condition cropping up so one variable would be write for process read for gui and another would be read for process write for gui

some calloc implementations just call malloc and memset internally so there s no advantage other than a potential overflow check

width	height
the first one is defined by the viewbox which contains x and y coordinates for the top-left corner and a width and a height

12163888
width	height
the second one is defined using the width and height attributes or style properties

12163888
width	height
then since you want the image to be displayed as 50mm wide and 25mm high you set the width and height accordingly

12163888
width	height
for browsers if you re defining the viewbox you don t need to specify the width and height explicitly since by default the area defined in the viewbox is displayed pixel per pixel

12163975

google-chrome	firefox
after inspecting the test in ie 8 9 and seeing its results look like those of firefox i think there s an explanation for the google-chrome results i m pretty sure google-chrome webkit has a better optimization in the first version of the test especially the parseint part which gives a better result for parseint there

12164494
int	chars
the compiler interprets unsigned as unsigned int you should specify unsigned chars like this

for example in opera and firefox images loading very quickly about 1 sec in ie about 3 sec but in google-chrome it is loading very slow

12164519

because it looks like you really want unsigned int as your type instead of unsigtned chars

12170261
width	height
user selects a width of 4 and a height of 2 then sends the form

i ve tried everything from isnull ifnull coalesce to set the value of sum count to 0 which i think the reason why the table generated is empty but still can t generate the data

12171865
getter	setter
i have getter setter method for the file object and i have set file in the pojo object which i get as result

12171914

12172076
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box

12172137
hash	salt
however i felt that all the passwords are still dehashable with access to both the hash and the salt

12172193
getter	setter
with that said your code is partially encapsulated as you have a private int with a public getter and setter and a private getter which i see no purpose in but that s up to you

12172193
getter	setter
however string name is public and has no getter or setter

12172193
subclass	abstract-class
when modifying a method which must be in an abstract-class the modifier denotes that the abstract method must be defined in any subclass implementation

12172261
getter	setter
also the idea behind having getter setter combo is to provide a controlled way of accessing the properties of that class

12172261
getter	setter
so for each private property of a class you would would have public setter and getter method

12172281
setinterval	clearinterval
as you re using setinterval for repeating time so to clear that timer you need to use clearinterval

12172294
getter	setter
the current interface looks like getter setter of an integer value

fadein	fadeout
on the other hand fadeout and fadein execute asynchronously meaning that the next statement may execute before the effect has completed

12184512
fadein	fadeout
this is why the fadeout and fadein functions need callbacks to execute when the effect has completed

not every sql rdbms has this restriction though it is a always requirement that what is ordered by be either an aggregate-functions of the non-grouped columns avg sum etc or one of the columns grouped by or functions upon more than one of those results like adding two columns because this is a logical requirement of the result of the grouping operation

if all you want to do is crop a tenth off the left and top simply subtract the offsets from the original width height

12185383

firefox	safari
increasing the padding size of the svg elements prevents the cutting off of the tick labels in safari 6.0 but not firefox 13.0.1

12185761
firefox	safari
safari and firefox are styling links by snagging the url via attribute selectors check in web inspector for specifics but i m guessing it s something like this which you can override by setting

margin	height
with flexibleheight and flexibletop it means that when the parent view frame changes it will maintain the bottom 100 pixels fixed and split the remainder proportionally between the top margin and height

12186039
margin	height
so if you go from 400 height to 300 height on the parent it means it will use 100 for the bottom margin and split the remainder 200 proportionally leaving your y 66.666 and height 133.333

12186039
margin	height
if you go from 400 height to 100 height it will still use those 100 for the bottom margin leaving 0 space for top margin and height leaving your y 0 height 0

hash	md5
my local file has an md5 hash of 702242d3703818ddefe6bf7da2bed757

12187216
background-color	transparency	background-color	outline
defining a background-color will prevent the black outline artifact from occurring and including the dximagetransform.microsoft.chroma as part of your filter will make anything in the element which has that color transparency

12187216
background-color	transparency
it is important to not choose a background-color which will match any content color or this will be made transparency as well

12187232
getter	setter
i have read some about the use of getter setter in object oriented programming and many resources such as this suggest that they should be used very infrequently

setting this option will fake put and delete requests with a http post setting the x-http-method-override header with the true method

i m basically trying to create an md5 hash of input parameters sorted in alpha order per the fastspring api

12187495
getter	setter
that article is describing that you should use methods instead of property getter setter

12187495
getter	setter
properties with both getter and setter provide an interface that both update state and query state

12187495
getter	setter
one of the other problems with properties is that people habitually add both getter and setter simply because it is a property

12187495
getter	setter
the ability to get or set a property may not be necessary and simply adding both a getter and a setter by rote creates and interface that requires testing and maintenance that may not ever be needed

12187505
put	get
it is better to get the value once and put it into some temporary variable

12187509

i ve seen several examples of writing an http proxy in ruby this gist by torsten becker but how would i extend it to handle https aka for a man in the middle ssl proxy

i have a music blog and would like to duplicate all my post to facebook but i can t get the api to post streaming audio like i can when i post manually

12187577

12187646
width	height
lets say you want to shrink your bitmaps width to 1 2 and increase its height to 2 times of the original

12187646
width	height
now if you have another your actual scaled bitmap or an imageview what you want to compare to the original then you can use this to get the width and height use getwidth and getheight

12187653
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are supplied by browsers outside of the proper javascript language which provides an external means of access to the language like event execution

12187681

how can i still use url framing and get the window size to be the width height of my phone

12187759
post	get
the main concept of this code that i made a page where you can rate a thing and that thing has got hidden values that i need to get in post format because this is the only way that i can decide which button has been pressed to do the mysql query in the second php file without refreshing the current one

12187769
int	chars
the try-catch is pretty important because the string could contain chars that cannot convert to int ofc you need to catch it better than this but keep it in mind

12187933
hash	salt
i felt that all the passwords are still dehashable with access to both the hash and the salt

12187933
hash	salt
salt slows this attack down in that it has to be done separately for every password instead of pre-calculated over all at once but modern hardware can calculate hash so fast now that this doesn t have the deterrent value it once did

12187947
serializable	deserialization
is a popular networking framework that has json serializable deserialization built in

12187947
serializable	deserialization
the core data base object has an associated with it which has the method which should make it easy to write serializable deserialization methods without having to write explicit code for every class and attribute

12187947
serializable	deserialization
i find core data to be heavy and complex for most of my needs and typically write local storage and serializable deserialization using the protocol

12188006
getter	setter
i have seen some projects jsoup for example are using this new getter setter naming convention

12188006
getter	setter
instead of old getter setter convetion

12188031
getter	setter
without getting into a discussion about when if to use getter setter in general it s better to stick with the naming convention because there are fewer surprises that way especially when you re integrating with third-party libraries or frameworks that expect things to be named according to convention

comparator	comparable
in classes that implement ievaluator i get the following warning when calling comparator on the values of map type safety the method comparator object belongs to the raw type comparable

12188183
comparator	comparable
similarly the ievaluator instance does not need to know anything about results that is evaluating except that they are of the same type and that they are comparable ievaluator implemetations need to be able to call the comparator method.

12188222
put	get
but these functions get put and del still need to access the common objects functions found in a so i need a reference to a but i don t know how this can be achieved

also you need to declare public setter getter you just can t get set any private variables that you have in your code

12188330
tostring	string.format
string.format doesn t complain if you pass it too many arguments so i could probably just pass a big array of integers which could get unboxed to d or tostring ed to s and look for format exceptions

12188652
ssl	https
just for background information a normal http proxy handles https requests via the connect method it reads the host name and port establishes a tcp connection to this target server on this port returns 200 ok and then merely tunnels that tcp connection to the initial client the fact that ssl tls is exchanged on top of that tcp connection is barely relevant

12195770
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box is most useful when you can t specify an exact content width based on the margins borders and padding of a box because you don t know in advance and can t control what these values are

12195770
width	border-box
in your first example if you didn t know how much padding was in the box or how thick its borders were making it use the border-box model allows you to just set width 50 to ensure that the box will always take up 50 width of its container regardless of borders and padding

12195780
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
in the first example you re setting width to 50 plus some border but due to the presence of the property box-sizing border-box

12195780
box-sizing	border-box
without box-sizing border-box

12195783
primes	modulus
for a 32-bit modulus the question is a bit academic your primary aim in choosing p and q is to make the product hard to factorize but finding the primes factorisation of a number smaller than 2 32 is so easy that there s little point worrying about the sizes of p and q in this case

12195783
primes	modulus
for something more realistic like a 1024-bit modulus then yes you re pretty safe choosing two 512-bit primes p and q at random that is choose p and q uniformly from the set of all primes in the range

12195783
primes	modulus
of course if you do choose two 512-bit primes you ll end up with either a 1023-bit or a 1024-bit modulus

12195825

children	parent
in you test case the list is empty you don t add the children to the parent you only set the back-reference in the children to the parent

12195954
children	parent
if it is stored what it is doing now nh clears the list in the database and removes the children from the parent

12196033

beanstalk	amazon-web-services
following examples and tutorials for getting a php application up and running with amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk and getting errors when i try to push

12196206
getter	setter
it also lets you offer a getter while not offering any setter then your field is read only from outside the class

12196226

actually when we use padding in our div elements on vertical and horizontal basis its add the padding in total width and height

12196233

what you can do is define getter and setter methods

12196235
background-image	background-size
as we all know using background-size cover makes the background-image automatically scale perfectly on the browser s viewport

12196256

i have seen mozilla firefox or google-chrome doing the above without any issues

12196361

textview	imageview
where custom_ab.xml is a layout with your imageview spinner and textview for the count

pains me to post this i cannot get it and been at it for sometime

12196486
imperative	declarative
here s an analogy to get you started on declarative vs imperative

12196486
imperative	declarative
although this is almost exactly how you would solve this particular problem in an imperative programming language we re talking about styles of calculator just now and the first way of doing it with the old calculator is much more imperative step-by-step in style and this with the new calculator is in a much more declarative just-say-what-you-mean style

12196486
imperative	declarative
these aren t examples of imperative or declarative code but an attempt to show you the differences in style of thinking and programming

12196486
imperative	declarative
i ve talked about trust because someone who read a draft of this said trust was important - she explains she uses the calculator the imperative way because she doesn t really trust it if she does it in the declarative way

12196486
imperative	declarative
it sounds from this that it would be much easier to use declarative styles all the time but there s usually a steep learning curve for declarative languages and most people prefer imperative

12196486
imperative	declarative
traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though they re imperative

12196505
mouseleave	mouseenter
nb hover isn t a valid javascript event too it s a jquery one so it needs 2 functions one for the mouseenter event and the second for the mouseleave so you should use mouseenter instead

12196511
width	height
1 first am calculating the width and height of the phone

12196513
width	height
and i want it to increase its width and height respectively but origin should have from center

12196520
put	get
does anyone know of a way to get data from a csv file then put it into an array which i can pass via ajax to my webservice

i did a lot of research regarding transferring a custom sound clip wav mp3 etc to an ongoing gsm voice call in android so that the other party can hear it but it seems it cannot be done

12196618
width	height
right now i would only suggest adding some layout attributes like width and height to your viewpager

12196622
width	height
you can increase the width height as per your requirement image will come in the center

12196631
getter	setter
seems you declared priority as long and getter and setter methods are using float

12196661
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
the above three methods used to get argument which are necessary for connection such as sqlcommand cmd sqlconnection conn sqltransaction trans commandtype cmdtype

12196700

12196704
lisp	smalltalk
in some languages lisp smalltalk this is a non-issue

12196765
width	height
when we increase image width while increasing the top - left corner of image remains constant and width increases towards right corner same height increases towards bottom

12197001

use line or plane to create an interlaced png or gif or progressive jpeg image

12197013
width	height
window.open formpopup width 400 height 400 resizeable scrollbars

12197043
google-chrome	firefox
this may be simple way to know that the browser is not using ie google-chrome or firefox

12197072
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
sometimes opera still uses the old and cached style which means that you should avoid opera and use google-chrome mozilla or safari

12197072
google-chrome	safari
reload f5 will be sufficient on google-chrome mozilla or safari

12197084
textview	imageview
i have to display video image title and description for which i have created a layout with an imageview and two textview .i am able to display the video list

12197085
actionscript	mxml
additionally it becomes much more readable and there s no mix of actionscript and mxml

12197085
actionscript	mxml
because your collection is declared as public it makes difference whether to use actionscript with or using mxml

12197085
actionscript	mxml
btw a general recommendation for cleaner code is to separate actionscript completely from mxml

12197085
actionscript	mxml
for instance in my projects i create a separate actionscript file for each mxml component in the form

12197109

are getter and setter evil

12197343
getter	setter
why use getter and setter

12197343
getter	setter
i ve been asking myself this for awhile but why do we actually use getter and setter methods

12197381
getter	setter
getter and setter are abstraction wrappers around your object implementations

12197381
getter	setter
also getter without setter allow you to create read-only properties and protect internal members of the class from inadvertent and possibly destructive modification

12197405
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are accessor methods meaning that they are generally a public interface to change private class members

12197405
getter	setter
you use getter and setter methods to define a property

12197405
getter	setter
you access getter and setter methods as properties outside the class even though you define them within the class as methods

12197405
getter	setter
there are some advantages to using getter and setter methods such as the ability to let you create members with sophisticated functionality that you can access like properties

12197405
getter	setter
even though getter and setter methods are useful you should be careful not to overuse them because among other issues they can make code maintenance more difficult in certain situations

12197414
width	height
problem is that i don t have control over dialog dimensions dialog s width and height seem to depend on contained image ones...not to mention top right left bottom margins.

12197414

even though getter and setter methods are useful you should be careful not to overuse them because among other issues they can make code maintenance more difficult in certain situations

12197488
getter	setter
when you write classes you are always encouraged to make as many as possible of your instance variables private and add getter and setter methods accordingly

12197488
getter	setter
in this situation you might create a private instance variable and allow a getter method only for the counter variable which means users are able to retrieve the current value only by using the getter method and they won t be able to set new values using the setter method

12197488
getter	setter
creating a getter without a setter is a simple way of making certain variables in your class read-only

12199408
getter	setter
i certainly concur with the other commenters that you should really have getter and setter functions for this but i also understand that developers often have limited power to control and change the world they live in

12199423
hide	show
and since we call methods within that to actually hide and show the tab bar we need to define those methods in our .m file as well

12202471

when we re very likely to care about some other way of considering two objects of a type to be equivalent we override equals to make use of it and gethashcode to correspond

12202471
equals	gethashcode
with value types we start with both equals and gethashcode referring to a field-by-field comparison because that s the most discriminating view of equality that makes any logical sense with value types

sorting	filtering
therefore mysql cannot use the simple index that you have defined on col_1 for finding max col_1 when you are applying a filtering it must instead scan all matching rows albeit it can do this in descending order of col_1 by sorting upon that simple index as would be shown by the explain output for your query

this probably is a bug in the framework and this happens when the extjs renders the application before the browser populates mayb the correct window.innerwidth and window.innerheight and thus the viewport cannot take the correct width and height

12205226
width	height
i poll for the correct height and width of the browser for around a sec after every say 100ms for the correct height and width of the window and if i find that the height or width of the viewport isnt same i re adjust it

12205226

with this if you think this app might be used on devices where the window height and width would be changed by the user like that of mobile browser when the orientation changes or if you think user would change the height and width of the browser window

this would get all the post of a single user and then you would have a field that contains the id of the next post

innodb	myisam
if you choose to use myisam you can not only archive completed years using myisampack but can also replace your original table with a merge one comprising the union of all of your underlying year tables an alternative that would also work in innodb would be to create a view but it would only be useful for select statements as union views are neither updatable nor insertable

profiling	debugging
this was hard to debugging because a it was not straightforward to replicate b profiling with xdebug did not help c stepping through the code with xdebug + dbgp was not helping either d almost no trace no pun intended was left other than very ocasionally logging the errors to the php error_log file and e with a custom exception handler it was not obvious to suspect of xdebug since i didn t involve it in the process of handling the exception or so i thought

when i draw an image in a canvas i have to specify the canvas width and height so it matches with the image size that im trying to paint

12207159
width	height

12207327
width	height	width	margin	margin	height	actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth and actualheight represent the calculated width height after the layout system has finished calculating the size of a control based on values such as margin horizontalalignment etc.

12207327
actualheight	actualwidth
one way to get the size of a control taking into account all of the scale transformations that have been applied to it is to walk up the visual tree and apply all scale transforms to the actualwidth and actualheight of a control

12207349
actualheight	actualwidth
em1 make sure you are checking the actualwidth and actualheight of the canvas after your content has finished loading after the loaded event has been raised

you don t necessarily need to specify the canvas width and height

width	height
i have learned that the proper way to set a uitableview that covers up the whole main view full width and full height in a single view app is in viewdidload

12207633
width	height
so i thought the idea is don t worry the width and height not being correct because the uiviewautoresizingflexiblewidth and uiviewautoresizingflexibleheight will take care of setting the correct width and size automatically

12207633
width	height
the width and height can be set incorrectly but it must be incorrectly at

int string and double do implement the comparable interface but in a generic way int implements string implements etc.

12212876

specifying comparable as a common interface also gives the false suggestion that you can sort the array which is false since the different comparator can t cooperate

12212886
comparator	comparable
if you use the comparator method directly or not for example by sorting your array take comparable

12212886
int	double
but note that you rarely have to store in an array strings double and int

12212891
int	double
maybe because comparable extends int strings double etc

12212893
filtering	grouping
we did this in one of our projects to provide users the flexibility to filtering sort grouping on any attributes of the underlying data model and this approach works really well

12212898
children	parent
the children will inherit those supported orientations from the parent

12212916
comparator	comparable
- moreover comparable is good when you need to sort only according to one parameters but it would be good to use comparator when you want to sort in more than one way..

12212925
versioning	upgrade
my solutions are upgrade from previous versioning to vs2010

12212941
int	chars
this is a program in which line no 4 generate a compilation error possible loss of precision required chars find int

12212962
int	double
i m trying to create an extension method for string that says whether the string is a valid int double bool or decimal

12212986
put	get
when i get the response the variable is always undefined unless i put something like an alert after the response...then the variable contains my value

12213009
int	chars
the reason of the error is that chars is 2 bytes and int is 4 bytes

12213009
int	chars
you have to make an explicit cast from int to chars

12213041
int	chars
in both cases you are requesting a conversion from a signed 32-bit int into an unsigned 16-bit chars

12213041
int	chars
in this line the compiler only knows you are converting some int value to a chars so it doesn t know for sure it can fit

12213055
iscsi	cifs
cloud storage has multiple types of cloud data storage interfaces that are able to support both legacy and new applications.to work with these interfaces existing standard protocols such as iscsi and others for block and cifs nfs or webdav for file network storage etc

12213068
getter	setter
getter and setter

12213068
getter	setter
an entity can contain getter setter adders behavior and business rules recommended .

12213070
int	chars
loss of precision means that int has a larger value and chars is smaller so you can t fit something which is to large for that space

12213070
int	chars
you need to type cast the int into chars but still the precision will be lost because you just can t fit int into chars but if the int value is smaller than loss precision can be ignored

12213094
int	chars
line 4 fails because it says that if you try to assign a 4-bytes value int to a 2-byte location chars it needs a cast

12213116
pop-up	dialog
i don t even get a pop-up warning dialog in internet explorer

12213157
tinyint	varchar
generally i choose int or tinyint for that but if i choose varchar it will be more clear while seeing data directly from the database table or while querying it

12213159
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and ie just put it on minium height

12213172
int	chars
here int is higher datatype and chars is lower datatype.

12213172
int	chars
i+1 evaluates to int result which cannot be fit into chars type

12213277
post	get
the same categories and sub-categories i want in videos tab.like what i want is i would assign some videos post to the same category and some normal post to the same category.when i go on the site and come from recipes tab and click some category can we get the value of parent tab menu that we are clicking this category and coming from that tab

12213303
hide	show
there is no way to show hide three-dot menu indicator for a single activity

g++	gcc
i am trying to link a static third party library compiled with rvct 2.2 with a test program compiled with gcc arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc sourcery g++ lite 2011.03-41

12213372
memcpy	memset
both memcpy and memset should be present in libc

12213384
int	double
note pow returns a double so the best way to avoid such problem is to make a double not int

12213397
ceil	floor	int	double
you need to use ceil to round double value to the int just assigning is the same as floor - it s truncating fractions part of floating point double number in your case positive number

12213397
ceil	floor
you may also find useful to get mathematical rounding - floor x + 0.5 for positive x ceil x - 0.5 for negative one

12213401
button	checkbox
i need to block all checkbox s when click in one button

12213415

hide	show
so my question is that i want to add animation of toggling behavior when it hide or show for this

12213492
client-side	server-side
server-side works fine but there is a problem on client-side after adding signature some new ws-security elements are always added and signature becomes incorrect

12213511
getter	setter
i would suggest you to have a private variable for inputstream type inputstream and public getter and setter for it in your action class which is missing

12213515
wordpress	joomla
as wcms i will probably use wordpress drupal joomla

12213555
post	get
the form will still get submitted but you won t be able to get the post values when the form has been submitted

12213565
put	get
this makes your password field a max of 8 digits and if only 4 are given it is padded with zeros if you get a number 1234 to put in the database the cell will fill it to 00001234

12213576
prepare	execute
i have a prepare statement and this statement is execute on every loop

12213584
folder	directory
simply give path of that folder.suppose the upload folder in the same directory of your uploading file script than you have to do just like that

12213590
width	height
after some basic trigonometry we got a camera position which works when the height width

12213590
width	height
but it does not when the width height

12213617
free	malloc
i don t know the answer but as c++ evolved from c a lot of code in c used malloc free as there was no other way to do it and so it carried over to c++ as new delete

12213624
getter	setter
in our project properties getter setter are already quite self-descriptive so we don t see the reason to add javadoc for those

12213624
getter	setter
so i was wondering is it possible to disable javadoc check code inspection declaration has javadoc problems only for getter setter and leave it for the other methods in intellij idea

12213694
pop-up	dialog
however you really don t need to do this if all you want to do si supress js dialog pop-up messages

12213787
post	get
there are two ways to get like the like button after each post either you have to add this script underneath the post query

12213803
opera	google-chrome
also it causes flickering in opera and google-chrome so you ll need to detect ie so you only reset the fill if running in ie

12213823
hide	show
but why not use just normal stack or grid panel and when use visiblity when you want to hide or show it

12213844
hide	show
clicking on a country name will show hide all it s regions and their las

12213844
hide	show
what i can t work out how to fix is that the same method on the country level does not work as it hide the region as expected but it show the hidden las as it s just using a toogle

12213844
hide	show
any ideas on how to make clicking on the country name hide the regions and their las regardless of whether the la row is show or hidden

12213859
inherited	properties
i should mention that probably is possible to trycast to a generic control instead of specific panel or label because backcolor is a properties inherited from the base class control

12213862
inherited	properties
if you don t check hasownproperty you ll end up with properties inherited from object

12213894
super	implements
problem is resolved by implements messagelistener on topicsubscriper as well even if the super class got it

12213935
int	double
best would be to store the return value of pow as a double or float not as an int

12213953
typedef	struct
usually you can create variables with struct bla and s_bla created by typedef struct bla s_bla and exchange these values among each other

12213953
typedef	struct
if it would be possible to alter the struct by using typedef this coherence will break.

12213973

12214756
folder	directory
you can set directory listing to false for the folder you want to protect from direct access

12214795

it may lead to this kind of problems when the bean is in a too broad scope and or when you re doing wrong things in the getter setter of that attribute

12214827
jlist	jtable
my problem is that on top of the drawing a jtable jlist as well as other components are also placed

getter	setter
realistically you are allowed to add most anything you want within a propeties getter and setter

12214863
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
i will use argumentexception or nullreferenceexception in cases where i have to account for values in the property that will break the code but otherwise if it needs an exception or i call a method that could result in an exception unrelated to the property itself then method is better

12214867
int	chars	int	boolean
here it just uses a chars as a boolean but i m after a solution that would take multiple int etc

12214873
post	get
i m using code similar to response 3 of the post however i only get the login screen nothing asks for google drive permissions

12214902
jlabel	jviewport
you have to use swing timer for moving with icon in the jlabel placed into jxlayer glasspane or jviewport don t use runnable#thread and never not by using plain thread.sleep int

12214942
system.in	system.out
the problem in this particular case is going to be in setting up the system.in and system.out streams so that you can talk to the child application running in the same jvm

12214972
disk	ram
the high ram usage is due to the number of images 360 which even on disk would occupy at least 266mb as dikei pointed out and you have to consider that images are represented as pygame objects thus using more memory than a raw bitmap

12215017
stdout	stderr
when most processes are started they are given three open file descriptors to begin with stdin 0 stdout 1 and stderr 2

free	malloc
the code critically depends on the implementation of malloc and free

12215759
free	malloc
it s definitely easier to create a working dll implementation of malloc and free but it s far from impossible to do so in a static library

12215773
memcpy	memset
a workaround for this could be to implement your own versions of these using the libc memcpy and memset but it may also be that there are more subtle linking issues going on here that could trip you up further on

thus the instructions were rendered in the same place regardless of the phone been in portrait reversed portrait landscape or revered landscape

12216148
screens	tablet
so as you can see in the code below i check for tablet large screens and minus the extra 90 degrees

12216148
portrait	landscape
in portrait it returns 0 but i detect it as a tablet so minus 90 degree thus the result is 270 and it places my instructions as if the tablet was in landscape mode

12216148
portrait	landscape
i assume the reasoning behind this is the xoom transformer was designed to be used in landscape and the nexus in portrait but unless i know about all the devices affected this doesn t help

12216148
portrait	landscape
is there a reliable way to detect the orientation across all devices and return the results in realtime as in the code below but taking into accoutn the default orientation of the device phones + nexus 7 are portrait but most tablets are landscape

12216176
ireport	subreports
when i compile the report including subreports with ireport it compile ok so i think is not a compilation problem

12216480
implements	extends
what concerning final as long as interfaces contain only methods given an abstract class a which implements an interface with a method foo and an ordinary class b which extends the abstract class a cannot the class b override the foo method

12216531
getter	setter
but you will get som false positives methods declared in block comments and you also has to consider getter and setter

12216555
scala	typesafe
i m eager to get into scala through the typesafe stack but cannot get it up and running on freebsd 9.0 stable

12216560
width	height
i don t know why after rotation the width and height haven t updated i m assuming your rotation happens before loading the view otherwise the printed out bounds are exactly what you should expect but i have noticed this as well after rotation

12216562

12216590
inherited	properties
use can inherited from documentpanel if you need the tag properties for more encapsulation

12216631
uiview	subviews
i have created one diagonal uiview with eight subviews at all corner and center of the all four edges

12216663
spaces	delimiter
the command line interpretor is regarding the spaces between program and files as a delimiter

my first thought was to try the show or hide based on an expression option under visibility in the row group s properties results grouped by isopen

12216712
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

12216717
mongodb	bson
i have some numpy arrays that are are pickled and stored in mongodb using the bson module

12216726
accessor	properties
however i also get listed the compiler-generated properties accessor if the interface has a properties

12216726
accessor	properties
i would like to differentiate between explicitly-defined methods and properties accessor to omit the latter

12216735
backtracking	greedy
i thought that when i use atomic grouping aka nonbacktracking subexpressions then would match the last two double quotes of because the left alternative can match two double quotes and then result in an overall match fail as desired because the last of the regex is not present but the group seems like it wouldn t be greedy enough although having greedy quantifier and atomic grouping and still backtracking to the point after the very first of the regex as soon as it is noticed that the regex fails

12216738
pop-up	dialog
i pop-up a loading dialog step through the async task stuff and i guess expect to see the dynamic controls add to the layout one by one

12216759
client-side	server-side
whether or not a programming pattern can apply to more than one programming language even though one is client-side and another is server-side

12216773
post	get
richard is right g-wan does the parsing for you so jmain args contain the arguments of both get and post requests

12216773
post	get
there s nothing special to do on your end see the loan.java example which can be used in both modes get and post

12216794
accessor	properties
the specialname bit is set to flag members that are treated in a special way by some compilers such as properties accessor and operator overloading methods

12216885
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox everything works fine but in google-chrome for some reason the first card has a wrong direction for the animation

12216903
min	max
since you are grouping by prodid in the select list only prodid should be present if you want any other columns in the select list it should be given with aggregate finction like avg min max etc

12216903
min	max
usually group by is used with aggregate functions to get min max etc for each group in a table

12216969
ftp	smb
it s part of fuse-workspace which offers access to all kinds of resources like smb shares ftp server work in progress and audio cd s

12216969
mp3	ogg
so i guess that decode.encode this audio tracks to another format like mp3 or ogg is a good option

12216969
wav	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
convert a location in a mp3 or ogg file offset to a location in a wav file and vice versa

12216969
wav	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
convert a buffer offset from wav to buffer offset in mp3 ogg format

12216991
inherited	properties
if you set autopostback properties on the dropdownlist to true and viewstatemode to inherited you should get value you selected

12217014
for-loop	loops
which loops will exit on encountering the break statement the for-loop or the do while loops

12217017
for-loop	arrays
with this i plan to run a for-loop where as x increases it will go through each diff arrays and pull from the specified location

12217029
implements	extends
as i ve understood the deal the standard way of extends the user django model is by implements profiles

12217036
goto	break
if you want to break out of both loops use a label after the for and jump with goto

12217044
google-chrome	firefox
i m having some difficulty with css styles being aplied in internet explorer if you look at the site and view it in google-chrome saffari firefox etc

12217057

in your example the break will kill the do-while and control jumps back up to the for-loop and simply start up the next iteration of the for

12217088
getter	setter
create a private getter setter pair that transforms foomap into treefooadapter.maptype

12217213
yacc	bison
there is always lex and yacc or flex and bison

12217217
width	height
it will force the browser to make 16px 1em and that will enable me to do width and height properties by calculating desired pixels 16 right

12217229
getter	setter
create a singelton class that has the appropriate getter and setter for the items you want it to store

12217260
backbone.js	zepto
i m using backbone.js 0.9.2 underscore.js 1.3.3 and zepto 1.0

12217314
getter	setter
my other suggestion is to use the getter and setter even within your own code to ensure encapsulation

12217339
for-loop	arrays
you re inner-most for-loop only checks if the current random number is in the arrays

12217339
for-loop	loops
if all 10 are already used nothing will get stored in that slot of thus it will be 0 try adding a while loops around that and get rid of the extraneous outer-most for-loop

12217339
for-loop	loops
this is essentially replacing the middle for-loop the one that goes from i 0 to 9 with the while loops

12217343
put	get
put these two together to get

12217354
width	height
because you are not accounting for the height and width of your loading spinner hence it would be a little bit -less- than 50 top left

12217354
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
everyone beat me to the next part but yes you always divide 2 the height width of your div image etc and that make that negative top left margin

12217381
implements	extends
and make it only extends activity but i am just not sure how to implements this

12217402
debian	linux
i installed apache tomcat 7.0.29 on 32bit windows xp as well as on 64bit debian 6.0.5 linux and tried using the websocket examples

12217405
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview bound to an objectdatasource that returns some instances of mydto

12217421
portrait	landscape
the event works fine on iphone in landscape mode but in portrait mode it doesn t do anything

12217458
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
note that as of this post s writing iterator yield and array comprehensions are not yet supported in webkit browsers google-chrome safari and seem to only work on firefox s javascript engine google liberateme

12217473
children	parent
the only trick of this method is that once you declare a font size for an element all children elements have to have their em values based on that parent s value this is true of all relative units of measurement

12217480
google-chrome	firefox
k numbers in firefox where as in google-chrome it deals with k as a whole number 8258

12217487
getter	setter
here are the entities i use for versioning getter setter etc

12217507
freemarker	velocity
although restlet doesn t include a usual soap stack you can easily use freemarker velocity templates to send soap messages and xpath processing to extract valuable content from answers

12217510
portrait	landscape
this looks like it can be valid portrait but not in landscape making the problem right there

12217543
ant	maven
used to do it in ant but there is also a maven plugin as well

12217576
post	get
you can see my post here it shows you how to get directions from json instead of kml since it is not supported anymore

12217579
debian	linux
os debian linux

12217595
implements	extends
have countrysuggestbox extends composite or simply implements iswidget and wrap the suggestbox

12217644
free	malloc
memory is pretty limited so i can see why things like malloc may fail but not free

12217644
free	strcpy
to those asking why i was trying to print out an array i just free that was just there to show that the problem occurred after strcpy and rule out any other code that came after it

12217647
post	get
it is necessary to read directly from the input stream to get post data of any complexity

12217685
post	get
i cannot get my ajax call to post the fileloc and keep the dir structure intact

12217709
ember.js	batman.js
i looked at stuff like ember.js qooxdoo jquery batman.js kickstrap etc

12217773
for-loop	loops
but i need my if loops and my for-loop to work

12217778
int	boolean
i am targeting api level 15 so there is available a method expandgroup int grouppos boolean animate

12217836
cllocationmanager	clregion
just look for cllocationmanager clregion and the region monitoring methods associated with them

12217859
post	get
you could of course code up some ajax interface where the javascript goes off and makes a query to the server-side code to see if the post exists and then you ll get your answer back and act on it accordinglyâ but that seems really over-complicated for this problem

12217904
uiview	subviews
create a uiview that is a line then add it as a subviews to the cell

12217910
tablesorter	datatables
so if i use some table plug ins like datatables tablesorter etc. when i try to refresh the table styling paging etc. they ignore my new table row

12217927
free	malloc
you allocated 2 bytes too few in the first case and the copy overwrote some control information that malloc et al depend on so the free crashed because you had corrupted the memory it manages

12217942
websphere	ibm
really small message broker v1.1 alpha mosquitto the broker that comes with ibm websphere

12217950
websocket	pusher
as noted by daniil you d better use websocket eg pusher or slanger to communicate realtime messages

for a small zoom function i m using a toggle function to show and hide some divs

12217988
google-chrome	firefox
no one site offered clear guidance but taking what i learned from several i was able to piece together a function that handled this in firefox google-chrome and ie

12217999
int	boolean
you can create something like this in the standard ways using interface builder or programatically and then respond to any changed settings by saving nsuserdefaults objects int boolean urls

12217999
int	boolean
whichever method you choose add an observer for nsuserdefaultsdidchangenotification in any views that need to respond instantly to the change you can simply read the current value of the nsuserdefaults objects int boolean urls in real time if you don t need something to respond instantly

12218012
submit	submission
the other thing you might want to look at is the submit method if you intend to do more validation when the visitor clicks the submit button before you actually perform the submission

12218017
hide	show
state 2 and 4 create a view with a seperate .xib file and insert it onto the view stack they then both have a button that hide the view and show the search screen again

12218044
client-side	server-side
i ve been looking around at various template formats and am a little surprised that there are very few which have wide support for both server-side and client-side parsing

12218052
pop-up	dialog
i need to pop-up a modal dialog with a warning wait for the warning to be acknowledged and then forward to a constructed url

12218052
jquery	simplemodal

mdpi	hdpi
for hdpi your image needs to be 1.5 times bigger and for xhdpi devices 2.0 times the size of your mdpi

12218063
screens	mdpi
on a mdpi device screens density is about 1.5 dpi dots per inch which means that your 400px wide image will measure 2.5 inches

the pieces were in different folder of prjdata but prjdata was configured as a java project with as many source directory as needed

12218145
getter	setter
as well as when i do have a variable ratingcriteria1 it has a getter and setter

12218158
width	height
now if you reduce the height and width to 0 only the borders remain

12218158
width	height
if they are of different colors think of the intersection of the borders because there is no width or height they will be reduced to triangles

12218195
folder	directory
i m trying to open a directory that i would normally be prompted with you currently do not have permission to access this folder

12218202
google-chrome	firefox
i think this has to do with the fact that the style nodes on the original document do not get updated in google-chrome firefox when modifying the rules via javascript

12218212
folder	directory
i need to extract the contents of the zip to a folder called zips doesn t really matter just not same directory

right click and add reference visualstudio and sharpdevelop or edit references monodevelop and add in system.data.oracleclient.dll

12218268
gridview	formview
in the olden days before asp.net 4.5 we could easily bind a date to a gridview formview or other databound control and make it look presentable with a simple format string

12218276
google-chrome	firefox
a good tool to use to ensure syntax errors do not occur are google-chrome s web developer firefox s firebug or jslint

12218283
inherited	properties
make sure the object you binded to has the inotifypropertychanged interface inherited and that you are calling the public string properties which a notifyproperty event

12218286
nsstring	nsobject
basically i am receiving some funky encryption characters in std string form and storing them in the keychain as an nsstring since it has to be an nsobject of sorts i believe

12218332
postgresql	mysql
currently the system uses mssql but we want to be sure later we can switch to postgresql or mysql if needed

12218332
postgresql	mysql
what s a good approach to take with these reports so that without too much work i can make it work on mysql or postgresql

12218371
wookmark	masonry
i think that what you want is masonry or the wookmark jquery plugin

12218395
lxml	elementtree
i really think you should look into elementtree and for even more advanced stuff check out elementtree s superset lxml

12218437
uipangesturerecognizer	uipageviewcontroller
in some sort of way disable the uipangesturerecognizer in your uipageviewcontroller

12218437
uipangesturerecognizer	uipageviewcontroller
in some sort of way disable the uipangesturerecognizer in your uipageviewcontroller

12218438
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for google-chrome but in firefox it downloads the file as xxx.xls.part and doesnot work for internet explorer

12218438
apache-poi	jxls
note 2 i have a constrain that i can t use any external libraries such as apache-poi or jxls

12218509

12218525
rss	feed
i m trying to work with an rss feed i ve created

12218525
rss	feed
the rss feed looks like this

12218561
folder	directory
if you add the file into the src folder in your netbeans project directory then it should be automatically placed in the same relative position in the dist folder and any jar you build

12218594
folder	directory
create a packages folder off of the directory where the solution is

12218599
nhibernate	queryover
i haven t checked recently but as far as i know nhibernate doesn t support querying over collections of values using the queryover or criteria api directly

12218606
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the problem is that the page renders how i d like it to in firefox but not in google-chrome safari

12218656
getter	setter
your getter setter should in synch with attribute name

12218683
pop-up	dialog
when a cell is double-clicked a little dialog pop-up which is a custom widget derived from qframe and should allow editing the contens of a cell

12218771
png	ico
you can use to convert your png to an ico

12218773
min	max
i d use qsort with a custom compare function that as stefan noted sorts descending by y then alternates max min for x

12218779
gunicorn	uwsgi
recently popular methods seem to be gunicorn and uwsgi

12218785
mdpi	hdpi
these are ldpi mdpi hdpi and xhdpi

12218785
width	height
for handling size you need to use have multiple layouts one for each category of the size and you need to use different dp value for the height and width of the views for each of the layout as the sizeof a small and a large device will not be same

12218785
mdpi	hdpi
the ratio for this variation of the resolution is 3 4 6 8 ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi

12218816
ilist	icollection
to fix this error either change the json to a json object name value or change the deserialized type to an array or a type that implements a collection interface icollection ilist like list that can be deserialized from a json array

12218860
post	get
basically you get the cumulative probability of each post based on its view count then generate a random number

12218861
jobs	cron
if i have to go the server route i can always set up cron jobs but i am hoping to avoid that because then i need to worry about scaling to many users

12218865
post	get
so i need to send a request to the db to either redirect to the post or get the url or id of the post then use javascript to redirect

12218895
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are relaxing browser and adjust themselves

12218934
strcpy	strncpy
if you were using strcpy then you d need null-termination of subword but since you re using strncpy the null-terminators shouldn t be necessary just be careful with your n values as the strncpy limit

12218937
for-loop	while-loop
use a while-loop instead of a for-loop to iterate through your cursor your for-loop is doing three times the necessary work

12218967
postgresql	mysql
but is not ideal as it used a sql function not a ruby function so is database independent - that said - lower does exist in most sql implementations including mysql postgresql sqlserver and oracle

12218977
pull	push
so i commit and push work on the other machine and when i come back and want to pull i get a merge conflict because the .kilepr file contains the cursor position which obviously changed now

12219001
kde	gnome
some of my thoughts i know some graphical sessions such as kde gnome etc. source different files when login

12219026
width	height
simply set the div to be the same width and height as the background image and to be text align center

12219062
folder	directory
the bowser makes directory for each site and stores the cookies of that site in it s respective folder

12219068

12219068
google-chrome	firefox
p.s. it is working fine on windows google-chrome firefox

12219090
screens	tablet
there are really many more considerations though-- does it need to work on small screens phones or just larger screens tablet

12219148
ubuntu	debian
if you re using debian ubuntu you can run

12219163
express	node.js
i m working with node.js + express + mongoose and have a mongoose schema that i use to store session data

12219176
google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine in firefox and google-chrome exactly as i want whereby the margin is the same as the one before the logo on the left

12219200
bids	ssis
i m using ssis and bids to process a text file who contains lots millions of records

12219203
udp	tcp
behind the scenes the application layer communicates with the transport layer which passes the information over the network using the tcp or the udp protocol

12219206
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it seems to be browser independent ie 8 9 firefox 15 safari 7 google-chrome

12219208
submit	submission
another solution is to detected the user s browser and if it s internet explorer cancel enter key and force user to click submit button for proper submission

12219214
width	height
delta is there because i have a bigger width than height

12219243
children	parent
i am trying to drag and drop an image from parent a which has several children to parent b which is initially empty

12219269
google-chrome	safari
it basically is a google-chrome fork - which works because both google-chrome and safari are webkit browsers

12219285
submit	submission
however this is preventing the submit value being passed on form submission via post

12219340
post	put
how do i put each post in the correct part of the multi dimensional array

12219347
websphere	ibm
i have a java ee 5 project in eclipse actually ibm rad 7 running on websphere 7

12219354
google-chrome	firefox
i want to resize a textarea in ie in a manner similar to the built in resize in firefox and google-chrome

12219405
comparator	comparable
i used comparator since the property could be any type but obviously needs to be comparable to be ordered

12219415
post	get
this is because the above example assumes that when we make a request to get a user the server returns the user data in addition to all of its nested post and comments

12219472
width	height
it does not happen when resizing window on a desktop pc i.e on a desktop browser map_canvas is correctly filled when browser s window is enlarged even without the resize binding only due to width height at 100 on map_canvas...

12219485
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
as a single layout you might look to use grouplayout or gridbaglayout

12219492
translation	localization
consider training authors or adjusting localization and read folder permissions to only the authors responsible for translation for those publications

12219501
implements	extends
i was looking in the wrong place here is the link for a way to implements the listview without extends listviewactivity

12219513
put	get
but when i try to grab the file and put it back into a movie clip i get this error

12219518
post	get
if you are using flex you should just create a httpservice and post the json as a parameter using either post or get

12219578
doxygen	tex
i ve tried putting all the preamble stuff from refman.tex generated by doxygen in my preamble and then later in the document using input to include the tex file of an individual class

12219587
google-chrome	safari
using google-chrome safari the select s stay synchronized from the beginning

12219629
put	get
but when i put the same code in header i am not able to get the page title

12219654
try-catch	exception-handling
you could potentially place this in a transaction in ssis you ll need msdtc running or you could create t-sql script with a try-catch to handle any exception-handling of the bulk insert probably just rollback or commit

12219703
width	height
this is done with trickery where the body or some other element has a large size so as to get a scrollbar and another element is placed with position fixed and height width 100 in front of the scrolled element and takes up the entire screen so the scrolled element is nt visible

12219721
hide	show
the trick to show hide panel has been show in this post with clienthandlersand multiple panels in a unique vertical panel to ensure that the visible panel is always at the right place

12219727
put	get	move	drag
i can move its initialization point around the parent widget s area using self.button.move x y and i can get mouse events from mousepressevent self e via e.x and e.y so that the button move to wherever i click but i just cannot seem to put all this together into a drag and drop framework

12219810
onmouseover	onclick
on a side note you don t want to use click onclick onmouseover etc on elements regardless each one individually per element creates a scripts file in ie slows down performance

12219890
firefox	safari
features used by jqplot are supported on firefox 3.5+ safari 4+

12219890
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome 8.0+ opera 10+ and ie 9+

12219932
free	malloc
malloc and free use the data segment returned by brk and sbrk by turning it into a heap

12219932
free	malloc
it is important to note that many calls to malloc and free will make no system calls

12219932
free	malloc
now when malloc and free want to make use of the heap they need to get a pointer to the heap

12219932
free	malloc
however on linux both the dll and the executable will access malloc and free through a common dll libc.so on linux

12219958
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this seems to be the default type

children	parent
if there is a parent lookup creating it if needed -- no idea how the ordering is and add this structure to the children there

12219976
children	parent
at the end you can iterate over all posts and those without a parent are the roots with their children properly filled in

12219987
nofollow	noindex
add meta or x-robots commands to each page with a value of noindex nofollow

12219987
nofollow	noindex
additionally to be extra safe i would also add a meta robots or x-robots-header command to each page to noindex nofollow just in case ip tables fails from a misconfiguation or if authentication ever fails .

12219987
nofollow	noindex
otherwise pushing out a noindex nofollow or a disallow would be disastrous for your production site

12220011
for-loop	arrays
but in my application before the generation of the arrays the for-loop below the invocation of this method get executed also the show modal block

google-chrome	firefox
it is working in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox e is always undefined in firefox

12220113
ssl	https
the task of the .https version will certainly be to redirect the https traffic towards a service that can handle https stunnel or nginx usually since haproxy cannot terminate ssl connections

12220144
rspec	capybara
the second example doesn t work because because capybara resets the session after each rspec example

12220145
mp3	wav
i m running lame to convert a wav sound in mp3 executing as console application

rss	feed
is there any scala library that can be used to generate rss feed using idiomatic features like case classes

12220308
vbscript	vba
this question is a good example as to why it is important to always include option explicit in your vbscript same as you should be doing for vba code

12220322
stdout	stderr
run that command in terminal and redirect stdout and stderr to different files

12220371

12220437
folder	directory
i have also placed the mysite directory in var www folder but to no avail

12220445

but if you override ondestroy or in general destructor alike method then rule of the thumb is to all the cleanup things in opposite order you did in oncreate

12220458
google-chrome	firefox
what should i do to make it open the link in a new window in ie works in firefox google-chrome

for-loop	arrays
you re recreating a new arrays each time since it is inside the for-loop

12220692
post	get
i ve already searched for it using get and post apis of jquery but with no results

12220714
portrait	landscape
when i go from portrait to landscape orientation my uibarbuttonitem resets to what the button is in the storyboard

12220718
hash	md5
absolutely do not use multiple iterations of a conventional hash function like md5 md5 md5 password

12220718
scrypt	pbkdf2
these include bcrypt scrypt and in some situations pbkdf2

12220741
children	parent
i want to be able to pass an array of category ids a parent id with all of it s children for example and return only results that match one of those categories

12220771
google-chrome	firefox
i am testing with both google-chrome and firefox and the behavior is the same so there must be something that i don t understand and am doing wrong

12220789
fadein	fadeout
edit i almost forgot you are going to have to set the body or a wrapper element s height to be what the height would be if your elements were part of the normal flow as display none which is required for fadein and fadeout will remove them from the flow and shorten your page to the height it would be without them there

12220824
jar	war
you may also try placing the folder inside the war or jar ejb to narrow down the issue

12220857
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
recv is not limited to just tcp it supports any transport that the underlying provider supports - tcp udp ipx icmp raw etc

12220881
ubuntu	linux
my netbeans platform application which uses jpa with embedded derby will work when i launch it out of the netbeans 7.2 ide but when i create the linux installer for ubuntu 12.04 and install the installed app will not create my database in the derby home directory which i set to system.getproperty user.home

12220882
google-chrome	firefox
this webapp works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

12220889
super	self
in other words super represents the same object as self it just starts the method lookup one step higher in the inheritance tree

12220889
superclass	subclassing
so you re running respondstoselector on this subclassing which replies yes but then later trying to get gesturerecognizer shouldrecognizesimultaneouslywithgesturerecognizer from the superclass which doesn t have it

12220898
children	parent
as a workaround i read all the children into the list and remove them from the parent widget at the same time then sort these items using comparator and add them back to parent from the sorted list

12220914
put	get
to get around the problem i tried to put the argument -d32 in the vm arguments but got the same result

12220927
width	margin
-made the width and margin of the footer match the wrappers

12220932
nfa	dfa
for implementing the dfa and nfa i decided to put some common functions into classes fa and fastate

12220932
nfa	dfa
for a dfa b char while for a nfa b symbol

12220932
nfa	dfa
dfa and nfa are respectively defined as

12221005
versioning	upgrade
it would make versioning controlled upgrade scripts a bit easier to manage and deployed changes would perform better

12221055
gridview	sqldatasource
my asp code for gridview after binding to sqldatasource is

12221084
jar	war
when i generate the java artifacts from wsdl i would like to pack the web service project as a war file and its client as a jar file

12221086
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed in both firefox and google-chrome that if you set the html5 doctype there s a minimum line-height for inline elements

12221093
addclass	removeclass
remember removeclass and addclass in jquery doesn t need the dot

12221104
pop-up	dialog
if anyone knows if this is just because it is alpha please let us know because pop-up was based off of dialog and dialog does not have this problem

12221119
put	get
i put it in my application models directory but these files do not even get included they have syntax errors but my app works just fine

12221129
versioning	upgrade
if you have an app on google play with a native library and at some point you publish an updated versioning where support for an architecture say x86 is no more will google play tell x86 users about an upgrade

12221134
min	max
also it s worth noting that min and max work on text and several other data types that are not numeric values

12221189
ienumerable	iqueryable
prop3 is actually implemented as an iqueryable but is an ienumerable because i need to pass the resolved query back across the wire because the context is lost upon returning a value from wcf and therein lies the problem

12221193
typedef	struct
there are several problems with this approach but the most important is for each typedef or static constant that i find convenient defining in the vector_expr struct i will need to perform all the above only to have the expression compile even if an iterator-expression is-not vector-expression and it makes no sense to enlarge the interface of vector_expr to accommodate transformed trees

12221205
hide	show
i have used hide and show methods of jquery

12221262
children	parent
the matched elements for your selector is the parent only none of its children are included

12221263
toolchain	bionic	bionic	libc
arm-linux-androideabi- is the one used to build all the native code in afs linked against bionic libc as well as the toolchain used for the ndk

12221287
set	bag
inverse attribute is set for items bag in orders entity

12221309
convertview	spinner
so you have to use the settag or something else to ensure your convertview is correct. spinner does not support multiple view types

12221323
put	get
i don t know how to do it from woocommerce but with following code it is possible just make sure that these php code should execute so put it at suitable place in php file where some php codes are executing best place would be any wordpress plugin s base file be careful while updating that plugin as these code will get lost after updating

12221336
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox handles events differently than ie google-chrome

12221357
hide	show
that is jtabbedpane s tab should show panel_b and hide panel_a

12221365
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari will work but the android browser may have issues

12221449
firefox	safari
this works for terminal xcode safari firefox and probably many others

12221455
post	put
i m using curl from the command line and i can post new blog articles and i can put changes to existing blog articles but i can t adjust the date of the existing articles yet

12221498
hide	show
the problem is with a normal js hide show script it hide show all of the forms and i m unsure of how to make it specific to only one form

12221508
g++	gcc
inherited a slew of legacy c code and am in the process of porting it to compile on linux with gcc g++

12221511
fseek	fread
use low-level file i o functions in matlab like fopen fclose fread fseek etc to read the files following their format

12221517
rss	feed
hy i m trying to display my rss feed but the problem is that while trying to display the title the rss feed somehow displays everything the link title and even the name of the page i m trying to read the feed from

12221531
integer	unsigned
i also took the liberty to assume that you want an integer not an unsigned integer

12221533
dictionary	map
another approach is to use dictionary to map keys if you have small number of them to values

12221546
put	get
also getting used to add quotes around your variables helps you to remember to always put them once you get used to it and makes do you less errors

12221550
put	get
you get your urdu string say the one you put before ø¹ ùˆø ù ø ù ø ø ø¹ø ù ù ù ø ùšù ø ø³øªø ùšø¹ ø ù ø ø ø ùƒ

12221582
getter	setter
a quick way around this would be with a type-hinted setter method and subsequent getter like this

12221600
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works properly in ie7 ie9 google-chrome firefox and safari

12221618
int	boolean
set method has a lot of overloads it can accept int string boolean datetime etc

12221628
children	parent
there is only relation in parent to children like this

12221643
post	get
in your post redirect post - redirect - get pattern

12221657
next	except
to fix this you can wrap the next in a try except pass

12221692
post	get
it works with get but we really want post

12221713
put	get
they may even do a read query to get all the fields change the one they want to update then put them back

12221754
elf	coff
the directives in the linked file are only valid for elf targets as used on linux and other unices but cygwin is a coff target

12221758
getter	setter
the auth_key is simply a getter setter virtual attribute for the column you choose to locate the record when authenticating it is not a column itself unless you choose to create an auth_key column in your identity model

12221852
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
only store salt hash made with appropriately secure not md5 hash functions

12221852
hash	salt
use a different salt for each hash

12221862
folder	directory
in this case the simplest thing for you to do is to invoke python from the directory containing the folder swampy since the interpreter will first search for modules in the current directory

12221933
decoder	encoder
this is the buffering the encoder assumes is available at the decoder side

12221976
loops	if-statement
i want to go back to loops 1 if the if-statement is successful

12221988
width	height
the left title is set to preferred width and fixed height so that it gets the width it needs but doesn t grow vertically

12221988
width	height
the expanding title gets an expanding width policy and a fixed height

12222006
ienumerable	iqueryable
i can understand that the code compiles iqueryable inherits from ienumerable which have an orderby method taking a as parameter

12222007
mp4	webm
output format webm ogv mp4

12222040
ienumerable	iqueryable
because f is a delegate rather than an expression the compiler picks the ienumerable orderby extension method instead of the iqueryable one

12222040
ienumerable	iqueryable
it seems that your question is as much about the iqueryable ienumerable duality being dangerous from the point of view of introducing ambiguity

12222068
udp	tcp
port forward tcp udp 5555

12222105
kerberos	ntlm
so in short you need to switch from using ntlm to kerberos

12222109
sigkill	multitasking
then if i press the home button then close the app from the multitasking bar then press the icon i get the sigkill error

12222163
getter	setter
all the fragments are able to access the data in the activity they are displayed in just make sure to create getter and setter

12222201
matplotlib	scipy
generally for mountain lion you can find great advices and a well described step-by-step procedure to install numpy scipy matplotlib iphython at this link

12222212
getter	setter
assuming that you have created getter and setter in your computer class

12222220
client-side	server-side
please refer to the documentation for a list of simple client-side and server-side hooks

12222283
width	height
the size width and height and the filename is included for each record

12222283
width	height
width and height are included no need to launch phpâ s imagegetsize to get the size

12222286
mp4	h.264
mp4 with h.264 aac is the most common and for devices that don t support those mpeg4 with mp3 will suffice

12222342
versioning	upgrade
i m afraid i can t show you any code because we got rid of it as soon as most firefox users were upgrade to a versioning that supported ellipsis

12222388
fontfamily	font-size
do i apply a font-size style and a fontfamily style to the div ul or li

12222403
width	height
i add a custom button in storyboard and add some text and then add the backgroundimage which is a vector done in illustrator width 630 height 130

12222488
google-chrome	firefox
intellij 11 does support js debugging with google-chrome maybe firefox too but only the ultimate edition

12222529
post	get
but to get a value from a view in the post action you should use an hidden input

12222638
gunicorn	uwsgi
i ll second matt w s note about the application environment being a major factor gunicorn uwsgi nginx- paster pserve eventlet apache+mod_wsgi etc etc etc

12222648
epplus	excellibrary
but instead of creating a html-table that can be interpreted by excel i would use a excellibrary like epplus gpl which i can warmly recommend

12222696
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the solution should work in recent versions of google-chrome firefox and safari

12222728
bmp	png
i can t use because of the filetype so i m searching how to load a png file convert it to bmp and feed it to either or

12222760
websphere	ibm
we have ibm rad 7 with websphere 1.6 version when creating webmodule project it is taking only java 5 and override annotation methods not working .please provide hints

12222775
implements	extends	inherited	properties
if you want to create a custom class for your textfield though it s not clear whether that s altogether necessary in this instance you would need to either extends the textfield class in your custom class in which case it will inherited the textfield.text properties or implements a setter of your own to set the text on a textfield instance stored as a properties of the class

12222813
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox google-chrome and unfortunately the android device do not allow me to get the information

12222813
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox complain about cross-site ajax callsâ and the phone just freezes up when the function is called

12222826
versioning	upgrade
i see that the latest versioning for ef in nuget is 5.0 but i m running .net 4 and don t plan to upgrade to 4.5 anytime soon

12222836
content-disposition	content-type
as it is quite simple in this scenario and involves only terms like content-type content-disposition therefor i would recommend it here

12222839
width	height
for example if i have a large image that s 1600x1200 but i want to generate a thumbnail that is 250x200 a different ratio of height and width -- how can i scale this down to size and then center crop it

12222873
mouse	keyboard
i started automating this process using autoit to control my mouse and keyboard

12222873
mouse	keyboard
not only am i dependent on an installation of visual studio but while the script is running i cannot use the mouse or keyboard without throwing the automation out of sequence

12222885
post	get
these might be some good blog post to get you started

12222893
post	get
the service has a few get methods which return some data that is serialised as json and some post methods that accept custom wcf classes

12222926
put	get
you need to put your php function in a .php file of its own and then use an ajax request every second to get the updated table

12222977
union	distinct
with union only distinct values are selected

12222984
securitymanager	classloader
the xalan engine internal to jre has the logic to look for a callback class in the boostrap classloader if securitymanager was set in the jvm else it would look for it in the system classloader

12222991
inherited	properties
the appmanager class inherited from nsobject and not from uiviewcontroller - how come it would have a properties named view

12223004
octal	decimal	octal	binary
we must use these 3 loops to generate a table of decimal numbers as well as the binary octal and hexadecimal equivalents of the decimal numbers in the range 1-256

12223024
post	get
if you want to know how to get the permalink based on the title of a post then send it to the server call get_page_by_title and return get_permalink

12223037
pop-up	dialog
this will cause the program to continue or a wer dialog to pop-up depending on your machine configuration

12223072
outputstream	inputstream
i want to test that the bytes i write to outputstream a file ouputstream is same as i read from same inputstream

12223108
post	get
how to get the real path i want to get rid of the lines .metadata.plugins org.eclipse.wst.server.core tmp0 wtpwebapps i looked and did all possible i seen in internet but failed sorry if i made an duplicate post kindly excuse me

12223115
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
applying the background color via css to a works fine in google-chrome firefox and safari

12223122
post	get
i have a table containing news post and would like to get the entire last added newspost of every category

12223122
post	get
the last post by date of every category is returned so i get 3 post back

12223124
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade cygwin s openssl you just need to run the installer and select the newer versioning

12223124
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
after the installation upgrade is complete you should be able to see the new versioning in cygwin with the following command

12223124
installation	upgrade
i figure cygwin handles the installation upgrade for a reason

12223127
for-loop	loops
using log.d i saw that once it gets into one of the inner for loops the ones with the if statements before them it will not leave that for-loop ....which doesn t make sense to me but i figure it has something to do with the canvas and holder

12223156
hide	show
you can either append it to the dom later or just hide it with css and show it with js

12223192
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately by looking around the web i have only found hints for debian and ubuntu

12223197
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you can read from inputstream and write on bytearrayoutputstream then use tobytearray method to convert it to byte array

12223242
hash	hmac
a common choice of mac is hmac with whatever hash function you prefer such as sha-2

12223267
nfa	dfa
i don t know automata theory and can t help you with dfa nfa but that s a solid direction to go if you needed more precision

12223305
put	get
the queries work when run individually but when i put them all together i don t get the desired result set

12223305
min	max
but now they want me to get a certain column image_measurer_id with each row returned that corresponds to the row from the group that has bottom min bottom bottom max bottom bottom closest to avg bottom and bottom from the row where date_time max date_time

12223312
put	get
in order to get it to work with contiguous ranges i had to put my month_type enumeration in this order

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
each of the subviews cells in the uiscrollview content view have a uigesturerecognizer attached to them so that when a person touches one of them the uigesturerecognizer will trigger

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
the problem is that when a person has scrolled away from the contentview origin the uiscrollview returns a contentoffset where x is other than 0 any of the new subviews cells that scroll in from the right do not trigger the uigesturerecognizer when touched

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
all the subviews do have their uigesturerecognizer

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
i implement my own queue dequeue of the subviews analogous to what a tableview does so if i have scrolled over by place #15 none of the original icons subviews is even in the contentview as the subviews are recycled and old uigesturerecognizer removed and new ones attached when it is pulled off the queue and reused and none of these are touchable and trigger the uigesturerecognizer

12223348
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
it is just the uigesturerecognizer attached to each subviews that are not triggering and are position dependent on being within the original bounds of the scrollview before it starts scrolling

12223365
for-loop	arrays
the first for-loop seeks to convert each integer to a binary string and store it to the string arrays

12223388
postgresql	mysql
i would like a single query that would work just as well on sqlite mysql postgresql or sql server

12223433
folder	directory
but a simple approach for basic security could be to deny directory listing to the folder and then to create encoded filenames and put these in the dbase

12223484
capistrano	rvm
gem rvm capistrano

12223492
width	height
you have to encapsulate your height width -calculating code into

12223493
public	protected
in your ai class create an addedtostage listener and in that handler create an enter_frame handler that is either protected or public then you can override parts of its behavior if you have slightly different needs for different character types

12223501
rar	zip
the archive itself may include other archives zip rar kmz zae

12223565
width	height
if you want to scale down to inside 250x200 pixels while keeping aspect ratio the ratio of height to width of the original image and cropping that dimension of the 250x200 pixels which isn t used up use

12223565
width	height
by default width and height given in the -resize argument are maximum values unless you specify it as a percentage

12223565
width	height
when the height is shrunk to 200 pixels from the original s 1200 pixels to 16.6666 of this original value the width is now 266.66 pixels

12223565
width	height
when the width has shrunk to 250 pixels from the original 1600 pixels to 15.625 of this original value the height now is 187.5 pixels

12223565
integer	fractions
so the final dimension will be either of 250x187 or more likely 250x188 pixels you can t have fractions of a pixel in the height it requires an integer

12223565
width	height
when modifying width and height with the addition to the -scale or -resize arguments these settings are considered to be minimum values where only one of these too dimensions is really attained

12223565
width	height
this means output images expand or contract until either width or height matches its specified dimension maintaining the aspect ratio of the image

12223571
post	get
in general you should not need to serialize the form into json and post that - instead you should take advantage of the model binding in mvc and submit the form data the standard way by using the action attribute on the form element - well the model binder is able to bind objects based on json but i think you get my point

12223571
client-side	server-side
as you might already have guessed my best experience with asp.net mvc3 when it comes to model validation is using data annotations and the built-in support for server-side validation through modelstate.isvalid and client-side validation through unobtrusive javascript

12223588
hash	md5
you can use file name with md5 hash a the end

12223642
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview diddeselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

12223688
qthread	qnetworkaccessmanager
what you should probably do is create your own qthread subclass and create the qnetworkaccessmanager in the run method

12223696
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you can also run following

folder	directory
the commands in this case generate lists of files under the two directory - the cd makes the output relative to the directory being compared so that corresponding files come out as identical strings and the sort ensures that comm won t be confused by the same files listed in different order in the two folder

12223767
implements	extends
in simple words implementation means applying set of predefined rules.interface is same like this.so an interface can not implements other interface.thats why we extends one interface with other

12223774
width	height
i want to make a qwebview appear expanding to the width and height so that ideally it will have no scroll bars

12223774
width	height
it doesnt take into account that the height and width are related to each other

12223774
width	height
it doesnt take into account the relation between the displayed width height

12223801
width	height
the effect is that the image will fill the to the width of the containing element and height will automatically adjust

i have been searching google all day so far the best i have been able to come up with is using a ternary which i have put into my code but it keeps throwing an err and i get a blank white page

12223827
put	get
when using readline via the -e flag the argument to -i is put on the first line of the input to get you started

12223848
public	protected
the methods that could be invoked on item inside the method would have to be public methods or protected methods within the same package

12223862
portrait	landscape
so it seems that the rule of ios app is that it is always first layouted in portrait mode and then resize re-layout if landscape mode is wanted

12223866
client-side	server-side
using meteor i m wondering how best to handle different client-side collections that share the same server-side database collection

12223866
client-side	server-side
if the latter would i then duplicate code used for both the server-side and client-side query

12223866
client-side	server-side
what if i wanted to create a new client-side collection that consisted of search results from multiple server-side collections

12223904
jobs	cron
i know nothing about cron jobs unfortunately but maybe i don t even need to use them

12223912
public	protected
about the methods you can invoke if you are not using casting then you can only invoke public protected within the same package of launchable

12223932

12224128
post	get
does anyone have any experience that can tell me how i can get the post data they say there is

12224128

12224204
min	max
in coreimage a cifilter has both a set of max min values and a set of slidermax min values

12224204
min	max	minimum	max
the documentation for the max min says the maximum minimum value for a filter parameter and the slidermax min says the maximum minimum value specified as a floating-point value to use for a slider that controls input values for a filter parameter.

12224204
min	max
i m wondering why these might be different values as they are for example for the inputangle parameter of cihueadjust where max min are 0 0 but slidermax min is 3.14 -3.14

12224204
min	max
and also what is the use of having the max min values at 0 0 like they are for most of the filters

12224207
postgresql	mysql
i doubt that you can do this in mysql or postgresql as you expect to however there is an alternative which i have used where data is very free-form

12224253
min	max
i would wager that a value of 0 means there is no max min that any value representable by the datatype is valid for the filter

12224276
filesystems	fat
fat short for file allocation table is the name of a computer filesystems architecture and a family of industry standard filesystems utilizing it

12224284

this error only happens in explorer and opera but works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari

12224396
uiview	subviews
you may have to create a background view uiview will suffice and put the uilabel on top not as a subviews because the alpha value of the background view affects all of its subviews

12224410
post	get
i get array return id of those post

12224420
mongoid	mongomapper
the rails3-jquery-autocomplete gem can work with mongodb but only if you use the mongoid gem not mongomapper

12224451
post	get
however the radio button chosen by the user doesn t get send along with the word in the post request

12224471
subscript	superscript
in general when there is an unicode equivalent for the subscript superscript you should use that character directly instead of the sub sup element it s not a must just a recommendation so go on using whatever you like more

12224471
subscript	superscript
it s not relevant in this case but maybe for other readers when the subscript superscript is stylistic only and carries no new meaning by being subscript superscripted you should use css instead of the special unicode characters or sub sup elements vertical-align with sub super and you d have to adjust the font size too

12224476
int	chars
the main problem is that i cannot touch the resulting chars buff with any members of my class nor can i even change an int flag that is also a member of my class

12224509
subtract	add
you must subtract hours and minutes from a time given in an eastern hemisphere timezone in order to get back to utc not add them

getter	setter
i ran the command line to generate the getter setter and join info in the entities

12224521
setinterval	clearinterval
angular s built in timeout service is used instead of setinterval and clearinterval since modifying the model outside of angularjs shouldn t be done if easily avoided

12224583
wordpress	joomla
setting up a poll is not going to be a simple task if you are not using some sort of cms platform like wordpress or joomla for example and some extension such a platform might offer

12224602
put	get	post	put	post	get
only supports post and get requests for some reason- but i also need put and delete standard restful methods so i didn t bother looking into it any further

int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
the wrapper classes boolean chars int long float and double serve this purpose

12224629
google-chrome	safari
in particular which versions of google-chrome and safari will have support for them

12224632
public	protected
also it is a good idea to declare your methods as public protected or private

12224678
setinterval	settimeout
i m possibly looking for an alternative to node.js - some really nice things about it are settimeout and setinterval

12224706
put	get
since in this case get time will never change and accepts no parameters you would do best to put this into a static method since it s a waste to instantiate a class in this situation

12224721
des	aes
symmetric cryptography such as the aes or des algorithms use a single key to encrypt and decrypt data

12224721
hash	md5
common hash algorithms include message digest 5 md5 and secure hash algorithm sha and its derivatives like sha1 sha256 and sha512

12224733
decltype	auto
why can t i initialize a value with auto and pass it into a function that expects a decltype as a parameter

12224739
google-chrome	firefox
this script is working for me in google-chrome firefox but choking in ie

12224739
google-chrome	firefox

nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you should use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents to do the maths - something like

12224765
rss	feed
should i ask websites if i need to use their rss feed as data for my iphone app

12224765
rss	feed
i have seen several apps which use rss feed as their back end

12224765
rss	feed
most websites have a restriction on how many calls an app can make per second or per hour for an rss feed

12224765
rss	feed
but if my app is distributed amongst several users it is not really a single user who is calling for rss feed

12224765
rss	feed
also one idea i had was to cache the rss feed on some different server for some time but then the users might not get the most latest feed

12224765
rss	feed
i don t wanna get sued for using rss feed from websites but asking every website for permission is too much

12224798
cefsharp	cefglue
in the realm of providing a decent implementation of the chromium embedded framework cef for .net the two leading options appear to be cefsharp and cefglue

12224798
cefsharp	cefglue
they differ in approach cefglue uses p invoke to call into the cef unmanaged code cefsharp uses a mixed-mode c++ cli wrapper around the cef libraries

12224802
rss	feed
most rss feed are available to the public to subscribe to so there shouldn t be a problem if your app is subscribing to them

12224816
rss	feed
you don need to to ask permission to consume an rss feed - that s what it is implicitly for - content syndication

12224816
rss	feed
however if you are creating an app with wide distribution and it is going to be hitting the same rss feed then you almost certainly should cache the content on your own servers

12224820
put	get
get the url from the ide ends in dev and then put the params after the dev

12224821
vmware	virtualbox
does that mean using virtualbox with vagrant is pretty much the same as just using vmware fusion

12224884
post	get
it was a post and validation does not get executed

12224907

i am a mewbie in java but the problem may be that you create the list for double s however you are adding some int s

12224969
google-chrome	firefox
note the code jsbin.com does not work for me in ie9 firefox and google-chrome work fine

12224988
int	chars	int	double
things like int chars double are all primitives meaning they do not need to be instantiated by using new

12224988
int	chars	int	double
things like int chars double are objects that take up more room on the computer since there is more overhead for objects but you can use methods like integer.parse

12225023
textarea	textbox
i ve gotten it to work using an html textbox or textarea set to disabled read only with some display style changes via css

12225023
textarea	textbox

12225070
traceroute	packets
traceroute to identify where the packets are dropped

12225093
int	double
t1 would be int and t2 would be double

12225097
int	double
when the i crossed the limit of int as indicated by dbaseman at one time it reached zero then it threw an error along the lines of zero is trying to divide the double due to 600851475143 i

12225097
int	double
so when you call the count minding that it is an int it will allocate a single byte but the thing it reads is double

12225132
put	get
is there is a way other than then because i don t want to put an extra button in activity b and i am also not sure will the user get actual data from location activity after he edits his details in b

depending on the character encoding of the file you will get better performance by doing byte-wise i o with a bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream with large buffer sizes

12225527
integer	unsigned
so yes you should use unsigned integer types even if the extra range is not required and no you shouldn t use unsigned int s or anything else if not necessary but you need to revise your definition of what is necessary

12225613
getter	setter
i have two entities customer and order trivial setter and getter excluded

12225616

in the for-loop i intent to call the method loopdata to get the content with a block which has in every loops a new page id

12225712
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
equally concerning is where in another one of your questions you said embedding a uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller my case in a uiviewcontroller somehow interrupts with the calling of these methods. thing is you don t embed nav controllers in other view controllers unless it is itself a container controller such as a tab view controller but rather its the other way around

12225714
post	put
using the same save method backbone changed the username attribute and made a put request for you instead of post because it knows you already saved your user

ant	maven
maven or ant or are you packaging in eclipse itself without using an external tool

12226171
sage	maxima
first i used maxima embedded in sage to solve it analytically but the solution was too dependent on the initial guesses i had make for my unknown functions constant initial guesses yielded answering back almost immediately while symbolic functions when used as initial guesses yielded the system to go deep into calculations sometimes seemingly never ending ones

12226214
calloc	malloc
you can use calloc rather than malloc while allocating entries like

12226215
ggplot2	aesthetics
- there might be a better idea you come up with for the above workaround in ggplot2 for alpha and size aesthetics hope to hear from you soon

12226218
for-loop	loops
however for the get loops instead of using a for-loop with an index i used a for-each loops

for-loop	arrays
the get-loop was a for-loop using an index from 1 to 100 000 as is typical for an arrays

12226218

textarea	textbox
you ll notice this little div with the letter v if i remove this div the textarea and textbox are aligned as needed and resizing takes place with the position of both divs totally in-sync

12226320
integer	unsigned
the problem with the systematic use of unsigned when values can t be negative isn t that java doesn t have unsigned it is that expressions with unsigned values especially when mixed with signed one give sometimes confusing results if you think about unsigned as an integer type with a shifted range

12226320
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer types are ideal for uses that treat storage as a bit array

12226352
width	height
there is two more text boxes from where user can enter height and width of pdf to be generated

12226352
width	height
the div height and width are set at run time basically with this div we want to show how pdf is going to look like

12226420
min	max
so far that has worked fine but once i tried to implement the recalculation of the bounding box my box starts of at the same position as the cube but once i start rotating it the bounding box sometimes implodes hence i need to check the max min corners so they don t get smaller than the cube itself but when i rotate the camera the bounding box shifts of to one or the other side

12226424
jython	pypy

12226955
svg	vml
ie may not support svg but it does support an alternative format called vml

12226955
svg	vml
the two formats are similar enough that a number of svg- vml conversion tools exist which allow you to effectively load svg images into ie

12226955
svg	vml
it probably isn t what you re looking for in this case but is an excellent cross-browser graphics library that allows you to write scripts that draw graphics in svg in most browsers and vml in ie

12228406
public	protected
version 1 would introduce access modifiers in the parent that perhaps should not be there going from protected to public while version 3 does not make much sense since you are still using an instance of maptile even if it did it looks awkward and unnatural

12235222
int	double
i don t get why it works fine if you change all the double into int

12235244
int	double
the thing is that on your system int appears to be of the same length as float but not as double - when you scanf a double you loose half of it and by the way feeding a wrong format specifier to scanf is undefined behaviour

12235251
int	double
also in the main function the type of buffer should be double not int

udp	tcp
i have a udp server reading images both udp and tcp

12235388

12235547
udp	tcp
tcp and udp have very different characeristics

12235547
udp	tcp
if you care about data arriving in a timely manner where if data is late it is no use then tcp is not useful and as such you should use and only use udp

12235587
udp	tcp
now imagine writing lots of small packets across a network udp may cause congestion whereas tcp is better controlled

12236629
hide	show
when clicking link 3 the div that is visible will hide and div3 would show and so on

postgresql	informix
in theory if you were working with informix and needed to access postgresql you could buy and use the enterprise gateway manager egm and use the odbc driver for postgresql to allow informix to connect to postgresql

12236763
postgresql	informix
the egm would do its utmost to appear to be another informix database while actually accessing postgresql

12236763
postgresql	informix
for the converse connection working with postgresql and connecting to informix you will need to look to the postgresql tool suite â or other sources

12238754
int	chars
the argument is passed to your program as a chars and so as andy pointed out you would have a pointer to a byte containing 0x35 - which is the int value that represents an ascii chars 5 - rather than a pointer to an int value 5

12238754
int	chars
to use your argument as an int you would need to convert the byte to its int equivalent as defined by the ascii table - otherwise you will find that you pass in the chars 5 but any math you attempt to do with this will be using 53 0x35 because that represents a 5 in ascii

you don t have to declare exceptions derived from runtimeexception in your throws clause v.g. nullpointerexception

12239660
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
illegalargumentexception extends runtimeexception not just exception

12239663
qscrollarea	qwidget
by default a qwidget has no minimumsize and the widget layout inside the qscrollarea can make them as small as it wants in order to fit the available space which is the size of qscrollarea

for instance in order to avoid the dividebyzeroexception arithmeticexception your program must check if the denominator is not zero

12239697
width	margin
float the div in the background to the max width set a div inside that that s not transparent and center it using margin auto

apache	nginx
when i run apache on my server localhost still point to that welcome to nginx i dont know why

12239837
short	base
the short answer is yes in fact in the array case it does not only have to check the index limit but to calculate the actual memory position of the reference you are looking for -as in i 7 get the base position of the array and add 7 words-

12239920
mergesort	timsort
if you are using the standard java sorting method and an array of floats you are fine with 1.2gb imo as it already uses a very space efficient and fast n lg n sorting method timsort mergesort - see arrays.sort

12239920
integer	radix
to make it even faster you could convert the floats to integers but you ll need to know precision up front and then apply integer sort or the already mentioned radix sort

12239925
width	height
you need to specify a number between 0 to 1 which is the percentage of the texture s width and height

12239968
post	get
now i have look at some other answers from this site which suggest either using get i don t want to use get post only or use the header with location url for redirection

12240011
onfocus	onblur
i was just checking my newest website creation today was making sure the form was ok for some reason the onfocus of the street address is not working the onblur works fine and all the other text inputs work with the onfocus onblur

avd	galaxy
i can build the project as an android app but it will not deploy to my phone i have a galaxy nexus or to an avd

12240027
put	get
my guess is that i first need to fetch get its source somehow use some kind of system signing do the changes and put it forcefully into the device maybe also restarting it

12240038
ienumerable	iqueryable
as for the first query that s deferred execution.you created an ienumerable of train s noticed that it did not have the include method so cast it to iqueryable added the include and added the tolist to prevent lazy loading

12240038
ienumerable	iqueryable
the result of the select is an ienumerable converted to iqueryable but now implemented by enumerablequery which does not implement include

12240057
apache	nginx
if you are sure nginx is actually running you just need to kill nginx.exe process and re-run apache

12240063
hash	md5
but as pointed out in the answer to my original question md5 has replaced half-md4 as the hash function from kernels 3.1

12240068
google-chrome	safari
at the root of the problem is the difference in the way that webkit browsers specifically google-chrome and safari and other browsers treat the onpopstate event

12240068
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the current version of both google-chrome and safari fire an onpopstate event for the initial page load both firefox and opera and possibly others do not do this

12240068
google-chrome	firefox
this causes strange cross browser issues with davis including routes being fired run twice in google-chrome and the first route not being run in firefox if you are navigating using the back button

12240078
burn	prerequisites
it s probably better to look at what tools like wix burn and installshield setup prerequisites and suite installers have to offer and change your requirements to match their capabilities

12240103
put	get
it s intended primarily as an external interface while a time_t is intended primarily for internal use -- typical use is that when you get a date time from the outside world you put the components into a struct tm and convert it to a time_t for internal storage

12240137
versioning	upgrade
also i recommend you to upgrade jquery to the newest versioning and replace delegate with on

12240147
width	height
though you could use the function mentioned above to convert meters to map points and create an mkmaprect it would be easier to use the mkcoordinateregionmakewithdistance function which takes a regular coordinate latitude and longitude in degrees and the desired width and height in meters so all the calculations are handled by the map view

12240148
google-chrome	firefox
problem my technique works fine for major browsers google-chrome firefox ie

a typical 64-bit double can represent all 32-bit int values exactly

12240317
slideup	slidedown
use jquery slidedown slideup instead of animate

12240378
nsoperationqueue	completionhandler	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
i bet using the new api that allows to send an asynchronous request on an nsoperationqueue +sendasynchronousrequest queue completionhandler uses gcd under the hood and dispatch_source_create or something similar so that it behave the same way as when an nsurlconnection is scheduled on the run loop avoiding using an additional thread watch the wwdc 12 videos that explains why threads are evil and their usage should be minimized the difference only being that allows you to use a block to be informed upon completion instead of using the delegate mechanism

12240389
post	get
on the wall i get a placeholder thumbnail and the rest of the post as specified

i have a created a pdf with a complete tutorial showing how to debugging and profiling openlaszlo swf11 runtime applications including the swf11 lfc classes

12240489
int	chars
of course this fails at the # chars the # isn t an int and thus reading it as an int fails

phpstorm	aptana
i ve been doing some magento development over a network share using aptana and phpstorm and the syncronizing or project building is extremely slow

12240556
phpstorm	aptana
phpstorm takes a few minutes to synchronize the project and aptana takes even longer to rebulild the project

12240583
int	double
not likely with int and double but with slight alteration

12240591
getter	setter
kineticjs however generated it s getter setter based on the name of the variables

12240591
getter	setter
so with the addgetterssetters method you generate getter setter based on the names of the variables

12240591
getter	setter
i could add externs to for each getter setter

12240591
getter	setter
alternatively i could rewrite all the getter setter stuff to make it actual methods non-generated ones by hand

12240591
getter	setter
that last part seems the best since then closure can optimize those and do some magic with it i hope. though that would be quite a bit of work so i was wondering is it possible to run my program so it generates the getter setter and then extracting them

12240592
post	get
try your hands on the applications and if you get stuck post here and help would be provided readily

12240600

12240652
getter	setter
version 2 exact same thing as #1 except that you re also defining a getter and setter method for the two variables

12240688
consistency	acid
this is typically the design choice of high-performance systems that want to eliminate the need for a second query even if that comes at the cost of additional code complexity on the insert update side and with some potential consistency problems since mongo is not acid

12240688
put	get
put d in a and store a reference dbref or some other combination of identifying fields in b so that you can get to it with a second query

12240708
inherited	properties
what i wish to do is to inherited it while expending my properties

12240773
for-loop	loops
why is it that the second for-loop continues to loops within the if statement incrementing d whereas the first loops increments p once and then moves on

12240789
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu server running a jboss webservice

12240808
width	margin	width	text-align	margin	text-align
then with a width in place you can use display inline on the ul and text-align center on the parent div or maybe use margin auto

12240926
free	memcpy
and also for strlen memcpy and free

12240933
sharpgl	opentk
you could render using opengl use opentk or sharpgl or render using directx...via the 3d path with d3dimage or direct2d whether this behaves the same as rendertargetbitmap in terms of memory usage...that s to find out

12240942
hash	md5
the nonce is passed as a get variable and on page 2 a md5 hash is computed using the get passed nonce and a secret string that is the same on page 1 and 2

12240942
hash	md5
i know the md5 hash is now considered bad but in this implementation i think its safe since my assumption is that the only way to beat the system here is to brute force url check which as said could be stopped as a ddos attack

12240968
free	malloc
for malloc free it is

12241006
many-to-many	one-to-many
from the schema information you provided it looks like you have a many-to-many relationship between tenant and system through the join table system_prop and a one-to-many relationship between system and authorization

12241023
getter	setter
use properties instead of setter getter methods

12241025
int	chars
use the regex to test the format but then take the right-most n chars capturing it in a group is the easiest try to parse it into an int and test if it s in the range

12241071
google-chrome	firefox
my guess is that google-chrome and firefox are probably adding this for you when an ajax request is made if it isn t already present but ie is not

several ides also provide static analysis using jsdoc tag information for example see webstorm phpstorm blog new in 5.0 google closure compiler jsdoc annotations

12241117
mongodb	bson
the on-disk storage of documents in mongodb is in bson format

12241117
spaces	delimiter
while there is some disk savings from using short key names since as you can see by looking at the spec the key name is embedded in the document it looks to me like there d be almost no net difference between the two designs in terms of on-disk spaces used -- the extra bytes you use by using the delimiter - get bought back by not having to have string terminators for the separate key values

12241131
rockmongo	mongovue
instead of using a desktop ui like mongovue you could install one of the web-based admin uis such as rockmongo

12241418
hash	salt	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
about the constants mentioned in the code the guide says that m ake sure your salt is at least as long as the hash function s output. am i right in assuming that pbkdf2_salt_bytes and pbkdf2_hash_bytes are both set to 24 bytes since the output of the pbkdf2 function would be just 24 bytes not 32 for 256 bits since the underlying algorithm used is sha256

there is not api to get the items from the app though so you need to put the list in an easily parsable format xml json csv etc on your server and have the app check and update its storefront if new items are available

12241752
put	get
how could i get 2.23 to never put the wifi to sleep

128bit	64bit
your value has to be inserted as a string as it s far beyond 128bit what can be represented as a normal number in php in both 64bit and 32bit editions

12241798
int	chars
the equality operator compares only primitive types int chars etc but not user-defined types or arrays a string is a chars array

12241798

you have to use strcmp or strncmp to compare the first n bytes from an optional offset

12241834
width	height
if you assign height and width to your image if that is not changing and if you have already set it in your css you need not put it along with

12241834
width	height
simply define image width and height in your css

12241838
post	get
you can get the post values for html file only through the form tag

12241853

awt	swing
use swing rather than awt for this

12241899
jtree	jtable	awt	swing
either is capable of doing it but swing is more modern and supports components jtree jtable .. and functionality double-buffering built-in key bindings plafs support for rich text that is missing from the awt apis

12241899
awt	swing
in awt you might use a canvas for drawing the waveform but in swing you would use either of the following

you very well may need to make post or put request

12241996
pop-up	dialog
if i wait a little longer more dialog boxes pop-up on top of each other

12242011
width	height
is it possible to access the screen s width and height in css media queries to write a dynamic url like this

12242011
width	height
here width and height are variables which would be dynamically set to whatever the user s width and height is

12242018

12242127
button	checkbox
now what i would like it to do is as the user is typing in each textbox it will output automatically to the notes_view textbox and also the same with the checkbox needs to keep the formatting and predetermined lines of text as well and then the user can just push one button that will copy it to the clipboard without having to use the file to store the information

12243655
testunit	simplecov
i know that both rspec and testunit can live in the same project but i haven t been able to see how simplecov will generate coverage for both test frameworks

12243655

does the input bitmap have to have a width and height that are powers of 2 or can i let opengl take only the part that it wants which will have this rule

12244682
width	height
you could handle this by checking if the width height then its landscape

12244682
width	height
and if the height width then its portrait.

12244682
width	height
client height and width is different between browsers though the

if you can t block while waiting for input then you can use select to check if the stdin_fileno file descriptor is ready for reading and if it is then you can use normal input functions scanf fgets std getline etc.

12245264
inherited	subclassing
this have worked nicely and the code is pretty straight forward but it does not work with multiple inherited because the constructor call will be to the subclassing instead of baseclass and that will create a stack overflow

12245283

12245727
textview	imageview
i think you can use a relativelayout within the framelayout for the imageview and the textview and by using the parameters you can navigate the textview to the white box

12245727
textview	imageview
you can add the imageview block first and then the textview so that the textview will lay over the imageview and by using align bottom and specifying top margin with a negative value you can make the textview go over the image

12245727
width	height
use your images and values for the height and width

12245744
selecteditem	selectedindex
the tag property is easily accessible from the code but from the ui it will be quite tough complext to bind to - all because the treeview itself exposes only a selecteditem selectedindex properties that returns usually the data items not the treeviewitems

12245756

12246031
try-catch	exception-handling
looked at this way you can see that the dispose will indeed be called if the exception-handling throws because the try-finally is outside of the try-catch

12246041
implements	extends
you are instead passing a mock object which implements the same interface or extends the server abstraction class

12246045

12246634
google-chrome	firefox
what is the most responsible doesn t kill other browser windows and portable works at least with firefox and google-chrome under linux of achieving this

12246651
button	checkbox
this also still assumes that your checkbox radio button will be grouped by having the same name

12246652

while google-chrome shows correct well-formed json output firefox and also tested in in opera only show null even for simplest string like usa

12247155
nuxeo	documentum
nuxeo is based on open source but you have to pay the license and is pretty expensive at this point documentum is better anyway

12247277
min	max	width	height
others suggested overriding measureoverride and setting window s min max height and width there but this seems to be somewhat unclean considering that such a trivial problem should surely have a purely declarative solution

12247341

12248382
width	height
i am expecting a hash in the console like width 100 height 100 but i am not really sure how to do that

12248396

if the width gets smaller the height should get larger accordingly to display the whole content

12248401
base-class	derived-class
you ll have to call the base-class function from the derived-class override

12248421
getter	setter
you can do this using the getter and setter methods

12248426

12248666
implements	extends
i don t know if it s really important to you to demand in your observer but if it s only optional you can still implements or extends splobserver but make the optional it lets you do that

12249000
postgresql	informix
for this sort of answer i would recommend postgresql informix or oracle

if you use typical rest approach like resteasy which is jax-rs implementation you are bound to use http - it is by design all that get post content type stuff is connected with http communication handling

12249021
versioning	upgrade
so it may be working now but it may not work in the not so distant future when you upgrade to mysql versioning x where the optimizer will be clever enough to understand that order by inside a derived table is redundant and can be eliminated

here children will contain the descandants of parent

12249246
google-chrome	safari
however since the preferred font for most browsers is now svg safari seems to have trouble handling letter-spacing as in - it just ignores it however google-chrome does not

12249246

touchesmoved	touchesended	uiview	uiwindow
solved using a custom uiview that implements touchesbegin touchesmoved touchesended methods and forward the touches using hitest function back to the main uiwindow

12263521
versioning	upgrade
it has the versioning guid etc which will be used during upgrade uninstalling etc

12263521

12263658
base	fractions
the problem is that some fractions values can t be exactly represented in base 2

12263666
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the tooltips work fine in google-chrome safari but in firefox and ie when you hover over a point while the respective tooltip does appear it shows up outside the graph svg element in the top left hand corner of the screen html element instead of next to the point

12263688
base	fractions
the numbers will in general be stored in base 2 so fractions numbers are unlikely to correspond precisely to concise decimal strings

12263750
mouseover	mouseleave
and i want to handle the mouseover and mouseleave event for each option element of the i don t want handle the mouseover mouseleave event for the select

12263805
post	get
now when you post the form you will get the selected languageid in the selectedlanguage property of your viewmodel

12263807
stdout	stderr
if you want to write something more rigorous that treats stdout and stderr separately you ll need to use proc_open instead php stderr after exec

12263850

12263921
button	checkbox
dont add onitemclicklistener for the listview rather add onclick for your required button and for checkbox do it like this

12263962
width	height
if you need some padding you can tweak the x y width height attributes on the filter element

12263967
google-chrome	safari
it assumes that such things work on svg elements unfortunately that assumption is incorrect outside of google-chrome safari

12263967
google-chrome	safari
it seems that google-chrome safari have put these on their svg elements but there s no specification that says that that should be the case

12263993
implements	extends
first of all if you are creating the custom dialog then you have to to extends the dialog class to read the response and implements the onclicklistener

12264322
opera	firefox
in opera firefox etc the user login and logout works fine

12264334
apache	nginx
you ll need to set the permissions of the directory to that of the webserver probably apache nginx or similiar as that s what is executing the php

12264348
pull	push
so it will ignore the file in all the operations like merge pull push .

12264362
range	max
i have to perform count max avg on various columns total 20 odd queries for same data range

12264363
postgresql	mysql
as i know mysql doesn t have a array type like postgresql so you have to fetch it one by one

12264424
google-chrome	firefox
since the test cases must run against google-chrome firefox and ie we are currently passing around a webdriver object for our driver

12264424
google-chrome	firefox
do i need to create a new interface sandwiched between the google-chrome firefox and ie drivers and the javascriptexecutor interface - something like this

12264462
hide	show
if so you should just load them up to begin with and use javascript to show and hide the appropriate dropdown onclick of the radio button

12264469
public	protected
basically you want to test each public and possibly protected method that can possibly fail

12264518

12264536
rss	feed	opml	feed	opml	rss
appears not to import opml but can support rss feed

12264536
rss	feed
by hand can setup the same rss feed as igoogle or netvibes

12264559
super	self
why we should make such assignment self super init

12264563
superclass	subclassing
which returns an instance of the superclass which is not what you want in a subclassing constructor init

12264563
superclass	subclassing
is needed if the superclass has members variables or other objects to initialize first before setting up the subclassing members

12264664
min	max
do you want an aggregate function like max order.payment or min order.payment

12264664
min	max	range	max	range	min
if what you want as you say in a comment to another answer is to validate your date range criteria was applied return the max and min range of values like

12264669
getdate	dateadd
effectivedate dateadd mm -4 getdate

12264680
rar	zip
jquery.pack.js - smaller in size - but requires unpacking time sort of like a rar zip would

12264692
onbeforeunload	onload
my first thought was to simply tap that onbeforeunload event by redirecting the page to a generic page which would hold onload code to close the popup

12264692
pop-up	dialog
instead i choose to check for changes in the iframe document when a close event happens and display a dialog which can be modified too and clearly indicates that you are performing an action on the pop-up and not on the page which could be interpreted as the parent page of the modal

12264701
realloc	malloc
i mean it is define structure rather than class allocate memory through malloc and realloc and calloc.in recent they have installed boost library so i am planning to use into my existing code base so i have some following question

12264701
free	malloc
can i use std shared_ptr with malloc and free

12264701
calloc	malloc
will it impact any functionality if i create std shared_ptr in my application and pass this pointer to another function which uses malloc or calloc

12264751
min	max
the obvious answer to select min zonemin max zonemin from plant in linq to sql is

12264751
min	max
however this answer actually retrieves each of min and max and if you include other aggregate functions like count and average in separate sql queries

12264751
min	max
i also say obvious because the obvious answer to me aggregate p in plants into min p.zonemin max p.zonemin actually retrieves the whole table twice even when optimised and then uses the linq-to-entities min and max to obtain the result -

12264811
post	get
i have seen this blog post automatic login for sharepoint using claims authentication but the code on the site doesn t appear to be complete i cannot get it working

12264822
bids	ssis
the only difference i can see between my ssis custom component dll and the console application is that my component references system.windows.forms and uses bids

12264826
free	malloc
can i use shared_ptr with malloc and free

12264826
calloc	malloc
if i create shared_ptr in my application and pass this pointer to another function if they are using malloc or calloc

12264856
free	malloc
to use a std shared_pointer with malloc and free you should specify a custom deleter

12264872
width	margin
edit i found the culprit i assigned a top margin in but all top bottom left right margin values are defined as of the width of the parent.

12264885
wordpress	joomla
i don t want to use things like wordpress or joomla or blogger

12264892
min	max
i want to generate another table which includes all numbers from min tick to max tick as tick values

12264905
for-loop	loops
i can do this another way by using a for-loop but i am just wondering what i ve done wrong with this while loops

12264920
openssl	crypto++
apparently crypto++ and also openssl doesn t support tofb-i operation mode

12264924
implements	extends
for that i implements a class which extends service and called its oncreate method

12264928
chown	sudo
you may have to pre-pend sudo to the chown command above or find other means to run it as root ... reply back if you get stuck.

12264930

12264999
post	get
i get an exception on the last line of the following code sorry for the format won t let me post it any other way

12265013

i ve read all the post on this site relating to it and tried all diferrent combinations of path and i ve also nowgot the pie file in loads of folders but no-matter what i can t seem to get it to get it to work on ie8

12265013
put	get
edit i ve tried creating a sinple one page website to test and i can get it to work alright so it must be a problem of where to put the htc file

12265019
onmouseover	onclick
on a side note try to never use any onclick onmouseover etc events on any dom elements each one individually creates a script block within legacy browsers ie and with hundreds thousands of elements on a page it can deteriorate performance

12265069
free	malloc
can i use shared_ptr with malloc and free

12265069
free	malloc
remember that malloc and free only deal with raw memory and you re responsible for correctly creating and destroying any non-trivial objects you might want to keep in that memory

12265069
calloc	malloc
if i create shared_ptr in my application and pass this pointer to another function if they are using malloc or calloc

12265069
realloc	calloc
how will handle with realloc and calloc

12265069
free	calloc
it s fine to initialise the shared pointer with the result of calloc or anything else that returns memory to be released using free

12265069
free	realloc
you can t use realloc since shared_ptr has taken ownership of the original pointer and won t release it without calling free

12265112
ant	maven
i am pretty new to maven ant hence please excuse me if my question sounds silly to you.

12265112
ant	maven
what frameworks libraries like maven or ant will i require to be installed on that virtual machine in addition to jre for this to work

i just want to have this fadein fadeout effect and two images to shuffle between 6 seconds

12265241
ant	maven
you likely won t need ant maven deployed remotely

12265267
google-chrome	firefox
there is some different between firefox and google-chrome browser

12265272
width	height
the most important thing is the ratio between height and width that should be lesser than 1 3

12265291
int	chars
.nextint gets the next int but doesn t read the new line chars

12265305
nfa	dfa
the way i did it was to combine all the expressions in one pretty big nfa and converted that same thing into one dfa

12265317
width	margin
simply put when you want an image to go to 100 of the monitor then you need to put it into a container with width as 100 and margin auto not fixed width and no position at all

12265343
mouseup	mousedown
i store each mousedown and mouseup event in an array and on each frame i loop through the events to set the appropriate flags

12265608
put	get	post	put	post	get
my team has taken decision to use post for all rest verbs because get put delete exposes id in the url

12265608

everybody seems to be agreed to use post http method for get put delete and pass http_method as parameter and using the parameter decide what operation to do

12265613

from experience you ll end up running into a few issues with various browsers using width and height

12265620

is it possible for captivate 6 to exchange data with a php script via post get while maintaining our ability to package our module into scorm

12265620

carrierwave	minimagick
i have installed carrierwave to handle the upload along with graphicmagick to process the images installed correctly and minimagick installed successfully using gem install mini_magick

12265667
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if this is the case i suggest you move the code in your first view controller in viewdidload or better yet in viewdidappear as this view controller will always get loaded

12265696
cos	sin
now use the pythagoras theorem to get the distance from the middle point of ab to the middle point of the circle and calculate the position of the circle shouldn t be hard from here using basic sin cos combinations

12265702
outputstream	inputstream
if you see in the above code itext is not using any inputstream parameter rather it is writing directly to response s outputstream

12265702
getter	setter
i know that my class should have getter and setter for inputstream and i have that too in the class mentioned in struts-configuration

12265702
outputstream	inputstream
but since itext doesn t really need inputstream rather it is writing directly to response s outputstream i get exceptions since am not setting anything for the inputstream parameter

12265715
width	height
i want to customize the height and width of the jtextfield objects

12265715
width	height
i have tried with the setsize method passing width and height as dimensions and as int as well

12265721
portrait	landscape
this is important because on phones it is only used in portrait and on tablets it is only used in landscape

12265721
width	height
i then changed only the android version to 3.1 did not change width height and density and it worked as expected - the default layouts were used

12265722
width	height
first you might want to create a dict to contain the base width and height of each item

12265886
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
all of the sections have fill_parent as the width and 0dp as the height and there are no padding or margin properties on any of the 3 children of the top level linearlayout

12265886
width	height
ideally the width will always stretch to the entirety of the screen and the height will scale proportionally so that the buttons will line up with the grid in the background

uilabel	uibutton
001 does set the titlelabel text property but as its a uilabel a subview of the uibutton it does not cause the ui to be redrawn

width	height
your variable height stores width of screen and variable width stores height you have defined the glviewport and in gluperspective you think your are taking ratio width by height but actually you are taking ratio height by width so it occurs the problem

setinterval	settimeout	google-chrome	firefox
from what i know in newer versions of both firefox and google-chrome background tabs have settimeout and setinterval clamped to 1000ms to improve performance

12266360
equals	gethashcode
whether that s a good thing or not is debatable some would prefer the c++ approach where an object need not have any sense of being equals to another but once done it does make sense that all objects also have a gethashcode because of the link between one and the other

12266436
width	height
just out of curiosity could you add the width and height attribute to the image of that says tmla you deverve to be here

12266436

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	webkit	blink	google-chrome	safari
since safari makes use of the webkit engine and so does android the second block of code targets the whole apple lineup and any desktop or mobile device with google-chrome or the newer versions of opera that make use of the blink engine a fork of webkit

12270267
getter	setter
my customview has a bunch of setter and getter

12270291

the auto value for the margin css property will work only if a width is set

12270302
children	parent
on a certain event where a tabbed element get highlighted or selected i want to disable the click function below and all click functions for the parent button and all the children elements within the column

12270305
google-chrome	firefox
in mozilla firefox it displays the image in center while in google-chrome it displays it of left-middle of the screen.

12270305
width	height
i e max height width .

12270320
packets	pcap
it currently writes only in pcap format which means there s a 24-byte header at the beginning of the file giving information such as the link-layer header type for packets in the file so the first thing you d need to do would be to subtract 24 from the size of the file

12270320
packets	pcap
therefore what you should do is write a program use libpcap as it already knows pcap format and you don t have to write your own code to understand it that reads all the packets and adds up the length of the packets field it s the len field in the struct pcap_pkthdr structure

12270360
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie8 9 and google-chrome all run with the desired effect

12270399
width	height
jquery assumes that any element that has a width and height of 0 is already hidden and therefore wont try and hide it again with a fade-out

12270399
google-chrome	firefox
now why it was working in firefox and google-chrome is a different issue but might be relevant to what you re doing

12270399
width	height
i am setting the width and height of my divs dynamically by examining the dimensions of an img file that is contained in it

12270399
google-chrome	firefox
i was using the direct .width and .height properties on the elements which works in firefox and google-chrome but ie likely doesnt set those properties for images and for ie i was getting back 0

12270403
min	max
to allow the browser to scale your content you need to set user-scalable yes then to disable zoom you can set the min and max scale to the same value so it cannot shrink or grow

12270403
min	max
android 4.x same rule apply as 2.3.x except the min and max scales are not honored anymore and if you use user-scalable yes the user can always zoom setting it to no means your own scale is ignored this is the issue i m facing now that drew me to this question.

12270403
min	max
you don t need min and max since you can switch off zooming in the expected manner

12270403
min	max
chrome scales work as expected like they do in ios min and max are honored and you can switch off zooming by using user-scalable no

12270412
post	get
i saw a few post about get columns from subqueries most of them suggest use a single select for each column but this is my case

12270416
portrait	landscape
i am allowing the user to use the hardware camera button to take a picture which may be accomplished in either portrait or landscape mode

12270427
versioning	upgrade
so after we ran some tests we upgrade the ibm data dll to versioning 9.7.6.2

12270433
rss	feed
what you can however do is host the whole calendar yourself and if the user has outlook or similiar to subscribe to that rss feed

12270437
button	checkbox
when user clicks the button i need a modal dialog to display a message containing a hyperlink to an agreement doc and a checkbox for the user to confirm they ve read an agreement

12270437
button	checkbox
after closing the dialog if then the continue button opens the same dialog loop until checkbox is clicked

12270440
tiff	bmp
you need to use bmp or possibly uncompressed tiff

12270440
bmp	png
i think if it were me i d use bmp scan the pixels for changes and construct a png where everything except the changes were transparent

12270461
post	get
so if i am inserting a news item that can be read by restricted and confidential i would set read_roles to have a value of 2 | 4 or 6 and when i want to get back the news post that a particular user can see i can use a query like

12270462
children	parent
1500 objects with an average of 13 properties per object and an average of 3 object within each of the 1500 parent object as children also being populated with an average of 13 properties a piece - boast these times for my comparison

12270473
factors	matrix
factorization is the decomposition of an object for example a number a polynomial or a matrix into a product of other objects or factors which when multiplied together give the original

12270509
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but it doesn t in ie9-7 nor google-chrome

12270580
int	boolean
effectively you can fit four or more boolean columns for one int column eight or more for a bigint

12270629
inherited	subclassing
might want to watch for subclassing of known valid types though as even if they inherited from a valid serializable type their implementation may not be

12270629
serializable	deserialization
in fact you may want to separate out the serializable deserialization aspects to their own discrete method class so you can feed in other serializable or be more clear from the stack trace where the issue is or simply to make your methods do one thing and one thing only but any more rewriting refactoring is really left for code-review anyway and not valid much for the question at hand

12270645
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr

12270645
stdout	stderr
however this solution doesn t generalise to the case where you want to do this for both stdout and stderr while satisfying the following

12270645
stdout	stderr
the output from stdout stderr should go to the parent process stdout stderr respectively

12270645
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
the order between stdout and stderr lines should not be changed i m not quite sure how that would even work if the subprocess fflush its stdout and stderr caches at different intervals

12270667
vbscript	jscript
i am writing the script in jscript but i have reproduced the problem in vbscript as well

12270737
subtract	add
subtract that from the overall price to get the cents and then use the case statement add the correct .05 or .09 back to the price

12270739
implements	extends
but even then it s useless as an abstract factory because the way that you implements a new concrete version of the factory is by creating a new class that extends inputstream

12270750
hide	show
i m trying to do a simple hide show effect depending on what radio button is checked

12270750
hide	show
i want the hidden table #reprint_oui to show when the user clicks oui ...and hide if non is selected

12270778
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
one of these is a uibutton that calls when touchupinside one is a uisegmentedcontrol that calls when valuechanges

12270778
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
what i need to do is to ask if sender is a uibutton or if sender is a uisegmentedcontrol

12270788
multiplying	add
if the int is odd multiplying it by three and add one

12270793
superclass	subclassing
so far what i have thought of doing is making an invoice superclass with a customer and vehicle subclassing since vehicle information and customer information is on the invoice

12270822
onchange	onkeyup
you can change with onkeyup or onchange

12270862
submit	submission
if you re submission the form without using the form s submit handler then the wymupdate class won t work and you won t get the implicit wym.xhtml call which means that some necessary html cleanup might not occur

12270880
portrait	landscape
on an ipad when i change its orientation from portrait to landscape the page will continuously reload with the portrait orientation all is well

12270885
stdout	stderr
create two readers as above one for stdout one for stderr and start each in a new thread

12270984
stdout	stderr
i made a second attempt specifying both stdout and stderr

12270995
screens	tablet
note this works fine on my kindle fire and 7 tablet where the screens size is 600x1024 ish

12271021
feof	fread
either check the return of fread or call feof to check your status or both

12271051
google-chrome	firefox
for example i d like to be able to run it on google-chrome firefox etc

12271069
hide	show
so this will either show or hide all drugs

12271085
width	height
while loading the image of size 767 x 1105 on a phone layout with resolution 320 x 480 the image width fits the device width but the height of the image is stretched which disturbs an aspect ratio

another important thing i can say is that you shouldn t build a hierarchy of elements that aren t relationed for example you shouldn t build a superclass vehicle and two subclassing car and horse maybe you think they share some features but they aren t in the same category of elements a more studied hierarchy is better in that case

keydown	keyup
rather than trying to react directly to the keydown event i d suggest you use the keydown and keyup events to maintain a list of which keys are presently down

12273538
keydown	keyup
you ll notice that this lets you handle multiple keys at once if the user presses the left and up arrows together and the problem of delay between subsequent keydown events when a key is held down goes away since all you really care about is whether a keyup has occurred

stdout	stderr
i m working in a windows cmd.exe environment and would like to change the output of stdout to match that of stderr so that i can pipe error messages to other programs without the intermediary of a file

12273866

i m aware of the notation but that combines stdout and stderr into a single stream

12273866

but that combines stdout and stderr just like

put	get
but where would i put the end part of the timer to calculate the difference and how would i get it into the footer of my html template

12273964
put	get
to access the different fields it invokes get put methods on hashmap

that s because when you submit the form with it still runs the submit handler which unconditionally prevents the form from submission

12274088
implements	extends
finally i had to write my own class which extends gesturedetector.and you can implements scale by yourself

12274145
stdout	stderr
you want to first redirect 2 stderr to 1 stdout then redirect 1 stdout to something else

12274145
stdout	stderr
at this point stderr will still be redirected to the previous definition of stdout

12274145
stdout	stderr
the pipe will still work with the old definition of stdout which now contains stderr

12274145
stdout	stderr
if you still want to see stdout on the console but you only want to pipe stderr to find then you can redirect 1 to con

12274145
stdout	stderr
it is possible to truly swap stdout and stderr if you use a 3rd initially unused file handle

12274145
stdout	stderr
1 and 3 will contain original definition of stderr and 2 will contain original definition of stdout

12274145
stdout	stderr
but saves the original definition of stderr in 4 3 has already been used and saves the original definition of stdout in 5

12274145
stdout	stderr
so technically the explicit redirection of 3 is not needed to swap stderr and stdout

12274145
stdout	stderr
saves stderr in 3 and 2 is redirected to 1 stdout

12274145
stdout	stderr
saves stdout in 4 and 1 is redirected to 3 stderr

12274164
width	height
the image had to be translated by half it s width height along the axis it was being rotated

12274175
width	height
these values reflect the actual dimensions of the source mediastream and can differ from the width and height attributes of the element as rendered on the page

border-box the width of the element includes the padding and border

width	border-box
while the border-box model will set the width of the div to

integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer see footnote 41

12275310
integer	unsigned
footnote 41 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

12275313
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

getter	setter
and generate the setter getter stubs of lines

12275914
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the former has many advantages it can t leave partially written file around it can t leave both files around it is very fast and if you use it to rename over old file there is no period where the target name wouldn t exist the last is posix semantics and windows can do it on ntfs but not fat filesystems

seems you are doing it wrongly instead you can have two elements and hide and show them accordingly and .toggle method itself comes with animation properties

12276227
accessor	properties
you must create an accessor method for example getid which will then return the value of id properties

12276237
int	boolean
the last two statements compare boolean against an int

12276237
int	boolean
by placing parts of your expression in brackets those parts get evaluated first and you end up with comparing int and boolean

12276239
int	boolean
your second two examples force one comparison to be evaluated first resulting in a boolean value which is then compared with the remaining int

12276249
width	height
you have setup height and width of the scheduler container

12276263
mouseup	mousedown
you have your the wrong way round in the mousedown and mouseup events

if the extension uses standard magento getter setter maybe may work too

12276371
getter	setter
the varien_object class defines the standard getter setter i was talking about so yes you can also use to get the value

12276371
getter	setter
to understand how these getter setter work i d recommend to check the varien_object and read about phps magic methods like __call __get and __set

12276529
int	double
instead of casting double to int consider using int32 or uint32 arrays in matlab

12276529
int	double
casting double to int is expensive

12276529
int	double
you do it because the varletlist is a double array that is the case by default in matlab which holds int values

12276529
int	double
do remove double to int cast

12276545
for-loop	arrays
first alert showing a length of 58 i.e length of attributes arrays but the control is not going into the for-loop

onkeyup	onkeydown
just changed onkeydown method to onkeyup and now it sticks

12277266
width	height

calculation of the next double involves computing a large int based on the seed and dividing it by another constant large int and the magnitude of the result is mostly affected by the magnitude of the int

i m wondering if it is necessary to call through the super class oncreate and ondestroy methods when overriding these methods in my implementation as it happens when you override such methods in an activity

12288657
oncreate	ondestroy
i would recommend calling super.oncreate as the first thing that you do in your implementation of oncreate and calling super.ondestroy as the last thing that you do in your implementation of ondestroy

my current simplistic solution is to put only 1 character at a time into the queue so the consumer will only get one character at a time

12289606
outputstream	inputstream
once the side writing closes its outputstream the inputstream will deliver any bytes that have not yet been read and then the next read after that will return -1 to indicate end of input

12296188
getter	setter
this feels very much like getter and setter - not quite as bad but there s a lot of get this information from that class and hand it to this one which has an inefficient feel to it - lots of extra methods lots of extra reads and writes and the classes have to know a lot about each other s logic which feels wrong

12296210

12296251
accessor	properties
object.create cannot be accurately polyfilled to ecma 3 since it can be used to specifiy properties with accessor functions though the above will work for props which use value instead of get or set

12296275
hash	md5
you can change hash function to sha256 md5 or anything but it will not work well if your db is already filled with sha1-hashed passwords

12296838
int	double
there is another problem that you implicitly convert the double into int

12296880
width	height
this will also keep the node in place and image width height

12296888
width	height
the problem is due to the fact that you have not defined the height and width attributes of the elements

12296888
width	height
as per the html specification the canvas element has two attributes to control the size of the coordinate space width and height

12296888
width	height
the width attribute defaults to 300 and the height attribute defaults to 150.

12296888
width	height
so your default width and height is getting set to 300 and 150 and because of the your top left bottom right attributes in rect it is going out of the canvas size

12296888
width	height
set it explicitly to a larger width and height and you will see your rectangles

12296895
google-chrome	safari
it seems that google-chrome and safari treated the nodes as invalid when using setendafter if the nodes were not part of the document

12297107
nsstream	nsoutputstream
the only way you can do it is register your application as voip type the most problematic part because if your app is not a messenger conference social type app apple may refuse it and then use nsstream in couple with nsinputstream nsoutputstream and interface to send receive heartbeat

12297141

12297251
getter	setter
with getter and setter

12297355
for-loop	arrays
finally you iterate over your arraylist with a for-loop and write the contents of the arrays to the dataoutputstream preceded or followed by the additional data you need to add for each chunk

12297383
int	double
double is bad as we can lose some data precision biginteger is good but only for int values

12297385
int	chars
i would probably write a helper function int is_vowel chars c

12297424
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

i get far more than 50 post

12297727
post	get
so is it enough only to use limit to get more than 50 post

12297783
yesod	happstack
and you should probably look into snap yesod or happstack for serving the content

12297816
google-chrome	firefox
i use ajax for call remote webpage this works on firefox google-chrome and ie correctly

12297852
jobs	cron
and click on cron jobs

12297904

so when the user selects a number of checkbox that are being ajax stored in the backend into the emp_collection the user then presses a button that calls a javascript function that basically performs a .dialog open call which all works fine

12297977
oncreate	setcontentview
add below two line code into your main activity s oncreate method after setcontentview line it will solve your problem

12297979
rel	attr
open jquery.prettyphoto.js presumably non-minified one and perform find replace function of your text-editor replace all occurrences of attr rel with attr data-gal

12298001
updatepanel	onclientclick
to refresh the updatepanel by clicking in gridview1 you could add a javascript onclientclick handler to the links in girdview1

12298009

12298046
maven	pom.xml
in this situation is there some way of using maven modules to store the beanstalk-maven-plugin config in a separate pom.xml to that of the actual software project

12298054
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
jaxb apis are bundled in jdk1.6 but these are not available in jdk 1.6 ex jdk1.5

12298054

12298255
post	get
the first line below is for the post and the second is for the get of mainpagecourt

12298264
int	double
then you have to know that in the xxxtablemodel is stored only string value or double or long or int or icon depends of value stored in comboboxmodel for combo box as an editor

12298273
mouseout	mouseenter
use jquery hover instead of mouseenter mouseout

12298277
mouseover	mouseout
because the mouseover and mouseout events bubble they will trigger multiple times as you mouseover and mouseout of child elements of the element your event handlers are watching

12298277
mouseleave	mouseenter
jquery provides the ie-inspired mouseenter and mouseleave events which only trigger for mouse events on the watched elements themselves and are not triggered for events on the element s children

12298277
mouseover	mouseleave
use the mouseover and mouseleave events and your code will work as expected

12298277
mouseleave	mouseenter
alternatively use the jquery hover syntax which internally uses the mouseenter and mouseleave events wrapped in a convenient syntax

12298344
super	extends
then extends it in subclasses by calling super

12298345
hide	show
i have a form with several buttons that i hide and show as needed

12298347
super	implements
this means the user can make as many updates as they want but they won t show until the super user accepts them it also means the data is never destroyed stored in the version table and they don t need to implements rollback as it s already there

12298435
versioning	upgrade
check your tar versioning and upgrade if needed

12298442
scatter	graphing
solved my problem by using a scatter graphing instead of a line graph.

12298469
nsurl	nsstring
i wrote a simple category to extend nsstring nsurl that lets you extract url query parameters individually or as a dictionary of key value pairs

12298527
children	parent
therefore the movement of superview in it s parent s coordinate space does not effect it s children

12298587
for-loop	loops
then i tried to use a for-loop that loops in 4912 but it gives me number like

12298606
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-shade-plugin
you can use maven-shade-plugin instead of maven-assembly-plugin to merge these files correcly as described here

12298620
google-chrome	firefox
- it s great debugging - at least in firefox and google-chrome

12298623
super	extends
a good way to think about extends and super in generics is in terms of assignment t extends foo will accept any type t that you could use on the right hand side of an assignment to foo without casting

12298678
fileoutputstream	filewriter
along those lines you should at least consider using outputstreamwriter wrapping a fileoutputstream instead of filewriter - that way you can specify the encoding to use utf-8

12298766
int	chars
with single quotes it s an ascii chars without quotes it s just an int value

12298783
int	double
i am facing a problem with the conversion of value from double to int

12298783
int	double
conversion from double to int may remove decimal part but int part should remain

12298795
post	get
as to your concrete question about maintaining the url after a function function is the wrong term you probably meant method action method is used just use get instead of post

12298802
google-chrome	firefox
altered the jsfiddle and tested on both firefox 15 and google-chrome

12298810
google-chrome	firefox
at least in firefox google-chrome not ie

12298815
children	parent
setting a layout different from null to all the children of parent component fixes the issue and keeps the layout to look as if they were all null layout.

12298824
int	double
the built-in data types int long and even double can t hold the result of that calculation

12298828
floating-point	fractions
converting a floating-point value to an integral value removes the fractions part provided the result can be represented in the integral type the value isn t too large to fit

12298884
children	parent
give relative position to parent and absolute position to children

12298924
versioning	upgrade
unlike db migration scripts config doesn t execute to upgrade something to versioning x to versioning y

12298982

opera	google-chrome
everything works fine in opera and google-chrome browsers

12299179
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome but it should be very similar with firefox

12299273
children	parent
i think it s quite a frequent task to define the layout where the guiding role of the sizing during measure pass of the layout conditionaly swithces from children to parent and back

12299274
google-chrome	firefox
the problem happens in all ie google-chrome firefox

12299294
google-chrome	firefox
my code displays fine in google-chrome firefox ie9 but in ie8 it displays this error

12299330
profiling	instrumentation
when i run the visual studio 2010 performance profiling in instrumentation mode i get no instrumentation information for the f# class other than where it was called by the c# application

12299351
post	get
one post mentioned that if you defined a category but did not actually implement the method you can get crashes like yours the compiler does not enforce the existence of category methods

12299353
google-chrome	firefox
this worked great with firefox 14.0.1 google-chrome 21 and even ie 10

12299353
