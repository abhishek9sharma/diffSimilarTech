folder	directory
secondly there are pas files and those are usually found by going through the directory in your global library path - the installer usually sets that up for you and in jedi s case it usually points at the dcu files instead of the pas files -- if you didn t mess up your library path since the installer ran then it should contain the paths of all the delphi units including the jedi jvcl ones and other component vendor s folder

getter	setter
the number of input fields in the form can vary at runtime and hence the action class can not have fixed setter and getter for the parameters

swt	swing
..so i guess swt and swing don t mix together

10901164
awt	swing	swt	swing
it is generally not a good idea to mix swing awt swt components in the same top-level container

10901164
awt	swing
it is not a problem to open an awt filedialog over a swing based jframe since they are both top-level containers

10901164
awt	swing	swt	swing
i am pretty sure the same would apply to swing swt or awt swt

google-chrome	firefox
i guess google-chrome must have an html method on its raw dom elements but evidently firefox doesn t

width	height
then used width attribute to define the height at the bottom of the page when you play with that you are actually playing with the height there.

10901693
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
and for the empty left space visible after rotation i used the variable width height as negative margin

10901699
width	height
also you haven t specified what to do with the overflow if the table exceeds the width height settings specified in css so the browser is just relying on what it is told to do which by default for a table is to expand beyond the limits specified

10901714
actionscript	mxml
the mxml is generated into actionscript under the hood by the flex compiler

10901714
actionscript	mxml
mxml should be viewed as an actionscript code generation language

10901714
actionscript	mxml
that won t work in an actionscript only class and it won t work inside of an mxml class

10901821
put	get
higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost reflected in most of the operations of the hashmap class including get and put

10901827

10901963
hide	show
in my example link i have used a show hide javascript effect but the resulting overflow is getting hidden because my iframe can t communicate

10901990
children	parent
if the parent block needs to split because it is holding addresses for too many children a similar process takes place

serializable	deserialization
so another way is to implement an iterator which iterates over the composite tree structure and serializable every object and one iterator for the deserialization

10902240
getter	setter
- you have to provide a setter and a getter for every parameter you wannt to serialize

10902240
getter	setter
so how do you call the setter getter of the derived classes

10902290
gridview	sqldatasource

rspec	capybara
i m a bit new to rails rspec capybara so this is probably a newbie question but google didn t help as much as i would have hoped

call databind on the relevant object in your case it is probably the sqldatasource otherwise is generally the gridview

10902349
udp	tcp
i m pretty sure i ve got the last three steps right no firewall ports 80 tcp udp 80 server ip assigned by mac address but i don t know how to do the first i ve tried playing around in httpd.conf by setting the servername to my external ip address but thats just a wild random fail

10902353
audiotrack	audiorecord
moreover both strategies suggested by yahma and tom fail on this particular phone as it is possible to receive a positive minimum-buffer size from an unsupported configuration and worse i ve been forced to reset the phone to get the audio stack working again after attempting to use an audiorecord class initialized from parameters that produce a supposedly valid non-exception raising audiotrack or audiorecord instance

10902429
setinterval	settimeout
if this is not possible practical you can use a mutually scoped variable as a flag change value in the response callback functions and then use settimeout and recursion or setinterval to keep looking for a change in your flag variable and when you see it change then pop the next .post request

10902441
mathml	mathjax

the code works on firefox but while safari calls into my interposed functions it ignores the redirection

10902728
firefox	safari
i m wondering if anyone has insight into why safari ignores the redirection and whether there s a way perhaps via addrinfo flags to get safari to behave as firefox does

10902733

onkeyup	onfocus
why are you calling showdata on onkeyup try to call function on onfocus instead of onkeyup

10902915

this control has ribbonbutton and while this button has a click event and it s well a button it seems caliburn doesn t auto fire the action when it s name match the viewmodel method one

10902938

the advantage of using properties is that you can apply different access modifiers for the getter and the setter

10902938
implements	extends
suppose for example that you want to extends your class to implements inotifypropertychanged

10902938

10902993
int	chars
the int argument shall be converted to an unsigned chars and the resulting byte shall be written

10903024
inherited	properties
take a look through the element inspector i like opera s dragonfly best to see if anything seems to have inherited an odd properties like an inherited 1 em or inherited 2 px

10903024
opera	google-chrome
keep in mind that the affected element may be non-obvious as i had to set margin-top and margin-bottom for my paragraph tags since opera s inspect element picked up an inheritance issue while google-chrome s only showed the table inheriting cellspacing even though my tables had cellspacing set to 0 just like you do

10903100

min	max
i have made a class in th constructor it defines a pin as pwm output en sets min fade max fade fade time etc

10903353
int	chars
c expects a chars which is an int value and prints it according to encoding rules

10903353
int	chars
one is instructions for interpreting a specific int value as an ascii chars and the other is iterating the contents of a memory location chars by chars and interpreting them until a zero value is encountered

10903401

lisp	prolog
i have used the allegrograph 3.3 python api before to do prolog queries on rdf data but i thought their prolog extension to allegro common lisp was kind of lacking because it was missing things like number comparison operators

10904912
lisp	prolog
i have since tried out allegrograph 4.6 and i found that anything missing from their prolog extension is made up for by the fact that you can use the lisp escape functor to write allegro common lisp expressions to take care of anything you need to do that isn t offered by the prolog extension

width	height
the aspect ratio of a window screen image or other rectangular object is simply its width divided by its height

10905465
width	height
also of interest if you know the aspect ratio 16 9 or 1.7778 and know the height of the screen 1080 pixels you can get the width of the screen by multiplying

10905465
width	height
similarly you can get the height of the screen from the aspect ratio and width by dividing

10905465
width	height
for example when you rotate a phone onto it s side its natural to think that the long edge has become the width of the screen and the short edge is it s height - however iirc most phone operating systems actually keep the width and height the same and leave it up to you to handle the fact that the screen is basically just tipped on its side

maven	m2e
you may have poms set up for your projects but for the m2e plugin to work you need to have either created the project as a maven project new - project... - maven - maven project... or converted it into a maven project by right clicking it then selecting configure - convert to maven project

10906635
maven	pom.xml
whenever you add a dependency to a pom.xml then the project s build path will be configured automatically although sometimes you may need to force it to do so by right clicking the project and selecting maven - update maven configuration

10906635
maven	m2e
for this to work the project must have workspace resolution enabled and the projects to be picked up need to be configured as m2e maven projects as well

10906635
folder	directory
one more thing that may help is that you should make sure that your source folder follow the maven default directory structure

10906635
maven	pom.xml	folder	directory
it is possible to configure a pom.xml to tell maven to expect your source code to be in different source folder but it is highly recommended that you follow the standard maven directory structure

the errors i get when i put on error reporting is

10906820
ppm	pbm
since your original images are png lossless bitmaps you can convert both to long-form pbm or a related format like long-form ppm

10906820
ppm	pbm
as storage formats pbm and ppm are egregiously inefficient but they are likewise egregiously easy to manipulate and that s what you want

10906820
ubuntu	debian
the pbm 5 manpage available for example on debian ubuntu systems in the netpbm package is well written and explains the process clearly

if it needs to be c compatible you can always typedef the struct as well

10906859
google-chrome	firefox
you ll eventually have to test in firefox ie etc but not really in google-chrome because they both use the same v8 engine you might want to do a cursory glance of course

10906859
client-side	server-side
with node.js you ll also have one of the faster server-side interpreters at your command faster than python and ruby roughly equal to lua and sometimes up to java s level and somehow v8 has the fastest regex engine in the world and then server-side code matches client-side code which makes things like rpc layers much nicer to work with

10906889
swt	swing
the problem with swing is the look and feels metal nimbus gtk... the worst out there compared to swt windows mac and gnome tool kit and getting good looking widgets is utopist yet i am asking the question though

10907225
prepare	execute
of course you probably won t need pdo fetch_both i recommend pdo fetch_obj for the same sort of functionality in a cleaner package and you ll probably want to take advantage of parametrized queries in which case you d call prepare instead of query then bind the parameters then call execute to fetch the results

10907227

10907297
pop-up	dialog
that s just a page that launches the dialog box not the actual dialog it s launched in a pop-up when you click the button so it s still part of their site on a page that detects if you ve allowed the facebook permissions

the memory at the other end unless previously free free or operator delete if it was dynamically allocated malloc and operator new or just cleaned up automatically because it was an auto all locals by default

10907389
post	get
sounds like it is being passed as call-by-reference rather than actually setting the value or more simplisticly that last row s input name of id is the last occurance in the html form which means it will be the only one to get post d

10907389
post	get
your this- input- post id would then be an array which you can get the key value with what id was clicked

10907396
hmac	md5
you d want to use something like hmac instead of your simpler md5 -- and you d want to use sha256 or larger since md5 is known to have weaknesses and sha-1 is starting to feel weak too

how can make my local host open in google-chrome instead of firefox

10907697

fourth observation the final line that creates pred cum_tt_z31 essentially just does a cumsum operation across the rows corresponding to each separate value of pred lookupnum using tapply which allows you to apply the same function over different groups of rows here we re grouping by pred lookupnum

getter	setter
though properties are made generally when you need to access some variable outside of the class mean getter n setter but in objective c an additional need to make property is that the memory management goes on compiler ends so if you are using some object not primitive data types then you should use property and synthesize it and then release in dealloc if you are using manual reference counting

10909094
getter	setter
normally i synthesize a property because i want to have access to the ivar from the outside of the class and also because i want a getter and setter methods

10909102
accessor	ivar
- you can customize the accessor methods for example to lazy instantiate an ivar or do something when a setting a new value like setneedsdisplay

10909102

- and least but not last - don t worry about performance issues if you have concernes that every time a getter or a setter is called.

10909274
put	get
what you are doing can be done if you put the string in an invisible div and then from extjs code get the div html in a variable and use it in your code

10909284
getter	setter
custom getter and setter if you like you can still write custom getter and setter and you can even just write a getter or setter and let the other one automatically synthesize

10909284
getter	setter
and you can write custom logic into such a getter and setter you can reload a tableview after a property has changed

10909284
getter	setter
dot notation you can access getter and setter via dot notation if you have the property

10909284
getter	setter
if you need you ivar to be public it is simpler to write one property than writing a getter and setter for a ivar

getter	setter
by simple i mean classes that have no-args constructors and have only getter and setter methods that directly relate to properties that will be present in the json object as it travels over the wire

if i use different layout for each screens size both devices says they are large-long and mdpi so i can t distinguish them by using layout folder names.

10911523
google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked this with developer tools in both google-chrome and firefox

the client ends up sending something that a http 1.0 proxy doesnt understand commonly an expect header as part of a http post or put request due to a standard protocol convention of sending the request in two parts as covered in the remarks here

10916014
post	put
as covered in the other answers if the specific issue you run into is that the expect header is causing the problem then that specific problem can be routed around by doing a relatively global switching off of the two-part put post transmission via system.net.servicepointmanager.expect100continue

10916016
button	checkbox
above checkbox is type of button

10916018
haskell	scheme
smalltalk or even better self and newspeak are much better languages to learn before learning ruby as are scheme and haskell

10916020
int	chars
note alphachar is simply a typedef with unsigned int type and the function counts the alphachar chars

10916039
google-chrome	firefox
third why do you want to do a var_dump if you want to see what is being sent back from the form use a tool like firebug for firefox or developer tools in google-chrome

debian	linux
i am on crunchbang linux which is debian based

10916179
post	get
this means that i need learn the json library and rewrite all handlers so get and post in json

10916179
client-side	server-side
implement a server-side solid protorpc service and use the framework for client-side is a good strategy

10916233
post	get
i understand it uses post instead of get but does it then post foo with a value of bar

10916268
stdout	stderr
stderr ssh proxy error authenticating remote session failed stdout ci continuous project.git 10.38.218.68 22 authenticating remote session failedfatal the remote end hung up unexpectedly

10916284
hash	salt
another thing i want to learn is how to create a one way hash sha256 combined with a good salt

10916296
post	get
the difference between post and get is how the server retrieves the data

10916302
client-side	server-side
to ensure that a client has in fact connected and the process of populating client object on the server has successfully completed i have a server-side method that invokes a client-side function with the number and list of connected clients derived from the connected client collection

10916303
children	parent
i think i m getting to the root of the problem probably caused by the children not able to reference the parent because they do not yet exist

10916327
base	fractions
whatever base is chosen will have difficulties representing finitely some fractions

10916327
base	fractions
base 2 can only approximate any fractions with a factor of 3 in the denominator but base 5 or base 7 do too

10916386
box-sizing	border-box
something like an experiment border-image inside with a box-sizing border-box

10916403
put	get
i think you can put a conftest.py file along with your tests and it will take care to skip all non-matching tests non-marked tests will always match and thus never get skipped

10916424
width	height
if i read the height and width of button in pixels i can see that the size is right

10916439
width	height
get the youtube link from the embedding tab below the video on youtube you can set there the width and height of the frame

10916456
udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
only the live communication case is one that may require a rtp rtsp implementation over udp to work with the required low latency

10916456
rtsp	rtmp
what future do streaming protocols such as rtsp rtmp and video streaming servers such as adobe streaming server have when seen in the light of the increasing features that browsers are adding to support html5 video

10916506
udp	tcp
you can only reliably use two protocols through the internet udp and tcp

10916506
udp	tcp
both of them involve a process setting up a listening socket and the other sending a message udp or performing a connection attempt tcp to said listening server

10916506
udp	tcp
if anything it just means that additionally to either listening to or initiating a tcp connection all the nodes will have to be udp listening servers as well

10916530
versioning	upgrade
i d suggest you upgrade to a more recent versioning of opencv 2.4 has recently been released and try to stick with the one or other of the c++ or c style methods

10916540
atomic	compare-and-swap
in multi-threaded code it will use atomic operations if an atomic compare-and-swap instruction is supported by the cpu otherwise the reference counts are protected by a mutex

10916543
client-side	server-side
one notable difference is that the attribute performs explicit client-side validation whereas when your field does not contain a valid datetime you get server-side validation through a failure by the default model binder to create a datetime object from the posted form data

10916560
qunit	sinon
this is an excellent post on how to use sinon with qunit for mocks

10916571
google-chrome	safari
supported by google-chrome safari

10916584
int	double
compiling this with visual studio i get a warning c4244 about possible loss of data - of course because simplified the multiplication of an int by a double results in a double which is then cast to an int losing the non-integer part

10916617
int	double
and if you really want to multiply by floats double don t use int to store the result

10916713
maven	pom.xml
i have a grails project with pom.xml that is treated as maven project by intellij

10916748

it means i have m.n images whose width and height is given

10916802
hide	show
is there some simple code to show hide a div on the click of a button

10916848
jruby	rubinius
rubinius s or jruby s optimizing compiler may be able to inline and optimize away many method calls that yarv s rather simple compiler can t for example

10916899
rank	max
if you have defined max ceiling default to it to simplify the code i am assuming 0 is not a valid rank

10916900
hash	md5
for example if you use md5 you may try generating hash colision

10916914
google-chrome	firefox
check out that jquery is loaded in the page source f12 if you use firefox or google-chrome

10916921
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
to call the method programatically from within the uiviewcontroller being displayed you could make the uipageviewcontroller a delegate of your uiviewcontroller that are being displayed then call a delegate method when the buttons are pressed

10916929
mp3	ogg
to cover support for most of the commonly used browsers you will have to stream in at least 2 formats mp3 and ogg for example

10916929
mp3	ogg
for streaming audio ogg mp3 you can use an icecast server

10916959
stdout	stderr
is stdout is stderr

10916965
explode	implode
i know it s not the most efficient way but if you want to use explode you ll need to use implode also

10916974
post	get
post and get are not equivalent

10916984
postgresql	mysql
you can import data nodes and edges directly from a database mysql sqlserver postgresql sqlite teradata using simple sql queries

10916988
textmate	sublimetext
sublimetext and st2 use the old format supplied by textmate .tmtheme

10917000
post	get
the problem here is that you are using get to retrieve the contents but the website is expecting a post

10917000
post	get
get and post are not equivalent although some programmers consider them the same in php for example you can use instead of and

10917009
qsort	strcmp
i was looking at the man page for qsort and the example does the following to convert the pointers to elements of a an array of strings pointers to elements seen as to normal char pointers feedable to strcmp

10917019
macports	homebrew
it could be installed with homebrew or macports on osx

10917030
division	multiplication
multiplication and division will be really cheap operations

10917033
range	minimum
i want to add a minimum range so the users can not slider lower than that

10917038
post	get
however it looks like there s post data you ll need to figure out in addition to the above query string arguments to get this to really return data

10917074
starttls	smtps
smtps server logs show ehlo starttls starttls and ehlo then auth mail etc

10917074

smtps server logs show ehlo starttls starttls and ehlo then nothing

10917085
post	get
whenever i fire the post i get

10917133
getter	setter
c# does not support custom bit widths but it does support binary operations and getter setter which makes it relatively easy to add a compatibility layer

10917157
gruntjs	uglifyjs
the gruntjs min task allows you to set uglifyjs the gruntjs min tool options which can give you greater control on how the destination file is mangled and compressed

10917174
google-chrome	firefox
other browsers mainly new versions of firefox and google-chrome went through the roof bounce rate of 65-90

10917186
floating-point	integer
the problem is that frames of a video are pixel-based which means there s usually no built-in way to draw lines or rectangles with real aka floating-point as opposed to integer coordinates

10917186
floating-point	integer
if the library you re using to draw the rectangle onto each frame only supports integer coordinates and not floating-point coordinates and you should check this because many graphics libraries do support floating-point coordinates which would make this task very easy for you then you ll have to roll your own for this

10917217
button	checkbox
note if you want radio button that look like checkbox then this answer will be of help

10917293
hide	show
this will show the .field-group-format-wrapper elements if they are currently hidden and hide them if they re currently visible

10917293
ready	each
fyi the reason your code snippet in your question wasn t working is because you re only checking the visibility of the elements on dom ready rather than on each click - so the event handler to show the elements will never be attached

10917346
versioning	upgrade
if i want to upgrade or downgrade i change the versioning and run the bundle update command

10917346
post	get
another situation let s suppose i want to get the last comment from a user and within the comment insert a link to the related post using the post title

10917346
post	get
in rails i would do something like user.comments.last.post.title to get the post title

10917346
post	get
if i want to the get the 5 last published post from the category programming ordered by the most accessed for example i would call them this way post.published.from_category programming .most_accessed.limit 5

10917358
width	height
in your x and y arguments you have to include the width and the height of the icons

10917369
rational-numbers	base
yet no matter what floating point system you choose there will still be lowly rational-numbers with no perfect representation 1 3 in base 10

10917379
google-chrome	firefox
as to your concrete problem i m not sure if i understand browser s 404 page properly perhaps you mean the browser-default error page which can occur when the server is unreachable or when the request has been redirected in an infinite loop that should however have been made clear in the actual message of the browser default error page at least google-chrome and firefox do that

10917397
box-sizing	border-box
if your project doesn t need to support ie7 you can use box-sizing border-box to add padding to your columns otherwise add an extra element inside each column for padding

10917420
hide	show
we should only hide the taskbar if the mashup application is show fullscreen on the primary monitor

10917434
rss	feed
also you may have better luck using curl and simplexml and getting your rss feed

10917435
google-chrome	safari
and in safari and google-chrome blocks of text are surrounded by tags

10917437
accessor	properties
a get properties accessor is used to return the properties value and a

10917462
versioning	upgrade
upgrade php - but that would require significant amount of regression testing since the openx versioning that we are using does not seem to have tested against these latest php versioning

10917465
webkit	gecko
if it s not webkit nor gecko i ll just use the standard property

10917481
getter	setter
however by using a property you can add code to the getter and the setter allowing you to do stuff like lazy loading in the getter or validation in the setter and much more

10917495
contourf	imshow
making the 2d plot seems to be possible because contourf accepts a zdir argument while i ve looked and imshow doesn t

10917505
accessor	properties
properties are just syntactic sugar so that you don t have to write accessor methods like java

10917525
mp3	ogg
the procedure is simple just request an evaluation with mp3 and ogg optimization scripts and the suite and you get the best quality compression ratio out of your audio

10917527
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked with firefox ie9 and google-chrome - and all browsers do the same

10917536
getter	setter
a few questions been asked regarding getting notified when a variable changes define getter or setter

10917571
onresume	onpause
it would then be important to unregister the listener in onpause and register it in onresume

10917577
folder	directory
for axis2 the working directory where jre is started from should be the bin folder of your apache tomcat while for your program it will depend on where you made the call to the jre to start the program from

10917581
queue	fifo
the way i have this implemented is that whenever a client wants to read a chunk of bytes the class will repeatedly read from the underlying file-like objects with chunk sizes appropriate to those objects and add the bytes to the head of a fifo queue until there are enough bytes in the queue to serve a chunk of the requested size to the client

10917581
queue	fifo
the first time the client requests 1 kib the class has to read 1 mib and add it to the fifo queue

10917581
queue	fifo
then for that request and the subsequent 1023 requests the class has to pop 1 kib from the tail of the fifo queue which gradually decreases in size from 1 mib to 0 bytes at which time the cycle starts again

10917589
post	put
put all your more specific rules first then everything else that is a single unit will go to user post something

10917605
ctime	strftime
i would consider using ctime and or strftime

10917608
put	get
the weird thing is when trying to put the same facebook https links that the app tries to use in any browser on the android device they dont load there either i get a web page unavailable

10917622
public	protected
you should only wrap the public members of a class not any protected or private members

10917622
integer	unsigned
declares another class this time briskscalespace but also provides a constructor that accepts a uint8_t an unsigned byte - which should just map to an integer in python but i d be careful to not pass in one greater than 255 bytes - i don t know what would happen in that situation

10917634
jython	jacl
equivalent to bkail s suggestion using jython instead of jacl

10917635
primefaces	richfaces
note that componenent libraries like primefaces and richfaces have already made the form the default execute attribute so you don t need to explicitly specify it in their command components

10917645
put	get
the code within the get block of a property is in fact put into a hidden get_propertyname method and the set block into a hidden set_propertyname method

10917668
width	height
i m using some images which i want to have no width or height

10917668
width	height
in other words i want to remove the auto generated css attribute that is given to each image in the slider because the inclusion of width and height in the dom on the page makes the image look pixelated for some reason

10917680
flask	django
use a web framework like flask or django to serve pages

10917680
post	get
when the user requests the job be started via a request preferably a post request because get requests should not cause significant side-effects the framework sends a message to a delayed task system like celery

10917698
versioning	upgrade
application and module versioning allows multiple versioning of the same application to exist in a glassfish server domain which simplifies upgrade and rollback tasks

10917740
client-side	server-side
it should include both client-side and server-side validation before you insert the data into your db

10917741
onclick	onchange
try to use onclick instead of onchange

10917753
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box to make padding and border be counted inside width

10917757
jax-ws	jax-rs
one supporting jax-rs and one jax-ws

10917809
filtering	grouping
when the filtering changed from q1 2012 to q2 2012 customer name 1 and name 2 would be under existing customer grouping

10917815
jar	war
i have a jar that suddenly needs to be re-packaged as a war don t ask why

10917956
background-image	background-position
because the ui-widget-header s width is set dynamically you need to dynamically change background-position of the background-image with slide callback

10917984
postgresql	mysql
i ran bundle --without production since i m using mysql on local machine and can t compile the gem postgresql properly

10917987
idictionary	icollection
not sure what you are asking here but if you need this method to handle dictionaries differently you can test to see if the icollection is also an idictionary

10917996
pull	push
i have a server hosting a repo that we pull push to

10918006
mouse	keyboard
we can create update populate tables etc by either sql commands or by simply clicking the options command with a mouse keyboard in sql server management studio express 2008

textinput	textfield
i d like to make an textfield that on textinput to automaticaly search that address and add an marker there and viceversa when i move the marker to populate the input

10918046
children	parent
foo has navigation properties parent of type foo children of type and bar of type bar

10918046
children	parent
now what i want is to be able to such that bar is loaded up for all the parent and children of a foo as well

10918055
put	get
get parameters are not inherently unsafe all rest services rely on data being put in the url

10918055
post	get
parameters get or post are unsafe if your user detail page in your example does not check if you actually have access to user account 12

10918055
post	get
also don t think post parameters are any harder to manipulate than get parameters

10918068
filtering	grouping
you can grouping the link table by object and filtering for only those grouping containing one record

10918083
g++	gcc
if your on linux or mac learn to compile from terminal using gcc or g++

10918102
ggplot2	ggmap
fyi i m fairly new to ggplot2 and ggmap so i apologize for the sloppy code but it is the only way i ve been able to plot sets of groups of points where each group has it s own color

10918105
accessor	properties
did you know properties accessor can have access modifiers

10918174
superclass	subclassing
when you create an instance of the subclassing by calling new on the sub class type then immediately its superclass constructor is called and it keeps going till the object class this is called constructor chaining

10918174
superclass	subclassing
and most important is that when constructor of subclassing it called it goes to its superclass and so on till the object class then 1st creating the object class object then the class under it till it reaches the subclassing on whose class new was called you will see that the constructor of the superclass is called first then its subclassing s

10918192
mp3	ogg
if you extract the raw audio data from a diverse range of formats like wma m4a mp3 and ogg you ll be left with no context for how to use the data later unless you re planning to store the context elsewhere like in a database

10918204
post	get
you can make codeigniter filter all post and get by changing the option in your config file or you can ask to filter manually by doing this

10918211
width	height
your suggested method will work as long as you make sure that you always use the height width properties to set _height and _width

10918211
accessor	properties	width	height
as matã as stated you could make your height and width properties have accessor with different access modifiers so that you could read but not write to your height width properties outside of this class

10918217
portrait	landscape
in regards to the rotation remember that the ios rear cameras are mounted landscape left and the front cameras landscape right so for a portrait orientation you need to rotate the incoming video frames

10918235
goto	break
in the cleanup even in normal case scenario i would regard the use of goto as being clearer than the do while 0 constructs among other things because the target labels themselves practically cry out look at me far moreso than the break and do while 0 constructs

10918242
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
links to the subsections work cause the content to scroll to the correct height but using the back button does not re-scroll to the correct section in firefox v13 ie v9 or opera v11 it does work in google-chrome v20 and safari v5

10918244
squash	merge
i merge a tree onto a my repository by using git subtree add without the squash option

10918247
google-chrome	safari
this works great in safari google-chrome but there s one case that doesn t work in google-chrome if there are no options to load via ajax so only the disabled edit... options are visible it will not fire an event on the edit... option being selected

10918264
int	chars
for your question 3 there is the char2seed function in the teachingdemos package which will take a chars string alhpa numeric and convert it to an int and by default use that to set a new seed

10918273
hide	show
click on the visibility pane and select show or hide based on an expression radio button

10918288
free	malloc
as far as a simple implementation of malloc free goes k r c has a good one

10918291
super	implements	super	abstract
have abstract method in super class to create the components sub class will implements these methods to create the component

10918329
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	omnifaces	richfaces	omnifaces
you d need to look at 3rd party component libraries like primefaces or richfaces or omnifaces

10918345
superclass	subclassing
it s like having an animal superclass and dog and cat subclassing

10918354
google-chrome	firefox
the problem was that for some reason in firefox not google-chrome there is room to scroll even though the renderer is set to the window size so firefox was scrolling when using the arrow keys

10918373
post	put
in rails button_to will try to do a post or put so it is not actually a regular button you can style your link to look and act like a button

10918394
super	implements	super	abstract
have abstract method in super class to create the components sub class will implements these methods to create the component.

10918397
width	height
the executive summary is that for this variation yuv 4 2 0 planar each pixel in the image gets a y sample note that the y loop iterates over every x y pair while 2x2 pixel quads each share a u cb sample and a v cr sample notice in block seven that the iteration is over width 2 and height 2

10918402
for-loop	arrays
then you can sort as per usual and you can even include the two arrays in the same for-loop

10918405
pecl	pear
here s one pecl pear thing i never used it

10918405
postgresql	mysql
postgresql will treat uuid as 128-bit values and presumably do optimized binary operations whereas mysql s char 36 solution is looking at 36 bytes 288-bits ansi or 576-bits utf8 plus-or-minus bits bytes for office-keeping and presumably do much slower multibyte-char-by-multibyte-char string routines

10918405
hex	binary
and my conclusion was that you d want to write up a stored function that converts the hex representation into the binary representation for storage and that would make all select statements require a conversion back into hex representation.

10918417
width	height
lets assume i want to calculate the rotation 90 degrees of a shape with x 1 y 1 topleft point and a width of 4 and a height of 6 around its center 3 4 x1 y2

10918420
put	get
not sure i put all the type casts right everywhere but you get the idea

10918436
post	get
i couldn t get this to work properly but i did find out the first author brian sallans is currently affiliated with arc seibersdorf research gmbh information technologies seibersdorf austria and i think i have his email address though i m not sure if i should post it directly on so - but you can find it on this paper -

10918439
asterisk	pbx
i am using asterisk-java to listen to messages from an asterisk pbx

10918467
versioning	upgrade
the appropriate fallback would be to use the .delegate method instead or you could upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery microsoft cdn google cdn jquery cdn

10918475
behat	mink
i ve been following this guide and installed everything through composer and am attempting to get behat + mink working but everytime i try and run bin behat i get the following error

10918475
behat	mink
and my vendor behat mink behat.yml file contains

10918475

getter	setter
getter and setter for selectedrole allroleslist are included in code

10918690
freemarker	thymeleaf	freemarker	velocity	velocity	thymeleaf
from the velocity freemarker family sort of you can look at thymeleaf - it s clean and really easy to learn

10918691
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
you need to put margin 0 to exclude the content margins from the width height since we are using position fixed having margins makes no sense

10918715
width	height
the next step is to render the curve using gl_triangle_strip and control the width relative to height

managing the complexity of a large project is rather hard also in silverlight - we used prism mef and a couple of other libraries to better organize the code and get the job done but the project was just large - couple that with some not so fortunate decisions consequence of the lack of web development skills made navigating within the project a problem

10927446

i ve also seen nice lob apps in sl - the 9 months we ve put in also led to a rather nice application - but by switching to mvc 4 we could get more people on the project and i have to confess that the mvc app looks just as nice as the sl one

10927749
sorting	filtering
however you will get a performance hit building a list if you don t already have it - it is much better to ensure that you are passing ienumerable from the linq statements directly as it is only realized when used - which can have major benefit with long lists and when using sorting or filtering because you can modify the ienumerable before it is realized

10927752
submit	submission
i am having new customer page wherein the user fills information abourt customers what i was planning to do is i wanted to display a popup where the user is asked whether he really wants to submit the information if he clicks yes then the information processing is continued and if he cancels then the submission wont continue.the popup i am talking wont be a javascript confirm.so how do i go about this should i use clientscript.registeronsubmitstatement to show my popup or is there any other alternative any suggestions are welcome thanks

constructors are not members so they are not inherited by subclassing but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclassing

10927933
greenhopper	sprint
sprint planning stories are selected for upcoming sprint and using greenhopper we create add the stories to the sprint

while i am a die-hard git aficionado for this particular case i would rather recomment fossil with its fossil server or fossil winserv modes or mercurial with its hg serve mode

10928239
children	parent
you can have inner outlets so when entering a parent state you could bind an application view being the layout and having sub-outlets named as needed which content will be set by children states

versioning	upgrade
if you are worried about running the conversion on lots of records as part of an upgrade you could come up with some ways to make it more efficient for example add a column to the table that contains the message schema versioning so you can efficiently target messages that are out of date

10928323
post	get
simply use either get or post method in your controller according to your form method like

strlen	strcpy
since we have now made this information available by calling strlen we don t need to call slow functions like strcat and strcpy that search for a null termination

10928430
memcpy	strncpy
we could use strncpy or memcpy instead

10928430
memcpy	strncpy
i picked memcpy since the extra feature in strncpy appending additional null terminations is useless in this case

10928461
many-to-one	one-to-many
use fetch joins to load the one-to-one and many-to-one relationships in your find method and add extra methods for loading the one-to-many collections like addresses

nsmutablestring	nsstring

since the former is a subclass of the latter an nsmutablestring instance supports everything an nsstring does

10928549
width	margin
what you can do is to either center body by using margin 20px auto or by setting body s width to be 100 to fill the entire viewport

10928549
width	margin
you will have to set the width of #divmain to be smaller than 720px 500px - the only way for a child to be centered horizontally within its parent using margin 0 auto is for the parent s width to be larger

question i would like to find a set s of n numbers from the table where the set must contain only one number from each row and the max s - min s is as small as possible

i have just received the following design for a project for an image grid gallery with dynamic width height images user submitted images

10930783
width	height
jquery masonry allows for both width and height to be dynamic however there are gaps generated

cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
i have also learnt that i can programmatically disable the logical cpu s by modifying the processors affinity for the current process for example like this in c#

10930822
cpu	affinity	cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	affinity	hyperthreading	affinity	processors	processors	hyperthreading
at least from a performance point of view will disabling every second logical cpu by changing processors affinity have the same effect as disabling hyperthreading altogether

10931004

backbone is based on a rest api when saving updating a model to the server backbone will send it serialized as json in the request body with a post our put request

10931100

although ssl tls doesn t strictly require certificates https expects certificates since rfc 2818 in particular section 3.1 clearly refers to x.509 certificates

10931105
for-loop	if-statement
in this case it looks like the inside of a function but the same rules would apply to the inside of an if-statement for-loop etc

10931467
background-color	transparency
try giving background-color transparency

10931502
free	malloc
i always assumed that objective-c s retain release is just malloc free under wraps so leaks based on c memory functions should be equally visible to instruments..

10931508
width	height
the thing is the window showing the files is pretty big wide or tall because you resized it and emacs sees that the width or height is greater than the respective threshold and splits it likewise

10931513
rss	feed
i m following an rss feed which returns an xml

10931537
google-chrome	firefox
if you want it to work in all browsers you ll need to add google-chrome firefox opacity css or have some ie only css to apply background colour

10931540
internationalization	localization
the documentation also says some times its better to give base localization and internationalization so i edited from

10931612

width	font-size	width	height
height 0px and width 0px also you have to place font-size 0px

10931772
filesystems	hfs	filesystems	ntfs
you usually can t do this from windows because windows uses ntfs filesystems and will not recognize the mac filesystems hfs or hfsplus

10931787
next	except
all is ok except the searchsuggest div that is not scaled height so my results appear on the next div

10931798
min	max
the c standard doesn t mandate any limits min or max

10931835
for-loop	arrays
alternatively you could use a for-loop to build an arrays of the key names then sort that and use it as a basis for accessing the object in order

10931839
button	checkbox
with this approach i am able to translate almost any html element like button radio button and checkbox

10931859
portrait	landscape
i think it does this because it changes the orientation from the phone from landscape to portrait

10931859

when i go to the camera it changes to landscape and when i finish it it goes back to portrait

10931881
children	parent
the initials being the children registered by each of the five parent

10931943
octree	quadtree

10931945
versioning	upgrade
ms report viewer 2005 sp1 upgrade versioning 8.0.50727.42

10932031
microchip	dspic
as praemdonck said microchip dspic with an mplab debug probe is probably the most affordable solution and you can actually do a lot of things with these microcontrollers

10932076
google-chrome	firefox
for example from firefox to google-chrome

10932095
opera	google-chrome
javascript debuggers embedded in msie opera and google-chrome do not understand that js uses semicolon and not crlf as a line break

10932171
many-to-many	one-to-many
you only really need to use a pivot table when you need to track many-to-many relationship and in this scenario there are no many-to-many relationships to track just one-to-many relationships

10932202
coalesce	isnull
i know that there are functions like isnull or coalesce but i do not think this is the case because i am trying to update a column given the value of another column

10932207
client-side	server-side
as you are working in yii already i would definitely use cactiveform for client-side validation and also for ajax and server-side validation

10932230
min	max
what i would like is to have for the loop part a counter and the min max average values

10932239

10932288
junit	easymock
i write my unit tests for my java application with groovy junit and easymock

10932307
primefaces	richfaces
perhaps that thread on jboss community called working towards richfaces primefaces compatibility could help

10932315
opera	google-chrome
you would have to use a dom viewer to see it google-chrome developer tools or opera dragonfly

10932348
jsf	seam
either change named linuxcontroller to to make it pure jsf or change viewscoped to something else like seam s conversationalscope or sessionscope or in your case i think requestscope is just fine

10932348
getter	setter
it s especially important for jsf expression language because you need setter and getter for accessing bean properties on the page and these methods should be written in camelcase so the jsf el can parse them

10932485
groovy	gsp
to avoid writing groovy or java code within my gsp i added a string variable with the classname for easy reference within the gsp

10932504
post	get
i know we can change the get methods to post methods

10932578
circuit	nor
i can t imagine that there would be a separate circuit for each number you can shift by that would 64 shift circuit on a 64-bit machine nor can i imagine that it would be a loop of shifts by one that would take up to 64 shift cycles on a 64-bit machine

10932653
post	put
what i realized though is that it still required a fair amount of php experience to put the post type in the wordpress loop and display it with the right information

10932666
hash	salt
using the account id as a salt is probably not a good idea - if someone can steal your hash passwords then they can probably get the account id s too

10932674
put	get
i was able to successfully get it to work but i was told to put the app in multiple sub directories

10932694
trie	tree
seems like you could adapt either a trie radix trie or a binary search tree to work in either situation

10932694
trie	tree
you could augment a trie to store folders as the inner nodes instead of characters like in a regular trie or you could augment a binary search tree to store folders as inner nodes as long as they implement a comparable interface and files as leaf nodes

10932698
apache	nginx
then add authentication directly to that server virtualhost using your http server nginx apache

10932755
post	get
yes if you change from get to post then the parameters will not be displayed in the url upon submission

10932766
fadein	fadeout
i ve used fadein and fadeout before but still it doesn t work when i tested it clicking the button rapidly

10932780
children	parent
the only catch to this is that there are parent-child relations so the parent table has to be updated before its children currently accomplished through array ordering

10932814
oncreate	setcontentview
place the line setcontentview your layout id view before in oncreate

10932822
implements	extends
i need to develop an ant wrapper to an automated task implements in java and i m going to do this with eclipse and i want to do it by extends ant s task class

width	height
currently capped to 1 11 2048 and you can not create buffers larger then 2048 pixels in width or height

10932913
bmp	png
it is preferable to save as bitmap bmp which is uncompressed or png which uses a lossless compression

10932921
migrate	upgrade
rails upgrade will often disturb your database once you have a clean install since often you will have to do a rake db migrate at the end

10932928
udp	tcp
it looks like it allows native client access to tcp udp sockets for chrome extensions

10932948
versioning	upgrade
that said if you provide a web service call that your app makes at launch time you could supply it with the ios versioning the app found and return a message to provide the user with a nudge to upgrade

10932951
textview	imageview
in the adapter put onclicklistener for the textview and imageview

10932958

10932971
pull	push
the article i cite provides ideas for push and pull design

10932980
getter	setter
ruby gives you convenience class methods to define getter and setter methods like attr_accessor

10932999
min	max
if you re using the jquery ui datepicker it takes optional min max date parameters

10932999
min	max
so you would need determine your min max dates from you json data turn them into date objects and pass them as options to the datepicker

10933010
width	height
turns out that in my xaml code my window had a property called sizetocontent set to widthandheight so i changed it to manual and established a value for width and height manually

10933096
superclass	subclassing
i have the superclass vehicle with it s subclassing plane and car

google-chrome	firefox
of course browsers vary in javascript performance google-chrome is known to be faster however firefox doesn t hang on my computer - but i know what you mean

10933312
icmp	tcp
your best bet other than an icmp ping which could be blocked since rdp is open would probably be to open a tcp socket to port 3389 which would confirm that the computer is online and fully booted ie

10933323
operands	scalar
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

10933323
operands	scalar
the left operands is evaluated in binary scalar context always

10933358
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
in every other latest browser firefox safari opera ie8-9 working normally

10933358
width	height
i think the best solution if there s a javascript which is dynamically escribe a width and height for every single image and keep the original aspect ratio

10933365
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything worked as it should in ie10 ie9 google-chrome firefox safari

10933365
versioning	upgrade
but after i upgrade to release preview and therefor a new versioning of ie10 some stuff on the same sites i was working on in consumer preview didn t behave as it should

10933383
gif	png
once i had to show the png because the gif was lq so after the animation i replaced the gif with the png

10933413
vim	gedit
here is another workaround you can use vim to auto indent and auto format your code from inside gedit

10933413
put	get
if you don t get the indentation put filetype indent on in your .vimrc file and it will work

10933420

post	get
but the best solution is post + redirect + get

10933554
portrait	landscape
i want all view controllers to support only portrait mode except one view controller lets call it landscapesupportviewcontroller that should support also landscape mode

10933554
portrait	landscape
the problem is when i m in landscapesupportviewcontroller in landscape mode and then push a new view controller that only support portrait mode the pushed view controller will be in landscape mode also

10933554
portrait	landscape
i saw few apps that do it take for example skype iphone app the messages tab is portrait only - then if you press to enter the message itself you get a view controller that support landscape also because it make sense to enable landscape mode when user is chatting - then if you press to view the persons profile a new view controller will be pushed but in portrait

10933594
content-disposition	content-type
specifically content-type and content-disposition

10933632
erd	diagram

10933694
allocator	stl
if you modify an stl container delete or add new element to it it usually involves allocator deallocating memory

10933694

10933704
move	drag
in some cases when the drag adorner move from source to the next itemscontrol i.e the target itemscontrol where the drop will happen ...the onpreviewdragleave method on the drag source

hide	show
with the first one also 1 cycle but i apply the same operator hide or show 2 time to the same element

10933823
int	chars
instead of doing it chars by chars you should take k chars at a time such that it can fit into a java int or long

10933823
integer	unsigned
to get the most of the block you might use a power of 2 as the limit for a 32 bit unsigned integer type you would set your threshold to 2 31 or you could set it to 2 32 but it depends on where and how you are storing the overflow to pass over to the next element

10933831
postgresql	mysql
i m in the processing of moving over a mysql database to a postgresql database

10933831
postgresql	mysql
i was thinking it would be best to just grab the mysql data row by row and then insert it into the respective postgresql table row by row i m not concerned with speed atm

10933886
hide	show
if you want to change your ui without switching activities you need to use fragments or put all of the views you want into your one layout and hide show only the relevant ones for each portion of your activity with setvisibility

you should implement onfocus and onblur like below

10937406

by add here i mean make sure this state is tracked and update max min as needed if it was not tracked .

you need to make the width and height of the button

10937426

then use a for-in loops or a simple for-loop to change the background for all of them

i usually use simple linear search to find the min max in a list which for me seems to be simple and adequately optimal

10937647
min	max
unfortunately i don t know how to get max med and min returned in separate entries in a list within the linq query

10937647
min	max
what you can do though is have your linq query put min med and max into a list object and then return the first row

10937647
min	max
- your end tags for min max and med are formatted incorrectly the should be before the name not after

min	max
conceptually i would say that linear search is better when you only want the min or max of a list as the problem does not call for sorting

10937760
post	get
i pass this value from one page to another and get the value using post method inside a for-loop as follows

10937790

10937799
width	height
with place you specify the exact x y location and exact width height for a widget

you re posting 10 times that many messages to the queue and not handling any before you stop so even if the queue was completely empty before you started which is unlikely since you re probably triggering this functionality from keyboard or mouse input you d only get one-tenth the messages

10938127
unsigned	short
in your case either as an unsigned short or a

10938127
unsigned	short
then you interpret it as an unsigned short

10938127
unsigned	short
which means that when your code looks at an unsigned short it thinks 0x03 is the least-significant byte

10938127
unsigned	short
so your 2-byte unsigned short is interpreted as 0x0203

10938130
range	max	range	min	min	max
it takes in two arguments a max number and a min number and spits out a random integer within that range including both ends

10938245
getter	setter
atomic does not universally mean multithread safe. it just means that the when you use the getter then you will get an extra retain autorelease pair on it so it can t vanish during your runloop and it ll be synchronized with the setter so that you can t get half-an-object if setting and getting collide

10938245
getter	setter
this is all only true if you use the getter and setter

10938255
sqoop	hadoop
hadoop is absolutely suitable for such big data..you can use it with hbase that allows us to expand to millions of rows and billions of columns and provides great horizontal scalability as well..it is suitable for real time random read write access..on the other hand hive is good for batch processing so you can run hive jobs in back ground for other tasks..we should not mistake hadoop as an alternative to traditional rdbmss but it really helpful in dealing with huge data sets..you can use another apache project sqoop that allows us to import our data form existing databases to hadoop cluster without much pain

turns out that the only place httpd.h s max and min macros get used is in httpd.cpp so i just moved those #defines into httpd.cpp where they really should have been in the first place

10938812

at any rate the current mjpg-streamer code has #ifndef guards around max and min and also has them in a separate utils.h file here that just gets included in httpd.c here not httpd.h

int	chars
the main problem is that the int bytes within that file do not actually map to meaningful text chars so where the mapping fails to render portions of the alphabet it will render whatever your text encoding dictates which looks to me like a lot of garbage

backbone.js	zepto
i d recommend backbone.js and zepto for an html-based app

10941587
backbone.js	zepto
you can use zepto for css3-based animation transitions and events while backbone.js helps you organize your code in a sane way

10941587
backbone.js	zepto
for a more traditional business-y app i think zepto backbone.js is perfectly viable

10941976
children	parent
parent views are in charge of initializing rendering hiding showing and or destroying their children as the app requires

10941976
children	parent
often parent maintain references to children but sometimes it is unnecessary more on this below

10941976
children	parent
views essentially have 3 functions 1 render themselves and their children when told to do so by their parent or in response to events or in the case of a root-level view when initialized by a router or a main function etc. 2 respond to ui events from dom elements within their el but not within the el of any child view by updating models or collections or triggering custom backbone events and 3 observe and respond to backbone model collection etc. events that require something to be rendered or changed within their el but not within the el of any child view. one sometimes-useful trick is that child views can trigger events on themselves this.trigger customevent that parent views can observe childview.on customevent this.handler this

10941976
children	parent
as a general principle views should be blissfully unaware of each other with the exception of parent minding their children when it makes sense

10941984
ubuntu	mint
that is really odd to me because i already run into this error in mint and have no way out i was thinking ubuntu could have resolved it but now i am stuck on it again

10942090
width	height

10942108
nowjs	node.js
node.js still responds fine but nowjs stops responding

10942108
nowjs	node.js
i think that nowjs which is an abstraction layer on top of socket.io creates it s own server along side my node.js server

10942108
nowjs	node.js
scaling heroku spins up a new node.js server vm but since nowjs isn t yet compatible with distributed environments it just dies

10942283
jobs	cron
it should list all your cron jobs and you should be able to test them with a link on the page

10942323

how can i get an array of all categories that have at least one associated post

10942730
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
i ve been researching some parsers and it seems beautifulsoup lxml html5lib are the most popular

10942730
lxml	beautifulsoup
from reading this website it seems lxml is the most commonly used and fastest while beautifulsoup is slower but accounts for more errors and variation

10942730
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
i m a little confused on the beautifulsoup documentation and commands like beautifulsoup markup lxml or beautifulsoup markup html5lib

10942730
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
in such instances is it using both beautifulsoup and html5lib lxml

10942822
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
my understanding having used beautifulsoup for a handful of things is that it is a wrapper for parsers like lxml or html5lib

10942822
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
for your purposes it seems like you don t need to worry about getting one of those other parsers to use with beautifulsoup html5lib or lxml

10942822
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup can deal with some sloppiness on its own and if it can t it will give an obvious error about malformed html or something of the sort and that would be an indication to install html5lib or lxml

10951126
min	max	minimum	max
roughly speaking your code will appear to work if the uninitialized variables min and max just so happen to hold values that compare in between the actual minimum and maximum values encountered in test

10951136
nunit	mstest
my impression is that pex is a supplement to traditional testing frameworks like mstest or nunit rather than a competing framework

10951150
post	put
from another post here i received the suggestion to put a toolbar there since the navbar only allows one left bar item

10951168
equals	compareto
alternatively i think it is worth mentioning that the behavior of equals and compareto methods in the class bigdecimal are not consistent with each other

10951183

versioning	upgrade
the code used to work fine in 5.3.8 versioning but after upgrade to 5.3.13 it stopped working

10951271
keydown	keyup
it s worth pointing out that having more keydown events than keyup events is actually expected behavior when you hold a key down the os reports that as multiple keydown s one for each time that a character would be inserted in a normal text input though this happens even under mac os 10.7 with its default key-holding behavior

10951295
distance	polygons
in the case of convex polygons d a b is the maximum of the distance from vertices of a to any point in b

10951295
distance	polygons
therefore the hausdorff distance is not too hard to calculate if you can calculate the distance from an arbitrary point to a convex polygons

10951295
distance	polygons
to calculate the distance from a point to a convex polygons you first have to test whether the point is inside the polygons if so the distance is 0 and then if it is not find the minimum distance to any of the bounding line segments

10951295
distance	polygons
the result i am trying to prove is that in calculating d a b with both polygons and b convex it suffices to find the distance from the vertices of a to b

10951295
distance	polygons
this distance is 0 only if a and b are the same polygons in which case it is clear that we achieve that distance at a vertex of a

10951295
distance	polygons
that is why it sufficed to find the maximum of the distance from the vertices of the polygons to the other polygons

10951305
google-chrome	firefox
if you are testing your form out on firefox or google-chrome i would suggest using firebug or developer tools to see the data that is passed to the server

everything works great in google-chrome firefox ie7 8 9 and kindle but android does not seem to respect a particular z-index on a div that we create dynamically

10951398
put	get
i ve tried numerous things to get this menu to show on top of the modal dialog such as asking for the z-index after the menu is displayed which is correct the highest z-index of all absolute items assigning a new higher z-index after it is displayed moving the order of the divs around etc and nothing seems to put it on top of the dialog as it does in all other browsers

10951419
unsigned	short
short unsigned short

10951432
implements	extends
then for any other class that you would need to add more fields you would create a class and have it extends your abstract class so now it is a jpanel with all common fields already created and laid out and implements an interface with your extra fields

10951439
hash	salt
i guess you could store this in two database on two servers and use multiple server with salt and hash but the correct and accepted way is simply to encode using an algorythm like i said and compare

10951444
int	double	int	chars
simple types bool byte chars short int long float and double

10951475
versioning	upgrade
the plugin can have a url that points to the most recent versioning and screwturn can check this but there are time-delays involved and i ve found it just easier to manually upgrade each time

10951524
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on google-chrome and safari but i can t make it work on safari mobile

10951537
hash	salt
the password is â saltedâ concatenated with the salt that is stored for the user then that salt string is hash and verified with the users hash password in the database

10951537
hash	salt
this almost certainly guarantees unique hash and makes the hash table of passwords much harder to reverse engineer back into logical passwords because the output of the hash function relies on also knowing the custom salt assigned for each user

10951537
hash	salt
if anyone knows why linkedin doesnt salt their hash i would love to hear from you

10951622
int	double
one of long long and double is bigger than 3 int and a multiple of 8

10951673
coalesce	isnull
since you are assuming a row without an amount is to be summed as zero then you can just filter out rows without the amount and don t worry about the isnull or coalesce

10951714
cruisecontrol	teamcity
currently pushing the code to each environment is a manual process wondering how something like cruisecontrol or teamcity could streamline this process

10951738
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
as for the accessing the struct s internal vars cgpoint and cgsize to be exact just use regular old dot notation after storing the frame into a cgrect var like so

10951740
salt	md5
now i ve learned that md5 is not the safest to use however what i think can be done to be safe is salt it i know this is nothing new

10951740
salt	md5
then after successfully putting the information in database i create the password that is going to be stored in auth table this way the password is not the md5 of the password the user enters rather its the md5 of the salt and the password user enters

10951740
hash	md5
and the decrypting websites don t actually decrypt the md5 they just have the md5 hash of millions of strings

10951757
post	get
you should try debug this- request to see the results of passing the data with get or better yet use a post and check out this- request- data cakephp 2 or this- data cakephp 1.3

can i just post to the create action on the notes or do i need to get the new_user_note_path

10951868
svg	vml
this works fine but of course in ie8 raphael uses vml instead of svg and this solution fails

10951870
hex	binary
you have to convert the binary data to hex or base64 or something like that and embed that in the document

10951912
mutators	getter
why should i consider making defensive copies in getter methods in my immutable class with no mutators in it

10951923
hide	show
of course in real use you d wrap up hide most of the ugliness i ve show here

10951961
cpu	hyperthreading
because of the cost of cpu cache synchronization between cores it makes sense to limit your http worker threads to the physical cpu cores ignoring hyperthreading

10952041
children	parent
that is to say for each parent produce children then move on to next parent etc

10952044

you must pay attention to cldc and midp versions and which classes they bring

10952081
width	margin
try giving the width of your progress bar 515px and remove the right margin of your red box

10952149
inherited	properties
yeah the idea with mvc is to keep things decoupled in your case you re ultimately smashing everything into one chain of inherited where you ll end up with one type of object that inherited all the properties from another object that inherited all the properties from another object so you ll have an instance of this thing that represents everything which is why this isn t a great pattern to go with

10952149
mouse	keyboard
control being the modification of the model in this case it would probably also be where you register listeners for user events keyboard mouse whatever

10952159
gif	png
to determine if an imagine is jpeg png or gif you can use either though i would generally go with imagetype

10952173
superclass	subclassing
you want that whenever a subclassing object is created the subclassing class object should be passed to the superclass

10952210
for-loop	arrays
instead of writing out 3 system functions i am trying to learn how to pass a string arrays that holds these commands to the system function or a similar function exec in a for-loop

10952213
hash	md5
my solution that i believe will work is to do an md5 hash on the userid field which is unique ...which would should guarantee a unique value in that field

10952213
hash	md5
what is the best way to get a unique value in the employeenum field possibly based on an md5 hash of the userid field on all the rows in which a value isn t already present

this allows you to type away as normal but as soon as you select anything using mouse or keyboard you ll see you can extend the selection across divs as usual

10952282
google-chrome	safari
it also works perfectly fine on google-chrome safari and ie with and without the cdn

10952284
ftell	fread
you d be better off using an fread into a fixed size buffer type solution or ftell then file and read it all in at once for best efficiency and then do your reading off the buffer

10952284
realloc	malloc
not to mention all the overhead of malloc and realloc they do add up

onclick	onchange
once within the onclick function of the drop down list the other within the change_fruit_color that s called via the onchange event in the radio button box

10952311
cos	sin
values of sin a and cos a are rational numbers only for particular angles see so you can t store values of sin a or cos a as decimals without losing precision

10952311
cos	sin
this defeats the purpose of converting sin and cos values to decimal and having built-in functions that return sin and cos values as decimals

10952341
post	get
i followed another post to get it set up

10952361
hide	show
the issue is that when we use chosen it hide the original select element and renders its own dropdown instead and when we focus out the validation isn t called and also when the validation message is show it is show with the original select element so positioning of the error isnt also correct

10952391
inherited	properties

pull	push
if i just set up a normal build it will pull the most recent source code and use that to push to the production server

10952496
inherited	subclassing
that s because circle is a subclassing of shape and it would mean that all the members of shape will be inherited by circle and in some cases because you re using c# and overriding the members isn t always the rule like in java overridden

10952544
hash	salt
most hash algorithms are designed to be fast but this makes it easier to create rainbow tables for every salt

10952544
hash	salt
this salt has to be stored together with the hash but is not secret can be plain text

10952544
hash	md5
it is not for high security sites only and using it can be as easy as using an md5 hash

10952548
boyer-moore	rabin-karp

but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once

maven	pom.xml
below is part of a very simple pom.xml that uses the maven execution plugin to auto-deploy to glassfish as a function of the build

10956622
width	height
you can use a snoop for wpf equivelent for silverlight silverlight spy to examine the visual tree and see which element s increase the width height vs the inner control or even if that control has the wrong settings due to an unexpected binding

10956636
width	height
currently in order to make the icon fit its parent container its width and height need to be explicitly defined and match the width and height of the parent container

10956636
width	height
if i change the width and height of the parent container i need to change the background-position sizes as well

10956656

flatmap	concatmap
in addition to that the bind operation on lists concatmap flatmap only looks at one element at a time and offers no way of reusing the result of previous steps

10956867
nsstring	nsdata
property lists do not store colors and apple recommends you store them as nsdata not as nsstring you should probably do the same

10956878
versioning	upgrade
update git repo add tagged commit and upgrade build versioning

10956898
concave	convex
finally something to remember is that box2d can only work with convex shapes not concave

10956907
width	height
if you re wondering why i am actually the person who wrote the code is looping through all the w it s because i think w has the biggest width and height in the entire character set so the person who wrote the code is trying to guess the maximum area needed

10956916
int	chars
the assignment given by our teacher was to create a program that asked for asked for two int x and y and one chars z

10956916
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
the letter entered for z could be a and it would add the two integers s would subtract them m multiplying and d divide

10956920
median	minimum
the first thing i would do is to use weiszfeld s algorithm without rigidity constraints to find geometric median of individual points define lagrange multipliers corresponding to deviations of edges of the object from expected values and use gradient descent to find a constrained local minimum

10957096
hash	salt
the point is you always need to store salt and hash together somewhere because when you compare the password input with the hash you need to hash the input - obvious right

10957096
hash	salt
so this is the point even if you change the salt after every login and do some weird re-hashing of the password it changes nothing because as soon as an attacker gets the database he has both hash and salt if it s stored there together which is necessary if you always use a different salt for each user which is something you should do

10957116
subtraction	addition
edit also if anyone has any tips for to addition subtraction methods i would be grateful

10957118
children	parent
the reason for this is that android creates a new canvas or reuses the old one depending on how your parent and children are rendered and where in the cycle of processing it is being called

10957137
for-loop	arrays
i ve read elsewhere how inefficient a for-loop is compared to other methods as for example in copying an arrays

10957157

traditionally a bean had properties defined as a getter and or setter

10957366
post	get
am i supposed to submit the authtoken via get post variables each time i want to communicate with the api

10957394
for-loop	arrays
if you need to create those arrays a lot of times and they are very big instead of continuously iterating in a for-loop you could create all the arrays once and then copy them

10957421
mongoid	mongomapper
mongo and rails integration with mongoid mongomapper is pretty good

10957452
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
suppose you have a database that contains password hash for the n users of your site and for each user you have salt si and hash hi where hi was computed with some algorithm such as sha1 or md5

10957452
hash	salt	scrypt	salt
for each user you first create a new random salt value s i and then compute a new hash h i using the formula scrypt s i hi and store the new salt and hash in the database

10957452
hash	salt
so you are left with two salt values and a new hash

10957452
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5	scrypt	salt	scrypt	md5
when user i logs in and presents password p you use your old weak hash algorithm let s suppose it was md5 salt password to compute a hash for comparison as follows scrypt s i md5 si p and compare that with the h i stored in the database

10957452
hash	salt	scrypt	salt
once the user has logged in successfully with password p you can completely eliminate any trace of the old weak hash by choosing a new random salt value s i and computing scrypt s i p and storing that in the database

10957475
portrait	landscape
you should create separate layout for landscape and portrait mode.see this

10957491
post	get
also if i just try what is generated as the default i.e get sessions new instead of post or post_via_redirect without trying to test a username and password it works fine

10957681
folder	directory
look into copying the file you wrote to the first directory to the second folder

10957701
width	height
resizing other elements say by modifying the width or height of an img element using script will not raise a resize event

10957727
children	parent
finally a common case of circular referencing is bidirectional parent-child relationship a parent a ui panel holds a reference to an array of its children and each child buttons tables etc. holds a references to the parent

10957727
children	parent
the parent needs to send motifications to its children to tell them that it became enabled disabled visible or invisible

10957732
ubuntu	linux
my best guess is that you are running a 32-bit x86 linux distribution that does not have support for x86_64 binaries i just tried to disassemble an x86_64 binary on my x86_32 ubuntu 11.04 distro and it worked fine

10957738
express	node.js
now i want to use this library in a website i have build using node.js and express

10957752
google-chrome	firefox
i m sure google-chrome does it differently from ie or firefox and vise versa

10957801
hide	show
it uses hide and show but you could substitute in addclass hide etc

10957806
opera	google-chrome
i expect this to be the solution and it works in google-chrome but in opera the validation is ignored

10957808
ready	each
each time the user deals with a database i open the database and create the required cursor and i call cursor.getcount in another thread to tackle the laziness issue of cursors and make it fully ready for future operations

10958358
readonly	temporary
the table is not readonly and hence creating temporary tables and swapping them may not work out

10958417
int	chars
essentially one gets a chars reading the first couple bytes as an int gives you an id number which points you to instructions on how to decode the rest it tells you the rest of the bytes are for example respectivley an int a string an unsigned int another unsigned int a nested message etc.. and the next couple bytes tell you in each bit whether the subsequent fields are there or not

10958423
explode	implode
so i thought the best way would be to take an existing one explode shuffle and implode

10958469
put	get
put an rtf file into nsdata get the first eight bytes print them out and put these eighht constants in an array of bytes in your program

10958481
kwargs	isinstance
if you really need instance then you can iterate over args and or kwargs using isinstance to get the instance variable though like i said this isn t very pythonic..

10958593
min	max
time would be fairly easy 0 no time spent 1 entire time spent online the 2 others would require setting up some min and max thresholds truncating everything above

10958593
min	max
then setting up bounds is either arbitrary you decide what the min and max is or somewhat complex you could base for instance the max on the observed number of posts by users and pick the 90 fractile as your maximum bound

10958636
google-chrome	firefox
it is normal in firefox but in google-chrome div s event always called when click checkbox

hash	salt
usually websites use random salt so that even if your password is the same on two sites different sites will store their hash differently

10958933
hash	salt
even if websites didn t use random salt and passwords always hash to the same thing you d still need to know the password before being able to login to those sites

10958962
innodb	myisam	versioning	upgrade

10962856
google-chrome	firefox
and in this case firefox prefer to drop it while google-chrome prefer to accept partial correct declaration

for-loop	loops
i just can t understand why the variable i can not increase to 6 when k 0 outside the for-loop and loops will repeat again and again

10963021

src is most likely a property too so you can safely replace attr with prop in your code

10963036

change your def post self to def get self or whatever else is appropriate

as a side note i ve noticed that mysql enums do not require this type of cast so this is something particular to postgresql in my experience

10963271

solution for other browsers firefox google-chrome would be also nice

10963283
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a browser extension google-chrome and firefox which uses content script to change a textarea value

10963334

also in this case one could just fetch that page in browser js console get the csrf token through some specific xpath and then post some arbitrary data with that csrf

10963338
width	margin
when screen width is 940px the -20px from row and the 20px margin from span4 cancel each other out that s why the first span4 has no left margin

10963424
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and safari kept running the script but firefox killed it w out error

10963456
hash	salt
the salt itself is stored with the hash so it is available for checking the password later

10963468
128bit	64bit
salts are still required their main purpose is to deterred off-line attacks if the salt space is to large then the adversary won t be able to generate the look up table 64bit salt seems a bit low bcrypt has 128bit salts coupled with the work factor makes it quite a challenge for offline attacks .

10963510
boost	stl
boost serialization handles user-written classes as well as stl containers std deque std list etc

10963527

10963556
onclick	onsubmit

10963589
daemons	launchd
this is pretty easy to do accidentally since executing adb with any command will launchd the daemons if it isn t already started

10963589
daemons	launchd
using the root user to manually launchd the daemons is fine as workaround but tools like eclipse that automatically start the service will still attempt to as an unprivileged user which will cause the reported problem

10963622
hide	show
hi i have several buttons the first one is a show hide and it works correctly when it is first clicked on

10963653
stdout	stderr
i just want to be able to send the output from a printf to stderr instead of to the default of stdout

10963654
post	get
how can i exclude some get post method from the param read by struts2

10963654
put	get
if someone enter a real campus in the url but put a get method with a wrong campus the test will pass but all the information will be wrong

10963704
stdout	stderr
means make filehandle 1 point to wherever filehandle 2 does currently â stuff that would have been written to stdout now goes to stderr

10963704
stdout	stderr
but filehandle 1 isn t affected at all so stuff written to stdout still goes to stderr

10963704
stdout	stderr
the correct thing to do is which will make writes to both stderr and stdout go to errors.txt because the first operation will be open errors.txt and make stderr point to it and the second operation will be make stdout point to where stderr is pointing now

10963711
pop-up	dialog
when an ios app attempts to register for push notifications for the first time the system pop-up a permissions dialog asking the user for permission to receive push notifications

if i set the frame of the tableviewincell to a width larger than the height of the containing cell then it goes heywire

10963741

10963741

nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
so with this order i am making sure the exceptions are caught correctly and they are not tripping over one another if it s a nullpointerexception it enters the first catch if a stringindexoutofboundsexception it enters the second and finally if it is something else that is a runtimeexception or inherits from it like a illegalargumentexception it enters the third catch

the problem is that google-chrome and ie add the border to the width of the box while firefox compensates the width of the internal textfield to make it fit the border within the bounds specified

10965329

i wouldn t draw such a sharp distinction between compiled and interpreted-language - this is really just an implementation detail and tends to change with time faster than the languages themselves change. case in point - thanks to facebook php is now a compiled-language too

10965470
width	font-size
the answer to the question for clarity appears to be a combination of box-sizing and its vendor-previxed variants in order to include the border-width and padding in the defined width of the elements s rather than their width being defined-width + border-width + padding and font-size 0 for the parent element which removes the errant space between the two input elements although the space is technically still there

10966290
papyrus	objectaid
if you re a designer then papyrus is your best choice it s very advanced and full of features but if you just want to sketch out some uml diagrams and easy installation then objectaid is pretty cool and it doesn t require any plugins i just installed it over eclipse-java ee and works great

i could configure emacs or vim or something but that seems to me to be more of a hack then a proper solution

10966401

each element has a width and height of 140px which means that each line row can contain 7 elements before they are pushed down to the next line row

10966467
folder	directory
in order to use the zf files you need to preserve the directory structure they use at the very least you need a zend folder with all the zf files in there

10966467
folder	directory
zf folder path should be the path to the folder that the zend directory is in but make sure not to actually include the zend folder in the include path since zend does require_once zend file.php

unfortunately when the book was released it focused mainly on pull mechanisms ajax and its only suggestion for push based mechanism was a long-living ajax session via things like comet

10966543
apache	nginx
you ll have to run a webserver like nginx or apache

10966606
width	height
remember that when you have padding on both sides then you would have to subtract top and bottom pad to get the remaining height or subtract left and right to get remaining width

10966607
post	get
however by deviating from the rest and the canonical http usage you ll lose some of the features of the protocol such as caching which can be applied for get requests but not for post

10966607
post	get
your example of using two requests post with parameters + get to get the results seems overkill

note i only really care about cells within the and the column reference can be an int not an alphabetic chars i ve only done this to easily highlight the problem

10966688
width	height
this works 100 tested for the division itself i just hope that the browser will recognize your embeded pdf as part of the if not you can also adjust the height and width of the division to the same of the pdf to make sure that the link covers the complete area of the pdf

first of all do proper exception handling as ejp suggested a reason might be you get a connection timeout or something similar - so put an e.printstacktrace into the catch blocks and let s see if we get sort of an error message btw you gonna stop creating empty catch blocks really quickly when you debug a suppressed exception for 2 days

thanks to this very clever and powerful encapsulation mechanism in python you can usually go with attributes without a priori encapsulation so without any getter nor setter unless you need to do special things when accessing the data

the c++ global std istream object std cin is associated with the standard input stream the same stream as stdin refers to the global std ostream object std cout is associated with the standard output stream and the global objects std cerr and std clog are distinct objects but are both associated with the standard error stream

10983058

i have found a similar question distance from a point to a polyhedron or to a polygons

10983874
width	height
width and height are pretty much self-explanatory with the only question of the used probably pixels

10983874
gif	png
an image object seems to have always an image format jpeg png gif therefore an image object probably never has a straightforward memory representation but is encoded

10983924
implements	extends
it also can have advantages in terms of allowing the user to manage lifetimes of the objects ie you can let the class implements idisposable and dispose of instances on shutdown etc as well as being easy to extends in future versions in a way that doesn t break backwards compatibility since adding virtual members to the base class won t break the api

10983941
portrait	landscape
for example if i open it in portrait mode then the user wont be able to change it to landscape and when i open it in landscape then the user won t be able to change to portrait

10983941

in the future you ll get more helpful feedback if you actually post the code you ve attempted to write to solve your particular problem and let us know where you need help

10984147
distance	polygons
typical solution are to find the distance to each vertex and find the pair with the smallest values note that for a point outside a convex polygons these might not be adjacent and then check point to line intersections for each segment

load all markers into js arrays or objects so that you can reference them later on keeping track of parent child relationships or you can ajax-load children in step 3 if necessary

10984464
children	parent
add a click listener to the parent markers which will call .setmap null on all other parent and call .setmap yourmap on the parent s children markers

10984500

to get help with beautification i suggest that you open a new question and post your best effort so far not links to general resources but to code that you actually tried and explain what you wish to achieve

10984995
mouseover	mouseout
what happens is that after you scroll down then mouseout then mouseover again the animation repeats instead of staying at the bottom of the menu

10985282
hash	md5
a way to generate a hash sha1 or md5

10985282
hash	md5
also while there are crc32 implementations that can be modified for a running operation what about running shax or md5 hash

inline	inlining
therefore inlining is left for the compiler as an optimization option and by using a keyword such as c++ s inline your inline directive or gcc s __attribute inline you only give the compiler a hint that inlining might be worth a try here

10999293
post	get
so if you have both post and get data what do you do

10999293

10999397
fflush	gets
when doing really a lot of updates a big part of the mmap gets dirty and the page cache tries to fflush it to disk producing lots of random writes which in turn slows down the performance of the regular sequential writes to the data file

for-loop	loops
inside the for-loop how can i increment p_cust_order_ref by 1 every time it loops

10999563

i m moving our backend database from mysql to postgresql and am in the process of migrating all of our old queries functions

11000150
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if you need to maintain a certain ordering to your key value pairs in your dictionary you re better off using either a sorteddictionary or a sortedlist

11000150
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
in my testing sortedlist tended to be 2x faster on lookups and indexing by key but sorteddictionary was 100 times faster on removing entries

11000163
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux 11.04

11000187
post	get
however after about 5-10 minutes of inactivity the next request to the app experiences a network exception i m at work right now and don t have the exact error messages on me so i will post them when i get home if people think they re germane to the discussion this causes the internal messagequeue to close which results in every subsequent enqueue throwing an exception the queue is closed

11000466
width	height
why not use a regular grid instead with the height width of the rows columns set to so they re all equally sized

11000466
width	height
if you want cells to be a perfect square with the height matching the width be sure to bind the grid s height to the width or vice versa

11000489
google-chrome	safari
it seemed to work in google-chrome safari anyway but it s somewhat hacky but it s always a little hacky to change a site s styles

again haven t tested it outside of google-chrome safari but it might work for your needs

11000517
pop-up	dialog
i updated the jsfiddle for better understanding the procedure is the same click on the image - dialog pop-up - click on missions - scroll down to the last one a thick wall - click on the missing image to the right i dont know why it does not display the alt content doing that will display a hidding content clicking on it again will hide it

11000550
put	get
try to use context and just a put application context into your program context in main method in other methods you have to just get in your case use static method from some context class it is not a good but you cannot change api

11000706
jquery	simplemodal
i use the simplemodal jquery plugin to popup posts and call them like this

11000726
uiview	uiwindow
second animatewithduration is a uiview method not a uiwindow method

11000726
uiview	uiwindow	inherited	subclassing
i guess the compiler allows what you wrote because uiwindow inherited from uiview but sending a class message to a subclassing that does not implement that method is a bad idea

11000735
int	chars
again because each h value is generated from the linear sum of some int representative values of chars therefore a particular h value can be achieved by different linear sums that is different strings

11000755

serializable	deserialization
serialversionuid is a special static variable used by the serializable and deserialization process to verify that a local class is compatible with the class used to serializable an object

11001056
free	malloc
since the pointer is invalid free tries to read the book-keeping information as if the pointer was returned by malloc and valid which usually leads to freeing some random address pointed by that invalid pointer leading to corruption crash etc

11001061
iprincipal	iidentity
i m using a custom iidentity and iprincipal in my asp.net mvc application via ef 4.3 as expalined here and follow accepted answer s solution

11001215
put	get
i intend to put this code in asynctask class but i get error can t create handler inside thread that has not called looper.prepare ..

11001260
put	get
if i put the buttons on top i get just the game board filling the whole screen and no buttons

11001264
int	double
with the cast that bad stuff is undefined behavior most likely double is bigger than int and it overruns the memory for i

11001264
int	double
your version with actually works provided that double can accurately represent every value of int

11001264
int	double
which with an ieee double and an int smaller than 53 bits it can

11001329
ant	maven
from your script you don t mention if it is ant maven gradle etc. you should be able to find a way to get that value out of the .classpath through some plugin or custom code

11001346
stdout	stderr
this returned this is stdout n this is a failure on stderr n as expected

11001373

11001377
post	put	post	get	put	get
lets say over http via put get post etc

11001386

when i started using so i usually put up questions like below but ended up cutting down to the bare minimum as i usually didn t get an answer on thourough questions.

11001462
post	get
so i post in the code and everything seems to work great until i actually hit play and get an error

11001464

11001507
uitableview	uipickerview
in the register view is a uitableviewcell that when clicked takes the user to a view containing a uitableview and a uipickerview

11001507
uitableview	uipickerview
the uitableview is working correctly but the uipickerview which is supposed to dynamically pull the data it is supposed to display using a web call is showing up but appears completely blank

11001507
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
i ve posted the code below for the uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource methods as well as the method that is supposed to pull the data in the model

11001522
width	height
you should offer some way to access width and height and your conversion constructors should use such access methods to create the new rect

11001541
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade to the new versioning of the excellent signalr library and moved all my dependency injection from structuremap to ninject as ninject seemed to be better supported

can ignitedhttprequest use get requests or only post

11001583
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation

11001592
gson	jackson
although closed this so post can help you understand the differences between jackson and gson

11001629
vim	emacs

11001704
width	height
note that this won t be necessary if you add accessors for width and height as k-ballo suggests -- then you can just use those accessors in the conversion constructor and forgo the friend definition entirely

11001715
int	double
like all numeric types int may be cast into other numeric types byte short long float double

11001750
factors	matrix
if you have an intercept in the model you can t represent it and each level of the factors as the resulting columns of the model matrix will be linearly dependent on each other - you can represent the same information with at least one fewer columns in the model matrix

11001769
vb.net	vb6
so the main comparison should really be between vb6 and vb.net because that s where you ll find the big differences

11001769
vb.net	vb6
vb.net includes a lot of functionality that has been around in other languages like c++ for ages and is by some considered way to different from vb6 even to be called vb anymore

11001769
vb.net	vb6
when it comes to compiling vb6 compiled to native code while vb.net compiles to cil common intermediate language which makes it a lot easier to reverse engineer however you can obfuscate the code in order to make it less readable

11001774
width	height
it s also inefficient for my purposes because i ve got views with a specific width and height that encapsulate text fields

11001787
ubuntu	debian
it is possible to assemble bare binary debs from a simple directory as you are doing but their usefulness is quite limited since they are difficult to reproduce port maintain autobuild and generally violate all sorts of debian ubuntu policies

textview	imageview
you should put both the imageview and the textview together inside of a cell.xml layout file

11001968
textview	imageview
then inflate and populate that xml file during your getview call instead of making new instancesof textview imageview for each cell in your grid

11002288
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to be the attribute used in firefox and google-chrome for text data i m assuming because it was enclosed in cdata tags

i know that the fractions part will always equal 6 digits as zeros are padded but the integer part is not so for a decimal 12 6 column does the storage get valued per row or at column definition

11006534
put	get
if you can get static date tables put in your database that may be the simplest method

11006555
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
this reads the next character from the file using a bufferedreader xors it against the next character in the key and appends it to a stringbuilder

integer	fractions
for mysql 5.1 and higher it splits up the storage for the integer part and the fractions part and makes room for storage for the largest possibly number

int	boolean
since select is evaluated after group by the if is converting the returned values in favor of an int from the boolean expression and thus your 0.5 gets rounded up to 1 but if you explicitly put a 0 in front of the decimal place the if will treat returned values as a decimal including the result of the boolean expression 1.0 or 0.0

11009573
width	height
can i calculate width and height in points or in inches for each symbol of this font

11009604
children	parent
concepts you would need to use are the focus property of nodes the node requestfocus api sometimes with a delay by executing in platform.runlater to ensure that you override default focus processing and the fact that i think the default focus order depends on the order of children within a parent

11009606

inherited	properties
tasks at any level can be set as featured by the properties inherited from the abstract class

11009805
width	height
another way to think about it is that instead of immediately averaging which does throw away the variance in the data you can produce 40 graphs like your lower one in your posted image from each horizontal row in your spectrum image all these graphs are going to be pretty similar but with some variations in peak position height and width

11009805
width	height
you should calculate the position height and width of each of these peaks in each of these 40 images then combine this data matching peaks across the 40 graphs and use the appropriate variance as an error estimate for peak position height and width by using the central limit theorem

11009813

11014812
filtering	grouping
if you are going to be running on a windows-based server connected to the same domain you are authenticating with then you should look at waffle which provides a servlet a spring security filtering a jaas plugin and a few other ways that you can implement windows integrated authentication which uses native windows methods to load the windows identity and associated active directory grouping

11015396
pop-up	dialog
if you want a real pop-up not a dialog

11015403

and i know that rspec works great for tdd in data models via failing tests but can capybara do this as well

11015834
getter	setter
to create such a property in your case xfraction and yfraction you need to build your own getter and setter associated to this property name

11015834

then you need to build a custom view that wraps the framelayout objects and write your getter and setter

11015869
rspec	minitest
that s where test unit rspec and or minitest come in

11015953

at the moment i can only get 1 variable to post back due to the ajax function below

11016605
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately afaik it s only supported on webkit browsers right now safari google-chrome android ios but it could be good to learn how to use this and also an orm like persistencejs which is a jquery plugin that creates an orm for sqlite and can work on the client or server-side

11016606
hash	md5
and would like the id field of sensitive table to be obfuscated somehow like an md5 hash or something similar so that people querying the view can t see the actual id

11016618
width	height
i played around and by putting the button at the very top for expansion collapse of height from top to bottom or left for expansion collapse of width from left to right everything worked as planned

11016618
width	height
soon enough i hit a wall if you put the button at the bottom or right for expansion collapse of height or width respectively the buttons stay where they are on.

11016620

11016799
post	get
you could post the whole controler so we get a clearer view of your code

11016829
children	parent
the difference is that delegate applies an event handler to a parent element someelement and watches for bubbling events from children

11016835
getter	setter
use a single getter and a single setter function as that s simple simplest and neatest api for client code to call

11016885
mouse	keyboard
as to disable mouse keyboard it s not very user-friendly either

11016885
mouse	keyboard
it is likely that the user will see that sometimes the keyboard mouse stops to work for apparently no reason since he doesn t understand what s happening

i am thinking of a recursive solution where the minimum running time is o max x2 y2

11017511
int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown	onkeyup	onkeydown
and you can t assign an action to the button but you can implement your type of edittext assuming that the text fields are of type edittext which overrides the public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event and or public boolean onkeyup int keycode keyevent event methods or any other you find suitable for your goal

11017609
google-chrome	firefox
all theses facts make me think the problem occurs silently in the browers probably triggered by a buggy add-on antivirus a browser bar or a crappy manufacturer soft integrated in browsers updated yesterday but i didn t find any add-on released yesterday for google-chrome firefox and ie

11017626
inherited	properties
probably the simplest example of where we don t have inherited context links is across random properties elements

11021319
getter	setter
first of all i think is a good practice to maintain class attributes with private visibility and access them through getter and setter

11021319
super	extends
in second place you are not accessing the attribute by inheritance you are creating an instance of zoo and accessing the superstring attribute because of it package visibility you could also access them from another class of the package that don t even extends zoo class and that s generally not a good thing in third place you don t need to create an instance of the super class to access his public or default attribute you could simply do

a slightly less complex way would be to use a fifo queue which would be easily made in a database just save the emails to a table with a datestamp and send them with a select top 10 from outgoingmail order by datestamp asc remember and use proper indexes then use a service to just send them out in batches

hmm well overriding the properties in b means that any accessor in b will access the new properties in b

11022235

11023137

post	put	post	get	put	get
apart from this you should also make sure to implement the four verbs correctly so that they match the sql commands get select post insert put update delete delete handle encoding negotiation correctly return proper http response codes and all the other things that are expected of a restful api

11023447
post	get
for example if you on a post request return the full entry as it now looks in the database you can immediately store it on the phone with the correct id and you can use the same code for rendering the content as you would if it had been downloaded using a get request

11023468
actualheight	actualwidth
what s happening is that this function returns a contentpresenter object with its actualwidth and actualheight properties being 0

11023468

11023577
actualheight	actualwidth
i have used the technique described in this link to bind to actualwidth and actualheight

11023610
width	height
you could wrap each element in an element of the same width height

11023623
mouse	keyboard
the biggest reason is that you re using so-called native events when you re using the ie driver which simulates mouse and keyboard events at the operating system level rather than just within the browser using say javascript and the way ie processes native events is sometimes compromised if the browser window doesn t have focus

11023653
profiling	instrumentation
when i profiling my app in instrumentation 4.3 i get a bunch of leaks

11023670
folder	directory
before now we were using the application folder for monitoring but as security permissions are required to copy the file inside the application root directory we decided to change its path to be the my documents folder

11023678
width	height
the error of width and height not being defined is because they are not local global variables but bound to the class and or the instance of the class therefore in their namespace

11023713
put	get
i also notice that if i put the extension in the same file lib db_hippo rb-readline without making it a submodule of dbhippo i get the error uninitialized constant dbhippo source readline nameerror on the line

it s either an int if there is a match on the select count even if there count is 0 or a boolean of false if there were no results

11023819
division	modulo
you can do it by manipulating the number with division and modulo operations

11023819
int	chars
you could also convert it to a string parse the the month chars and then convert back to an int

11023835
setinterval	clearinterval
you could also use setinterval and clearinterval but there is a small chance that they can pile up on each other if there are delays in the ajax calls

how would one get a csrf_token into the flash app so it can post data back to the server without security concerns

11023933

11024298
put	get
the problem is the input field get variables are causing your url get variables to be truncated put all your url parameters as hidden values

11024315
background-image	background-color
i ve seen this done with two divs and effectively revealing faux fading in the background-image by fading out the background-color of a div covering the background-image

11024358
implements	sealed
hence lies the distinction an unsealed class needs to provide a way for its derived classes to implements dispose of their own while a sealed class is free of this responsibility because it cannot be extended

11024372
maven	pom.xml
by the way i am not using maven i ve seen many examples with pom.xml dependency tags that cannot help me

11024374
flask	django
i m a django developer learning flask

11024387
post	get
forging arbitrary csrf requests with arbitrary media types is effectively only possible with xhr because a formâ s method is limited to get and post and a formâ s post message body is also limited to the three formats application x-www-form-urlencoded multipart form-data and text plain

11024462
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this approach does not require the use of viewwillappear and initialization is done in viewdidload

11024477

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
movie shows the problem on google-chrome but i get similar behavior on firefox and safari all osx

11024573
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
in this case just replace jtextfield with jpasswordfield

11024573
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
also you don t have to worry about listeners or method calls on the text-fields they will still work because jpasswordfield is a subclass of jtextfield

11024624

11024812
firefox	safari
as i see this problem is in safari in firefox all ok

11024814
implements	sealed
if a class which implements idisposable is not sealed it is likely that a derived class will need to do something in response to dispose but the base-class actions for dispose should be performed as well

11024861

11024937
hash	md5
if you are doing this salting hashing in mysql only that is a bad idea i would suggest you perform it in a server side language before storage and if you are already you could always sha1 or md5 your hash result before storage

11024948
width	margin
if your blocks are fixed width why not float them instead and put them in a parent container with a total width and centered using margin 0 auto

the file api filereader object operates the same way in google-chrome as it does in firefox opera or internet explorer 10 yup works in ie

11025115
int	chars
your switch statement is incorrectly trying to match the int position value to the ascii chars 0 and 1

11025141
width	height
but it sounds to me like the width and or height of your radio button or the containing element around it is too small for the size of image you re using

11025141
width	height
if so a css declaration specifying the appropriate width or height should fix it

stringbuilder	stringwriter
this is not merely an internal detail because stringwriter has a public method getstringbuilder that returns the internal stringbuilder and also a constructor that allows you to pass in an existing stringbuilder

11048978
stringbuilder	stringwriter
so stringwriter is an adaptor that allows stringbuilder to be used as a target by code that expects to work with a textwriter

11049010
post	get
i can post some code here but obviously there s quite a lot so i thought i d try and get a general opinion first

it s ok for the compiler to put the second i sub-object at offset 1 inside the int because i has no non-static data members so you can t actually dereference or access anything at that address only get a pointer to the object at that address

11049457
versioning	upgrade
a somewhat extended versioning of the default xpo upgrade mechanism has comfortably catered for all the changes

11049457

i would have thought that whilst the scope limitations of the variables within the for-loop may prevent them from being accessed outside loops as loops s contents exists within the same stack frame the actual declaration only happens once

11049571
pull	push
that way everything will be set up for you to push and pull

11049591

11049696
dictionary	map
the easiest way to do this is probably to overwrite the yaml constructor for tag yaml.org 2002 map so it returns a custom dictionary class instead of an ordinary dictionary

11049702
post	put
when you create or update your models you send post registries or put registries 1

11049729
getter	setter
let us suppose i have created setter and getter of them using properties

11049729
getter	setter
if yes then does that mean creating getter and setter are unnecessary in this case

11049729
nsmutablestring	nsstring
which is better using nsmutablestring or nsstring

11049740
getter	setter
the closest you can get works for class members and involves magic getter and setter

11049762
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the second and third options don t even work with the warning incompatible pointer types assigning nsmutablestring to nsstring

11049776
icmp	tcp
the replica set monitor thread similarly will continue to ping the members of the replica set that are down and fail to connect to them it s not actually an icmp ping it is a tcp connection attempt

i took the liberty in changing the animations a bit but you should get the idea along with the many comments i put in to understand the flow concept

11049949
width	height
also what i noticed was if i used the deprecated uikeyboardboundsuserinfokey i used to get the correct width and height of the keyboard i am working only in landscape mode

11049949
width	height
whereas when i used uikeyboardframebeginuserinfokey the width and height values were interchanged

11049957
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring will save some memory as nsstring objects are always constants

11049968
getter	setter
i could easily find the solution by implementing the applicationcontextaware interface which has the getter and setter method for context

11050027
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the other solution i provided isn t even perfect across all of the browsers with some combinations of font sizes because google-chrome opera round inexact values differently than firefox ie so even with my solution you d need to use some browser-specific css

11050030

i wonder if because i used hover with a function only for the mouseover part of it jquery had already decided it had an empty mouseleave so ignored the second one

11050087
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so the simple rule is that if you need to modify the string in any way use a nsmutablestring and if not nsstring

11050087
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you can also cast a nsmutablestring to a nsstring but not the other way around then you need to make a copy

11050145
min	max
update the bodge doesn t work because the min and max date fields get validated independently and pass validation

11050849
mouse	keyboard
for instance if you would delete your pc you would still have your 3 monitors mouse keyboard and your awesome sound system

11050853

debugging with profiling instrumentation

11051221
maven	m2e
empty goals list in m2e maven but it did not worked

11051242
draggable	droppable
you will have to make all the label as draggable and all the empty spaces possibly divs with fixed width as droppable

11051255
width	height
remember that cocos2d always saves images with a width height being a power of 2

11051256
textview	imageview
my list_details has the textview and imageview in a relative layout

11051297
width	height
now ignoring the hard-coded values etc - this is just an illustration of the problem - after clicking ok on the print dialog when the cdc passed to ondraw is the printer s dc the values of rect i get are left 0 top 0 right 2010 bottom -2880 which tallies with the width and height variables values which are 201 and 288 respectively

11051297
width	height
my gut is to just adjust the information retrieved from getdevicecaps and assume the width and height are 0.1mm smaller than reported but i feel like i m missing something

11051370
equals	gethashcode
note that you may need to override equals and gethashcode in class bar

11051379

when you hover over it in webkit browsers google-chrome safari it seems to glitch and go light blue then to the proper colour

11051532
disk	ram
quite a lot of disk for a desktop system and rather more than most people can afford when it comes to ram so you need to find another approach

11051854
fish	zsh
but it is possible in other shells in zsh see or in fish see

11051862
ilist	icollection
while you can use the length property as others explained an array also implements the ilist interface which in turn implements icollection which defines a count property

11051920
int	boolean
and unless this is explicitly required you shouldn t be optimising for memory use an array with 10k elements does not take much memory at all even if you were storing each boolean in an 64 bit int it s only 80 kb

11051958
put	get
get a dropbox account and put the project in your public folder

11051975
inherited	properties

11051989
express	node.js
i just inherited a project with node.js express written in coffeescript and using jade to render views

for-loop	arrays
i d prefer to keep this less messy by creating an arrays of the urls and using a for-loop to iterate over it something like this

11051997
nsnull	nsstring
sadly only nsstring nsnumber nsarray nsdictionary or nsnull types are supported

11052013
fadein	fadeout
i have the following code which switches some fullscreen-background-images fadeout fadein

11052065
inherited	properties
as a follow up what properties did 80x86 architecture inherited from 8086 why doesn t intel just call the cpu 8087 but instead it s called 80186 80286 80386 and etc

11052118
portrait	landscape
how you design the view portrait landscape in interface builder has no influence over how it will actually be shown

if you still want to use 50 width then use box-sizing border-box

11052242
children	parent
type_id of 1 is parent and its children are displayed below. until i read another parent

11052253

i think what you are looking for is to queue it so it runs fadeout - new queued - fadein

11052309
width	height
the way i am traing to make it works is by embeding a wmplayer object with 100 width and height and placing on the top of that layer another layer with a background and some php code to load the tweets

11052322
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if using apache putting rewrite rules into either the directory section of the httpd.conf file or into an .htaccess would probably be the easiest way to do this

i have an .net 3.5 application as a parent application and in the same folder i added a virtual directory which runs a .net 4.0 application

11052415

11052441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in ie

11052491
post	get
without timeline most of the distribution is likely lost as there s no aggregation units on timeline and news feed distribution of a single action is unlikely but your calls should definitely result in something appearing in your activity log and the post id you get back should be retrievable from the api to verify the details at action_id

11052505
int	chars
now the the situation is like this with the help of xml-rpc-c i can transfer chars and int but now i want to transfer some binary data

11052507

11052533
put	get
i feel that the html5 version will ensure good ranking but i wanted to put it to the community and get an opinion

11052539
codeigniter	yii
purely subjective answer but codeigniter and yii are pretty well known and support starting points

11052637
vbo	normals
the first fact i recognized is of course drawing images is much faster than imagelines beacuse of vbos but also i cannot pre-put vertex-data into a vbo for imagelines because imagelines have no static shape like normals images varying linelength varying linewidth and the vertex positions of x1 y1 and x2 y2 change too often

11052637
vbo	normals
that s why i use a normals floatbuffer instead of a vbo

11052642
post	get
we observe that browser is making a lots of get and post requests

11052642
post	get
can you please help me how can i get all the requests get post and responses

11052650
google-chrome	firefox
here is the code sample that works both on firefox and google-chrome

11052675
width	height
set the table to 100 width and height and set its text align and vertical align to middle

11052689
implements	extends
testgui extends frame which in turn implements serializable

11052781
hide	show
so you can handle the show hide logic of your steps and for validation you could just do this

11052833
int	boolean	int	double
here s my current solution i ll create enumerations for each type of member variable i want to access one for double one for int one for strings one for boolean etc

11052835
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so i subscribed my parent view controller to uiapplicationdidbecomeactivenotification and re-execute manually the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods of the controller containing the uiimagepickercontroller

11052841
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
but the result renders totally different in ie 9 vs opera firefox and google-chrome

11052841
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
how can i make ie render the same way as opera firefox and google-chrome

11052841
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
is the cause but why does this make ie9 render some thing so totally different than opera firefox and google-chrome

11052873
textview	imageview
you could easily extend the view class and replicate this with two textview and an imageview

11052878
.htaccess	httpd.conf
basically you ll want something like this either in the section of httpd.conf or a local .htaccess

11052904
folder	directory
in unix you don t see the network directory because you need to use a protocol like samba to access folder over network

11052909
google-chrome	firefox
returns undefined in ie 9 but works in google-chrome and firefox

11052921
serializable	deserialization
if the number 1332856031313 is being serializable as 1.33286e+12 there is no way to get it back in the deserialization process

11052977
x86	64bit
there are very few things that intel amd don t want to continue supporting or already chose not to undocumented and duplicate instructions and some instructions and instruction encodings in 64bit mode but 64bit mode is not your normal x86 and for that reason is commonly referred to as x86 64 or x64

11052988
google-chrome	firefox
this seams to work on google-chrome and firefox but doesn t work as expected on ie

11052992
google-chrome	firefox
compare google-chrome to firefox note how the editor is apparently missing in firefox.

11053075
punctuation	words
lastword is of course defined as __block so we can set it inside the block and see it outside and it s initialized to nil so if the string has no words if it s empty or is all punctuation we don t crash when we try to use lastword

11053120
addclass	removeclass
in this case i d track what s been clicked with classes using the jquery addclass removeclass and toggleclass so once clicked you add the class clicked to the parent li element

11053121
highcharts	highstock
i have implemented the same with highcharts but when i looked at highstock compare i was pretty much impressed by the way it is doing

11053127
hash	salt
the database then re-encrypts it with the salt and compares the hash s

11053127
hash	salt
in this situation the salt needs to be passed from the database back to the web server for the hash to be created

11053127
hash	salt
should the web server be compromised salt and hash can be requested from the database and easily cracked

11053151
np-hard	np-complete
i was using backtracking algorithm so it explain a lot why it was so much faster with bitwise operation since sodoku is a np-complete maybe np-hard problem

11053158
min	max
by default the functions max and min do not count null in their evaluation of your data

11053175
devise	cancan
i ve been looking into cancan to run alongside devise but i m not sure if this is the answer

11053176
draggable	droppable
you could use the droppable s over and out methods to detect when the draggable was over it and then implement the grid parameter only at that point

11053202
qevent	qcoreapplication
call qcoreapplication sendpostedevents 0 qevent deferreddelete

11053202
qevent	qcoreapplication
call qcoreapplication sendpostedevents mpage qevent deferreddelete

11053225
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction of nodes links

11053225
d3.js	infovis	d3.js	sigma.js	infovis	sigma.js
i ve looked into many existing js frameworks including infovis jit dracula d3.js sigma.js etc

11053283
uiview	subviews
then when you have your two points you can add a new uiview as subviews which is aware of the two cgpoint and will draw a line in its drawrect method

11053298
for-loop	arrays
if it is a reference problem how do i get two hash tables in to different arrays elements withouot creating multiple hash tables i have to run the code inside a for-loop to add multiple hash tables.creating separate hash tables every time does not sound good

11053314
width	font-size
for the people curious to know why i need this very font and font-size it s because it is such that the width of any character and the width of a dash - are the same

11053324
oursql	mysql-python
if i use mysql-python instead of oursql it takes about 2 seconds

11053335
primefaces	richfaces
okay i m currently migrating a richfaces 3.3.3 jsf 1.2 project to mojarra 2.1.7 snapshot 20120206 and primefaces 3.3 which is imho revelation to jsf

11053367
folder	directory
the classpath determines where to find classes the working folder defines the starting directory of your application.

11053383
google-chrome	firefox
use something like firebug firefox addon ie development tools or google-chrome dev tools to find out the fonts used

11053388
sudoers	passwd
in order to use bin mount without a passwd i must add this line to sudoers

11053388
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
if i give the passwd it accepts it and runs - so it must know which user is running it and allow the user to use sudo so it does honour part of sudoers but it doesn t honour the nopasswd keyword for bin mount

11053418
hash	salt
a salt is used to prevent a dictionary attack against hash passwords

11053418
hash	salt
furthermore proper randomly-generated salt prevent an attacker from knowing that you and i have the same password without the salt we d have the same hash

11053418
hash	salt
they are not public information but an attacker getting access to the salt values + the hash does not necessarily mean that the passwords have been compromised

11053483
hash	md5
sure it probably has md5 and sha1 but these are cryptographic hash functions

11053483
scrypt	pbkdf2
does it have bcrypt or scrypt or pbkdf2

11053483
hash	salt
the hash and salt are never held in the application

11053483
hash	salt
in this case the hash and salt are pulled from the database into the application and the hashing of the raw password and comparison is done there

11053483
hash	salt
i would consider the raw password to be more sensitive than the hash and the salt together

11053484
rss	feed
i have a rss feed in an xml file at the root level

11053484
rss	feed
is there a way to have wordpress add to that rss feed every-time publish a blog post

11053503
hide	show
i would also like to hide show some child elements of this div

11053534
getter	setter
and at the very least end up with ajax requests cardrest and handofcardsrest classes with the specified methods stubbed out and card and handofcards classes with properties or getter setter

11053550
getter	setter
in java i use getter setter when i have simple models pojos

11053550
getter	setter
problems rise when using languages where getter and setter start feeling clunky like in python and i often hear people saying that they are bad

11053550
getter	setter
so my question is how do you guys document code without getter and setter

11053560
post	get
a few searches yielded me these two blog post on how to get scite to print javascript test to its output rather than just opening a web browser when you press f5 to test the code

11053564
int	double
also envoke the number number method and not the int double method

11053564
int	double
i get a compiler error that it can not choose between the number number and int double method.

11053588
ssl	socks
if i remember correctly ssl will work across http and socks proxies

11053627
away3d	papervision3d
that being said it s been a while since i ve touched the pv3d stuff but i remember i had to be very specific in how my collada geometry was written - the parser in papervision3d only reads a subset of the spec if it tried to read the full spec the parser would be enormous - part of why away3d does not support it

11053649
mouseleave	mouseenter
use .on mouseenter ... and .on mouseleave ... instead of .hover ... otherwise only the elements that aren t active on document ready will be targeted

11053683
getter	setter
whether you use getter and setter to access the defined attributes of a class is a little more fungible to me

11053683
getter	setter
and others by getter setter

11053689
innodb	myisam
if your table uses innodb engine no support for transactions with myisam transaction is the most efficient solution but also the most complex

11053690
post	get
for example in some cases after post or get request i want to redirect user not only to specific page but to a specific part of page

11053694
message-queue	messaging
we now have to provide a message-queue interface to the application for some high throughput internal messaging from c++ producers

11053703
width	height
i m not gonna edit off the position absolute portion as it might be helpful for those who are thinking of making a div inherit the window s height and width without the use of jquery

11053705
integer	unsigned
i imagine the methods would look similar to an unsigned integer divided by its maximum representable value

11053711
apache	lighttpd
not as simple as using something like apache or lighttpd in front but likely just as effective and allows you to keep everything within tomcat if that s really what you want

11053725
google-chrome	firefox
aside from api incompatibilities between at least two major browsers firefox and google-chrome the ie10 implementation has yet to be released to the public

11053737
versioning	upgrade
microsoft.net 4.5 is coming and i want to upgrade my clickonce app when ms releases the final versioning

11053762
integer	unsigned
can t you simply do all calculations in integers from 0 to max_int keeping all the same formulas algorithms whatever and then use unsigned integer divided by its maximum representable value conversion as very final step before printing result to user or otherwise outputting it - for example in intermediate logs

11053793
int	double
the int double function doesn t match at all

11053793
int	double
convert 5 to an int and convert 1.2 to a double

11053793
int	double
leave 5 as a primitive int but convert 1.2 to a double

11053793
int	double
as an aside if you had a method that took int double there would be no ambiguity at all that method actually matches the existing types of 5 and 1.2 so it would be called

11053799
acs	adfs
2 other than some special knowledge around hooking up acs adfs i m not sure what seeking someone with azure experience will get you

11053799
put	get
people put all kinds of crap on their resumes just to get in the door hoping you won t notice

11053820
width	height
i m looking for an efficient algorithm that for a space with known height width and length given a fixed radius r and a list of points n with 3-dimensional coordinates in that space will find all the points within a fixed radius r of an arbitrary point on the grid

11053820
addition	multiplication
i thought this would offer a speedup as it only needs addition instead of multiplication but it actually slowed the program down by a little bit

11053822
post	get
i get how you do post and sending but little lost has to how to pull from that

11053846
portrait	landscape
if i start my device in portrait mode rotate to landscape mode and rotate back to portrait mode it prints 989 989 565

11053898
opensuse	linux
i ve been assigned to develop a software on linux opensuse 11.4

11053975
allocator	stl
now in regard to the forward allocator point that anthony-arnold mentions all stl containers make promises about amortized operation time

11053993
int	chars
you can enumerate the chars of the string and use the character.isdigit method you can even intertwine the verification and the transformation into an int

11054009
put	get
however i cant put values in or get them out

11054017
cpu	affinity
the only way i know of for code to force a strong memory model would be to have each thread set its cpu affinity

11054017
cpu	affinity
if there were a way to set a process option so .net would only use one core at a time that might be useful especially if it meant that the jit could replace bus-locking interlocked operations with faster non-bus-locking equivalents but the only means i know of setting cpu affinity would limit a program to using a particular selected cpu for all its threads even if that cpu was heavily loaded by other applications and some other cpu was sitting idle

11054024
implements	extends
now if someone would be interested in implements that in pydev it d be a matter of extends the method getchildren from for the use-case where it s not a dir or zip-file to try to parse it and create the proper nodes

11054028
google-chrome	firefox
it is working in google-chrome but not in firefox

11054053
getter	setter
struts2 provides a clean way to put your request response data in valuestack and its ognl system provides a very clean way to access those data from the value stack.all you need to have a list in your action class with its getter and setter and at ui use build in struts2 tag to access those data.here is a simple code to accomplish this

11054074
getter	setter
but why are you wrapping it in a getter and setter at all

11054079
opensuse	linux
of course other linux distributions have similar setups opensuse has obs

11054081
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work for me in ie7 in windows and google-chrome firefox though i haven t been able to test it in ie6

11054113
width	height
you need to set the width and height of the canvas in javascript too

11054126
matplotlib	colormap
colormap class in matplotlib has nice methods set_over and set_under which allow to set color to be used for out-of-range values on contour plot

11054128
puts	gets
when it gets to 5 the second if statement causes it to go to 4 then the first if statement puts it back to 5

11054171
getter	setter
it will at least let you nix all your getter and setter

11054185
opera	google-chrome
at least this did work for me when using icsâ default web browser google-chrome beta and opera mobile

11054206
awt	swing	swt	swing
the two obvious choices for a java app are awt swing java s standard gui frameworks or eclipse s swt rcp

11054206
awt	swing
if you re looking to stick with awt swing then eclipse also has tooling to help with that

11054208
min	max
i want to for each level of gene_id get the min start max end mean pctat mean pctgc and sum length

do.call	lapply
i tried using lapply and do.call for this but it s taking forever +30 minutes to run

11054223
justmock	typemock
will i have to end up using a mocking framework such as typemock or justmock

11054231
listview	gridview
the gridview listview expandablelistview gallery classes in android provide important optimizations that allow you to display long lists or grids of content without drawing the entire list at the same time

11054318
pop-up	dialog
i am developing a small app wherein a dialog must pop-up when the user touches anywhere on the screen and if the dialog is already being displayed then on clicking anywhere outside the dialog box it must disappear

i can rotate my phone and it switches to landscape but if i rotate my phone back to portrait the video rotates as well

11054320
portrait	landscape
any ideas why it allows the rotation back to portrait and how i can start the playback in landscape

11054353
post	get
sorry i just saw you re after post not get something like this should work

11054398
versioning	upgrade
does your application allow side by side installs versioning 1 and versioning 2 can be installed at the same time or does your installer upgrade earlier versioning to the latest versioning

11054398
installation	upgrade
you might try logging the installation and reviewing the log file to see exactly what is happening during the install upgrade process

11054398
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade earlier versioning it would seem that the com interop components are not registered properly

11054398
installation	upgrade
i would log an installation that you know works without issue on a clean machine and then log an installation that you know will fail an upgrade and then compare the two log files using a tool to see if the output is identical

11054445
subtraction	addition
2 s complement makes sense because it can be used in natural addition and subtraction arithmetic without any need to change the bits

11054445
subtraction	addition
the bit number promotion and addition subtraction arithmetic is a bit mess with this notation

11054450
hide	show
nb - these variables are used else where in the script to perform some show hide behaviour so i am keen not to redefine elsewhere

11054460
client-side	server-side
so how can i get client-side to mirror server-side consistency

11054542
client-side	server-side
the problem lies when the client-side validation is bypassed and fails on the server-side validation

11054560
maven	pom.xml
positive side effect when adding or updating a library dependency only one place maven pom.xml needs to be updated the rest can easily be regenerated

11054586
button	right-align
you probably found out by now but you have to add a uibarbuttonsystemitemflexiblespace to the left of your button to have it right-align

11054624
client-side	server-side
you need to separate your server-side and client-side code

11054645
range	minimum
you could use the numpy where function to replace values in a specified range to the overall maximum or minimum value and that would effectively whiten or blacken those values in your plot

11054678
setinterval	clearinterval
you can use setinterval capture the intervalid and use clearinterval to cancel the loop in a click handler on the div containing the rotating ads

11054701
ant	maven
ant and maven integration see second half

11054724
int	chars
if that uid only contained int values you d use int whereas if it was a 6-character alphanumeric value you d use chars 6

11054775
width	height
the density screen width height have not change

11054784
noscript	meta
so if you wrap your meta element in a noscript element it should only be parsed if javascript is disabled

11054850
for-loop	loops
if you had a for-loop running then it would block your main thread until it has finished looping in the meanwhile if the connection finished while the for-loop is still running then your delegate code will not execute until after loops has finished

11054861
folder	directory
so in the . classification folder i m going to generate classification.so and thus to the other directory

11054870
post	get
also what http protocols will you be using for specific requests like get post etc

11054870
post	get
furthermore you will have to decide at what url s on the server will it be useful to get or post to depending on the data you want to send or receive

11054877
portrait	landscape
althought the device orientation was in landscape mode the interface turns always to the portrait mode

11055036
bash	zsh
in bash ksh zsh you can simply -2 1

11055039
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do no let you click the radio button as the .shield is positioned over the top of it however ie9 and i assume older versions does even though developer tools shows .shield is correctly in place

11055068
junit	easymock
i m using easymock 3.1 to mock mycollaborator in a junit 4 test class that is testing classundertest

11055068
junit	easymock
i ve used easymock and junit extensively in the past in exactly this manner and have never run into anything like this before

11055123
hex	binary
if i understand correctly i would have to convert this array into string then into hex and then into a string of binary

11055214
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
in a qgraphicsscene i have a background set with a few qgraphicsitem s on top of it

11055243
int	boolean

11055329
width	height
if i modify the meaureoverride so that i set height of rowdefinition s to minimum and width of columndefinition s to minimum then it works

11055329
width	height
but i saw some videos and they say you should not be explicitly setting height width properties of anything

11055332
min	max
to find the min or max value for a specific indexed column key_col

11055332
min	max
in this case mysql does a single key lookup for each min or max expression and replaces it with a constant

11055332
min	max
select min key_part2 max key_part2

11055332
min	max
note in particular that the where clause must refer to columns that occur before the column for which you wish to calculate the min or max which is why your current index is not used efficiently

11055357
hash	md5
but i haven t got no password neither md5 hash i have only md5 md5 pass+salt

11055370
min	max
to find the min or max value for a specific indexed column key_col

11055370
min	max
in this case mysql does a single key lookup for each min or max expression and replaces it with a constant

11055370
min	max
select min key_part2 max key_part2 from tbl_name where key_part1 10

11055372
portrait	landscape
so you are either having one view controller for a tab that returns no for all orientations or you are having conflicting orientations one view which only supports landscape and another that only supports portrait

11055383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if they do and their terminology includes the saving action for the editor on one side most scriptable document based apps do so in the form the page refreshing for the browser s on the other google-chrome has safari gets the same result via a javascript detour â i donâ t use firefox you are set

11055423
post	get
while i still cannot get it still does not work via the -sslv3 flag with curl this post saved the day

11055460
post	get
the value of foo.bar in the get and post method is but i am expecting string test

11055495
kerberos	ntlm
note if you re using ntlm and not kerberos or another delegatable protocol it will not work as the middle server the iis server needs to have a token that it can pass along

11055509
hash	md5
i store close to 2 million images that are stored in a simple folder structure xx yy filename where filename md5 of file + optional number should a hash collision happen xx first 2 characters of md5 yy 3rd and 4th character of md5

11055517
integer	unsigned
it generates an unsigned integer seed on program startup and then produces a 256 uint array based on that seed

11055519
int	double
currently only int are supported but i would like to add support for double too

11055602

you attach this method to any event you can catch with jquery and show hide and divs

11055629
uiview	subviews
that s how i m using uiview in uiviewcontroller and added uiimageview and uitextview as subviews of uiview in uiviewcontroller didn t showed code for uitextview because you are not asking about it in your question

11055637
button	checkbox
they enter the text for the checkbox into a textbox on the page and click a button to append the checkbox

11055669
min	max
as noted this is when you start playing with the min max idle instances -- you can tradeoff response time for fewer instances

11055669
min	max
in the example let s say you adjust min max idle and let your app s response time go up but by doing so you reduced the number of active instances from 4 back to 1

11055679
put	get
since you want to average the averages you need to put in a single constant value for the _id field so that all of the input documents get grouped into a single result

11055716
cashapelayer	cagradientlayer
another problem however is i cannot switch to using a path instead of a mask because i am using gradients and cagradientlayer does not have a path property like cashapelayer which is why i used a mask

11055741
screens	tablet
if you ve developed your application primarily for versions of android lower than 3.0 but your application does resize properly for larger screens such as tablet you should disable screens compatibility mode in order to maintain the best user experience

post	get
i want to be able to get a user s address and post zip code then display a map showing their location

11055764
post	get
step 1 make sure all pages that are going to use the pager controller are passing all parameters via get not post

11055764
post	get
use redirecttoaction if you must accept post somewhere and just translate all the parameters into primitive types for the get method

11055772
post	get
is it possible to use webclient to post to a server and get a response

11055785
put	get
after you get the indexes put in and the query performing at a normal rate 1min times you can look at additional index tuning or adding table query hints where needed

versioning	upgrade
if you want to upgrade your database simply add the new column in your create statement then increment the versioning

11055890
google-chrome	firefox
i used the above condition to test out different portions of my code for ie only and that not only helped to narrow down what was wrong but i was able to keep my working code in tact for firefox google-chrome

11055890
google-chrome	firefox
my final solution was to acutally use the browser if statement to run a different function for ie and another for firefox google-chrome

11055905
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in any browser except ie8 tested ie7 ie9 firefox google-chrome safari the google maps is correct

11055911
code128	code39
there are other complex bar codes like hibc lic and hibc pas with implementations using code39 or code128

11055911
code128	code39
so you can go with code39 or code128 gs1 family and replace with whatever ais func

11055923
int	double
i m building some input checker that needs to have specific functions for int and or double for example isprime should only be available for int

11055940
google-chrome	firefox
this example works fine in firefox and google-chrome when the window doesn t have focus

11055965
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine with firefox and windows explorer but issues arise with google-chrome and ie haven t tried any other browsers just yet

11055965
google-chrome	firefox
looking at the output it seems that firefox actually saves the image to the clipboard whereas google-chrome is just grabbing the html of the image while ie doesn t do anything with it

11055965
google-chrome	firefox
a couple of workarounds i ve found are to parse the html google-chrome firefox for an image source then download from the source using something like the webclient object

11055986
imagemagick	im4java
under the hood we will be using imagemagick and its java adaptor library im4java

11055986
imagemagick	im4java
create an imageservice.war web service that deploys alongside the primary app and basically handles all calls to im4java under the hood exposes say a restful service and just runs imagemagick when it receives a request

11056083
oncreate	setcontentview
with setcontentview in oncreate

11056084
width	height
one alternative that may suit you is varying the width of the chart because they do have a properties for dynamic height and dynamic width see also this blogpost

11056092
put	get
as chris shain points out below you have to be careful where you put it though since in the case of a thread abort you ll get a threadabortexception in your thread so if you put it in the finally clause it will get set even in the case of a thread abort

11056133
put	get
i have already put together code using the system.net.webclient class to pull source code from a webpage which i then use a string search on to get specific information

dlopen	backtrace
this option is needed for some uses of dlopen or to allow obtaining backtrace from within a program

11056207
outputstream	inputstream
calling the close methods on the inputstream or outputstream of an httpurlconnection after a request may free network resources associated with this instance but has no effect on any shared persistent connection

to add to michael s answer the reason why you should not use for string comparison hopefully this will help you navigate similar difficulties in the future is that when you call a simple on an object such as a string or really anything other than an int double float chars long short or boolean in most languages what you re really comparing is the address in memory of each object that is the pointer value

i ve fiddled with this for days comparing google-chrome with firefox mostly

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome agree about the left and bottom but they do not agree about the top nor the right of the parent container

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has an extra column or two of pixels on the right when compared to google-chrome

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
it also appears when you put a border around the foo span that firefox moves the text up a pixel when compared to google-chrome

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
the descenders in firefox do not touch the border while they do or very nearly do in google-chrome

mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
the listeners that i use are mousedown mouseup mousemove

11059587
width	height
but rather than set the child object s width height directly you should use one of the flex lifecycle methods setactualsize or setlayoutboundssize

11059587
width	height
when you set a flex component s width height the component will invalidate itself so that on the next update cycle it can be re-rendered

11059587
width	height
the setactualsize and setlayoutboundssize methods set the width height on a flex component but do not invalidate the component

11059587
width	height
it will most certainly execute less code than if you set width height properties directly

11059615

landscape because the width and height parameters passed to sublayout will already reflect that

11060084
width	height
its width and height is the same of the view that is using it

11060084
width	height
then if this view has no width and height it ll have no width and height too

11060084
width	height
basically i think that your imageview has no width and height then it s invisible

11060084
width	height
set imageview width and height programmatically

11060090

my actual solution is to reset bash as the main shell and always run fish to use it

you need to set an explicit width and height on the canvas

11060168
width	height
the default dimensions of a canvas are a width of 300 and a height of 150 see the spec here

11060168
width	height
by setting the width and height via css you are just stretching the canvas

11060168

or set the width height via javascript

i think you may have some problems if you change from python 2.6 to 2.7 or 2.7 to 3.x but if you just upgrade inside the same versioning staying at 2.7 as you want you shouldn t have any problem as all the packages are held in the same folders for both python versioning 2.7.x and 2.7.y packages are inside your_env lib python2.7

if you are trying to derive the original algorithm that generated the hash of a giving set of values and hash you could try mainstream algorithms and see if you get any hits if not it maybe impossible or simply take to much time to find the most common homegrown algorithms tend to be a combination of a world wide salt + unique random salt + multiple iterations of a common hashing function sha256

uiview	subviews
you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards

post	put	post	get	put	get
if you need more powerful mappings you can use regular expressions in the first parameter of app. get post put del to filter for specific paths instead

11066441
put	get
put those back together and you get #dd0806

11066459
put	get
i know that node.js operates as a giant event-queue all http requests and their callbacks get put into that queue together with some other events

11066497
draggable	droppable
i want to have several classes of draggable each one corresponding to a class of droppable

11066497
draggable	droppable
but in addition i want to have a separate waste bin where all the draggable can be dropped until a suitable droppable can be found for them

11066497
draggable	droppable
however i may have up to 20 classes each one with 30-40 draggable droppable

11066497
draggable	droppable
so if i use an accept function for this the moment i pick up a draggable my chrome freezes as it runs tests for every droppable on the screen

11066510
hide	show
how do i perform show hide of the tr s by clicking the corresponding visible rows

11066510
hide	show
i have seen examples where one row next one is removed but how do i show hide tr within the parent table of the visible row and hide all child row not in 1 st positon

11066527
width	margin
it is based on the fact that vertical padding margin use the width of the parent box when it is set to percentages so it is possible to resize a div relative its parent box

11066544
put	get
you can make get put and getrandom all be o 1 average time

11066563
put	get
i know that node.js operates as a giant event-queue all http requests and their callbacks get put into that queue together with some other events

11066585
width	height
here ive used padding-bottom to maintain its height relative to its width

11066596

what you have to do is change the method from viewdidappear to viewwillappear

11066601
textview	imageview
i am trying to display an imageview with 4 textview

11066656
postgresql	mysql
historically sqlite3 doesn t perform as well as mysql or postgresql for large datasets which is the reason i recommend switching

11066686
disk	ram
for 1000 simultaneous calls i think the most concern would be to have a fast enough disk system and enough ram for i o cache

11066691
google-chrome	firefox
but it seems to work fine in firefox google-chrome and ie9

11066697
post	get
i m trying to get post with a particular taxonomy

11066759
min	max
you can eliminate those by removing the two select statements and insert the min max values directly into your temp table instead

11066798
decoder	encoder
you are trying to use the divx codec on a platform that has neither a native encoder nor decoder for it

11066815
uilabel	uibutton
should also work but is probably overkill as it will affect all uilabel not just the ones contained in uibutton .

11066884
public	protected
again it could and probably should be a different implementation for different language plugins - in php you work with classes methods and variables and have to care about visibility private public protected

11066886
folder	directory
i moved the css to one directory above my application folder

11066888
int	boolean	int	double
when it is allocated on stack only reference counted variables are initialized others kind of variable like int or double or boolean or enumerations are in a random state probably non zero

11066893
voip	sip
there are hundreds of voip providers which sell you an us number for a few bucks per month and the incoming calls would be delivered to you via sip

11066925
addition	multiplication
i could use a two dimensional array but a complete matrix library with multiplication addition etc. would be much more convenient

11066931
screens	tablet
is there a way to make sure an application runs in a small screens on a tablet

11066933

i m getting raw data from both the keyboard and the mouse - the keyboard data is being received to my application perfectly i m having no trouble at all

11066952
portrait	landscape
i ve got the images to float left and line up quite nicely within my div but i would like the images to align vertically as some are portrait and others are landscape

11066965
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian the log files end up under var log apache2 .

11066983
portrait	landscape
most of the app is locked to portrait mode but one section makes sense to be in landscape

11066983
portrait	landscape
currently is looks ugly as the status bar just switches to the top of the landscape view and shows a little black bar on the portrait one as it slides in

11066995
stdout	stderr
i also redirected the output from stderr to stdout so it could be processed in the pipe by perl

11067032
coalesce	isnull
i always considered isnull and coalesce to be equivalent except for the number of possible parameters

11067126
uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller
is there any specific way to use and access stand alone uinavigationbar with uitabbarcontroller

do they all have the same width same height or a certain size depending on whether it s a landscape or portrait image

11067231
subscript	superscript
basic formatting such as size bold italic strikeout subscript and superscript

11067248
quicksort	mergesort
in cases where there are a small number of values bucket sort can be much faster than the more commonly used quicksort or mergesort

11067264
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
objectoutputstream accepts a fileoutputstream as argument which can append to a file

11067288
width	height
width and height are overruled if the overflow isnt set to none or scroll

11067288

folder	directory
my static folder is in project with 2 directory like so

11067318
button	checkbox
i m implementing a php 5.4.4 class for including class definitions in a dynamic fashion for html rendering so if i have a form with two button four text inputs and a checkbox i just include the .php files corresponding to a form a textbox and a button and not anything else each html object is represented with a class

11067326
google-chrome	firefox
the image map loads in google-chrome but for some reason it doesn t display in firefox

11067335
post	get
but you must consider on how to add the parent id on the table how to get the parent post child post data out from database how to design the rewrite rules for child post etc

11067343
addition	multiplication
for example integers along with the operations of addition negation and multiplication form a ring

11067360
setinterval	settimeout
i used setinterval instead of settimeout for reasons given here

11067389
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
startswith is case-sensitive if you want to use case-insensitive use istartswith

11067397
postgresql	mysql
alternatively databases like mysql postgresql and others allow you to use regular expressions as well but that s more costly in terms of processing power

11067412
cpu	processors
the graphics card has a special purpose processors or often more than one so the compiler takes the input in the shader language and turns it into the assembly language for that processors much like a c compiler does for the cpu

11067413
width	height
the image is height 60px and width 30px

11067414
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is being nice by ignoring your error the # in the name attribute firefox is being nice by forcing you to stick to the specification rather than trying to guess what you mean

11067448
3des	aes
desfire offers aes and 3des for maximum flexibility with encrypted maced or plain communication your choice

11067472
opera	firefox
firefox internet explorer opera accept following code

11067481
onresume	onpause
step #2 have your activity register a broadcastreceiver with localbroadcastmanager in onresume and unregister it in onpause

11067482
mouseup	mousedown
i think the problem was that when the native drag event that dragged the image was fired on mousedown it was preventing the mouseup event to be fired

11067500
stateless	stateful
i want a bit of clarity on whether https is stateful or stateless

11067500
stateless	stateful
since http essentially works over tcp ip which is stateless hence http is stateless but when i switched to https my api became stateful

11067557
google-chrome	firefox
which seems to work just fine in google-chrome and firefox what i have access to

11067618
serializable	deserialization
however the classnotfoundexception was a result of incorrect serializable deserialization of the enum type

11067665
config	ini
working view helper ini config

11067665
config	ini
non-working action helper ini config

11067688
ssl	https
strictly speaking https is not a separate protocol but refers to use of ordinary http over an encrypted ssl tls connection

11067688
udp	tcp
and the http protocol is stateless by design not because it is used most frequently over tcp ip nothing stops you to use http over udp for example

11067700
post	get
i went through numerous post to figure out ideal setup inputs settings to get pass initial login screen but i had no luck

11067711
momentjs	datejs
i d like to recommend momentjs - a very lightweight yet surprisingly capable datejs library

11067714
addition	multiplication
since strings and any other reference types are stored in arrays as references finding the right element of the array requires one multiplication one addition and following one pointer the notion of a pointer here is at the implementation level not the programmer-visible level

11067730
gif	ico	gif	png	png	ico
the icon needs to be in ico format for it to work gif or png do not work

11067865
gtk	clutter
you may also use gtk and clutter

11067875
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

11067879
ddms	adb
usb debugging enabled connected to win7 x64 - adb devices would not find the tablet nor would ddms which i need for screenshots don t want to root the tablet

11067881
onresume	onpause
i m observing in my code that if i don t call onpause and onresume then the context is not lost when i press the home button so i can switch between applications and then go back to my game and everything is working

11067881
onresume	onpause
if i don t call onpause and onresume can i assume that it will never be destroyed

11067885
hackage	hakyll
now hakyll starts reinstalling pandoc and gets the new version from hackage i guess thereby overriding the local changes that i made in pandoc

11067897
mouseup	mousedown
here s a demo that will alter the style values with mouseup mousedown

11067898
google-chrome	safari
the above code works for at least the safari and google-chrome desktop browsers but doesnt work for mobile devices

11067900
google-chrome	firefox
if you have google-chrome you ve probably used the inspector if you don t firefox has similar addons so you can use something like firebug

11067907
width	height
this point is going to change it position randomly but thats not the point so lets assume that it has its own velocity and its moving on plane with restricted width and height

11067939
writetofile	nsdata
i m saving some nsdata with writetofile atomically and then want to use that file very shortly afterwards

11067958
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
so all you need is to create a uiviewcontroller which implements shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation and sets this controller as a rootviewcontroller to your uiwindow

11068013
prepare	execute
you create an sql statement to prepare in our case since the create database statement will not work with a variable and then you just execute it

11068014
qtreewidget	qtablewidget
qtablewidget items are editable by default qtreewidget items are not

11068027
jobs	cron
do i schedule a cron jobs pulling in the data from mixpanel and writing it to their respective accounts

11068032
post	get
i hope to get an answer before i m done but if not i ll post the code

11068033
portrait	landscape
you ll need to have two separate layouts one in a layout-port for portrait and one in layout-land for landscape

11068056
free	malloc
of course there is a memory leak for every call to malloc there sould be a corresponding call to free in your program

11068056
free	malloc
in your program malloc is called several times but there is only one call to free

11068067
margin	height
the best i could think of is to use jquery to get and set the container height and then set the margin according to the height

11068070
width	height
when you set your width and height in the extended textview the view hasn t been measured yet

11068070
width	height
its width and height are zero

11068070
width	height
override onmeasure in your extended textview and set your width and height there

11068076
post	get
i am trying to post and get a cookie

11068097
chunked	transfer-encoding
you can see here that an http response can either contain content-length or transfer-encoding chunked

11068097
chunked	transfer-encoding
however when transfer-encoding chunked is used in the header after the headers you ll get a hexadecimal string which if converted to decimal will give you the length of the next chunk

11068102
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything looks good in the latest google-chrome and firefox browsers however in safari it is fairly choppy

11068104
free	malloc
you have to call free for every malloc call you have done

11068104
realloc	malloc
also to store the characters in a continuous buffer you have to malloc an amount of memory at the beginning and use realloc if the characters you read become more than those initially allocated memory for

11068128
autocomplete	omnicomplete
after literally days of tweaking i think i got vim s autocomplete omnicomplete + acp plugin to work acceptably

11068138
google-chrome	safari
play with it google-chrome or safari with this jsfiddle

11068139
xfs	btrfs	xfs	ntfs
is there a book explaining the design of fat32 ntfs reiserfs ext2 ext3 ext4 zfs xfs btrfs .

11068150
width	margin
horizontally centering a block-level element like a div simply requires specifying a width and setting the horizontal margin to auto

11068180
width	height
the view will not be measured again and its width and height will remain the same

11068180
width	height
you can call requestlayout on the view to get the width and height recalculated

11068185
ubuntu	linux
this problem only occurs on ubuntu 12.04 lts ghci 7.4.1 when i tried this on windows haskell platform and other linux machines i worked

11068216
button	checkbox
as shown in this table on quirks mode the change event on radio button and checkbox is quite buggy in ie7 and ie8

11068220
portrait	landscape
in particular if you do not use different resources for landscape and portrait then the second method handling the configuration change yourself may work well

11068224
keydown	keyup
the following works in jfiddle-but when i use it in original form the total_full and total_half fields are calculated automatically from other fields and therefore do not have a keyup or keydown event

11068236
superclass	subclassing
creating a subclassing that creates a new tostring is impossible since they made all of the members private in their superclass

11068239
post	get
it is perfectly viable to use post and get inside a class method

11068244
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in safari and firefox google-chrome for mac and firefox for pc

11068251
google-chrome	firefox
latest firefox seems to be unable to inject google-chrome urls into the host page unlees the corresponding resource has additional contentaccesible manifest attribute

11068255
nsstring	nsdata
the object types are nsstring nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsarray or nsdictionary objects

11068267

then you put the db in your assets folder and copy it to your apps data directory on startup

11068322
folder	directory
here is a list of files and folder that showed up in my installation directory only after the directory was given ownership by and the program was run

11068326

clang	llvm
i have gcc 4.1.2 and like to build clang llvm using this gcc compiler version ony

11068393
clang	llvm
initially i faced issues regarding usr lib64 libstdc++.so.6 version glibcxx_3.4.9 not found during llvm clang make

11068393
clang	llvm
i am not sure for which purpose compiler-rt module is required but it seems llvm and clang has compiled well

11068393
clang	llvm
build llvm and clang only

11068393
clang	llvm
is it right to set my shared library path to use libstdc++.so.6 of gcc 4.5.0 and is compiler-rt is a madatory step to download and build it with clang llvm

11068396
fink	macports
fink same problems as macports

11068396
macports	homebrew
immediately when you want use some perl-dependent software you will must compile them itself and sometimes they will not compile - so you need the patched version for osx so start uses macports or homebrew and .

11068398
children	parent
this also has problems in that the role changes depending on who is asking - by definition a male_grandparent of his grandchildren is also a male_parent of his children who is also a child of his parent

11068398
children	parent
this gives a much simpler structure without the point-of-view contradictions but still results in problems evaluating further relationships because a given person s links only go up - a given person knows who their parent were but can t identify their children

11068398
children	parent
instead you can make each relationship two-way - each parent has a list of all their children and each child has a list of all their parent

11068436
for-loop	arrays
and then have my mouse check if it is clicking one of the items in the arrays using a for-loop

11068450
int	chars
the main problem is to translate string bunch of chars to int

11068461
put	get
a simple question i hope the binary package defines two types get and put

11068461
put	get
both state and writer have reasonable monadfix instances so i d expect that get and put also would

11068471
put	get
if you pass bardel to another function or return it you ll get a closure unless the function it s passed to takes the delegate by scope in which case that function guarantees that the delegate will not escape its scope because that state needs to be put on the heap so that it continues to exist even if the function call that its state comes from has completed when it s called

11068498
iboutlet	ibaction
i was able to connect my ibaction and iboutlet easily but this is proving trickier

11068501
folder	directory
iâ m finding models and helpers load fine from the shared directory however iâ ve added a config folder with database.php and this doesnâ t get loaded

11068505
blaze-html	hakyll
i realized that by default pandoc builds with an old version of blaze-html while hakyll requires blaze-html 1.5

11068512
folder	directory
that is the directory containing the fitness folder so you can import the module without any problem

11068513
put	get
but if you only put one index between the brackets you get the same result

11068520
draggable	droppable
internally jquery ui will run the following code whenever you start dragging a draggable to determine which droppable s are eligible to receive the draggable

11068520
draggable	droppable
jquery ui does not support adding multiple scopes to individual draggable droppable elements but you could roll that functionality on your own

11068524
post	get
i can use all the resources fine authentication get post calls to retrieve and send simple text data etc no problems there

11068524
post	put
for one part they have a non-oauth api through which you can also send a file in plain binary simply pass some params in the url and put the entire binary file in the post

11068531
post	get
as it stands this doesn t work - if won t post the data but rather sends a get request

11068623
folder	directory
as i suspected the using of recursion makes the code to crash when the hierarchy tree is too large i ve tried with 400 directory and it failed so i guess that after something like 50 folder one inside to other the overhead of the recursion makes the code to crash

11068637
inherited	subclassing
now i want to write a number of subclassing that inherited the protected fields and only differ based on the initial values that are assigned to those fields - for example if i wrote two subclassing b and c the only difference between those two subclassing would be that the values key and dmg would have different values

11068643
inherited	subclassing
this is not a place where you should be subclassing and in fact is a gross over-use of inherited

11068668
getter	setter
if i instantiate an instance of city i can see any public getter setter perfectly fine

11068677
hide	show
the callback of hide show in jquery does fire even if the function itself didn t do its thing due to the parent elements

11068677
hide	show
using the above method with jquery the elements will hide regardless if they are in a hidden parent element or not while also performing the usual smooth transition if they are show

11068694
ienumerable	ienumerator
however implementing ienumerable will automatically get you the entire set of linq methods on the enumerable class almost for free -- you only have to implement getenumerator and an ienumerator class

11068699
button	checkbox
i started using button but i switched to checkbox because the state of the box is easier to find out than a button

11068729
post	get
i want to get a set of tag counts for the post that the user has tagged but the method doesn t seem to be available

11068729
post	get
for a standalone post i can use post.tag_counts_on thoughts to get a tag cloud for the context of thoughts

11068776
superclass	subclassing
on the other hand the subclassing itself can call the overridden version of the method in its superclass

11068815
int	chars
the problem is that characteratindex seems to send an int and not a chars

11068824
updatepanel	ascx
the whole listview is part of an user control it s on a ascx file and the control is inside a master-page layout i m referring to the jquery library from the master page and the listview is inside an updatepanel

11068862
google-chrome	firefox
i found out that this tags work on ie8 firefox 11 and google-chrome but not sure whether this is valid by standards and work on all major browsers

11068907
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior has been tested on both firefox and google-chrome

11068929
post	put
it takes care of deducing whether to use post or put for a model object

11068935
post	put
if you put #allposts it shows all the post and similarly the content varies depending only on the #id in the url

11069026
ready	each
contents of each page into the dom as you navigate and the dom ready

11069091
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
it ll read all file types that have a registered support in delphi s tgraphic hiearachy and will auto-detect bmp gif jpg and png file formats

11069158
jgit	egit
so you have to do it locally and there you may want to use git and not egit since egit also uses jgit

11069196
post	get
i ve been unable to find any tutorials or documentation for post ing and get ing data from a webapi from within a metro style app

11069207
folder	directory
note you can do this even though your directory structure for css files may be several nested folder deep or in this case myproject src css main.css

11069223
put	get
first get the username and password from the user and put in the variables

11069223
post	get
post the data to the url with specified data using http get or post method post is preferable for authentication

11069238
centos	linux
rpm packages are for redhat based distributions of linux like centos and redhat

11069238
ubuntu	debian
for debian based systems ubuntu you need deb packages

11069271

11069631
xlsread	cell-array
the second matter is that afaik xlsread doesn t send out any signals of its progress which means that your .mex function would need to somehow get the memory addresses of the variables cell-array or matrices etc. of the called xlsread function

11069658
int	chars
no because the chars will be implicitly converted to int which doesn t sound like what you re looking for

11069839
hash	md5
an md5 hash is 128 bits in size

11069839
hash	md5
so no you can not store an md5 hash as an int

11069839
hash	md5
and you should think again if md5 is the right hash for your purpose or if you would be better of with something like sha-1 if you use md5 for cryptography related tasks

11070272
onreadystatechange	onload
to fix the problem declare the variables in the function and wrap the whole onreadystatechange block in or use onload instead of onreadystatechange

i have an abstract base class component whose responsibility would be to describe a generic component having an height and a width and it should be able to get these values by parsing the corresponding xml attributes of the passed node more precisely parser pointing to the node

11070918
width	height
so if the component superclass reads the whole node to get the width and height call to the super constructor how could the derived class read the same node to initialize itself

11070931
inherited	subclassing
third it only gives you identity while rtti is much richer as it knows about all the subclassing a given object can be cast to and even allows cross-casts or casts across virtual inherited

hide	show
also hide images you don t want to show and try to not loop into an array to find if yes or no you should show or hide an image but make an array of bool that can be read

11071531
put	get
you could also use views for this by getting the current node id in contextual filters and then using a relationship to get the images and then using views slideshow to render the resulting images in a block that is put on every node type...but as you can tell that is a roundabout way to achieve what a field formatter can probably do for you 90 of the time

i m wavering between using tcp or udp

11084304

should i use tcp or udp for this type of application

11084304
udp	tcp
from your experiences can you estimate how many percents is tcp faster udp

11084304
udp	tcp
sorry for many questions in a post but i need to know more details before deciding use tcp or udp in my application it s very important for me

11084426

one huge difference between tcp and udp in this case is that udp does not try to recover lost packets as tcp does

lapack	openblas
common choices here would be standard lapack blas as available from netlib atlas intel mkl or openblas

11084463

11084480
button	checkbox
that s what radio button are meant for not checkbox

11084500
udp	tcp
in your case i d use tcp unless you actually have hands-on experience with fragmenting and re-assembling udp packets manually and you re willing to maintain the overhead introduced in your code like having a re-assembling buffer and controlling the latency that this implies

11084500
lan	localhost	wan	lan
is it localhost only a lan a wan or even the internet

11084500
udp	mtu
as a rule of thumb udp is great when all data necessary for an instant defined below fits in one packet mtu is guaranteed to be 1280 in ipv6

11084500
udp	tcp
udp will outperform tcp substantially if the nature of the network is stable and remains stable

11084500
udp	tcp
but on the same note udp will not win when the network segments are very far apart and qos is used in some of the intermediate segments qos that is configured to favour more or less known tcp services over other stuff

11088029
stdout	stderr
with you are redirecting the error messages from stderr to stdout

11088029
stdout	stderr
without this redirection your error messages to stderr would have continued to go to the console creating clutter in the output and only stdout was getting processed by the pipes

11088029
stdout	stderr
based on use of the tcsh sometimes i think i m the only one using it it is possible to redirect stderr to stdout with the following construct

11088039
floating-point	integer
unlike the integers int32 byte uint64 etc where each value is easily determined from the status of each bit in the integer s bytes there is no intuitive representation of a floating-point number in binary so the ieee defined a specification for floating point numbers ieee-754

mef	prism
i ve seen some postings about mef prism and the event aggregate but it appears fairly complex

11088239
return-value-optimization	nrvo
in this case since the return value has a name f it would be nrvo named return-value-optimization that would apply

11088239
return-value-optimization	nrvo
so the technical answer based only on wording is that the absence of return-value-optimization won t prevent copy elision since nrvo could still allow it

11088259

anyway this code works fine for finding int chars and text categories but completely fails on datetime and decimal categories

11088793
haskell	agda
in languages like haskell and agda with the io monad functions like putstrln should have a type string â io âš not the string â io âš since this is an absurd logically it states that there is no strings that can be printed this is just not right

11088793

11091935
width	height
note that you probably want to detect if the mime type of the image and change accordingly and set alt width and height attributes using the file s metadata

11091965

using the datetime add method seems to work whether we are adding or subtract time from someotherevent

11092285

11092329
