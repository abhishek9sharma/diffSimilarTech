obviously this is less then ideal but it will get the job done and let you use scp sftp in classic asp

1971

i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported

5132

just a bit of a question is the reason they are choosing grails because groovy is closer in syntax to java than ruby or because they want access to java

12140

this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects

12412

bash is the better interactive shell in my opinion.

13210

.net 3.0 and .net 3.5 did not change the version of the clr so using asp.net 3.5 is a more complicated thing that it sounds like it should be at first

15091

technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities

18307

php is more well known and used than eruby but i like the ruby language so i tend to like using eruby

from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

some people also use artistic style command line tool although it requires perl and works better with c c++ code than with c#

32675

to me padding just sounds more inner than margin

39282

usually flex is more suited for application that need a lot of access to data but for simple things in flash you should use some xml data sources and write the xml source yourself in something like php asp python perl etc

47674

in other words m2eclipse is more friendly to the maven way

udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

48745

for things like video streaming and multiplayer gaming where it is better to miss a packet than to delay all the other packets behind it this is the obvious choice

49182

based on the documentation on msdn and my experience binary is better since the md5 hash does not vary in size

49953

java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support

50362

really though this is probably more a perl ruby python job than a pure shell script

67213

if you have to get under the hood and make modifications i m also a firm believer that drupal is a more friendly and elegant system than joomla

69410

personally i like celementtree which is a faster c-based implementation of elementtree which is a dom-like model

69545

there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

70440

quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440

it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

70627

quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

71743

i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page

75003

on a side note string + var is also more performant that the string.format approach generally that uses a stringbuilder internally when in doubt.

76811

in practice though most of this falls away and rest usually just refers to simple http requests that return results in json while soap is a more complex api that communicates by passing xml around

77166

since python is far less ubiquitous than php i wouldn t be surprised if hosting developer and other maintenance costs for it long term would have it fit this scenario

77945

quicksort is not better than mergesort

81983

datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

85193

but i think there are also genuine reasons for introducing new languages to the jvm particularly when they will be run in parallel you can use the right language for the right job a scripting language like groovy may be exactly what you need for your page presentation whereas regular old java is better for your business logic

89167

moss is probably less popular because its not free and having used it for a year i don t see as much value in it as wss

90477

as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

92324

c++ is more standard you will find more code libraries examples etc. and you may freely use the stl and boost while object pascal is more of an exotic language

94070

datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

99456

javadoc or doxygen is more suitable if you want distributable code documentation

100741

since you ve done vbscript migration to vb.net is more natural - you can learn the new syntax then move onto the framework and bcl when you are familiar with those you can learn the c# syntax as weel - being bi-lingual is always good

as for spring i would seriously check if guice is a viable alternative and then try to show how spring guice makes development better and easier

a novice but competent dba should be able to secure mysql much more easily than oracle just because oracle is inherently more complex

106428

this approach would be similar to using json or xml but is more performant since hessian is a binary protocol

106826

in my opinion json is more human readable than xml and json.net gives the option to write nicely formatted json

113895

but using scp or rsync over ssh is probably better than ftp if you can

115838

there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

116068

you didnt mention which engine you were using which might be relevant in this case count is much faster in myisam than in innodb for example

118016

in addition the second syntax is more flexible if there are further aggregates which may be added in the future in addition to count like min some_scalar max avg etc

120140

on the other hand i think so many people use the same tools eclipse and often it is much better to have some things standardised at design time instead of build time - for example checkstyle is far more useful as an eclipse plugin than as an ant or maven task - that it is better to standardise on the set of development tools and a common set of plugins

121731

i know of reia - a language that is based on erlang but looks more like python ruby

124248

that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

124248

block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

124822

create sequence which is more or less the equivalent of an orrible function that generates unique numbers when selected from as opposed to serial which generates the unique number when the row is inserted

133461

show them how python oo is a better integrated to the language compare to perl

138944

json is a more compact object notation than xml so if you re looking for high volumes it has the advantage

140415

hopefully xsd is not the only way to validate a xml a much more simpler approach is to use relaxng and especially its compact syntax which is really more readable than what you could ever imagine with xsd

142240

some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processor

149409

3des is more expensive than aes for example

150798

regarding maintenance imho is better to change a single line of code the regular expression pattern than understand lines and lines of parsing code or whatever the regular expressions purpose is

153299

as you can see the form input takes up more space than plain text

jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

if you spread the parameters over multiple lines but have several on each line it makes it more difficult to find particular parameters when reading the code

163188

we could leave them out since the priority is higher for division and multiplication than of subtraction but this gives us more readable code

163254

if i am writing a c c++ application that uses many numeric values that will always fit within the provided range of a short integer is it more efficient to use 4 byte integers or 2 byte integers

python introspection is more flexible you have access to an object s internal dictionary of attribute values and you have first class functions like getattr and setattr

166196

i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

166787

of course if you stop using var then you get around the whole problem and your code becomes more readable ok thats subjective but for something like this it s more readable by other people

172177

the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content

176043

the arrays module is more like a thin wrapper over c arrays which give you kind of strongly typed containers see docs with access to more c-like types such as signed unsigned short or double which are not part of the built-in types

176144

third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

180358

i like the vcl gui stuff delphi seems more suited to windows api calls than vb6 i really like the fact that it s much better at oo than vb6 and i like the unit-testing framework that comes with the ide

180411

of course java sintax is more like c++ than like delphi but i think that the object model is more similar to delphi

in practice i ve found that even when developing something that you do have control over the environment it will be run on over time it is better to give someone else the capabilities to change the configuration

183290

as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

192694

in general monkey patching is less used in python than in ruby

195398

that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey
