i m also assuming that you have a farm environment with atleast one web front end and a separate db server to host the content db the web application is not enabled for anonymous access and the authentication scheme is integrated windows with ntlm not kerberos authorization and impersonation is enabled

6300042
rss	feed
i get the contents of rss feed but for my bad luck they have different structure

ssl	https
when i published the service to the staging environment which uses ssl to emulate the production environtment i had to update the web.config file of my service to work over https

6300145
google-chrome	firefox
one thing i have learned over the years is it is ok that your website doesn t look exactly the same in each browser in fact it can be a benefit because i have had situations where the intended design looked fairly different in ie but still still professional and some users who preferred that ui would visit with ie instead of the beloved firefox or google-chrome

6300151
bash	subshell
the pipe is forking another bash process so when you do the increment filcount is getting incremented in the subshell that s been forked after the pipe

6300172

using print_r i get this i post only a part of it

6300378
hide	show
after that i would create further jquery to load after the dumbformstate plugin to then show hide the areas that are filled out

6300378
hide	show
its no problem if you call this before someone ever filled out their form because it will be blank and your logic should not show hide things that are blank anyway

6300388
min	max
i find i solve this with a group by and a max or min because for each distinct line there may be several docid values

6300394
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this means that if your controller presents a modal controller and then it is dismissed the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods will be called again

6300452
background-color	transparency
ie6 7 are incorrectly ignoring the fallback so it s not really a fallback and have their transparency background-color because of a bug purely because the op has the colors both hex and rgba specified using background-color

6300452
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
is likely the best solution in the original case - a fallback colour is only necessary for older browser versions of opera especially firefox safari et al in the case of their gradients rgba not yet being supported

6300487
express	node.js
then again this sounds exactly like an appserver-ready problem so rails express for node.js or even chicagoboss if you re brave would be good platforms for this kind of application

6300495
width	height
the startwidth and startheight i think can be used as your max height and width

6300517
post	get
when you get all cleared out the original post gets through like magic

6300540

pascal	delphi
i ve got a basic word guessing game written in pascal for a console in delphi 7 where the guesses right or wrong are stored in a fixed array named guesses now what i need to do is test to see if they have guessed that letter already

6300706
for-loop	arrays
my problem is it follows the for-loop 20 times and should end as it is the first letter and is not in the guesses arrays but keeps repeating

6300708
peer	p2p
i have a feeling though that what you want to do is to have your peer communicate with each other rather than have a direct connection between them with no middleman server which is what is normally meant by p2p

6300780
vmware	virtualbox
1 use a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware

6300852
bash	zsh
when you type ls -l | mycode into the shell it is the shell program itself bash zsh that does all the trickery with pipes

6300908
g++	gcc
if you would use g++ as a driver instead of gcc you could instead use the -static-libstdc++ flag

6300955
filtering	grouping
the grouping by clause works with the aggregation operators in the select clause and could go anywhere after the from clause however it is better to think about aggregation on the filtering data so it comes after the where clause

6300967
post	get
i can get jsr-303 validation by setting up all the application context magic and by creating my post method as such and submitting with form-encoded values

6300967

prepare	execute
normally if you just use a prepare statement in place of a plain query it s marginally slower since the query is prepare and execute in two steps instead of one

6301789
prepare	execute
regarding your last question there s no reason you can t use the same query with a prepare statement as you would through the normal query parser no reason to execute one version with an in and the other with a bunch of ors

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the apparent cause of this is the server sending an x-frame-options heading and the response of firefox and internet explorer is to display an error message about security and frames while the response of webkit browsers such as google-chrome and safari is to render an unhelpful blank frame

6302714

so when the page is being generated take all of your existing protected variables combine them somehow with a server-side secret value and hash correction hmac them

6312820
box-sizing	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box

6312820
box-sizing	border-box
although just setting padding 0 and forgetting about box-sizing border-box seems to work for me

6312821
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so i do have the height but i m not sure where to call contentsizeforviewinpopover i did try to call it in viewdidappear and viewwillappear but with no success since it seems that the table gets populated later and the actual height is only available later

6313063
ienumerable	iqueryable
the terminology on the page you reference may be a bit off - since both entityset and iqueryable derive from ienumerable if entityset implemented iqueryable directly then implementing ienumerable would be redundant

6313087
submit	submission
one way of getting around this would be to put the submit on a slight delay and then check for a cancel flag before actually submission

6313090
firefox	safari
when i load website in firefox 4 i don t know older versions perhaps and safari the website is slow

6313090
firefox	safari
after deconstructing and building back this website i realized that the css for safari and firefox is the cause of the slow down

6313090
firefox	safari
ok this is what is causing the slow down in both safari and firefox

6313096
hash	md5
see this page for info on an md5 hash

6313096
hash	md5
this means you need 16 hex chars or half the md5 hash to generate 64 bits

6313117
accelerometer	gyroscope
i can t use the simulator because the application is very opengl-heavy and uses an accelerometer gyroscope

6313164

6313174
portrait	landscape
so is it a solution to switch views properly with auto resizing when the device is on landscape and portrait

6313197
opera	google-chrome
the animations are slower than google-chrome and opera

6313438
ilist	icollection
do not implement ilist ilist icollection or

6313438
ienumerable	iqueryable
using the asqueryable extension method returns an object which only implements iqueryable and ienumerable and therefore will show the results view option

6313457
int	chars
the return value from fgetc should also be an int since it has to represent every possible chars plus eof

6313470
int	chars
please note that fgetc requires an int well something larger than a chars -- int is customary for its return value eof is a possible return value in addition to any of the values that chars might take

6313496
folder	directory
however i sometimes use the xlstart folder in excel s installation directory

6313554
hide	show
you might like to try hide instead which will not null the window but just not show it on the screen

6313565
postgresql	mysql
i don t need an easy way to manage it i just want a setup i can install that will already have apache php mysql or postgresql doesn t matter and preferably eclipse already installed so i can just load it up into virtualbox and log in to some form of linux and start to get thing set up

6313569
xna	spritebatch
edit also overriding the spritebatch vertex shader is very difficult xna before 4.0

6313693
division	modulo
modulo returns the remainder when performing integer division

6313693
multiplying	add
now add minutes - to determine minutes as seconds you multiplying them times 60

6313693
integer	fractions
now we see how mod works - because if you divide 630 by 60 you get 10.5 but if you ignore the fractions whole integer division you get 10

6313721
inherited	subclassing
i guess i can still rely on normal inherited as long as it s the subclassing version that s proprietary and not the original but for most features currently there is only one group that doesn t have the priveledges and it s not always the same group for each feature and the other groups do

6313721
filtering	grouping
so if i was to use inheritance i d probably need a bunch of directories files like secretfroma secretfromb ... secretfromz and then for each of the other grouping i d need from secretfromz import for every module whereas with the replacement technique i described i can just add stubs for functionality i want to filtering

6313723
width	margin
by setting the width to 100 and a margin of 10px the textarea will be a 100 width of it s container shifted down and to the left 10px

6313750
move	drag
in other words if i pan the scene with scroll bars or pick up the image and drag move it around in the scene i want all the tiles to also move and stay in the right position relative to each other

6313754
children	parent
add in extra conditions where needed apparently conditions don t inherit from parent entities so you have to manually add them to the children and compile

6313795
inherited	subclassing
my thinking was to create my own uiviewcontroller subclassing say authenticatedviewcontroller and make my other controllers inherited it

6313795
inherited	subclassing
i found this similar question can i create a uitableviewcontroller that inherited from a custom subclassing of uiviewcontroller

6313813

however i am trying to get the corresponding time of the max temp and min temp

6313846
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to use a for-loop to examine each character in an arrays and print the character it s position in the arrays and what type of character it is vowel consonant etc.

6313847
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want to animate a div by first making it s border thicker by 5px on mouseenter then decreasing the border by 5px on mouseleave the tricky part is that i don t want the div to look like it s moving if you just animate the borders the whole div will look like it shifts not just the border getting thicker thinner

6313847
mouseleave	mouseenter
the div animates just fine on mouseenter i can make the border thicker without the div actually moving out of place but when the mouseleave is triggered the div will first relocate itself to the position as if the margin -5px was never called and then decrease it s border slowly and it seems like the magin 0px isn t actually being called

6313864
codeigniter	kohana
ok so hmvc in codeigniter is the way to go for scalable web applications with kohana 3 based off many stackoverflow discussions such as hmvc patterns and mvc vs hmvc

6313878
tabitem	contentcontrol
why contentcontrol contentcontrol tabitem .content .contenttemplate is null

6313878
tabitem	contentcontrol
also casting tabitem to contentcontrol to get at the same content property just makes it harder to read

6313893
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql etc

6313898
ftp	telnet
debugging in the win ce device is very time consuming as it involves copying the files through ftp registering the com in the device using telnet and debug the dll through remote debugging

6313899
int	chars
this will validate the problem if i give it a chars or a word instead of an int and will ask for an int again this works actually prety as planed but if i give this a negative number i should give 2 enter before it to show the message and ask for the number again this wont hapenn if i give it a chars string or an int between ranges or out ranges but beeing positive

6313912
width	height
once your wrapper is set you can specify height and width to 100 for your iframe

6313918

back in the old days of serial ports and pots modems we used protocols like xmodem ymodem zmodem and kermit to transfer files over the serial connection

6314227
width	height
i don t believe your width x and height y syntax is correct and your #a float property is missing a colon

6314230
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	memmove	strcpy	strncpy	memmove	strncpy
string manipulation functions like strcpy and strncpy will stop when they see these characters whereas byte manipulation functions like memcpy and memmove will always continue for the number of bytes you tell them to

6314232
hex	binary
to better view what the contents of a binary file look like you would need a hex editor like hiew editor for windows or hexedit for linux

as stated by somebody jquery is required for the javascript version to work but you could easily remove it it s only used for the document.ready and show hide

6314568
hide	show
and for the show and hide stuff you could use something like and for more reliable cross browser techniques see here

6314604

6314809
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery and scriptaculous are good choices

6314843
post	get
if you want to solve that bit step through the logged in step and make sure that you have a user_session by the time you hit the post get calls

not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

6314985
min	max
there is good reason for these low-level functions not caching min max results

6314985
min	max
if you want to quickly get min max element of a container that is modified often you can

6314985
min	max
1 cahe maintain min max values yourself

maven	m2e
if you import the project into eclipse as an existing maven project using m2e then you can do a run as maven build and run mvn liferay deploy

6315053
ssl	https
if you mean sending from browser to your server then you need to use https ssl to encrypt the connection not the password itself

if you want your activity to be notified via observer pattern you can use subscribe in your onresume oncreate and unsubscribe in your onpause or ondestroy

6315228
onresume	onpause
my choice would be to use onresume and onpause this way your activity won t be notified if it s not visible

6315229

i have a global action-filter that is setting the masterpage of all viewresults during the onactionexecuting event

6315800
action-filter	onactionexecuting
the problem is that when setting the result like this my action-filter s onactionexecuting method does not fire meaning i do not get the correct masterpage applied

6315800
action-filter	onactionexecuting
one remedy is to move my action-filter logic into onresultexecuting this does fire but i am still confused as to why onactionexecuting does not

also it is entirely possible to have 2 completely different layout files for portrait landscape which potentially have different ui elements with different ids

6315982
jobs	cron
this avoids the requirement of cron jobs

6315992
unsigned	short
or you could use an unsigned short if you know you ll never need to represent a number larger than 65 535

6315996
integer	unsigned
using an unsigned type to make sure that you don t get any extra 1s in your integer representation if you intend to use bit shifting operators and

6316009
range	max
for example a signed char 1b has range -128 127 but if it s unsigned - the max value is doubled you have one more bit to use - sign bit so unsigned char could be 255 all bits are 1

6316009
int	chars	next	except
the smallest int except chars is short next one is int etc

6316038
post	get
unless you can get your users to just email the data to you probably the easiest thing to do would be to create a web app possibly with no user facing output since you re just using it to collect data using something like google app engine that gives you a url you can send a post request to using an http request

6316045
tabcontrol	tabitem
xaml with tabcontrol - notice that i hook the loaded event this is where i will add the dynamic tabitem

6316057
hide	show
the example assumes that you have already created an ssrs report and the report show in screenshot # 1 will be used to demonstrate how to add parameters and hide the expenses revenue or profit

6316064
ant	maven
we have been looking to several alternatives such as sprouts rake maven and ant but it s not being easy to achieve exactly what we want.

6316072
post	get	post	put	put	get
now we have to make sure that we can react properly on get put post and delete

6316072
post	get	post	put	put	get
cases would be get delete put post

6316113
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the effect is working nicely in firefox but not in google-chrome nor safari

6316114
keydown	keyup
you can use the keydown and keyup jquery functions to capture a single key press

6316114
keydown	keyup
the event handler for the keydown and keyup events provides a property which you can read to check for control keys event.altkey for example

6316181
put	get
i am uisng scrollview.lua for scroll but to get back out of it i need to put back button on that but there is no button action event for scroll view

6316222
icmp	tcp
ping is just low level icmp protocol defined in internet layer whereas tcp is more complex protocol defined in transport layer

6316222
icmp	tcp
icmp is unreliable datagram protocol whereas tcp is reliable protocol with much higher transmission overhead especially for establishing connection

6316247
addition	multiplication
what i mean is this to know powers i need to know multiplication and to know multiplication i need to know addition

6316274
min	max
i think you can specify max and or min size not sure though

6316292
for-loop	loops
if i understand the question and you just want to loops over some php code a certain number of times there is no reason a standard for-loop would not work

6316299
hide	show
select show or hide based on an epxression

6316343
mouseout	mouseleave
i did a little research but it seems that different browsers behave differently when it comes to triggering rollout mouseout events when the mouseleave the browser window

6316346
folder	dir
when i configure my template dir like this the app can t file the template folder and files

6316353
post	get	post	put	put	get
instead each resource has its unique url and the http verbs get post put or delete are used on those resources

6316353
post	get	post	put	put	get
best practise in this case would be to use post for creating new resources delete for removing them get for retrieving existing and put to update existing

6316371
onclick	onchange
using the onclick handler on the individual options isn t clearly defined behavior you should change the event to the onchange on the select box itself

6316400
gif	png
source is either png or gif where the pixels that should be colorized are white

6316400
gif	png
now i d like to cut out a rectangular part of the source and and it with the palette color gif or rgb color png of the brush to stamp it out on a timage tcanvas with that color

6316426
postgresql	mysql
use postgresql mysql with innodb etc

6316457
mouseup	mousedown
if you re using mousedown mouseup then you ll need to trigger those events

6316481
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
there are rich libraries available for jsf like icefaces richfaces adf faces primefaces which gives you a big amount of rich components that may be enough for you

6316481

thats code get from wordpress admin post page

6316554
width	height
how to if there s a way to read the width height of an background-image image and pass it to width height property of that element in css without the use of javascript

6316568
min	max
if you know that input1 is strictly between 0 and 1 or generally min and max where min and max are known to be between but not strictly 0 and 1 how would you get input1 to increment or decrement by a numerical jump given by input2 with assurance that the new value is strictly between min and max and will never reach min or max

6316598
width	height
match 500.jpg alt width 500 height 360

6316605
postgresql	mysql
ps if it helps i plan to use postgresql or maybe mysql and i am not paying for a dedicated server with justhost.com.

6316621
put	get
you can read innerhtml to get a string of markup from a dom element node but this serialisation is newly-generated markup and won t typically be exactly the same as what you put in.

6316630
for-loop	arrays
if you enumerate for in or for-loop over an arrays it will be ordered

6316670
min	max
i believe the following should keep input1 within min max

6316671
gif	png
capture html canvas as gif jpg png pdf

6316673
firefox	safari
however in both firefox and safari the photo-title in this case peace memorial park is left out completely

6316675
inherited	properties
since all of your models controllers extend them inherited automatically disperses whatever properties methods you place in them - for example auth

6316676
ready	each
once you have the field ready you can obtain a list of each image that should be put on the field

6316685
width	height
so that would be the video width en height

6316689
min	max
you can use min max like

6316689
min	max
this will allows you to adjust your values and be sure it will be between min and max but never those values

6316778
move	drag
i need the user to be able to drag the rectangles to move or resize them up and down each column of the timetable

6316786
google-chrome	safari
i don t have safari installed but i assume it s the same as google-chrome

6316818
next	except
next at the moment your triangle lies inside the x-z-plane and as you don t make any changes to the modelview matrix except translating along the z-axis you should just see a line if any think of a sheet of paper viewed from the side

6316828
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
you need to implement the uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource protocols

1 intermediary components proxies caches load balancers will not know whether you are creating updating or deleting resources they will only know if the operation is safe get or unsafe post

6316885
post	get
get and post

6316885
post	put
it uses put or post for editing pages

6316895
gprof	callgrind	profiler	callgrind	profiler	gprof
gprof is an instrumented profiler callgrind is a sampling profiler

6316895
gprof	callgrind
try the free 30 day evaluation of zoom from rotateright - i suspect it will give you a profile which agrees more with callgrind than with gprof

6316920
post	get
however have a look at this post which explains how to get extended data from the tags stored with the file

6316920
width	height
details the file may have its frame width and frame height information filled in

6316924
qframe	qwidget
it turns out if you create your widget as a subclass of qframe instead of a qwidget the background-image property seems to take fine

6316924
qframe	qwidget
if you create your widgets in qt designer or creator they don t have an option to create a qframe-derived widget so i just tell it i want a qwidget-derived class then manually change the .cpp and .h file to derive from qframe instead of qwidget

6316927
joystick	keyboard
is it possible to use the keyboard instead of the joystick or the spacemouse block in simulink

6316986
folder	directory
since the userlogin control is actually under a folder in the home views directory it s not in the standard search path of where the view engine will search

6316987
typedef	struct
if it makes a difference i usually typedef a struct like so in the .h

6317023
memcached	apc
what would you want to use between third-party caching softwares like apc and memcached

6317054
express	node.js
have known node.js and express several days ago

6317089
folder	directory
the build directory has been replaced with a derivedbuilds folder and it uses some obfuscation naming so it s not possible to let an external script find the files

6317146
range	minimum
create a cte that will take the minimum and maximum date values in the table dbo.timescaledata and generate all the time values for every hour between the given range

6317181
put	get
does anyone has an idea how to get xcode 4 to fetch the version of the latest commit and put that information into the project s info.plist

6317197
submit	submission
as for submission the form on hitting enter so long as an element in the form has focus hitting enter will submit the form by default

6317200
free	malloc
igreen 916 0x3f60348c malloc error for object 0x130350 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

6317211
superclass	subclassing
it means plainly a subclassing must honor the contract set by the superclass

6317211
super	implements	super	extends	implements	extends
if you extends a super class you should read its document and implements as it dictates

6317225
profiling	instrumentation
i configured the profiling method to instrumentation

6317236
udp	tcp
udp can be used to minimize latency and the retransmission of stale data but as rpgs generally don t employ twitch gameplay tcp ip is normally a better choice

6317242
lsp	principles
the principles of substitution or liskov substitution principles lsp basically states that an object should only be in a hierarchy if in every scenario that object can be used as its parent

6317303
wdm	ndis
ndis filter drivers are typically legacy wdm drivers

6317303
wdm	ndis
ndis filter drivers do not participate in traditional wdm pnp operations they do not handle irps

6317358
width	height
height and width are both 0

6317370
width	height
so i am trying to set an image to be 100 of the height and width of the html element really the browser window is what i m going for

6317370
width	height
and the width behaves right but the height does not change

6317417
memcpy	memmove
also i ve tried to replace memcpy with memmove but with no results

6317462
int	double
say i have 1 million structs each containing int double strings and other structs something like

6317465
post	get
disabled element not appeared at get or post collection

6317467
ssl	https
i ve heard i have to use ssl and https but i don t know how

6317468
post	get
use a urlconnection with setdooutput true and get its output stream for the post

6317477
many-to-many	one-to-many
instead of storing foreign key fields you should store entity fields for one-to-one one-to-many or many-to one mappings or collections of entities for one-to-many many-to one or many-to-many mappings

6317484
width	height
the width and the height of that box are correct but i don t know how to place its top left corner at the top left corner of the string that is drawn on the canvas

6317496
pop-up	dialog
if i make it a normal dialog instead of using qt pop-up flag in constructor then movement is fine with or without editor

6317525
free	malloc
it almost certainly is not working fine it is pointless and in c++ the way you allocate memory is with new and delete not malloc and free

6317591
uitextfield	uitoolbar
create an instance of uitoolbar add whichever views you required in toolbar then assign your toolbar instance in inputaccessoryview property of uitextfield

6317598
move	drag
quite working in xcode and other programs but in iphone simulator i rarely got it working for scrollviews looked like the drag area was not enough to initiate the move especially the horizontal one

6317609
post	get
you don t have to use the querystring you can also get by with the http post collection

6317620
cos	sin
once you launch a ball at an angle say 50 degrees add cos 50 speed to his x position and sin 50 speed to his y position

6317640
post	get
it does not make a difference to struts2 if you post or get as far as setting values

6317668
getter	setter
this line means that the property detaildescriptionlabel will have a setter and getter for the class attribute named _detaildescriptionlabel

6317706
tax	shipping
there are various reasons why tax or shipping options specified in the checkout merchant center are ignored

6317712
ubuntu	debian
installing mono 3.x in ubuntu debian

6317720
width	height
therefore width and height is undefined for inlines

6317723
width	height
but if i keep all picture dimension on same size width and height i get some bug which when player punch

6317760
for-loop	arrays
you can initialize arrays like this or an int arrays and iterate a for-loop over this arrays

6317770
rsa	aes
i understand rsa and aes but where i am lost is in handling attachments

6317792
button	checkbox
it shows how to specify options using drop-downs radio button checkbox

6317809
hide	show
i have not yet dealt with the fact that i may interpret a tap as show hide the status nav toolbars and the uiwebview may act on this same tap as a clicked link etc

6317813
apache	nginx
changing documentroot in apache to var www and passing wiki from nginx doesn t help - mediawiki starts redirection to wiki nginx redirects it back to apache and so on before it says about looped redirections

6317843
rsa	aes
attachments are big files and asymmetric encryption is really slow rsa so it is best to generate an aes key and encrypt it with the rsa public key and then encrypt the attachment with a lot faster aes

6317846
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome 12 firefox 3.6 and 4 and in opera 11

6317846
google-chrome	firefox
the drawing speed is fine in google-chrome and firefox when interacting with the mouse hover and scroll to zoom or when switching properties with the graph controls

6317850
setinterval	settimeout
you could execute a function using the settimeout and setinterval if you want them to execute at a later time

6317865
put	get
and get what i want but i m not sure where in the code above i should put this

6317890
int	chars
i have a code in which the chars array is populated by int converted to chars arrays and read by another function which reconverts it back to int

6317890
int	chars
so are there any other other functions which i can use which can take in the chars array the first bit and the last bit and convert it into the int

6317902
google-chrome	firefox
when i do the upload on firefox everything works out smoothly but on ie9 google-chrome it breaks

6317915
filtering	grouping	inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview
icollectionview will give you the ability to filtering sort or grouping the collection in addition to propogating inotifycollectionchanged events if the underlying collection implements it

6317915
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
use icollectionview when you need sorting filtering or grouping

6317917
g++	gcc
is there any literature available on the periodicity of the random number generator in gcc s g++ if we don t re-seed the function

6317938
stdout	stderr
the command itself redirects stderr to stdout which gets captured above then stdout to the original stdout from outside the block so only the stderr gets captured

6317966
innodb	myisam
i need to convert around 9 tables in each of 12 dbs from myisam to innodb and i m hoping i can do all the tables in one db with a single query rather than having to click-and-wait for each and every table in phpmyadmin

6318021
rss	feed
i just found a cool web app named full text rss feed it can convert a truncated rss feed to a full text rss feed

6318021
rss	feed
i try this pipe with the same truncated rss feed i just used in that app but got different result

6318021
versioning	upgrade
i also notice that the pipe author will upgrade the versioning to v2

6318045
memcpy	memmove
edit i always forget the simplest things use memcpy memmove for bulk appending pod elements to pre-allocated vectors

6318124
kerberos	ntlm
lack of support for automated windows domain authentication ntlm kerberos

6318138
min	max
it seems that there are two ways to get max min value

6318171
post	get
regarding i just want to get the claims i m interested in from the post and deal with setting auth stuff up myself from there

6318241
google-chrome	safari
remember to use safari or google-chrome

6318244
awt	swing
the most significant issue is that android has its own activity view system instead of swing awt so you will have to redo your entire user interface from scratch

6318270
hide	show
for really large numbers of components which have a too heavy payload for a good performance you could use javascript libraries like jquery to do the show and hide things by the client

6318291
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem none in google-chrome safari but huge in firefox i tried both 3.6 and 4

6318299
width	height
to resize an image proportionally you have to set either the height or width to 100 but not both

6318299
width	height
choosing whether to do height or width depends on your image and container dimensions

6318299
width	height	portrait	landscape
if your image and container are both portrait shaped or both landscape shaped taller than they are wide or wider than they are tall respectively then it doesn t matter which of height or width are 100

6318299
portrait	landscape
if your image is portrait and your container is landscape you must set on the image

6318299
portrait	landscape
if your image is landscape and your container is portrait you must set on the image

6318309
addition	multiplication
we have now turned our multiplication into an addition which is much easier to do

6318314
awt	swing
the painting in awt and swing docs state the following

6318341
teamcity	nant
if having teamcity run solutions and nunit xunit tests proves insufficient you might take a look at nant

6318352
awt	swing
i fear the paint algorithm is pretty hardcoded in swing awt and they only offer different hooks for different purposes

6318352
awt	swing
you can use use this method in swing which would offer what you want but sadly there doesn t seem to be an awt equivalent

6318352
awt	swing
you could try mixing awt swing but that s usually not recommended and may lead to strange behavior in some cases as i hear

6318396
getter	setter
however if i remove the getter and setter from the test string and end up with something like this

6318408
postgresql	mysql
presumably one of those fields is expecting an integer and postgresql is a lot less permissive on this front than mysql

6318419
ddms	adb
windows - preferences - android - ddms - adb connection timeout ms

6318445
google-chrome	firefox
and it worked in both google-chrome and firefox

6318451
free	malloc
free ing malloc memory is pretty safe because it won t touch the object graph

6318453
getter	setter
removing the getter and setter changes the teststring member from being a property to being a field

6318453
getter	setter
you can let the compiler create the backing field automatically by declaring empty getter setter like this

6318458
windows	wow64
so if it is a 32-bit process either by running on x86 windows or wow64 on x64 windows you want the x86 version

6318488
put	get
to get gdk to talk to my ldap server in the first place i put my ldap server s self-signed certificate file in etc openldap cacerts then tweaked my etc ldap.conf file - i changed the uri line to use ldaps and port 636 and then added this line for the cert issue

6318491
google-chrome	firefox
when i run this in addition to the http headers as shown by google-chrome or firefox there is a version htpp 1.1 an entry with key http_version and value http 1.1 is being added to the env hash

6318522
accessor	ivar
using accessor means you never have to worry about how mag is stored internally so you can transparently store it in nsuserdefaults rather than in an ivar

6318525
prepare	execute
if i try to run a straight select execute on con it works fine so the connection is being made but this prepare statement does not work it s not even recognizing prepare as a valid method it seems

6318535
draggable	droppable
i think based on your demo that your draggable is not reverting because it s actually hitting a valid droppable target the #dropzone element in your demo which is essentially the background

6318535
draggable	droppable
you can fix it by not turning that element into a droppable or by making it s drop handler revert the draggable element itself

6318585
children	parent
so i think my original question should be reworded to what is best recommended way to remove all child objects of a parent when the children have a non-optional relationship with the parent

6318593
mpdf	phpexcel
i have tried generate pdf file from codeigniter using phpexcel mpdf tcpdf and html2pdf but there was a problem for generating more than 1000 rows fetching from mysql

6318611
post	get
i read a post somewhere about using the sid to get the local admin name in case it has been renamed

6318617
getter	setter
the compiler needs to know the object s type because a property can designate any method to be the getter or the setter not just the default pair of name and setname for example this is usual with bool properties

6318617
accessor	properties
so the compiler needs to know what properties this is in order to generate the correct accessor calls

6318628
superclass	subclassing
so say i have a subclassing that extends a superclass

6318628
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
i m looking at an example in a book about abstract-class and when they extend it with a non-abstract subclassing the subclassing s default constructor is blank and there s a comment that says the superclass s default constructor will be called

6318628
superclass	subclassing
is the distinction from calling the superclass s default non-default constructor from the subclassing s default non-default constructor

6318638
post	put
with put or post requests sent in different formats it is much easier as the server can check the format and parse it accordingly.

6318659
put	get
if i put it into string object i get an error constant string too long

6318660
next	except
however i am trying to save the core data and call upon that the next time it is run except when i do this the parser runs again and the same items are aggregated in the uitableview again

6318688
post	get
i ve heard something about the curl library that helps sending variables via get or post method

6318696
accessor	properties
make sure that the properties has a valid properties accessor defined

6318696
accessor	properties
keep in mind you can have your own accessor and setters but i think code-sense needs properties to show up the dot notation

6318728
children	parent
i would like to be able to pass any id to a stored procedure and get the entire chain of ids parent and children of that given id

6318732
fseek	fread
im reading a specified chunk of a file with fseek and fread functions and then writing it to another file

6318758
firefox	safari
right now the limit is 8 in most browsers including firefox safari

6318816
parsley	robotlegs
take a look at some frameworks to help you with an mvc approach - i d suggest parsley because it s what i know but i m hearing that robotlegs is also great and possibily more suited to a mobile application

6318823
folder	directory
bin folder used as output directory by the ant build of the android project and is created automatically by android sdk

6318845
int	boolean
this would be quicker because summation could happen in a single query but am i losing something in storing 32 bit int for a boolean value

6318892
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
java supports the gzip format with the gzipinputstream decompressing and gzipoutputstream compressing

6318911
restructuredtext	pep
see also restructuredtext and docstring conventions pep 257

6318916
bazaar	perforce	bazaar	git
the more advanced ones such as git hg subversion bazaar clearcase bitkeeper darcs perforce etc. all support some form of merge tracking that can make this specific problem significantly easier to solve

6318916
sctp	tcp
you might prefer to branch based on features rather than on customer names as you might have ten customers who need sctp support and the other twenty customers want tcp support instead

6318931
subtract	add
the most obvious thing to do is to add up all the other blocks in the container and subtract that from the container height

6318939
udp	tcp
also please note that i m talking about the tcp connection which is more safe by itself than udp

6318973
udp	tcp
after all that is the whole point of using tcp instead of udp

6318976
cout	cin
after all you said print something here to cout â in the other case you just said read something from cin

6318977
spaces	delimiter
when reading input using the delimiter is spaces by default you can change this though while when printing cout prints till its find 0 which is end of the string

6318977
istream	getline
istream getline - member function of std istream

6318980
udp	tcp
if you use udp and you care about the data actually being received by the other side you need to use ack but if you don t need the speed of udp you should use tcp as it does the acking for you

6318996
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both work as expected but ie keeps triggering the error function when using instead of success

6319011
implements	extends
so i basically have an activity a class that extends the glsurfaceview a class presented above that implements the glsurfaceview.renderer and a class that have the game rules etc

6319020
addition	multiplication
in any single addition or multiplication the query optimizer understands that the data already has the same order and this is seen when you group by such expressions too

6319021
put	get
or put the id a get parameter instead of a hidden field just make sure you don t use get method for a form â those should never have any side effects

6319026
width	height
each state and each county has a bounding box which tells me the origin the width and height each is

6319026
subtraction	addition
it seems like it should be straightforward addition or subtraction as the scaling for each item is exactly the same and i m not trying to do any major transformations so i do not believe the cfaffinetransformation family is needed

6319026
post	get
i can post code if necessary but i m not trying to get someone to write my program for me

6319037
pow	sqrt
try 1 sqrt x i.e pow x -1 2 for starters

versioning	upgrade
first of all i can suggest an upgrade of symfony versioning - i use 1.4.11 where you ll have this functionality working from scratch

6319088
pjax	history.js
so you can get pjax to use history.js so that it supports cross browsers

6319088
pjax	history.js
in regards to simpler history.js is the most low-level basic shortest simple thing you can get which will ensure the html5 history api works in all browsers - that s it s aim to be as low-level and compact as possible so other things can extend it the way they want - such as pjax or that gist

6319095
hash	md5
the best approach to store password remembering stuff is storing as md5 hash along with some browser specific data

6319113
udp	tcp
you can use factory pattern to create connection on the basis of the type channel tcp or udp

6319122
des	aes
so in my sample android app i can switch from des to aes to tdes encryption in one line of code

6319132
daemons	systemd
for example the linux auditd 8 audit logging daemons can be configured to place the computer in single-user-mode or halt the systemd completely when there is no more space left for audit logs. audit logs from remote systemd should probably be maintained until it is known that they have been successfully written to centralized log servers

6319170
actionscript	haxe
haxe - similar approach as mxmlc uses haxe instead of actionscript very fast hx - swf

6319185
pseudo-class	visited
note it is possible for style sheet authors to abuse the link and visited pseudo-class to determine which sites a user has visited without the user s consent

6319186

it should only extend its width and or height depending on the size of content in div.w4

6319193
x86	mips
the c++0x memory model makes guarantees whether you re on x86 or arm or mips or anything else you can come up with

yacc	bison
gcc used a yacc bison parser once upon a time but it was replaced with a hand-written recursive descent parser at some point in the 3.x series see for links to relevant patch submissions

6319328
express	node.js
express itself uses connect which uses the standard node.js http api

6319335
udp	tcp
what about sending udp datagrams on a separate udp socket while making the remote host respond to each and then when the remote host doesn t respond you kill the tcp connection

6319340
hash	salt
that is a significant security risk and needs to be done very carefully even if the user database is encrypted and uses hash salt passwords

6319343
src	attr
next inside find there should be a selector not a jquery object and inside attr there should be an attribute name thus a string src not a value presumably src contains something like

6319366
implements	extends
update this wasn t originally my code and i m still familiarizing myself with it but i just discovered that there was a progressrenderer class that extends jprogressbar and implements tablecellrenderer

6319370
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
i am trying to use the mousemove event to track the position of the mouse while the button is pressed but neither mousedown nor mouseup fire an event for the left mouse button

6319559
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
or you can throw an unchecked-exception something that is or extends runtimeexception

6319564
air	flashdevelop
not yet as complex as flashdevelop but it s a good start and being an air application it runs under linux

6319575
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
as far as front-end web servers go it seems i have three choices nginx apache and lighttpd

6319575
apache	lighttpd
that leaves two choices - lighttpd and apache

6319575
apache	lighttpd
are there any caveats or benefits to using lighttpd over apache

6319641
accessor	properties
the properties declaration and the matching synthesize statement will create standard accessor for values named x and y

6319645
post	get
or use the ui dialog to get it with each post

6319651
getter	setter
the default behavior is property int x will reference 2 methods depending if you are using it as an left hand setter or right hand getter operator the default getter will be - int x

6319656
subclass	abstract-class
in the following code abstractiterator is an abstract-class that implements uniquefilter is a subclass of abstractiterator that is not abstract and data is a vector

6319658
accessor	properties
properties means that compiler should create accessor methods if you re using synthesize

6319660
children	parent
so parent expanding parent img children

6319667
apache	lighttpd
under heavy load lighttpd will outshine apache but apache is like a train

6319667
apache	lighttpd
out of the box lighttpd wipes the floor with apache

6319667
apache	lighttpd
under heavy load if configured correctly lighttpd will out preform apache i did some tests a while back and you might see a 200-300 performance increase in requests per second

6319673
freebsd	linux
linux freebsd follow the same abi for x86-64 and another set for 32-bit

6319673
freebsd	linux
but x86-64 abi for windows is different from linux freebsd

6319681
subclass	abstract-class
uniquefilter is a subclass of abstractiterator an abstract-class

6319681
subclass	abstract-class
if you want to create an instance for abstract-class first you create a concrete subclass and create an instance for that and use it

6319721
post	get
so i have the api working where i can get the auth key and post to my fan page

6319726
nginx	lighttpd
if that is the criteria though would actually suggest you use nginx rather than lighttpd

6319740
abstract-class	superclass
its not being instantiated here i.e its just a reference to the instantiated instance returned by vector.iterator with the type being that of a superclass of the actual returned type which happens to be an abstract-class

6319789
super	abstract
a head-of-state even though abstract in language and existence is a super class or super category of titles like sultan president premier prime minister beloved father etc

6319816

if and when i get this right it would be nice to have all the notes in one place the long post

6319941
uiview	subviews
i haven t tried it exactly you can create a uiview object in your class implementation and then add it as a subviews and then assign it to your instance variable your class using dot operator and then release the previously created uiview object

6320007
post	get
however i am unable to get it to post hashtags in the text area

use the post redirect get pattern

6320137
setinterval	settimeout
if you know the remainder time of the valid session you could pass it to javascript which could settimeout if the number is small enough or setinterval

6320158
width	height
note that if you are using the system chrome for your air application the height width of the os chrome bars is in addition to the stage width height

6320158
width	height
thus if you set the stage s height width to maximum - it will definitely cause a problem

6320158
width	height
i don t use windows 7 so can t give you the numbers - but what you can do is drag the window to the middle of the screen click a snap check the height and width of top and left side of os chrome in paintbrush

6320158
width	height
now deduct the same from and also for bottom and right from the stage height width

6320174
memcached	apc
apc is a local machine cache specific to php and memcached is a multiple-computer distributed cache

these are the same methods used to perform these functions by hand or in the head. to multiplying just repeatedly add the number

6320584
multiplying	add
when i try to calculate a root by hand i usually use the guess method start with an approximate number add a fraction multiplying see how far off it is add a smaller fraction multiplying check again and repeat until satisfied

6320629
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome internet explorer mozlla opera

6320643
division	subtract	division	multiplication
note however that you don t normally want to implement multiplication by just repeatedly adding or division by just repeatedly subtract

portrait	landscape
when i am running xcode the splash image appears in portrait mode only but the view is in landscape mode only

6320761
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout work by modifying the opacity of the element as a whole

6320761
fadein	fadeout
so this concept of fading in individual aspects of an element doesn t apply to fadein and fadeout

6320761
fadein	fadeout
if you want to go the fadeout fadein way and you really want it to take a full second as you said in your previous question which seems like a really long time here s how

i would most definitely recommend to use either formtastic or simple-form

6321258
dbcontext	objectcontext
objectcontext for version 4.0 when using a designer generated model and dbcontext with a 4.1 code first model

6321286

for-loop	loops
the most common form of a for-loop is using a new variable as loops counter and loops from zero up to but not including an upper limit

6321525
for-loop	loops
that is how a for-loop is commonly used and people will easily understand what loops is doing

6321544
nfa	dfa
the advantage of nfa s over dfa s is the property to always choose the right path

6321544
nfa	dfa
since you cannot say in an algorithm to choose the right path usually a conversion from nfa to dfa works creating dfa states that symbolize multiple nfa states

6321544
nfa	dfa
thus when your nfa is in state a and has the choice to go to a b or c then the next state in your dfa would be a b c

6321577
inherited	properties
what you can is to create a new class which can inherited from existing class and add the properties to that

6321874
portrait	landscape
im building a calculator app with friend and when i was starting the landscape layout i realized that the app would crash immediately on launch after the oncreate method because it was looking in the portrait xml fil i commented out the portion of the method that made up the new buttons and now it runs but i cant use the new buttons that i declared in the landscape xml file

6321887
button	checkbox
i have a button that the user can click but i want that disabled until the user has clicked in one of the checkbox

6321887
button	checkbox
is there some way that i can sense the user having clicked in a checkbox and then change the state of the button from disabled disabled if this has happened

6321894
portrait	landscape
it will then duplicate your xml so you can redesign your landscape mode without messing up portrait mode

6321904
button	checkbox
you could subscribe for the click event of all those checkbox and once the user clicks on one of them enable the button

6321909
children	parent
note that it would be a significant improvement if you could give the input elements a class or if you could specify a common parent element that had no other input children

6321934
google-chrome	firefox
in my tests of what i actually think you re doing google-chrome firefox ie6 ie7 and ie9 did string#indexof fastest

always expect the size of the message as a unsigned 32-bit integer as the first 4-bytes then read until you ve filled that amount of data

6322270
int	chars	int	double
if you want to being able to compare double float int int and chars then use ord

6322289
button	checkbox
it will attache a change event to the set of checkbox and trigger a change when the page is loaded so the button will be disabled by default

6322289
button	checkbox
if there is any checkbox checked it will leave the button enabled otherwise it will disabled the button

6322294
screens	tablet
if you are supporting tablet screens sizes a likely element would be

6322335
serializable	deserialization
generally if you want to use deserialization try to first use serializable to understand how must a valid xml look like

iâ m trying to set the header search path in xcode 4 using llvm 2.0 clang as compiler in a c++ command line project so that i can include a library header file via

6322594
int	chars
in this case the conversion specifier chars see below is replaced by the sequence n where n is a decimal int in the range 1 nl_argmax giving the position of the argument in the argument list

6322606
int	chars	division	modulo
the only other option i can think of is to either iterate the chars and check or cast the number to an int and use modulo + division to grab each digit off of the number and compare with the next number in the series

6322620
uiview	uiwindow
but if not then you can find all the uiview shown on top of the uiwindow and then check if any of the uiview is kind of class that is showing actionsheet

keep in mind it uses a lot of distributed computing and not a simple db lookup and probably caches the first n results for any query and also html ready results for each result page and intermediate results see dynamic programming

6325392
setinterval	settimeout
the suggested fix is to instead of using setinterval blindly use the callback function of the animation to trigger restart with a settimeout

6325699
width	height
i have found this way to do it but i don t know how to obtain screen width and height to fill it in the createbitmap parameter s list

6325701
put	get
as for storage of all the values you already have them in the xml document so you might consider a function that returns the values as you need them or get them all in a loop and store them in an object but then you likely have to loop over the objet to get them back just like you did in the first place to put them in there

6325704
rss	feed
p.s i do not want to use a library or server side scripting also a json object is not available from the rss feed i am using and i do not want to create one in php.

gitolite	gitosis
first i would suggest using gitolite as gitosis is no longer actively developed

6325965
width	height
the createbitmap call only requires the desktop width and height if the image you wish to save is actually the entire size of the screen

if that s indeed your intent you can use cwnd getdesktopwindow to get a cwnd object that you can query for its width and height

6326005
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undeï ned

in google-chrome s javascript console or firefox s firebug extension you can put a breakpoint on a line and see the the values of all the variables

6326386
codeigniter	cakephp
i m suggesting these two versus some of the other well-known frameworks cakephp codeigniter because common consensus is that they re easier to extend which quickly becomes invaluable

6326419
width	height
works fine but the problem is that if i resize the window to less than the width 1400 or height 900 of the photos the scrollbar appears

6326438
width	height
you should be able to set the height and width to 100 and set overflow hidden

6326470
temp	tmp
i had to save the page as a temp file to parse then output the way i wanted with no text then i just did unlink tmp at the bottom to delete the file

strcpy	strncpy
i use strcpy strncpy to do this but my program crashes when i go to use strncpy it compiles but crashes at runtime

6326669
strncpy	malloc
to fix this you should use malloc to allocate some memory to variable before calling strncpy

6326669
free	malloc
note that anytime you allocate memory such as with malloc you must be prepared to free it when you are done

6326675
client-side	server-side

6326720
uilabel	uibutton
how can you rotate text for uibutton and uilabel

6326733
hash	md5
rather than depending on byte size of two images you could create md5 hash or other hash algorithms of those images and compare the hash values

width	height
the inner scroll view would have contentsize of the actual content and its actual dimensions would be screen width and the same height as contentsize

6326769
firefox	safari
i created a slideshow that works fine in the latest versions of firefox safari and ie

6326832
stdout	stderr
the part that confused me was the mixing of stdout and stderr led to them being interleaved and the which prints out from and error || warning to the next empty line was printing out a lot more than expected which made it seem like the command wasn t working

6326900

profiling	instrumentation
to determine cache misses you ll want a cpu-level profiling like oprofile or vtune or a dynamic instrumentation tool like valgrind with cachegrind

6337662
jar	manifest.mf
in your jar file you should have a file called manifest.mf under folder meta-inf

6337662
jar	manifest.mf
you can open the jar file using winzip or winrar and edit the manifest.mf directly just to test but in reality you should have it outside together with the classes you are packaging in the jar so that each time you generate the jar file you include it with the rest of the classes

6337666
google-chrome	firefox
i only tested this in google-chrome firefox and ie9

6337703
width	height
one solution could be assuming that this would even work to load the video first without specifying a height and width but using css to hide the video calculate the dimensions destroy the video and load it again on click using the right size

6337703
width	height
alternatively you could make a server-side script php asp ... that reads the video file detects the height and width when you content is originally saved and save the height and width to a database

6337703
width	height
you would then be able to read the height and width from the database on every page view

6337703
width	height
another thought another solution could be to not specify the height and width in the embed code and let the browser size the video on it s own

you d want to put the control into the popup and then expand the popup s height to get the overflow effect

6338366
post	get
you shouldn t have to make any changes to your client-side js except changing the url if your service name changes which it probably will and you should also change to using a get verb from a post since you re just retrieving data

6338373
jar	war
if you re running in a java ee container like jboss 6 and i really recommend so all you need is to package your beans into a jar place a meta-inf persistence.xml inside it and place the jar into your war or ear package

hash	salt
now the salt is there to stop precomputed lookups of hash hashing itself is not enough any more people have precomputed hash of dictionary words and more

6338472
hash	salt
when you want to check passwords you would take the user input get the salt for that user generate the hash for the supplied password and stored salt and then compare

6338472
hash	salt
i should of course point out the asp.net membership functions do salt and hash so they should probably be a first point of call

6338501
width	height
the general technique is to use the 3-argument version of bitmapfactory.decoderesource with bitmapfactory.options#injustdecodebounds for a first-time-pass in order to get the width height of the bitmap although in your case since it comes from the app s resources there s no reason you should even have to do that

6338506
inherited	properties
the whole point of prototypal inherited is that you define an interesting object that is with all the behavior you want and then clone it with object.create and modify the clones to suit your needs usually by modifying its properties not its methods

6338541
nstextview	nsscrollview
i am not even sure if nsscrollview is the correct solution i need but if i could simply access the nstextview inside it i think it would be enough

hash	salt
if your attacker already knows your way of computing the salt hash we can safely assume he either has access to your db which would necessarily store the salt as well a dump of it or access to plaintext communication between your app and a client

6345083
hash	salt
to then crack the hash he would simply replicate your sha1 salt

6345083
hash	salt
he d take the salt from you db and compare the result of the hashed-salted-hashed password to the salt hash stored in the same db

6345083
hash	salt
instead of running a wordlist against a single hashing function with a single salt he ll have to run the entire wordlist against every single hash pw in your database

6345083
hash	salt
that said if the attacker is far enough into your system to actually acquire the hash salt it would be much easier for him to alter your code to send him plain text copies of credentials of users logging in in the first place

i wont confuse everyone with the details of it but simply put is there a surefire way to get this to work

6347027
outputstream	inputstream
your clients will then send their data over a outputstream to your server which will process them do whatever is necessary and then send them back to the other listening devices using an inputstream on the client side

6347058
free	malloc
i usually like to write free in my code immediately after i write malloc and then put whatever code i need in between

6347065
webclient	httpwebrequest
all these would of course not be a problem when using the .net classes webclient or httpwebrequest

6347065
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
i have tried running the nsurlconnection from a backgroundworker a threadpool.queueuserworkitem a nsoperationqueue and for some reason nsurlconnection only seems to work when called from the main thread

6347093
gridview	sqldatasource
to allow for this i have to handle the onrowupdating event of the gridview and set cancel in the gridviewupdateeventargs to true since the sqldatasource has no update command defined

6347094
width	height
if your real problem is my radio buttons are too small to touch with the particular setup i have here and you can t convince your device to scale things up by specifying a width and height in css your best bet would probably be to emulate radio buttons using javascript and your own images and a hidden form field

6347105
apache	nginx
for the opposite forcing all traffic to non-www it s recommended to just do a re-write at the server configuration level such as apache or nginx

6347112
box-sizing	border-box
if i set the box-sizing property back to border-box it at least doesn t make ie8 any worse and ff still applies the -moz-box-sizing property

6347161
getter	setter
i don t see any getter setter method listed in the javadocs

6347181
int	double
you should read about java specs to understand how double int strings are written in data output stream

6347210
for-loop	arrays
use something like this to convert the string to a byte arrays then use a for-loop to put those bytes into the byte arrays that is your message buffer and to zero-fill if necessary

6347244
button	checkbox
this seems not to be an official property of a button not a button-style checkbox

6347250
getter	setter
if you opt to instantiate your own getter setter then what happens in the body of the getter setter is entirely up to you

6347261
jvisualvm	jstat
running jvisualvm against the local ubuntu 10.04 machine by using its ip address and jmx port and adding a jmx instance works fine - and i m running neither rmiregistry nor jstat - though the monitor shows rmi threads running

6347262
integer	unsigned
i d pack them into the an array of the longest unsigned integer available using bit-shifting operations

6347282
zipoutputstream	zipfile
this means there are classes such as zip zipinputstream zip zipoutputstream and zip zipfile

6347298
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller with two uiviewcontroller

6347298

6347314
rss	feed
there are a few things you can do with rss feed or the connect to outlook option but there is no api as such

6347343
int	boolean
you can use a bitarray to pack the boolean into an int

6347343
int	boolean
a byte can hold up to 8 boolean an int up to 32

6347343
int	boolean
to hold up to 16 boolean you could use a byte array with two bytes or a single int depending on whether the overhead of an array or the unused bits in the int take up more space

6347343
int	boolean
to get the boolean back you create a bitarray from an array of byte or int

6347345
super	extends
bison and super bison must inherit or extends from a common class

6347353
polymorphism	specialization
at compile-time static polymorphism this can be done quite nicely with function overloads and or template specialization

6347408
int	double
enum is an int so yes state will be lx_done assuming you get rid of the weird double ++

6347433
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome ie opera and safari submit the form fine

6347449
webclient	httpwebrequest
i d just use the standard .net classes httpwebrequest or webclient

6347460
activemq	rabbitmq
activemq is not interoperable out-of-the-box with amqp systems like rabbitmq

6347505
ssl	https
if you set use_ssl as true you can use https and default value of verify_mode is set as openssl ssl verify_peer

6347515
many-to-many	one-to-many
you could probably do it with a linking table but you d have to enforce one-to-many via code otherwise it could easily become a many-to-many

6347515
children	parent
the jist of the linking table would be that it keeps the association between the parent and its children rather than the child object itself

6347534
put	get
get rid of that and you ll be able to put in some real code

6347535
textview	imageview
each row then has imageview a textview representing the player name and two other textview representing various scores

6347535
oncreate	setcontentview
this method is called from oncreate right after setcontentview

6347540
google-chrome	safari
this behaves as i would expect in google-chrome 12 and safari 5.0.5

6347540
button	checkbox
click on the checkbox produces got click checkbox then got click button

6347540
button	checkbox
however in firefox 4.0.1 both produce got click button and do not alter the checkbox checked attribute

6347543
consistency	acid
multi-threaded means there are multiple threads to run multiple operations at the same time and the database system has been designed in such a way that is able to control race conditions and locks between records to allow consistency according to the acid principles

6347561
int	boolean
the information in the value column can be formatted as a string boolean int decimal etc

6347580
submit	submission
i see you can add functions to a submit button over and above the normal submission process so is it possible to simply activate the add image button on the referenced node again automatically via a function on the image node s submit button

6347631
post	put
post the data to the different action that will put it to the session

6347658
inherited	properties
depending on the logic you need in a shared build step you may be able to actually perform real logic in the dependent build it won t be able to inherited any properties or vcs details from the real build

6347688
post	get
i can successfully query the unauthenticated calls ie get the top news stories using restsharp and hammock but i want to be able to post comments with my digg client on windows phone

6347703
pull	push
what i personally would do is push data to your clients and not pull data from them which seems what you re planning to do that way you d only have to send data whenever someone logs in or a new message appears - both situations that should happen not that often

6347725
google-chrome	firefox
open it in google-chrome and firefox you will see the difference

6347736
hide	show
as you see using visible property i show hide the popup based on some conditions

6347761
stateless	stateful
ejbs - stateless session beans stateful session beans

getdate	dateadd
instead of dateadd d -1 getdate you should use an expression that returns the beginning of the previous day

6347860
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
if you need j2ee functionality my suggestion would be to bite the bullet and use glassfish despite the complexity and resource requirements compared to tomcat glassfish is quite easy to use compared to others like weblogic and jboss

6347862
for-loop	loops
can a for-loop be written in java to create an infinite loops or is it only while loops that cause that problem

6347870
move	drag
i would drag a single file into this directory run the script which performs the text replacement and the rename and then move the file out of the current directory

6347944
filtering	grouping
need to filtering after grouping by

6348001

6348093
google-chrome	firefox
in some instances on google-chrome and firefox html 5 validation is running on that input field

6348093
google-chrome	firefox
open this in firefox or google-chrome

6348114
for-loop	loops
as other people have alluded to in the same way that you can have a while loops without an form or form you can have a for-loop without them

6348127
innodb	myisam
generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not

6348130
post	get
you need to make sure that the method attribute on your html form that is submitting the data is set to either post or get

6348194
goto	break
the break are like goto statements

6348201
width	height
for example you could store your thumbnails to the filesystem in a directory structure like width height filename which would be easier to check for in a rewrite rule than modified-filename-width-height.gif

6348223
post	get
is there a way to add a different value to both my post and preview submit buttons that get passed in the params hash so that i can check which one was pressed in the controller and render the view accordingly

6348229
post	get
you may want to examine why you want to preserve get or post variables

6348229
post	get
as a side note never trust get or post data to be what you expect it to be in the context of security

6348244
post	get
i ve got firebug open in firefox and when the price updates on the page i dont see any gets or post just a get maybe 30 to 60 seconds later

6348274
dependencyobject	uielement
only dependencyobject types can define dependency properties and all uielement derive from dependencyobject.

if you examine the request you will see that it specifies a header transfer-encoding chunked which is used for these purposes see

6348328
rss	feed
this pipe can take your x and your rss feed url and return json for you to work with in javascript saving tons of time.

6348347
superclass	subclassing
i m going to assume you re talking about passing a subclassing to a function that was designed for a superclass and it is therefore impossible to implement this optimization

6348366
innodb	myisam
i have always recommended drupal databases using innodb instead of myisam

6348372
post	get	post	put	put	get
wanted to use the same url for a get put delete post for a rest based api but when the only thing different about the actions is which http verbs it accepts it considers them to be duplicate

6348391
trie	tree
i ve implemented a basic prefix tree or trie

6348459
post	get
that said if you re talking about a get and a post this problem will likely go away as the post action will take more parameters than the get and therefore be distinguishable

6348482
qfile	qdir
boost filesystem seems like the winner but qdir and qfile are pretty nice too

6348499
post	get
the library is raising an 404 error not found which is correct for a get call post calls are processed well i m also trying with a post within a html form

6348517
put	get
what i want to do now is put these results into an array i know that i can use a while loop to loop and get the results but i can only use those once i need to continue to use them throughout the rest of the page

6348540
qlist	qvector
you could use qvector s or qlist s or another container class

6348574
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested on ie 7 ie 8 google-chrome and firefox 3.6

6348585
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the layout works fine in ie8 firefox google-chrome safari but of course not in ie7

post	get
with it you can conditionally intercept get or post requests inspect and change parameters break on responses change responses headers or body reissue old requests and generally screw with your application during development

6348614
children	parent
basically you need optimistic locking for one-to-many relationships when parent logically owns its children in other words when parent and children are modified at once as a whole

6348616
button	checkbox
the user first selects the dimensions of an array of checkbox using these spin boxes then clicks the push button

pressing enter or submission a form via the submit button doesnt trigger the submit event on the input that had focus when you pressed enter or on the submit button but rather on the form element

6348765
post	get
when the 302 redirect is performed the request changes from post to get see issue 1401

6348790
innodb	myisam
if you need to scale out you might consider replicating your tables from innodb to myisam

6348791
springsource	grails
as for your second question my opinion is that grails is mature and it is being actively developed by springsource

6348806
firefox	safari
my objective is to hover images and make them animate their rotation it works in safari + firefox but not ie

6348808
min	max

extjs	qooxdoo
i am very happy with qooxdoo 2 but there are several options jquery extjs ...

6348812
yesod	happstack
there are now frameworks yesod happstack ... that help with this but i think it is accidental complexity that can be avoided by writing a native application

6348818
post	get
the http request will be a post instead of a get when the data parameter is provided

6348829

i must warn you that chars although it is an int type is treated special it is implementation defined if chars is signed or unsigned

6348854
svg	vml
raphael is a great library that works in ie with vml and other browsers with svg

6348881
post	get
from reading many blog post articles books and discussions with many developers i get the feeling that the extended persistence context is fairly little known thing and not that much best practices have been created for it

6348907
udp	tcp	vbscript	jscript
how can i use a stand-alone vbscript or jscript file to connect to a port on localhost either udp or tcp preferable udp

6348907
vbscript	jscript
but at the moment i am having a hard time finding any examples on vbscript or jscript networking

6348950
width	height
for left and right margins they refer to the width of the page box while for top and bottom margins they refer to the height of the page box

6348951
width	height
measure the width of the original image height would do just as well but we just need one dimension

6348965
folder	directory
what i did is to look for resources in a hierarchy of folder starting from user specified to environment variable to relative directory and finally to standard unix directory

6348975
mouse	keyboard
the user can lock the computer from the start menu - typically a mouse action not keyboard

6348980
hide	show
the user can hide show table rows depending on seletions

6348980
nextuntil	each
and then within each a element using the nextuntil method to change any links into text that equal this.href

6348980
hide	show
but then what do i do when the user chooses to hide show a different selection

6348983
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank

6348983
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer

6348983
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type

6348983
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

6349019
couchbase	couchdb
is couchdb or couchbase suitable as a persistence nosql-based solution for storing users chat history and statistics

6349029
google-chrome	firefox
browsers come with some form of developer toolbar so you can disable styles within say firefox ie google-chrome whatever on demand and you ll get an idea how it s likely to be seen by text-only browsers

6349034
post	get
i m currently using asihttprequest for my iphone app and using get post on gae to update and get the data

6349045
oncreate	findviewbyid
all throughout the developer documents tutorials they reccomend use of findviewbyid to find a view that was identified by the id attribute from the xml that was processed in oncreate bundle so i exclusively had been using that everywhere i needed a view to reference something in an xml file

6349045
getter	setter
recently i stumbled upon setid which in addition to being briefer to write and being more readable since it is following the standard getter setter protocol also seems to have no requirements as to where you use it within your app

6349104
libcurl	typhoeus
the problem seems that typhoeus requires libcurl as development library to successfully compile it s native.so extension

6349104
post	get
to the record that same post mentions how unsuccessfully was the user attempt to get the gem to work on windows and he ended switching to curb

6349120
post	get
my problem is that i can t get the post controller to assign the correct discussion id to a new post

6349134
oncreate	findviewbyid
you could use findviewbyid not only oncreate

6349142
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch didn t work when trying to catch this exception-handling

6349143
vbscript	jscript
not sure that it is a good idea but yes you can use javascript actually jscript instead of vbscript

6349143
createobject	activexobject
just use activexobject class instead of createobject function that is used in vbscript to create objects

6349181
post	get
the problem is i don t know how to get the right links to those post

6349189
free	malloc
error demoapp 1874 0xb024f000 malloc error for object 0xc79e430 double free

getter	setter
you could pass b an object with getter and setter that can access a s private variables

6349192
getter	setter
the getter and setter could be public assigned to the this object of a but this way they are only accessible if explicitly given out from within a

6349215
versioning	upgrade
on older versioning of starteam where deltas were kept pre-2005 upgrade to certain server versioning patches could raise a similar error

6349256
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven simply add to your pom.xml

6349287
children	parent
i am planning to use two classes one stores a parent node element tree class and the other implements linked list for storing children single_linked_list

6349303
public	protected
what s hidden by private can only ever affect the code outside its class through the public or protected members

6349317
folder	directory
i have an application which needs to be able to create folder in uac-protected directory semi-automatically the user will be there to approve the uac notice but i don t want to ask them to go do it themselves

6349395
post	get	post	put	put	get
your issue is that you do not have a mechanism to get the discussion into the post controller one approach might be to put the discussion id in a hidden field in your partial form and then read it in your controller as a param

6349398
getter	setter
edit a simpler way to do have this functionality is to use properties which are a shortcut that create the getter and setter for a variable for us see this link for a good beginner s tutorial iphone 101 for your instance variables like so

6349410
folder	directory
obviously the directory are not open so i suppose i could just have the user select any random file in the folder and i can get the pathname but is there a better way to do this

6349451
google-chrome	firefox
to perform the same type of selection manually you can with firefox hold ctrl down and start dragging text in different positions but performing it on google-chrome doesn t work

6349452
hide	show
in addition you can also programmatically show hide a label add css styles and associate it with an input control associatedcontrolid property

6349458
put	get
or just get ghetto with it and put that library stuff in a directory that s symlinked into each app

6349462
google-chrome	safari
here is your original jsfiddle with a height added that works in safari and google-chrome

6349532
margin	height
can you maybe give the list view or the list view s container a margin at the bottom that is the height of the button

6349532
margin	height
just as a test give the button a height of 30 dips and have the listview or listview s container have a bottom margin of 30 dips to see if it still runs over behind the button

6349561
junit	testng
this page has advantages of testng over junit

6349562
junit	easymock	junit	jmock	easymock	jmock
to complement junit there are mocking libraries such as jmock and easymock

6349571
junit	testng
if it s pure unit testing maybe try testng but either way you should be fine with either junit or testng

6349592
nunit	moq
i am using nunit and moq

6349601
sudo	passwd
in my rails app i periodically require the user to re-enter their passwd after a certain amount of inactivity--like with sudo on linux

6349610
google-chrome	firefox
everything runs fine in ie firefox and google-chrome with the exception of one column

6349610
google-chrome	firefox
however this is hit or miss with ie and doesn t work at all with firefox or google-chrome

6349610
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome i get errors telling me that it is not allowable to load the local resource

6349621
serializable	deserialization
for serializable deserialization protobuf is pretty tough to beat

6349642
width	height
i ve set my table view to auto-resize width and height

6349642
portrait	landscape
starting in portrait and then rotating to landscape gives me this exhibit c

6349642
portrait	landscape
it seems that the width of the table should be 703 in landscape and 768 in portrait

6349642
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i ve tried putting resizing code to set this in viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear both these methods etc

6349659
junit	testng
if you re doing non-unit testing testng might be a better option than junit

6349669
perforce	cvs
support for version control including cvs perforce and subversion is built in

6349726
post	get
this whole process takes 3 lines of code plus one line of code for every post parameter or get query parameter

6349743
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
you can show any kind of uiviewcontroller in a uipopovercontroller

6349754
put	get
to get more control you might want to put the image on a canvas inside a viewbox

6349814
mp3	wav
for decoding and encoding you need an encoder like lame to convert mp3 to wav files

6349814
decoder	encoder
the lame encoder decoder binarys are available for windows

6349827
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
if the device accepts flash drives and or hid devices like a mouse or keyboard then host mode is supported

6349841
maven	pom.xml
one of the dependencies to my project has a maven repository listed in its pom.xml that no longer exists

6349846
post	get
when you fetch your last 5 post get the id make sure you re filtering on your post_type field to avoid grabbing things like revisions attachments etc

6349850
ienumerable	ilist
how you loop through the list will of course depend on the type of list you have but as arraylist appears to implement ilist which implements ienumerable then you should have no problem using a foreach var item in list type construct to build the loop

6349853
post	put
i have the following method which calls a post service and it returns xml which i want to put the attributes of the element into a hashmap

6349998

put the jquery post inside the subscribe function

6350038
gif	png
i upload a picture and i look for the type allowed jpeg jpg gif and png

6350038
gif	png
now i cut a part out of it and save it on a temporary resource which is created by the information of the type if the type is jpg or jpeg i use imagejpeg with png i use imagepng and with gif i use imagegif

6350038
gif	png
jpeg warnings seem to be deactivated but not the warnings for png and gif

6350052
mouse	keyboard
if you really want to do it anyway you ll need to implement low level mouse keyboard hooks

6350111
express	node.js
i plan to use express backbone.js mongodb redis if i choose node.js

6350154
postgresql	mysql
note that right now we re using postgresql but may be moving to mysql in the near future

6350168
vsto	add-in
indeed from your excel-dna add-in you only have access to the excel com object model and not the vsto extensions

6350168
vsto	add-in
however the vsto assemblies just talk to excel through the com interface so in theory you should be able to do the same from your excel-dna add-in perhaps after adding some helper classes

6350241
tiff	png
simply try change the jpeg tiff to pdf png

6350283
post	get
we keep extensive logs in a database containing each request it s variables get post session keys etc

6350317
nsstring	nsdata
you re also not telling nsstring what kind of encoding you expect your string to be in when it reads it from nsdata

6350347
superclass	subclassing
if your subclassing doesn t reimplement any of the methods of the superclass or if you re fine with ignoring reimplemented methods you can use the functions methods and superclass to find a list of subclassing methods that aren t also methods of any of the superclass

6350350
notepad	textpad
using select all does indeed highlight all the text selecting copy issues no errors but when i go to notepad or word or textpad etc

i have a wpf application that allows users to create questions of all different types which depending on the type will use a textbox combobox checkbox or radio button to allow the user to answer the question after they build some sort of questionnaire

6350417
actionscript	mxml
mxml tags represent components written in actionscript actionscript under the hood

6350417
actionscript	mxml
when you compile a flex flex application the mxml is compiled using adobe s mxmlc compiler into actionscript which is then compiled with the application s actionscript code into a swf swf file

ubuntu	linux
when i run the below command in terminal of ubuntu linux and also i set the classpath properly but i wasn t successful

6359466
16-bit	64bit
however you could be sneaky and convert your 32-bit or 64bit data into a set of red green blue and alpha channels and save it as a truecolor rgb image with alpha transparency which will give you 4 channels of 16-bit each for a total of 64bit to work with

6359466
16-bit	64bit
the 64bit number can be broken into 4 16-bit numbers and saved as follows

6359491
google-chrome	firefox
ensuring that the problem is client not server side google-chrome firefox may have cached it

6359498
post	get
if you can t get access use to the owner of the server the you could try using a packet sniffer such as wireshark to capture packets both from your app and from a successful post and compare the two to try and work out what is different

6359498
post	get
if you can t get an example of a successful post then you re pretty well stuffed as you have no point of reference

6359537
daemon	cron
i saw that someone suggested to run the cron as a daemon here

6359542
apache	nginx
in my case web server is nginx but it should be same in apache if you are using fcgi

6359579
hide	show
you re going to need to hide and show box every time the view appears not just when the view is loaded because the view might be loaded and then used to display multiple different office s

6359586
strcpy	malloc	strlen	strcpy
is just an array of pointers - for each element you need to malloc sufficient memory strlen token + 1 bytes and then use strcpy to copy the string contents from token to

6359595
jtextfield	jlabel
i meet a relayout problem that is in my swing application i add four components two jlabel one jtextfield and one table each occupies one row to a panel by using gridbaglayout for some logic i need to make one label visible true or false based on some conditions but when i invoke setvisible false the components below this label will come up a little and when i invoke setvisible true they come down a little which makes the gui flashing

6359621
ubuntu	linux
note this was on an ubuntu linux server - you may need different commands on your os but the approach should be broadly similar

6359627
int	chars
my above code is just contrived for my question that is what happens when we cast signed chars to int hex

6359630
googletest	gmock
i wrote a unit test using googletest along with gmock and was able to stub out a method for a class using on_call

6359683
hide	show
we can hide show already controls based on your selection

int	chars
all that happens is that the compiler will copy or expand the chars to have 4 bytes of memory interpret the value of the chars and rewrite it in the new int s memory

6359726
codeigniter	cakephp
also most comparison charts of cakephp vs zend vs codeigniter vs others are made in 2006 2007 or at last 2008

6359886
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	ondestroy
also i think it works better to retrieve your adapter in onstart and close it in onstop of the activities where it is being used rather than using oncreate and ondestroy

6359887
portrait	landscape
i think the root of the problem might lie in the fact that i m switching from portrait mode to landscape mode and that somehow messes with the bar

6359938
hex	binary
as our starting point 220 dc in hex and 11011100 in binary

6359938
int	chars
when it converts the signed chars to signed int it doesn t say this would be 220 if it s unsigned it says this is -36 make it an int of -36 for which the 32-bit two s complement representation is ffffffdc because it must be the negative value for the full size of int this is called sign-extension

6360019
equals	compareto
in any case you should use equals or even rather than compareto here

postgresql	mysql
it does matter as you won t use the same api to connect to a mysql database or to a sqlite one or oracle or postgresql or sql server .

6360148
try-catch	exception-handling
at a minimum put a try-catch block around the contents of the onstart method and log an error to the system event log when an exception-handling occurs

6360158
put	get
you can also just put it in your html header as you did and get rid of scriptmanager call which is unnecessary in that case

6360477
mouse	keyboard
it binds to both change and keyup so that mouse and keyboard clicks are both captured

6360508
getter	setter
property access on the other hand makes use of getter and setter be they synthesized or not

6360511
folder	directory
this is not a universal solution in that it won t handle multiple directory well but the solution i m using for a single directory of unknown contents ie mixed files folder bundles is to enumerate the contents of the directory and add them individually as arguments to zip rather than simply zipping the entire directory at once

6360533
prepare	execute
my stored procedure prepares an insert statement execute it deallocates the prepare statment and then attempts to return the last insert id

6360562

maven	pom.xml
i tried looking into maven overlays as that looked like it would require me to build a whole separate project for just my local credentials with a pom.xml and a war file

6361414
rubygems	rvm
if you installed rubygems separately from installing a ruby in rvm then that s probably your problem

6361521

scheme racket instead provides a representation that can handle arbitrarily large numbers limited only by the memory of the machine evaluating the code

6363532
ubuntu	centos
there are other functional differences between the two machines one is centos and the other ubuntu and they use different gcc s but i would have thought that they d use more or less the same logic

standard navigation markup has better semantics especially if you switching to html5 and use the nav element which is used by screens readers to figure out where the navigation is

6364541
folder	directory
i used this directory as a source folder and that works

6364547
hide	show
each form has show and hide method so you should simply call

if you want to have only one instance of the form you should keep it as global and only show or hide it on demand

6364575
xmltype	clob
i ve never used vb.net but if you have the ability to change the stored procedure i would consider converting the xmltype to a clob and returning that instead using xmltype.getclobval i find it unlikely that the .net oracle driver will provide support for xmltype

6364687
hide	show
i am trying to click on a button in a form by doing so it will hide the existing form and show the new one although i have had problems and also problems with the forms being generated in different locations on the screen

6364752
hash	md5
but if the space of your passwords is 4 digits 10000 combinations how long will it take to find a password that matches given md5 hash

6364752
hash	md5
you will hit the same security vulnerability with any modern hash function md5 isn t considered secure nowadays

6364752
hash	salt
for each user create some random data called salt and compute hash password + salt

6364752
hash	salt
you aren t obviously storing passwords but you will store hash and salt per each user

6364755
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this has never happened using safari firefox google-chrome or any other browser

6364758

this works fine in firefox ie and opera but when i added the third row in google-chrome it now starts off as 50 opposed to 100

6365015
octal	hex
aside yes that s right once upon a time repr did octal not hex

6365020
actionscript	mxml
a way to fix this with the mx combobox would be to just use a space or use actionscript to set it because of the way mxml parses string info into properties

6365031
put	get
i think is they way android handles messages and calls that makes this behavior i get the call 2 times whenever i send an sms so i m guessing is due to the message being put in the outbox table

6365512
lisp	scheme
it s talking about emacs lisp but the convention are the same across all lisp and scheme

6365514
onfocus	onblur
this is preventing me from using the javascript onfocus and onblur events because when i compare the string in the box there are extra spaces that are making it different from answer this problem... is there a way i can make this default text be aligned left and on the top of the textarea without any extra whitespace that i think is being generated from the php somehow

6365534

6365623
fftw	fftpack
it seems numpy.fft and scipy.fftpack both are based on fftpack and not fftw

6365623
fftw	fftpack
is fftpack as fast as fftw

6365661
profiling	instrumentation
in most cases particularly if the performance problem is easy to reproduce a profiling is the most effective tool for that as it will give you detailed statistics on execution time breaking it down to single methods without having to manually instrumentation your program

6365666
punctuation	words
words are broken by punctuation a space or being at the start or end of a line

6365684

6365686
fftw	fftpack
the fftw site shows fftpack running about 1 3 as fast as fftw but that s with a mechanically translated fortran-to-c step followed by c compilation and i don t know if numpy scipy uses a more direct fortran compilation

6365693
nsurl	nsstring
otherwise the following is mine a category on nsstring modeled after the new bookmark apis available in nsurl which require 10.6

6365711
superclass	subclassing
a uiview subclassing already has its own designated initializer which is - id initwithframe so calling - id init on any subsequent subclassing of contentview is not going to update any instance variables since directs to nowhere or better first the superclass runs initwithframe and only then it runs init which is the same as having done nothing

6365723
width	margin
after fussing with fredrik hedblad s most recent 1 1 11 solution for some time i figured out that the converterparameter value should be 6 + left margin + right margin margins of the outermost container in the template. after examining a blowup of a screen shot i expect the 6 is the width of the vertical bar at the left of each row

6365726
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

6365775
octal	decimal
according to the c++ standard in lex.icon integer literals can be split in 3 types decimal literals octal literals and hexadecimal literals each of which can have a suffix for signess and length type

6365775
octal	decimal
decimal literals must start with a nonzero digit while octal literals start with 0 and hexadecimal literals have 0x and 0x after the prefix for octal-literals and hexadecimal-literals any digit that is not representable in the corresponding base should trigger a compilation error such as 09 that causes error c2041 illegal digit 9 for base 8 and in other compiler prog.cpp 6 15 error invalid digit 9 in octal constant since if the integer literal is not representable the program becomes ill-formed

6365781
mouseout	mouseleave

i tried to implements customconverter or extends dozerconverter but dozer passes me integer type as source and destination class and expect integer as result

6366651
getter	setter
with that name i just call setter or getter method in my converter

6366674
int	double
you are suffering from float double values being demoted to int so any 0.nn gets truncated to 0

6366687
post	get
i think you should be using http get instead of post because post should not be cached idempotent according to http-specs and i believe your data can and should be cached

6366695
inherited	properties
the downside is that you have to specify what properties you want to inherited

6366723
pull	push
they effectively just screen scrape the green screen terminals to allow you to pull and push data and provide macro recording and editing tools to automate the process

6366743

boost	stl
do libraries such as boost stl ace which often make inclusions in namespace std contain any special kind of coding techniques which is not possible to be coded used by a usual programmer

6366775
width	height
the way i have the program set up at the moment you have to manually set the width and height of the pixels

6366775
width	height
if the width and height of the pixels is too large it simply wont work

6366775
width	height
so basically what i want to do is have a function to automatically set the width and height to the size of the picture

6366776
width	height
i want to pack the jtextarea to the minimum possible height given a specified width

6366828
width	height
if say you wanted to render two images side by side you would need to create to instances if getpixelcolor and each one should have its own height and width attributes

6366894
clang	llvm
apple llvm compiler should be available under developer usr bin clang

6366971
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

mersenne-twister	prng
but is there such an algorithm for mersenne-twister or for any other good prng which can be done with a reasonable amount of time and memory

6367082
width	height
the easiest and most compatible way would be to trigger it on resize and then just change the width or height of the frame

6367121
width	height
this will reduce the width as well height ..

6367123
post	put
the other thing i wasn t crazy about was having to manually put in admin post

6367145
viewdidload	viewdidappear
when the main uiview loads it invokes viewdidload viewdidappear

6367224
addition	multiplication
if there was a mathematical correspondence operators overloading can make a class more convenient to use by allowing equations to be expressed in the form a b + c rather than the more verbose a.multiply b .add c where addition and multiplication operators are used addition and multiplication should be the intent

6367226
onclick	onsubmit
onsubmit goes on the form not on the submit button try using type button instead in an onclick event

6367227

then the second form will hide itself and show the first form when you switch back

6367459
portrait	landscape
i want all 3 views in portrait form and only one landscape form

6367470
int	chars
in response to your second question the chars stores the decimal value 90 as chars are really 1-byte int

6367523
portrait	landscape
if i understand your question correctly and please correct me if i do not then you want to have 3 views in portrait all of the time and one view in landscape all of the time

6367526
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
if you use dynamically allocated memory with malloc you can use realloc to resize the memory region or allocate a new region copy the data into it and free the old one

6367554
mdpi	hdpi
each state should have a nine-patch .9.png drawable in each density ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi

6367582
realloc	malloc
don t forget to check if malloc or realloc returns null

6367598
screens	hdpi
but i have doubt that on normal screen- hdpi itself we have 3 screens sizes

6367604
hash	salt
on linux distributions using glibc2 the hash function has a magic bit and salt prefixed to it

6367604
hash	salt
b salt and hash password as explained above

6367643
implements	extends
what else should i do to get reportng s report like extends any class or implements listeners or write snippet of code

6367692
getter	setter
also you would benefit more from studying basic oo stuff about encapsulation the getter and setter in my examples

6367730
google-chrome	safari
if you re using a webkit-based browser safari google-chrome it actually animates between the two using a webkit animation

6367765
int	double
to be polymorphic f must be able to operate with values of at least two distinct types int and double finding and executing type-appropriate code

6367831
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
you are not supposed to free any addresses but those returned by malloc calloc or realloc

6367831
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
the free function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

6367831
free	malloc
even if you could use free on any pointer that points to a malloc d memory - your could would free it twice since you are calling free on more than one memory inside that area

6367836
width	height	switching	screens
i switching to the version that uses a rect for the destination which allows me to specify exactly where on the screens my graphic gets drawn including height width

6367841
children	parent
second of all you would probably be best correctly defining the relationships between entities in the edmx and you probably won t have to join at all instead you can use navigation properites to access parent children and filter on those properties directly

6367850
post	get
i also agree with you presto that your post is a little hard to get at times x

6367850
spaces	delimiter
the most typical word delimiter is the spaces but things like hyphens commas and periods are obviously delimiter as well

6367855
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	strdup	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	strdup	calloc	malloc	strdup	malloc	strdup	calloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc posix_memalign realloc strdup function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined

6367856
folder	directory
using ant scp i can able to copy a file from local system windows to server linux .so what i need is i want to create a folder by the system date at specified directory in linux system using ant and copy the file to the folder which created

6367867
rss	feed
i have an activity in my app which displays rss feed and next to each rss feed arrow image is attached

6367890
int	double
in some languages like c++ compiler-supplied support for run-time polymorphism virtual dispatch is specific to oop whereas other types of polymorphism can also operate on data types that aren t objects not struct or class instances but may be builtin types like int or double

6367893
outputstream	inputstream
now with outputstream writers and their inverse classes inputstream readers it is often useful in addition to wrap a bufferedwriter around them

6367924
margin	height
but that would mean you d have to know the height of the second div to make up for that exact amount using negative margin

6367943
clang	llvm
i want to run an example plugin for clang llvm

6367943
clang	llvm
specifically llvm tools clang examples printfunctionnames

6367950
getter	setter
and msg is the object of message class which has getter nd setter method

6367964
for-loop	arrays
here i pass user_page_id arrays into a for-loop and call facebook api

6367977
folder	directory
we have a folder called notrestricted in the directory where we run application from

6367990

this class also has a property body avbody which is used to define the x y width height etc of the object which in turn positions the skin

6368103
post	get
if the user allows your app you will get a auth token which you can use in the background to post any message on to the users wall

6368150
for-loop	loops
continue jumps straight to the top of the innermost loops where the per-iteration code and continuance check will be carried out sections 3 and 2 of the for-loop

6368169
for-loop	loops
the continue statement will execute the increment part of the for-loop then the test part and then decide whether to execute the next iteration or leave loops

6368175
uiview	subviews
i managed to solve this by adding an uicontrol as a subviews in the uiview

6368184
client-side	server-side
could be server-side or client-side

6368227
getter	setter
as for directly accessing attributes it s actually encouraged in python for simple classes instead of writing explicit getter and setter

6368250
post	get
post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests

6368424
hash	salt
wondering if anyone has some quick links to code snippets to generate a random salt that s not easy too easy to guess and then hashing some plain text password with the generated hash

6368446
oncreate	onstart
that means that trying to check oncreate onstart or even onresume will probably not get the results that you want

6368481
maven	pom.xml
in maven central repo are only spring 1.x and spring 2.x versions and adding to pom.xml don t change anything

rvm	bundler
i m using gem 1.8.5 bundler version 1.0.15 rvm 0.1.46 ruby-1.9.2-p0 x86_64 and rails 3.0.8 on a macbook

6368518
hash	salt
it just has to be unique so that if two people share the same password the salt applied to the password ensures that they don t end up with the same hash value and to reduce the effectiveness of rainbow attacks where a reverse hash dictionary is used to see the possible plain text value s that can produce a particular hash value

6368526
hide	show
you could use something along the lines of this to show hide content

6368615
min	max
i have no syntax at hand but try something along group by min sender_id receiver_id max sender_id receiver_id so that both cases will result in the same combination no matter if sender and receiver are switched

6368625
getter	setter
this is effectively a getter setter but without requiring users of your class to use methods like p.get_flavour

6368625
getter	setter
it also has advantages over letting a user directly access the data since you can add logic in the getter and setter eg

6368630
hide	show
but if you just want simple show hide functionality you should add a class to your div instead of an id

6368747
screens	tablet
it seems that my problem is not rendering a regular html tablet but a direct render to the screens

6368753
put	get
put the id over there on the this url to get the pictures of the friends now you can merge them using the php gd library functions like imagecopymerge check some tutorials and docs here

6368766
folder	directory
you can find it under tools directory of tfs installation folder

6368829
folder	directory
you can add the file to your project just like your code files and in it s properties select copy to output directory copy if newer to make sure that the file is present in the bin debug folder as well

6368877
post	get
the article you linked in your post solves any networking issues so between that and the above you should be able to get the remote debugger up and running

6368879
folder	directory
if you install your program in windows vista or 7 programms folder you will need admin rights to write into this directory

6368895
ubuntu	linux
i am having a linux ubuntu 10.10 version enabled pc and now as opengl is using shaders instead of fixed functionality

6368917
mef	prism
for example we started a large scale enterprise composite app and used prism then we started to use mef and slowly phased out prism as it wasn t necessary to meet any of the business requirements

6368925

the extension folder should be the ext folder in your php installation directory

6368946
hide	show
i want to hide show it from another application.how do i do it with cocoa

6368978
switching	screens
if you dont want the activity to restart itself but rather just switching orientation then you add the configchanges flag in the manifest for the activity and then only onconfigurationchanged will be called where you also can get the screens orientation

6368978
portrait	landscape
the second way is good when you have expensive operations running in the oncreate methods starting threads quering databases etc and you want to reuse that info data for portrait and for landscape

ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable and ienumerator in order

6369026
config	ini
the copy of the driver you are using is built to use the unixodbc lib to access the shared config file libodbcinst.so or the driver is reading it directly and is reading the same ini file as unixodbc

6369113
jpql	hql
since cast is a hibernate specific function no string-to-int conversion in jpql i assume it s a hql issue

6369140
sorting	filtering
you can then return those results in alphabetical order once as more characters are typed you can filtering without sorting

6369152
postgresql	mysql
it would be nice if postgresql supported incrementing on a secondary column in a multiple-column index like mysql s myisam tables but i couldn t find a mention of such a feature in the manual

6369160
move	drag
but i tried that map in safari i can t drag to move the map nor use two fingers to zoom

6369287
put	get
i want to have my service which has to get the ui thread handler and put a message into this handler

6369306
interpolation	splines
by not matching i mean they don t have the same tangent first derivative doesn t match and there is a difference between the last point of the previous splines and first point on the new splines this is because i m not using an interpolation splines but a smooth splines - see note1 below

6369306
interpolation	splines
note1 i m not using interpolation splines

6369306
interpolation	splines
note2 using an interpolation splines is out of the question because i have a lot of noise in the data used for computing splines

6369314
packets	pcap
dumping packets to pcap files

6369367
libevent	epoll
the best way of using epoll is using an event loop library libev or libevent for example

6369382
post	get
asp.net mvc makes a good job by storing values of inputs during get post cycle inside modelstate and automagically putting them into inputs in case of validation errors

you can copy the contents of the inputstream to a bytearrayoutputstream get the byte from the bytearrayoutputstream and create the string from the byte

6369512
eventlet	gevent
eventlet or gevent

6369536
interpolation	splines
this is a pretty unsophisticated suggestion admittedly but one obvious hack would be to fit overlapping rather than distinct subsets of points and then interpolation between the resulting splines in the overlapping region

6369541
post	get	post	put	put	get
i m having a hell of a time trying to figure out why the same line returns request body as string in post and an empty string in put and ultimately how to get the request body in put

6369541

6369801
disk	ram
are you deploying to the same machine i guess not by network conenctivity which may indicate that your server does not have sufficient ram available and is doing a lot of disk swapping

6369860
put	get
after you ve determined that the scrolling perfoms by a fling you can get your listview s first visible position by using the getfirstvisibleposition method and from there you can use smoothscrolltoposition where you put in your getfirstvisibleposition value as an argument

mouse	keyboard
is there a way to disable keyboard mouse

6370045
mouse	keyboard
ideally i m looking for a solution whereby i could completely disable mouse and almost disable the keyboard - bar one key combination for example ctrl + a

so once ctrl + a is pressed - the pc will go to a mute stage no mouse keyboard until ctrl + a is pressed again

6370056
width	height
i had to specify item width and height attributes or some anchors to enable qml to determine window size

6370142

i get the error unknown collection member when i try show or hide a rectangle contains some tables based in this expression

implements	extends
for that i advise you to read the api and see if you can extends some basic providermanager and authenticationprovider instead of implements everything

6371443
implements	extends
the label provider is a custom provider which extends labelprovider and implements itablelayoutprovider

try to view this site in firefox or ie xd and then in google-chrome

6371717
implements	extends
the next thing you want to consider is that if there are multiple entity models that share a property name and you want to share logic regarding that property name utilize the partial aspect of the code-generated classes to extends those classes and have each of them implements an interface

6371727
pull	push
you need to pull this branch before you can push your changes

hash	salt
yes it s okay to store the per-user salt in the same table which stores the password hash not the password itself - even if the adversary gets access to the raw database data he d still need to try each user s salt+password separately

to make things clear the user table should only contain the salt and hash of salt+peanuts+password never the password itself

versioning	upgrade
did the versioning numbers increment and dates get later in the upgrade package

6372662
versioning	upgrade
by default a file with no versioning info is considered user data that shouldn t be overwritten during a reinstall or upgrade

major upgrade are not really upgrade as much as uninstall and reinstall of the product in question

6372849
hide	show
you can choose to ignore all of that post s implementation on the javascript side and replace it with your favorite modal plugin but you ll need to bind into the show hide event on the modal dialog to show hide your custom overlay something that should certainly be possible

6372884
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
you can decouple the new and older versioning by using major upgrade because a major upgrade isn t an upgrade but an uninstall of the old versioning and an install of the new versioning in a chained sequence

6372949
hide	show
you can use the same thing to change the show hide text

6372982

if you can the easiest way would be to just ad a line in button pressed that checks the checkbox

6373241

images for high dpi displays should be placed in hdpi and similarly mdpi and ldpi

6373241
folder	directory
the default folder for the drawables is drawables if the operating system does not match any dpi category or the resources is not found in special dpi directory the system picks the resource from the drawables directory

6373241
mdpi	hdpi
the size are not exact but upto 130dpi it is considered small from 130 to 180 it can be considered mdpi from 180 to 200 it can be considered as hdpi and the higher is classified as xdpi

you should keep the vanilla versioning of wordpress on the master so you can upgrade the core and see how it plays with your custom code instead of upgrading the core on something like one of your branches and everything breaking

6373359
mouseleave	mouseenter
the issue is that i can still see the link tags in div id feedsinfo if i just wave over the lists a b c the mouse sits somewhere else now.in short it should fire mouseleave event even though they change color from red to blue and blue to red on mouseenter or mouseleave events

6373404

6373501
stdout	stderr
you can also use the popen3 method if you want to capture stdout and stderr independently

6373533
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
what that means is that if you have a drawable that is say 50x50 on a mdpi screens it will have to be 37x37 on a ldpi screens and 75x75 on a hdpi screens in order to appear at roughly the same physical size on each screens 2cm if you put a ruler on the screens

6373533
screens	mdpi
also your computer screens is most probably mdpi which is why it s recommended to start with mdpi drawables and then resize them the physical size of the drawable will be very close between your computer screens and an mdpi android device

6373533
screens	hdpi
if you view an hdpi drawable on your computer and on an hdpi device you will notice that it s much bigger again physically -- put a ruler on it style on the pc screens

6373533
screens	hdpi
a device could be very small and have an hdpi screens or very large and have an ldpi screens

6373533
screens	mdpi
for example if a drawable fills the whole screens on one mdpi device do not expect it to do the same on another mdpi device

6373533
mdpi	hdpi
for example if a listview can show 5 items on a mdpi device it might be able to show 6 items on an hdpi device in spite of the fact that the listview items have the same density-independent 1.5 times larger on hdpi than on mdpi height

6373546

6373601
folder	directory
i notice that all codeigniter folder cache config controllers core errors etc... contains an index.html file that basically says directory access is forbidden

6373612
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
if you are building your source code with ant or maven you have to specify the source file encoding in your build.xml or pom.xml

6373615
requestfactory	gwt
i then was looking at the 2.4 beta plugin for using c2dm and noticed that they use gwt along with a requestfactory for communication

6373690

just check the listview items count if its count more than 6 then a button or hyperlink ...all albums show on page otherwise this button or hyperlink hide on page..

6373692
jar	war
if your module b is also a webapp module you can create a jar file containing only the classes simply by c onfiguring the war plugin

6373752
jobs	cron
the default is 5 seconds and it can be increased to 10 seconds for normal handlers or to 10 minutes for fetches within task queue tasks or cron jobs

6373796
serializable	deserialization
you lose a bit of performance from serializable deserialization but you ll need to ask yourself if reducing the impact of this is worth developing a complicated proxy architecture

6373833
folder	directory
if your codeigniter installation system and app folder is outside of your public server directory then they re not going to help with anything since they could never be served

6373843

6373986
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome but not in firefox

6373988
comparator	icomparer
alternativly i don t think you can rely on the order of items in the dictionary but you could implement comparator or icomparer interfaces in your object then use those to sort and search

6374028
hide	show
in extjs 2.2 there is no method to show or hide menu item by using isvisible

6374028
hide	show
so after lot of digging and checking in firebug the final soloution i found was to hide or show the specific item as show below

6374031
getter	setter
i have the class diagram with 25 classes and attributes and getter and setter

6374031
getter	setter
so i want to know that does django also support same classes thing like java does like getter setter

6374104
hash	md5
why dont you try making a hash md5 or similar of each record

6374104
hash	md5
if you also store calculate on the fly an md5 hash of your loaded data then you can quickly determine using primary keys of a table and the md5 hash if anything has changed or indeed if a record doesnt exist

6374105
post	put
i am outlining the process to put together a site with a bunch of information in the form of post or pages shouldn t matter organized into categories

6374141
maven	pom.xml
if you re using a custom built copy of solr then you may just need to bump up the tika dependency in the pom.xml and re-build and maven will take care of it for you

6374155
post	get
if it s happening as you say post gets redirected to a get then it s probably an apache rewrite rule or similar

6374156
restrict	shared
you could have access restrict by default and then have another entity where you d enter in the account details a plugin would run and verify the details and then shared the record to the current user

6374159
profiling	instrumentation
pretty much all the time is consumed in as you can see in the instrumentation profiling data but also it appears that the app is no longer running at 100 of cpu for some reason like it s waiting on disk i o or something

6374159
profiling	instrumentation
what is interesting about this test is that the coredata save instrumentation reports that the successive saves take roughly the same amount of time which obviously conflicts with the cpu profiling information from the first set of results

6374181
aggregate-functions	sum
edit after getting using the aggregate-functions sum below from ericz if anyone else is interested i have found that

6374183
websphere	ibm
a windows service instance one instance among many in cluster nodes should listen to an ibm websphere mq and distribute the queue items to all cluster nodes including the distributor node based on the load on each service instance

6374361
hash	md5
when i need to implement a uniqueness constraint i usually use a specific columns which contains a hash sha or md5 of the text and some code to handle hash clash

6374378

i have an expandablelistview and an expandablelistadapter

6374400
subtraction	addition
this is why two s complement was chosen in the first place because subtraction is just overflowing negative addition

the method takes a flat list and creates a tree assigning the parent and children values as it goes

6374440
subtraction	add	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
if you are making an n-bit integer arithmetic library then you need to emulate the integer addition subtraction multiplication and division etc operations in which case such a technique might be implemented to add the n-bit length numbers but using the carry flag to do so is a better implementation in my opinion

6374462
mouse	keyboard
i don t have keyboard or mouse available at that location

6374471
multiplying	division
for example cpu s division operations are sometimes accomplished by taking the reciprocal of the divisor and multiplying it by the dividend

for-loop	arrays
i have some code that requires the use of a for-loop to read variables from an arrays

6374495

6374497
submit	submission
so submission your entire world will work of course but if you can find a way not to submit everything your gpu will be happier

6374497
octree	quadtree

there are actually parallel run-times libraries protocols like charm++ or mpi think actors that can scale -- with specially engineered algorithms to certain problems -- from a single cpu to tens of thousands of processors so the above is a bit of hyperbole

6382817
put	get
do all of these have the same get and put complexities

6382829
post	get
additionally simply being able to get a link or worse an image tag in will allow the user to make your client and others on the page make any arbitrary get requests including mimicking admin forms if you incorrectly allow both get and post in your inputs - why do you think facebook rewrites all posted links to go through their proxy first

put	get
all of the aforementioned map implementations have their basic get put operations in amortized o 1 time complexity

what i would like to happen is to hide the tab bar on a certain view and show the tab bar again when the user changes views

6383069
hide	show
it works fine when i show hide it on that view but when i navigate back to the previous view the tab bar there is also hidden

6383069

post	get
however if you post some code that doesn t work as expected you ll get lots of helpful advice to guide you to the correct solution

6383502
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval in place of settimeout could be used instead if you wanted it to repeat the process for example if things needed to meet a certain specification before the button was to be clicked

6383579
terminate	timeout
you might want to use a time based cache using the session timeout value rather than a straight map as mostly sessions are started but timeout rather than get explicitly terminate by the user

6383579
terminate	timeout
in which case a httpsessionlistener might work for you - although as i mentioned before you probably still need to use a time based cache due to the way that most user sessions timeout rather than terminate

6383680
nant	partcover
i m currently trying to parse a coverage file from partcover using a nant task

6384442
multiplying	add
using sse the core i7 can issue simultaneous add and multiplying instructions resulting in a peak rate of 8 floating-point operations flop per clock cycle

6384442
division	multiplication
strange bitshifting code implementing multiplication or division is far less expressive of what you were conceptually trying to achieve so other developers will be confused by that and a confused programmer s more likely to introduce bugs or remove something essential in an effort to restore seeming sanity

6384442
division	multiplication
multiplication and division can be achieved using bit operators.

6384442
division	multiplication
you illustrate multiplication but how about division

6384501

int	double
but for double this is not neccessary the case since 32-bit systems have machine instructions for 64-bit floating point numbers even when thet don t have them for 64-bit int

6385289
int	double
there is two unneccesary conversions first i int is converted to double that s what math.pow takes and then the return value is converted back to 64-bit int long

6385312
int	double
on a 32-bit machine doing addition and comparison on 64-bit int types takes more instructions than doing the equivalent on double s

2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly

submit	submission
why would the button that was used to submit the form be excluded from the form post when remote validation is not called prior to the form submission

6386726
width	margin
if your aim is to get a dynamic margin then you have to adjust with this else go for a fixed width page with centered elements and you don t have to worry about overflow problem

6386727
width	height
the significance of half your width and height becoming the new origin is that your view has had it s center moved to 0 0

6386745
width	height
he only animates the margin-left margin-top width and height and sets a higher z-index for the block

he has a fixed width and height for the boxes

6386870
strcpy	strncpy
if you are trying to copy a string data buffer and not just the pointer to that buffer then you are going to have to use a memory copy operation or preferably a standard library function made for such purposes like strcpy or strncpy

6386870
strcpy	strncpy
the value of rowsize will have to be big enough to hold your largest string plus a terminating null otherwise the copy will be truncated using strncpy or the data will overflow the array bounds and will write-over something else you don t want it to if you use strcpy

many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
as i explained in this post a many-to-many association cannot have a payload e.g eventid and if thatâ s the case then we have to break it down to two one-to-many associations to an intervening class and i can see youâ ve correctly created this class userlike to represent the extra information attached to your self-referencing many-to-many association but the associations from this intermediate class are not correct as we need to define exactly 2 many-to-one association from userlike to user like i showed in the following object model

base-class	subclassing
so in your case i think it would be more correct and more understandable to look at your document entity as being a base-class of which link and article are subclassing

6395136
getter	setter
self.propertyname is sending the object a message asking it for the value of propertyname which means it may go through a getter setter etc

the best way to implement this is using ascii codes for achieving this you can simply cast each chars to an int you can use the following code

6396165
x86	mips
it seems like a reasonable task but unfortunately there seem to be clearer tools and instructions to build toolchains for obscure archs like sparc or mips and not a single reasonably updated resource on how to go for x86 the best way

on my website i put the buttons hide free time and show free time

6396303
onfocus	onblur
alternatively you can hook it up in javascript removing the need for your onfocus onblur attributes in your markup - this script will hook the watermark onto the required inputs events directly

6396303
onfocus	onblur
now you can scrap your onfocus onblur attributes in your markup.

6396303
onfocus	onblur
and you ve got repeatable code meaning you don t have to contaminate your markup with onfocus onblur functionality

6396303
onfocus	onblur
then scrap your onfocus onblur attributes as the watermark function will hook it all up for you

6396303
onfocus	onblur
it also attaches to the onblur onfocus properly

6396303
onfocus	onblur
if you go with solution 2 it s a naive solution - if you want multiple handlers for the onblur and or onfocus then that method doesn t attach properly and all other handlers for those events will be replaced with these - so it s not technically a safe approach though in 99.9 of cases it will work just fine

6396334

i m trying to write a contact form however my label widths aren t being forced in firefox or google-chrome - ie seems to be working okay though for once

6396526
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ve only worked matlab and c# the other way around calling matlab from c# but it looks to me like the problem is that you have an iqueryable instance instead of an ienumerable in your code

6396536
width	height
problem is i get this error even though the system.out.println shows the width and height to be 640x480

6396571
submit	submission
i fathomed there might be some funny special characters or something causing this to happen in the copied contents even though there isn t - but if you copy-paste it then delete everything up until the first word biog then submit so you are literally submission one line the same thing still happens

6396571
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my browser latest google-chrome dev on mac os x snow leopard - tried in safari and firefox same problem

6396653
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
beware that it is not supported by some browsers people actually use and on other browsers microsoft s sigh it requires using a special object xdomainrequest rather than the standard xmlhttprequest that jquery uses

6396653
post	get
json-p is only for get though not post again because it works via script tags

6396653
post	get
it will contain the various headers it would send with the get or post as well as the headers origin access-control-request-method get or post and access-control-request-headers the headers it wants to send

6396653
post	get
the browser will look at your response and see whether it s allowed to send you the actual get or post

6396666
inherited	properties
ok you add new properties to the inherited viewmodel then you can bind to them

6396693
bmp	png
if i register my extension via shellex bb2e617c-0920-11d1-9a0b-00c04fc2d6c1 and unregister shimgvw.dll via regsvr32 u shimgvw.dll my thumbnail handler extension works but this creates a problem shimgvw.dll also handles thumbnails for several common image formats like bmp jpg png etc so after unregistering it support for these formats gets disabled

6396700
stateless	stateful
you can also use ejbs stateful or stateless

6396728
folder	directory
another option to create page- or model-specific files you could create directory inside your assets javascripts folder

6396734
filtering	grouping
you cannot do it within the statement itself however you can filtering the rollup set excluding the intermediate rollups where any one but not all rows are being grouping

6396762
requestfactory	gwt
the question with such requirement do you think we should follow the standard data centric way of generated roo + gwt which uses requestfactory

6396780
hash	salt
the user s password is then re-hashed with a new random salt and the original hash stored in the database is overwritten

6396825
put	get
you might want to put those code in onresume so it always get called when the main activity is brought back from the stack

6396839
super	self
one final point you will often see super childclass self .method where childclass is some arbitrary child class being used instead of a call to the baseclass method explicitly

6396839
super	self
discussion of super is a whole other question but suffice it to say in these cases it s typically being used to do exactly what is being done by calling baseclass.method self

6396855
submit	submission
the problem is the ajax submit is submission the whole page including the html.beginform at in the main view and not performing the asynchronous post with the note

6396876
range	minimum
next you find the scalar range - the minimum and maximum values in your desired output image using the brightness and contrast

6396876
range	minimum
now since we know the brightness and contrast we can setup the lut with the lower value range 0 mapping to minimum and the upper value range 1 mapping to maximum

6396877
persistent	transient
apart from using jpql i can think of one other method - which i dislike immensely i suppose i could have exposed z as an transient property in x as to prevent openjpa from persistent it as a column but that sounds like a really bad idea i am essentially flattening out an object graph manually and introduce unneeded garbage inside the entity bean not counting the time needed to flatten out a complex graph or the error-proness of this it can go awry in so many ways

6396896
hash	salt
from what i hear it is good to use the given password and a random salt and then store the hash password and salt together

6396896
hash	salt
i mean the reason to hash a password is because if someone get into your database they don t have the plain passwords and the salt make it much much harder to reverse the hash to get the password but but if i store the hash with the password what is the point of the salt my knowledge on hashing is every limited so i could be completely off base with my thinking

6396942
salt	md5
generate the salt for every user from some other information md5 of the user-id

6396942
hash	salt
even when the salt is known it will render rainbow table attacks useless or a lot more unlikely so you should always use a salt even when storing the salt right next to the hash linux for example does store the user passwords in the shadow file in a form of id salt hash

6396943
salt	md5
a few security exploits that have occurred this year were because the web application s database contained passwords without a salt and they were done with md5

6396966
opera	google-chrome
it works fine in ie google-chrome and opera

6397030

in both child projects i put the jar in the manifest.mf classpath and both projects have ear libraries on their build path

i m currently trying and failing to get the .clearfix after clearing fix that is detailed on stack here and on position is everything here to work in google-chrome and firefox

6397200
hash	salt
the only difference i can see here is that the salt hash in the database would change regularly

6397200
hash	salt
but when one of the hash is broken you found a password which together with the salt gives the given hash it most probably is the original password and it will continue to work even if the salt and hash in the database changes later

6397201
post	put
i am not sure if you want to display the cards like you wrote at the beginning of your post - or if you want to put them into an array to do something else

6397270
filtering	grouping
i am looking to create a google charts api dashboard with filtering but i would like to chart the data based on grouping data

6397270
filtering	grouping
in other words the filtering should act on the original datatable but the charts should be based on a grouping datatable

6397270
filtering	grouping
however i cannot seem to bind the filtering to the larger datatable update the grouping table and then draw the charts based on the grouping table

6397280
client-side	server-side
if validation is being performed on the client-side already then i would add any server-side validation in the business layer

np-hard	np-complete
to answer this question you first need to understand which np-hard problems are also np-complete

6397413
np-hard	np-complete
if an np-hard problem belongs to set np then it is np-complete

6397479
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
it works fine without a slideup slidedown or fadein fadeout animation attached to it but once i add the animation it will slidedown then slideup really quickly so somehow i m contradicting myself in the script or not seperating functionality correctly

6397479
hide	show
all i m trying to do is have it slideup down instead of instant hide show

6397484
np-hard	np-complete
to answer the rest of question you first need to understand which np-hard problems are also np-complete

6397484
np-hard	np-complete
if an np-hard problem belongs to set np then it is np-complete

6397526
jar	war
in my experience the only time to place a jar into tomcat s lib folder instead of the war file is when your code references some library by interface and you won t know the underlying implementation until deployment time

6397526
jar	war
in that case i packaged the jms interface jar into the war file and then at deployment time i placed either the activemq or the websphere mq implementation jar into tomcat lib

6397526
jar	war
i thought this was easier than managing multiple war file build variants each bundling a different jms provider jar

6397527
apache	nginx
to add on to this since you also ask about running in apache or other web servers you may want to check out these tutorials about deploying your new sinatra-based application to apache or nginx

6397527
apache	nginx
note both tutorials cover running sinatra via passenger -- don t be put off by the modrails name which i have had good luck with in deploying apps under apache and nginx

dr my basic question is should i be writing scenarios for critical functionality like sorting and filtering even if they are already provided by an external library and i have tested my application s integration with that library

6397641
equals	tostring
overriding gethash tostring equals operator

6397709
swt	swing
your code is using swt but jinternalframe is coming from swing toolkit

6397709
swt	swing
swt and swing are two completely different ways how to code ui in java

6397709
swt	swing
there are some possibilities about how to integrate swt and swing but i am afraid that you cannot just convert swt window into jinternalframe

6397733
equals	gethashcode
and so no gethashcode equals and operators overriding is needed

6397755

mdpi	hdpi
if your background image is somewhat uniform in texture consider using a single 9-patch image instead of using multiple images for ldpi mdpi hdpi

mdpi	hdpi
using 9-patch images also takes care of differing aspect-ratios for each of ldpi mdpi hdpi

use ord to convert each chars to an int value its ordinal value and then xor each chars together using the bitwise operator

6399221
put	get
then the text is written by javascript into a div on the page and is also sent via get to php and by php is put into a mysql database

6399280
put	get
the view controller should get your data from the model and put it in the view

pop-up	dialog
pressing the app store install button on my ipad 2 pop-up a dialog saying it can t be installed due to the lack of autofocus

6399672
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in google-chrome and in firefox

6399687

g++	gcc
edit i compiled this as just g++ source.cpp -o1 2 3 under cygwin using gcc 4.5.0

6399836

try using settimeout function delayinmilliseconds instead of setinterval

6399836

6399851
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i am just looking at some old code of mine and i have an action-filter onactionexecuting method

6399867

6399884
inherited	properties
i thought about making another class that inherited from my data object and add the attribute to the new class s field but then i have to hide the base class s properties

6399898
g++	gcc	typedef	struct	typedef	typename
but not with an unnamed struct in which case the code was rejected in g++ 4.2 4.6 with error missing typename in typedef-declaration gcc 4.2 4.6 gave a warning warning unnamed struct union that defines no instances clang++ warning declaration does not declare anything comeau error declaration requires a typedef name

6399910
google-chrome	safari
there s a reason safari has an unblemished record for the last 4 years running as the first browser to fall at pwn2own. google-chrome also has depending on what source you want to believe between 2.5 to 6 times the market share that safari does

6399910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m not kidding about the security aspect either one security expert i happen to know with a published textbook on how to do security testing has said the only good use for safari is to download firefox or google-chrome

6399937

newer hardware has processors cores shaders inside the video card which differ from your cpu in that they each run much slower but there are many more of them working in parallel

6400085
int	chars
variables of value types most built-in types like int chars bool as well as structs will normally have their memory reclaimed immediately when a function returns since they are allocated on the stack which means they are part of the data structure that gets created when a function begins execution and is freed when the function returns

6400122
restrict	shared
if you re on a shared host usually the host may restrict access to command line

my horizontal navigation bar is working fine with google-chrome opera mozilla even ie8 but it s not working on ie6

6400261

6400286
portrait	landscape
seems like the keyboard is still in landscape mode even though the phone is in portrait mode

6400289

although this won t tell you the exact resolution your testing you can use the zoom tool in google-chrome or firefox to zoom out

6400439
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works quite fine in firefox google-chrome ie but it seems to fail in safari

6400449

6400479
button	checkbox
i want to be able to pass whether or not these checkbox are checked to a service when the submit button is pressed

6400518
for-loop	loops
if you use pre-incrementation for example in a for-loop with ++j then you are basically saying make a copy of the value of j for use in loops then increment j then go through the statements in loops with the copy of j. if you are using post-incrementation in the same loops j++ then you are basically saying make a copy of the value of j for use in loops then go through the statements in loops with the copy of j then increment j.

6400606
int	double
for subtotal it s supposed to be double instead of int but i m not sure how to parse string into a double

6400622

that said you can use aspect oriented programming aop to get a pointcut that captures the execution of visitprogram and in theory you can put your breakpoint in the pointcut

6400623
client-side	server-side
it is not possible because client-side script can not interact directly with server-side script therefore it requires you to have a transporter in the between which is ajax

floating-point	integer
is non-negative integral exponentiation is integer exponentiation and is floating-point exponentiation

6400630
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
there are three two-argument exponentiation operations raises any number to a nonnegative integer power raises a fractions number to any integer power and takes two floating-point arguments

int	chars
the compiler implicitly converts the int to chars

6400781
int	chars
the chars is handled internally by the machine itself most likely for simple types like int

6400789
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 12.0.742.100 too although not as bad as firefox

6400794
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

int	chars
the value of an int chars constant

6400794
int	chars
numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int

6400794
int	chars
as you can see since the type of a chars constant is int for sizeof a we get sizeof int which is 4 on your platform

6400794
int	chars
so the int that is a is implicitly converted to a chars

6400794
int	chars
there s an example in there as well showing explicitly that int s can be implicitly converted to chars

maven	pom.xml
i was wondering whether i can add aspect j to a maven project because there doesn t seem to be a public repository for it to be added to pom.xml

6401597
src	attr
you need to use attr src to get the src attribute and then compare it to your roz value

6401600
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
you don t say which java ee app server you intend to use glassfish jboss weblogic etc. i d also recommend looking at the tutorials for your particular vendor

6401605
serializable	deserialization
the rest of the serializable deserialization you will have to do yourself via writing the soap header and body with custom code and skipping your xml reader ahead to your content respectively

6401607
versioning	upgrade
in macos x this is similar to windows only that there s no separation between opengl interface and driver client that s the reason why macos x is so slow to keep up with new opengl versioning it always requires a full operating system upgrade to deliver the new framework

6401640
interpolation	splines
in essence the first time the function is called it should compute a whole bunch of values for a range of x since it will be integrated over anyway and then interpolation that one with splines and cache the coefficients somehow possibly in a file for further use

6401660
haskell	ocaml
in pure functional languages haskell this is not allowed and you have to use monads but most of the impure functional languages f# ocaml allow this

6401716
queue	fifo
i would like to implement some kind of queue or fifo class that keeps all the data

6401754
implements	extends
you can just implements valueof no need to extends number to do it

6401820
superclass	subclassing
but it seems that when a subclassing marks a parameter section implicit it is no longer considered to override the method in the superclass

6401826
hex	binary
-like haskell binary compiled with ghc in a hex editor

6401833
inline	inlining
code can be inline within packages however inlining never occurs across

6401844
getter	setter
it s not how you re supposed to use dot notation and you should never do something very complicated in your getter and setter and they should never do anything to your object except lazily initializing it but there are no hard barriers in place to prevent you from doing this kind of stuff

6401844
getter	setter
it s up to the implementor of getter and setter methods which are the only methods supposed to be called via dot notation to ensure this kind of frivolity does not happen but there s nothing stopping the caller of a method to call destrucitve methods that weren t intended to be used that way via dot notation

6401850
treeview	checkboxlist
i have a checkboxlist in asp.net which i d like to convert to a treeview using something like jstree

6401854
qsort	memcmp
sort it in lexicographical order so your comparator for qsort just calls memcmp left right 17

6401907
glfw	glew
i recomment glfw for window context creation it deals with all that proxy context stuff too and glee or glew to make the opengl extensions available to the code

6401925
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
anyways making a uinavigationcontroller with a uitabbarcontroller used to be straight forward for me using the interface builder now i cant find the correct attributes

6401949
awt	swing
is there a constant problem in using awt components on swing components

6401986
width	height
i am trying to create background images with rounded corners and rough edges of variable width and height for several divs of different width height

6401986
width	height
these sections would correspond to the size of the corners and would each have a background url of the image of the corners 3 rotated or would be of varying width or height for the side sections 20px by whatever

6401986
width	height
if the width height of these divs is longer than 200px then the background image would be repeated

6401995
range	minimum	range	max	minimum	max
i ve also seen the solution that is to get sql to get a random row between a minimum maximum range like so floor max needed_id rand but this would only work when the rows are sequential 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

6402014
ant	jdk6
build the copied project using jdk6 by invoking ant thus getting a jdk6-compliant jar

6402086
post	get
i am pulling the source code of a webpage using net http and i was wondering if there was anyway to parse out the get and post parameters so that they can be listed

6402087
ssl	https
now when i m trying to access this service online get an error to create endpoint but i can t figure our how to create endpoint especially when wcf address is ssl https enabled website

6402108
inherited	subclassing
i could have subclassing the zend_controller_action into some base controller with all the shared code which all other controllers can inherited from but as far as i know it s not the best practice to do

6402112
ceil	floor
you do not need to run integers through floating-point ceil and floor methods

6402136
width	height
1 re-size images to a maximum width and height on client size

6402166
noexcept	decltype
new keywords alignas alignof char16_t char32_t constexpr decltype noexcept nullptr static_assert and thread_local

6402166
integer	unsigned
certain integer literals larger than can be represented by long could change from an unsigned integer type to signed long long

6402166
int	double
for example the following code is valid in c++ 2003 but invalid in this international standard because double to int is a narrowing conversion

6402175
background-color	transparency
if you need to get it working on multiple different background colors requiring you to have transparency inside and outside of the border-image then you can create an element behind the current element which is within the borders and assign the background-color there

if the solution is to write my own httpmodule or httphandler to handle my upload how can i get this installed on my azure servers

6402253
post	put
it works but i can t use it with swfupload since it uses the http post verb and not the http put verb that the azure blob storage expects when creating a new blob item

6402253
put	get
anyone know how to get around this without making my own custom silverlight or flash client component that uses the http put verb

6402253
post	put
for those interested in the client code that wont work since swfupload uses http post and not put as azure blob storage expects

6402253
post	get	post	put	put	get
i figured since swfupload is open source that i download the source and change the verb from post to put sadly the flash player urlrequestmethod does not support other verbs than get and post

6402253
put	get
i ve read that silverlight 3 and later supports the http put verb so i think i have to write some silverlight code to get my way here

6402253
put	get
since silverlight supports both the http put verb that azure blob storage requires and supports progressive uploads i now have the possibility to upload massive files directly to the azure blob storage and i don t have to go throgh a asp.net solution i also get some nice progress bars and the user can cancel in the middle of the upload if he she wants to

6402254
superclass	subclassing
because there is nothing to override you re implements an interface not subclassing from a superclass which already has definition for that method

6402261
width	height
so if it sticks to left or right side of a screen - it should have maximal height and fixed width

6402261
width	height
if it sticks to top or bottom side - it should have a fixed height and maximized width 100 of a screen width

6402261

6402282
google-chrome	firefox
extremely slow i think the google-chrome firefox remote drivers are faster than it

6402291

6402314
openkm	alfresco
considered alfresco openkm and knowledgetree

6402329
post	get
get and post parameters are in the http header not the html source

6402329
post	get
however any get or post parameters would have been sent by your net http code so you can print those out yourself

6402358
macports	homebrew
you could also switch from macports to homebrew then all your open-source software lives under usr local and you don t get into this sort of problem

6402360
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in ie 9 but not in google-chrome nor in firefox - both just empty the bar div

6402360

6402360
google-chrome	firefox
any idea how to get google-chrome and firefox to change bar div as well

6402388
versioning	upgrade
try contacting your shard hosting provider and ask them to upgrade to the latest php 5.3 versioning

6402403

6402458
width	height
also considering your response in some of the comments - the hidden selector will only find elements that are display none or a width and height of 0 and input hidden but that doesn t apply to ul li .

6402462
vb.net	vb6
realize the differences between vb.net and vb6 and prepare to learn some more object-oriented programming

6402483
fadein	hide
from the comments it seems like this is just a misunderstanding fadein won t have an effect on an already 100 visible element you need to hide the element first something like this

6402538
elf	coff
you can use a custom makefile setup.hs hook and invoke windres if you re on windows or objcopy elfrc if you re on linux to compile resources to coff elf objects which you can then combine with your haskell object files to form the final executable

6402604
cos	sin
therefore sin kal and cos kal are not necessarily equal to 1 or 0 respectively

6402604
cos	sin
to get better precision from sin and cos i suggest the following

6402604
cos	sin
second invoke sinl and cosl instead of sin and cos

6402612
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton is a subclass of uicontrol which is a subclass of uiview

6402769
config	ini
use the configparser class to read config files in the ini file format

6402770
mpfr	mpc
the standard choice of library for c is gmp which has all of those features but if you have specific correctness requirements for floats you may need the additional mpfr library and finally there is also mpc to do the same for complex numbers

6402777
querypath	phpquery
but if you want to actually fetch content from real-world html then it s easier to use a dom parser like phpquery or querypath for simplicity

6402810

i have installed both cakephp and codeigniter and it seems that codeigniter is much smaller a little less overwhelming and documentation is clearer

6403035
codeigniter	cakephp
are there other things that could be considered somewhat harder in cakephp than codeigniter for learning to work with the framework

6403035
codeigniter	cakephp
why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc

6403069
cpu	processors
i think because the android device has a different processors architecture than your pc so the cpu on your pc needs to emulate the android so it would do much more processing

6403084
post	get
also note that while technically not forbidden an entity body on a get is not standard and there are many products that do not handle it properly so you d wind up abusing post or another method to accomplish this

6403090

6403479
rss	feed
i am displaying data from an rss feed including the date

6403484

min	max
unless you are doing some serious date-crunching i don t know of any instance where i would be bumping into the min and max values

6403519
width	height
the width of the image is size.width and the height is size.height

6403519
cgpoint	cgrect
if that doesn t work my advice is to create cgpoint cgrect etc for every intermediate value to make all of your calculations explicit

6403560
width	height
or you can compare other things like width height etc

6403598
post	get	post	put	put	get
i have added a custom action filter in my mvc app which checks for option requests and responds with an allow header specifying get post put delete although it never seems to do a follow up post request.

6403619
mdpi	hdpi
besides the parameters i ve also created drawables for ldpi mdpi and hdpi

6403714
hash	md5
this would pick the first two character from an md5 hash 00 - ff 256 subdirectories to generate the subdirectory

6403725
xlib	xcb
this is one among the reasons why xcb was created in the first place fix the problems of xlib

6403725
xlib	xcb
however there is a xlib wrapping around xcb and one can safely use that to interface with glx and still use xcb for the rest of the program

6403738

accessor	properties
if you re making the connections in code you need to add properties or other suitable accessor methods so that the code in one class can get at the necessary object instances in the other

6403787
post	get
you do not need to pass variables in a get or post like way when including or requiring files the variables are shared between the files as long as the values are set before the including happens

6403792
post	get
this value is always set when handling an http request and will be get post head etc.

move	drag
when i drag the scrollmenu with the finger and i stop my finger held down the cclayer in background is not updated anymore and the sprites does not move

6404080
post	get
in this case the users will have to use easyxdm or create their own proxy -- by proxy here i mean users will have to write some code on their backend that can communicate with your api such that a post request will go directly to your server and a get response will get from their own proxy

6404094
strtol	atoi
strtol can be a better atoi specifically w.r.t

6404475
gif	png
base64 followed by the base-64 encoded file replacing png with whatever is appropriate gif jpeg

6404476
width	height
i will be grabbing the width of the parent div with jquery but i need to work out the math to automatically work out the height size

6404480
youtube	vimeo
this works but when i try clicking a video like youtube or vimeo from within the web view it opens on top of the view controller

6404489

6406695

6406947
git-rebase	undo

rss	feed
ultimately the answer to this question depends on what type of information is at the other end of the rss feed

therefore a stateful or stateless session bean does not have to be coded as reentrant

6407859
stateless	stateful

anyways one way to handle out-of-memory errors can be the creation of a php script that only imlements your internal for-loop and then call an php exec inside the biggest loops

put	get
and the next thing to remember is to put the const declaration after the pointer or else you will get warnings of discard qualifiers from pointer in most uses

6415758
clang	llvm
or you could use clang llvm instead of gcc which probably won t have the bug you described and if supplied via apple s developer tools should be able to compile universal binaries directly

6415821
width	height
for instance you can see here that although i m telling it to manage an area of width by height it throws an exception unless the byte array is actually double the width by double the height

6415821
width	height
note that width and height are the dimensions of my canvas 256x256 so this operation should take up the entire canvas s area

6416548
min	max
additional calculations average pareto maximum max min values trend lines ...

6416637
ienumerable	iqueryable
for the last you can have combined approach where you have methods returning ienumerable for most common scenarios queries used more often and one method exposing iqueryable for rare or complex dynamically build queries

6416637
ienumerable	iqueryable
when you expose iqueryable you must keep your context alive until you execute the query - iqueryable uses deferred execution in the same way as ienumerable so unless you call tolist first or other functions executing your query you still need your context alive

6416788
equals	toarray
as soon as you call contains containsall equals hashcode remove retainall size or toarray you d have to traverse the elements anyway

6416801

if you don t dispose it meaning it s disposed when a application exits it is no problem to return ienumerable iqueryable no having actual data

6416862
implements	extends
it s ok to change how it is implements in general as long as you don t have to change it whenever you want to extends derive from the class

6416868

i search in the hex dump of a binary file

6416889
vim	notepad++
i have been told from recent posting that regex is the way to go but i m unfamiliar with it and do not know what to use notepad++ vim word or anything else

6416891
implements	sealed	implements	extends
since they are sealed i cannot extends them to say provide extra functionality that doesn t belong in the server or implements an interface

6416891
implements	extends
i can however extends the functionality of these classes by implements the defined partial methods and adding extra properties to the other partial class

6416899
width	height
it looks like cycle stores the slide container element s width and height once when you first call it and then sets the incoming slide to those dimensions no matter what your resize script is doing

6416929

6417105
backbone.js	zepto
backbone.js is reliant on jquery or zepto and underscore.js which use the and _ as their special variables

6417136

those canvas elements use the size of your placeholder when plot is called to set their own width and height

6417143
hash	salt
i want one of the functions to return the hash byte and the random salt byte that was generated for use with the hash

6417143
hash	salt
i have a c# version of this that works by returning the hash and then passing back the salt as an out parameter which works perfectly however java doesn t give me the luxury of out parameters

6417145
width	height
the width and height of the source image are filled in correctly in the pixel bender toolkit but when i run this shader as a filter in flash player 10 the srcsize value is not automatically filled in

6417161
hash	salt
the most elegant way is of course to encapsulate the hash and salt in a class and return an instance of this class

6417170
hash	salt
a straightforward way of doing this is a small struct that contains the hash and the salt in the struct

6417178
hash	salt
you would have to create an object that had the hash byte and salt byte as two instance variables

6417195
hash	salt
if you re using project lombok you can use the data annotation to create a value class that encapsulates hash + salt and the lombok-ifier will automatically generate the boilerplate code

6417206
cpython	pypy
without changing your code you could try using the pypy version of python with just-in-time compilation -- it might run your code way faster than normal cpython

6417391
width	height
if you remove width and height from the canvas that seems to shift the content

6417392
iboutlet	ibaction
the best practice for a uiview is to communicate with the viewcontroller using targets that can be defined from the viewcontroller by using ibaction for methods and iboutlet for variables

6417392
iboutlet	ibaction
whenever the user makes any event with the view it can alert the controller through these ibaction and the controller can talk to the view using the iboutlet

6417393
children	parent
sync requires you to list tables in each scope in insert order so that all foreign key parent are in place before any foreign key children are inserted

qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i can get around this by having the derived items cast the qgraphicsitem returned by qgraphicsscene itemat using dynamic_cast but i don t really understand why that works and not qobject_cast or the benefits or disadvantages to using dynamic_cast vs

width	height
you might have luck treating it as a 1-component width height texture and a 2-component width 2 height 2 texture

6434640
post	get
i m not sure but i guess the fastest way to get an answer is to search the pygtk mailing list and if you cant find a similar post try posting it to the mailing list

6434661
cakephp	kohana
if you re using a specific framework cakephp kohana then this definitely changes things...like i said not enough info to go on right away

6434664

also i came to know that it requires sdk and wtl atl so please help me regarding the same

6434812
width	height
you d have to figure out where the upper left corner top and left is and how big width and height you want the clipping rectangle to be

6434848
int	chars
the c variable should be an int rather than a chars since it has to be able to hold all chars plus an eof indicator

6434893
maven	pom.xml
since you are using maven you just need to put the jdbc driver as a dependency in your pom.xml file

6434893
jar	.war
if it s a web application you ll need to package the driver jar in your .war .ear .sar the maven assembly plugin can do this or include it in the . lib folder of the application container and declare it as scope provided in maven

6434923
kindle	nook
i actually want to develop an android app which can be used to read aloud the words from apps like kindle nook etc

6434928
updatepanel	scriptmanager
to answer your question one way to do it is as answered before me to add an updatepanel and set visibility to false but then you would also require a scriptmanager and if you have other controls in the same page such as a fileupload control that will not work properly with the presence of a scriptmanager

6434929
versioning	upgrade
but don t dismantle or upgrade the old usr bin versioning

6434934
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
i mostly accomplished this by setting the maximum and minimum width height of both the mainwindow and view to the same thing and this works most of the time but on some smaller levels mainwindow only shrinks in one dimension and leaves a white margin on one side like so

6434954
profiling	benchmarking
for benchmarking you can use profiling or timeit module

6434962
versioning	upgrade
that gives you complete control over which versioning of everything are used and when everything gets upgrade

6434964
width	height
so to have a starting position of 30 45 corresponding to startx and starty with the width and height 130x120

my classes for deserialization they have public getter setter which i am not printing are listed below

6435072
google-chrome	firefox
so this code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but doesn t in ie

6435074
unsigned	short
cast it to unsigned assuming you ve got the usual convention of 0 darkest 255 brightest then cast it to signed short i assume that s what you want since plain short is by default signed

6435078
children	parent
i need it to be ordered primarily by its id but if its parent_id does not equal its id it is placed after its parent and also these children would ordered by id

6435131
int	chars
1 i am perfectly aware of c++ unsigned chars ranges and i can t change them to int

6435142
viewdidload	dealloc
my personal preference is for ojbects created by init they are freed by dealloc for objects created by viewdidload they are freed by viewdidunload

6435150
post	get
there s no need to use a separate library to coax json out of asp.net services long as you re okay with using post requests and no get requests

6435192
geocoding	geocode
if you don t want to use the android geocode object google also provides a geocoding web service which offers a rest interface that can respond in json and xml formats

6435193
viewdidload	viewwillappear
can i pass a parameter to viewdidload or viewwillappear

6435400
clang	llvm
i m using llvm clang 2.9 on mac os x x86_64 if that matters

6435406
decltype	auto
where auto isn t feasible you can use decltype to express types semantically as contracts based on expressions

6435410
put	get
one good way to narrow down the requirements for the design of any resource is to imagine that a get to its uri will send the exact same representation to the client that a client would put to that uri and vice-versa

6435414
postgresql	mysql
even with activerecord sitting as an abstraction layer between you and your database there will be differences between mysql and sqlite and postgresql and some of them will be subtle and the correct time for them to bite you is in the development and test environments not production

6435438
postgresql	mysql
mysql and sqlite are pretty loose with their type conversions postgresql is strict

6435438
postgresql	mysql
mysql will often silently truncate strings whereas postgresql will complain

6435438
postgresql	mysql
mysql and sqlite will allow you to have things in your select that aren t in a group by but postgresql will complain

6435438
postgresql	mysql
spend some time searching for things like it worked fine until i deployed to heroku or even just the tags heroku postgresql and you ll find lots of examples of people that got into trouble by developing on top of mysql or sqlite but deploying on postgresql

6435445
google-chrome	firefox
the treeview takes 40 sec to load on ie7 8 while same page takes 1 10th time on firefox and google-chrome

6435468
cpu	processors
your standard cpu has to do a lot more different calculation and processing types that what graphics processors do so they can t be optimized in a similar manner

6435523
put	get
you d need to put the php code in a separate page and use an ajax request to get the result

6435624
tcpdf	fpdf
this is just a quick review of how fpdf stands up against tcpdf in the area of performance at each libraries most basic functions

6435628
ienumerable	iqueryable

6435677
google-chrome	firefox
now this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but generate an error in ie

6435695

6436084
switching	screens
is it allowed to switching to different screens like popviewcontroller pushviewcontroller when we tap the segments of segmented control

6436088
min	max
although it does not give you min and max x in single query following code may be useful to you

6436125
firefox	safari
i would say this is happening because safari is rounding the 39.666 up whilst firefox is rounding it down

6436145
hide	show
one way is hide the button from javascript and show some ajax loader image

6436190
pull	push
since you have tagged it with github have you added the public part of your ssh key to their system so that they know who you are and that you are allowed to push pull from that repository

6436194
firefox	safari
while this works fine in desktop browsers like ie firefox the same does not work correctly on the ipad safari

6436235
getter	setter
where did you implement the getter and setter for the property

6436275

6436494
folder	directory
so please provide any custom settings changes that needs to be performed to change the location of these two directory folder

6436526
pull	push
if one of your projects updated the framework you could push just that subrepo and pull it in other projects meaning they could all use the latest version or be locked down to a specific version of the framework

6436530
uiview	subviews
if everything is fine there then please increase the height of your scroll view namely scv and also specify your uiview and the additions of subviews to it through code rather than from interface builder

6436556
sequence	permutation
i d suggest to utilize the permutation parser see here which allows to match a bunch of alternatives in any sequence

6436945
inherited	properties
when i send the list of apartments all is good all properties is on their place but when i receive that list at client side and see what it is in the received object at run time in non public members i saw all the properties that are specific to type that inherited from construction like rooms floor but in result view it shows all properties have the value 0 and not the value with which they were sent

6436957

aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions can be performed on other fields in the group such as sum or avg to collate related data into a single value

6436980
int	chars
first of all you have to change the structure members to unsigned chars or unsigned int otherwise you will loose one bit for representing the sign

6436984

6437383
udp	tcp
first of all is there any problem with using both udp and tcp on the same server

6437427
udp	tcp
yes you can use the same port number for both tcp and udp

6437427
udp	tcp
many protocols already do this for example dns works on udp 53 and tcp 53

6437427
udp	tcp
technically the port pools for each protocol are completely independent but for higher level protocols that can use either tcp or udp it s convention that they default to the same port number

6437427
udp	tcp
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

6437436
width	height
you may modify it to set your height width as you wish

6437480
mediarecorder	audiorecord
for recording take a look at mediarecorder or audiorecord

6437480
mediarecorder	audiorecord
the difference is that mediarecorder records audio and video to .3gp while audiorecord gives you only audio as raw lpcm buffers

6437483

6437601
equals	gethashcode
if is right then i would guess it s because the type column is not compatible with how checks equality - which is based on comparisons through gethashcode and equals - and my guess is that the column type does not implement these

6437602
ubuntu	linux
i m running on ubuntu linux

another error i found in your code is that you are getting the height and width in a wrong way

6437697
ant	maven
btw if you re already used to ant i ve heard that you can call ant tasks from maven somehow don t know how though maybe you could use that somehow

6437701
postgresql	mysql
assuming your database back end supports transactions mysql with innodb postgresql etc then simply wrapping the operation in question in a transaction will solve the problem

i post most of them here since i could never find the real ultimate documentation where i can get the answers

6438250
opera	firefox
now to my question it is fast in opera and firefox but it is painfully slow in internet explorer no surprise so thats why i wonder if there is a way to make my script more efficient in other words perhaps remove some of the for loops etc

6438594
post	get	post	put	put	get
the easiest way to get that done would be to put your json into a hidden input-field and then have the containing form being submitted using post

6438633
postgresql	mysql
for example if you take mysql postgresql mssql and sqlite

6438733
downcasting	upcasting
well they are more or less left out from rtti typeid will return their static type information which usually is useless dynamic_cast will only allow upcasting which can be checked at compile time downcasting will fail at compile-time

6438748
post	get	post	put	put	get
one trick that became popular with ruby on rails is to provide a form using get for any put post delete operation

6438769
unicode	ucs
the result is that your system python 2.5 and local version under usr local are expecting different widths for unicode characters and since unicode functions have the ucs type as part of the name when you are using objects compiled for one python with the other you get undefined errors for the unicode functions

6438784

mockito	jmockit	powermockito	jmockit
i d say the competition is between jmockit and powermockito then mockito

6439134
easymock	jmock
i d leave plain jmock and easymock because they use only proxy cglib and do not use java 5 instrumentation like the newer frameworks

6439134
easymock	jmock
easymock and jmock are based on java.lang.reflect.proxy

6439134
mockito	jmockit	powermockito	jmockit
further it compares between itself jmockit powermockito and mockito in several ways

6439134

tools jmock easymock it does

6439134
mockito	jmockit
jmockit vs mockito

6439134
easymock	jmock
in easymock and jmock the first mocking apis for java the focus was

what i did was copying the files in â œlibâ and â œincludeâ folder form the pre-built.2 directory to my project directory and add this line to mapping.cpp

6439262
int	chars
in java there are only two data types - objects everything that extends class object and primitives int byte chars and so on

6439292
jruby	mri
jruby already removed the gil i am not sure if there was once a gil to begin with but the implementation is not 100 percent compatible with mri mostly because of native gems if you use them jruby does not allow c extensions

folder	directory
it s already added and committed so each directory has its own .svn folder already

6440925
folder	directory
i can t just copy-paste the entire directory over from the gui program s location because then all the .svn folder would be over-written

6440925
folder	directory
the lazy approach is to go into each folder side-by-side and manually just copy over the files for the base directory and every sub-directory therein

6440925
folder	directory
short of just writing a bash script to do this for me is there any svn command that i can use that won t completely break all the nested .svn directory in the already-tracked folder

on the other hand the drag event of the draggable is raised every time the mouse move and seems appropriate for the task

6442481
draggable	droppable
drag is raised whether or not the draggable actually lies over a droppable

6442481
draggable	droppable
one way to solve both problems is to associate the droppable and the draggable in the over handler using jquery s data facility and disassociate them in the out and drop handlers

6442481
draggable	droppable
now that the draggable knows the droppable it s lying over we can update the element s appearance in a drag event handler

filesystems	ntfs
the point is that most filesystems other than ntfs store their filenames in byte -strings

6442667
google-chrome	firefox
this way you can restrict the use of programs to browsers you want if you can t lock down google-chrome and firefox and on a reboot it will clear any changes to the pc basically returning you to a clean state status

6442728
folder	directory
i don t know why you d need to change the folder to applications but your strategy of creating sub web.config files in each child directory is one correct way of achieving this

6442731
post	get
unless you post some code you just get wild guessing here s mine you didn t properly override the method but hide it with a method of the same name and signature

6442754

greenplum is a massively parallel processing database based on postgresql and is designed for analytic data warehouses to manage store and analyze terabytes to petabytes of data

6443061
sysv	systemd
of course you could use nasty slow techniques where every lock and unlock operation require a syscall to emulate robust mutexes on a systemd without proper futex-like robust mutex support using fcntl locking or sysv semaphores both of which have semantics by which automatic and atomic unlocking owner registration could be achieved.

6443066
width	height
you should place the loading animation html in the actual document and use css to make it cover and hide the page positioned absolutely with 100 width and height and a background

6443071
google-chrome	firefox
.html in jquery is an equivalent of innerhtml which means that in normal browsers e.g firefox google-chrome it should get it right while in ie you ll have to use the outerhtml property

6443100
folder	directory
if no solution .sln and or project .csproj file is present then the chances are this is a standard file-system type web site where once loaded only cares about anything and everything under its own root directory as opposed to a web application that does have these files where file and folder paths and more are persisted.

6443114

6443271
getter	setter
yes you can define a getter setter for properties and a shadow function for the function like this

6443283
post	get	post	put	put	get
you ll note we set the content_type header only on a post or put but the general method of adding headers via a request interceptor is used for get as well

6443294
post	get
since this is a get and not a post request it makes an empty uploadimageform and renders it inside upload_template.html

6443330
portrait	landscape
when the phone is oriented in portrait i want m-f 5 columns and when in landscape su-sa 7 columns

6443338
for-loop	arrays
i then tried to use a regular arrays but then a found the length property of an arrays in js doesn t carry over so i couldn t preform a for-loop through all the items because there wasn t anyway of knowing how many elements there were

6443431
ssms	sqlcmd
the easiest way i ve found for executing a large scripts outside ssms from a tool is to use the sqlcmd

6443432

6443485
lxml	libxml2	lxml	beautifulsoup
the html is malformed but i ve seen this error in multiple sites and since the browser is able to display it correctly i m hoping scrapy or the underlying lxml libxml2 beautifulsoup should also parse it correctly

6443517
wan	lan
users on the lan will be treated as remote just like users from the wan will

6443522
put	get
one example could be to use the different language wikipedias - download enough data in each language generate a list of the characters used in the documents with counts and put in a threshold to get rid of small instances of borrowed text from other languages

6443541
int	chars
promotes the result to an unsigned int but in the second example you force it back into an unsigned chars where it overflows back to 0

6443542
inherited	properties
actually i think you simply need to define the class actionlink in css so that it doesn t inherited the properties of the td that s containing it

6443564
union	distinct
sql server will union the results together which is an implied select distinct and then order the results by col1 then col2

6443568
int	chars
in the second program your int is assigned to an unsigned chars which results in truncation of 0x100 to 0x00

6443590
mouseover	mouseout
i m working on a menu which animates each li s padding and color properties on mouseover and mouseout and i wanted to stop the animations and color changes by changing the link s class

6443736
persistent	transient
when you use .saveorupdate hibernate will check if the object is transient it has no identifier property and if so it will make it persistent by generating it the identifier and assigning it to session

6443741
instances	transient
as stated here saveorupdate either saves a transient instances by generating a new identifier or updates reattaches the detached instances associated with its current identifier

width	height
drawtext will then modify your rectangle to the new height and width if necessary

6443818
google-chrome	firefox
i have noticed that css3 performance is unusably worse than javascript when doing a variety of css3 transitions including height or opacity transitions animations in firefox 5+ and google-chrome even the latest specifically on platforms that have nvidia optimus and or intel gma igp graphics - including the latest intel hd 3000

6443818
google-chrome	firefox
i have observed that firefox in particular defaults to using the integrated intel graphics hd 3000 in this case on optimus systems - even when a significantly more powerful nvidia gpu is present and google-chrome seems to be hit-or-miss

6443818
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried forcing firefox and google-chrome to use nvidia in the nvidia control panel but even then it won t take

6443818
google-chrome	firefox
even ios outperforms google-chrome and firefox in css3 transitions

6443825
width	height
you just need to remember to only call the runnable from onsizechanged if the new width and height are greater than 0 and if they are not equal to the old width and height

width	height
i am given a rectangle of some height and width i want to fill this rectangle with some dummy single line text

6444115

jqmodal	blockui
to get more complex - i even use both simultaneously to display an ajax-provided dialog via jqmodal then block it via blockui upon submit to display a custom message

6444837
jqmodal	blockui
one item to note be aware the default z-index for jqmodal is below default for blockui so using them together requires you set blockui basez option higher than jqmodal s default 3000.

if you do simply choose one to apply first say increase first then you can add 2.92 to get the increased amount and then subtract 2.21 from the new amount to get the decreased amount which should be equal to the amount you would find by applying the net weekly monthly change from the annual 9 change

6445313
portrait	landscape
is it possible to have some of the views or layouts in your activity be displayed in landscape orientation and some displayed in portrait orientation

6445313
portrait	landscape
i want one single activity to always have some views fixed in landscape screen orientation not layout orientation and some always fixed in portrait screen orientntation again not layout orientation

6445313
portrait	landscape
i understand that a layout orientation controls whether the views are added vertically or horizontally vertically being stacked top to bottom and horizontally being stacked from left to right but if the screen orientation of the activity landscape the will still all be displayed in landscape orientation and vice-versa for portrait

6445313
portrait	landscape
i also don t want to use two activities one being landscape and transparent and stacked on top of the other one which is portrait since that will make things unnecessarily complex

6445313
portrait	landscape
notice the buttons on the right are displayed in portrait orientation whereas the textviews are still in landscape orientation

min	max
now let s consider there are i elements in the sequence and number of intervals is j we can assume that last interval is s i - t + 1 ...s i where t is positive integer not greater than i so in that case solution is max d i - t j - 1 sum s i - t + 1 ...s i but as we want the solution be minimal we should chose t such to minimize it so we will get min for t 1 to i max d i - t j - 1 sum s i - t + 1 ...s i

if you want to implements the same semantics as extends you have to use dojo.mixin instead of dojo.extend which extends prototypes

6455577
visualvm	jhat	visualvm	oql	oql	jhat
the oql implementation in visualvm is based on the one you can find in jhat and it means that it is javascript based - in addition to standard oql queries it allows you to use plain javascript thus increasing the flexibility many times

6455588
put	get
you need to create a click listener for the button and in that create the intent and put a string extra which you get from the valuetv text

6455650
slideup	slidedown
now if i move the mouse out of the menu and bring it back in before it slides up menu has a lot of items so there is enough time to bring the mouse back in on the menu over the dropdown menu it starts a chain of slidedown and slideup functions and it does not stop till i move the mouse of the menu or back on the button

children	parent
this means that any changes to object state made by the children aren t automatically visible to the parent

6455729
pull	push
but windows users a don t grok ssh and b don t know linux command line environments and want a way either with their ide version control plugins or gui tools or with a cgi page written by me in python to remotely pull a clone giving them effectively a way to push or publish their hg repository up to a central repository without recourse to any ssh access to the remote server system

6455732
post	get
just use regular http get and post

6455754
inherited	properties
the reason why i like this approach is because i inherited from the mydialogviewmodel and provide more properties so that for instance i can display a bunch of options for the user to choose from

6455781
width	height
then you only need to assign the same background image as the others same width and height of the others display block and just change the background position of the image

6455815
put	get
you will need a button listener for your submit button and in its onclick method you will need to put the value in the bundle which can get passed to the next intent

6455837
svg	vml
not to be a pain and sidestep you but - and i say this as a canvas lover - the best charting package i ve used is graphael which uses svg vml and not canvas

6455862
implements	extends
pros simple to implements -- just type extends eventdispatcher and you are done

6455922
setinterval	clearinterval
it is true that setinterval is global but each call to setinterval returns a unique id that you can use to reference it for clearinterval

6455940
maven	m2e
you can access the m2e market place from the preferences preferences maven discovery open catalog

i m trying to get the dimension of image 1.jpg and i d like to check whether image dimension is valid or not before loading and if either width or height of the image is less than or equal to zero pop up a message like image not in correct format

6455982
min	max
if i understand your question correctly this is all you would need to return all rows where the min price is below 250 and the max price is above 250

6456040
children	parent
parent windows are above their children

6456050

superclass	subclassing
i want the xml file to be defined by the subclassing testsomething so that i can use the superclass with other test cases as well

6456087
google-chrome	firefox
it works in the newest versions of google-chrome and firefox 4 but ie9 doesn t have this implemented yet and there s no word on if ie10 will have it either

6456122
public	protected
also since the static initializer will most likely initialize some static fields if these fields are public protected or package-private depending on your javadoc visibility convention you shold add details about the way these fields are initialized based on the behavior of the static initializer

6456133
google-chrome	firefox
this is only an issue for ie tested in ie8 google-chrome and firefox behaves as expected

6456151
put	get
use getgnuwin32 to get all the tools necessary to build the library put them in your path then rerun pip

6456161
post	get
if your not sure how to do this let me know and i ll post some code for you which will get the directions from google and extract the data you need

6456169
hide	show
you can then have a div with this message in it and show or hide it based on this value

6456187
onchange	onkeyup
in addtion onchange occurs when the field loses focus while onkeyup is fired as the user types

6456235
directcast	out
directcast controls lbl i.tostring label is giving out a null value or nothing

6456333
put	get
however if i put doxygen comments in my header files i can t get eclipse to display those comments when i hover the mouse pointer over an instance of the commented method member

6456335
google-chrome	firefox
working fine in google-chrome 12 firefox 5 and ie 9 even with delete cut and paste actions performed in the textareas

6456352
post	get
a get is limited in size for the browser while a post is not

6456414
min	max
i know it should be dead simple but how do i knowing point a and b coordinates min max and selected velocity set x and y velocities to the circle taking into account the direction of the shot

6456452
post	get
however imho i would probably change the xhr from get to post simply to prevent problems with sending long data

6456473
hide	show
for example i have a user control let s call it mycontrol1 and i want to create show and hide javascript functions that can be called from javascript on the parent page - something like mycontrol1.show

6456506
getter	setter
you could create an object with a cookie setter and getter

6456506
getter	setter
more about getter and setter

6456564
gtk	gdk
i m programming in python gdk without gtk simply as a x11 abstraction

6456574
getter	setter
maybe you can let the controls be public or use friend methods to save the getter setter writing

6456590
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the app by running the msi file which will have a higher versioning number than the installed versioning

6456605
nsurl	nsstring
having trouble getting nsstring to convert to nsurl item.image holds the url for an image that im getting through xml

6456621
processors	hyperthreading
if you are talking about a processors with hyperthreading then that processors has extra execution pipelines for most parts of the execution cycle

6456621
cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
a quick test to validate this is to use a computer with hyperthreading spawn off some threads that do processors heavy operations and look at the cpu usage

6456634
post	put
put the asyncfileupload control in an iframe on the page which will post back to just that section

6456695
getter	setter
this viewdata class is a class of getter and setter

6456737
google-chrome	safari
what we found out is that safari and maybe some older versions of google-chrome or other webkit browsers have a problem with facebook s code using the innerhtml js function if your page arrives with an xhtml response header application xhtml+xml

6456740
hide	show
would i need to create another panel inside the container panel for each item they have selected and then hide show based on the active item show as item #1 in the dropdown

6456767
folder	directory
when i try to upload a file to the directory i get the expected login screeen but my login doesn t work and after several tries the page errors out with access to path server path fubar drop folder name filename.txt is denied

6456782
webkit	gecko
for example the bit like gecko is deliberately used to coax servers into sending the same markup as it would for firefox unless the server knows specifically about webkit

6456798
rss	feed
php-created rss feed

6456798
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome show the source code instead of the nice feed view other feeds are shown correctly

6456824
subtract	add
although you will have to add or subtract the length of your string test or abc

6456834
superclass	subclassing
if your xml filename is stored as a static member of your superclass have your subclassing assign the value before generatetestdata is called

6456872
cos	sin
to make things quicker you could calculate cos t and sin t directly

6456907
portrait	landscape
if the phone is in portrait mode and a user starts my app i see my app background appear then it will do an orientation rotation to landscape view because i use setrequestedorientation within my app

6456907
portrait	landscape
i just want a hard switch between portrait and landscape

6456912
ubuntu	linux
the problem seems to be either in eventmachine bundled with latest thin in ruby 1.9.2-r290 or in the linux kernel ubuntu 10.4 lts 2.6.38.3-linode32

6456926
getter	setter
there are certain situations where you might want a view model to combine data from multiple models sources or for specific validation scenarios etc. but it s perfectly acceptable to have your view take a model without an intermediary view model especially if the view model is just a class of getter and setter with no other functionality

6456943
hide	show
so you cant use delay with show and hide

6456959
ubuntu	debian
for example in debian ubuntu you can just install second version from package postgresql-8.4 and postgresql-9.0 and everything works out of the box thanks to postgresql-common

6456964
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is supported in ie 9 firefox 5 and google-chrome 12 but not safari 5 on win 7

6456982
client-side	server-side
i am thinking about writing a web app using knockout.js for the client-side and cakephp for the server-side

6457021
getter	setter
felix king s answer is right on i just wanted to point out that there is an alternate syntax for defining setter and getter in ecmascript 5

6457029
put	get
just an idea but if you want to create a unique directory name for each ua just put the ua through md5 and get something like

6457041
google-chrome	firefox
i m ok with running google-chrome or firefox with specific options or opening permissions in some other way

6457076
inherited	properties
all the properties and methods of the parent class is inherited in the child class so theoretically you can access them in the child class but beware using the protected keyword in your class because it throws a fatal error when used in the child class

6457104
mouse	keyboard
it s a little annoying but you need to right click on the element and then keeping your mouse over the link use your keyboard select the inspect element link and press enter

6457115
width	height
if you meant the actual size of the li element then you can change that as normal with width and height

6457117
put	get
what do i put in the contract name to get it to actually work

6457170
pop-up	dialog
what i mean by fails is that typically when you execute the exporttopdf method a dialog box pop-up with the name of the pdf file it s size and whether you want to open it or save it

6457198
converter	multibinding
another way to do this is using a multibinding and converter on the button you want to enable disable

6457198
converter	multibinding
while this approach does work i tend to agree with the other answers in that you should use commands when possible over multibinding and converter

6457220
mouseup	mousedown
my button handler gets called twice - once for mousedown touchstart and a second time for mouseup touchend

6457220
mouseup	mousedown
examining the event objects passed to the handler in chrome devtools i can see that they re both simulated tap events the first originating from mousedown and the second from mouseup

6457245
junit	mockito
i m learning mockito at the moment and one of the things i m doing to consolidate my learning is converting an old junit test from using a hand rolled mock class to one which uses mockito mocks instead

6457261
width	height
add a meta tag that sets the height and width to the device-height device-width you can allow the user to zoom by changing the maximum-scale to something above 1 however zoom is disabled in the following example i believe mobile safari allows a value up to 10

6457261
width	height
viewport.attr content height device-width width device-height initial-scale 1.0 maximum-scale 1.0

6457261
width	height
viewport.attr content height device-height width device-width initial-scale 1.0 maximum-scale 1.0

6457261
width	height
the if then statement in the event handler checks for which orientation the user has changed to 90 -90 and 270 are all values i ve seen for landscape and the lines just switch the height and width values in the viewport tag

6457262
versioning	upgrade
i also only have leopard installed as the company i work for does not wish to purchase an upgrade so close to a new versioning being released

6457265
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly in ie7 google-chrome and opera and i think in firefox 2 but not in firefox 4

6457265
opera	google-chrome
comparing to google-chrome and opera and ie7 the offsetwidth of the cells are a mixture of 44 and 43 pixels but adding up to the correct final width of 1311

6457266
post	get
specifically i d like to post some json to the server and get json back so my code looks like this

6457275
put	get
should i put like more methods in the service class which interact with the entities which would get the user and check everything for log in action get parent if needed and then just return the log in result to run method

6457276
pull	push
you can either periodically check the tasks for changes or use push pull notifications in case of exchange 2010 there are also streaming notifications available

6457294
addition	multiplication
the fact that the multiplication comes before the addition is irrelevant

6457385
printf	strtod	cos	sin	cos	exp
my program have reading of full precision values with strtod doing a lot of different operations on them like +- sin cos exp and other from and printf -ing of them

6457385
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
support for additional types includes the arithmetic operators add subtract multiplying divide

6457420
hide	show
if you want to hide the form if js is not supported why not hide it by default and then show it using javascript

6457443
postgresql	mysql
pick an open source databases either mysql or postgresql dependant upon which your team is most familiar with and how it integrates into the rest of your infrastructure stack

6457476
gridbaglayout	miglayout
you could use gridbaglayout or the non-standard miglayout if you want to code the gui by hand

6457490
squash	merge	squash	branch
so i have a local git topic branch vacation which i need to merge back into master to dcommit but i don t want to squash all the commits into one big one

6457529
submit	submission
that this would mean you d have to say yes when the app store submission process asks if your app includes encryption meaning extra paperwork and time before you could submit the app

6457565
inherited	properties
the issue is that i was using reflection for the looping on all the properties and this will cause a problem when you do this piece of code and you are using some inherited

6457571
public	protected
if you are attempting to keep others from taking advantage of your classes resources you can leave the modifier off private public protected which will make the class package protected the default when no modifier is present

6457591
cout	ofstream
if i m writing to the terminal i will use the std cout object whereas if i m writing to a file i ll create and use a std ofstream object

6457591
std	ostream	cout	ofstream
since both std cout and std ofstream objects inherit from the std ostream class i figured i would create a sort of print_output function that accepts a std ostream object

6457627
stdout	stderr
if you are sure the output is coming out on stdout via the print statement replace stderr with stdout

6457669
config	ini
however if i do not try to change the script the default layout layout.phtml is working fine set in my ini config

6457704
post	get
it is confusing to understand why there are multiple methods like load get post ..is the diff only like .ajax is general way of writing and others being specific based on type.

6457711
opensso	openam
we are looking to use openam opensso to act as a sso provider

6457760
post	get
get and post make get and post requests respectively which is useful if you are building a restful service

6457760
post	get
edit i actually don t see get and post methods on the ajax object

6457772
google-chrome	firefox
i have a bit of a problem with streaming mp3s in ie and google-chrome it works fine in firefox

6457772
mp3	wav
the web app streams the wav file by converting it on the fly to mp3 using lame not great but we have to do it is this way because of limitations of asterisk and then outputs the content as a binary stream

6457772
google-chrome	firefox
why does firefox not have any problems but ie and google-chrome

6457793
unix	solaris
however it s much more portable you said any unix but the linux and solaris way is to look in the proc filesystem - and other unixes may have different apis to just parse the output of ps for example to eliminate any extraneous output than to do any system-specific process stuff

6457822
updatepanel	onclientclick
if there isnâ t an event that can be easily handled it seemed like it might work to add an updatepanel with updatemode conditional and an asyncpostbacktrigger that pointed to a hidden button with an onclientclick event handler that would get the active tab index â but that seems like a lot of moving pieces for something that iâ d expect the dom to expose already

6457836
writetofile	nsdata
i think the issue is the returned nsdata is just a light wrapper around an array allocated with malloc and that writetofile does not know how to handle this

6457843
submit	submission
try to remove the submit event handler before submission the form again

6457846
put	get
i have given the tick to the first answer as that put me on the right track to find the solution although it might not be 100 correct its working in order to get this to work i followed answer number 1 but then in the view i did the following

6457870
prepare	execute
try to prepare and execute the query

6457894
backgrounding	multitasking
ios backgrounding audio playback support â developers can now write multitasking ios applications that can play audio while in the backgrounding including music or voice chat from a conferencing application

6457894
backgrounding	multitasking
searching a bit i found out that this multitasking does not include true backgrounding process like playing audio while the app is in the backgrounding

6457906
implements	extends
why can t i just make that interface extends the serializable interface so that the two classes implements it would be in turn serializable

6457936
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
all we want to do is to either be able to have an uninstall work properly or an upgrade actually removepreviousversions properly and install the new versioning without intervention

6457953
implements	extends
you can have your interface extends the serializable interafce and all your classes implements your interface will be implements the serializable interface as well

6457976
x509certificate	bouncycastle
you can embed it in the code and use bouncycastle s pemreader to turn it into an x509certificate instance

6457986
cassini	iis
the only difference i can figure is that the dev site goes thru the cassini web server and the live is iis so maybe iis is clearing out the max-age

6457998
width	height
the uicontrol position property gives you the height and width of the bounding rectangle for the control

6458024
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
he really thinks it s the coolest thing and definitely doesn t care that a website styled with html5 and css3 is going to look and function great in firefox safari opera and just ok in all versions of ie

6458032
sorting	filtering
after doing some googling on filtering and sorting data i came across the isotope jquery plugin and thought that it would be an easy fix for my problem

6458032
filtering	grouping
getting the final filtering to work essentially when the user selects a state from the last filtering grouping only the schools in that state should be shown.

6458050
google-chrome	firefox
or that their browser will support the scheme firefox and google-chrome do not support this

6458086
width	height
if i now want to auto-size the middle part i cannot use width or height property because both will raise a wrong sizing result

6458202
put	get
one option is to put it in a stored procedure and use the execute as feature to get it to execute as an administrator

6458226
springsource	grails
grails vs roo - why springsource is pushing two very similar technologies

6458233
min	max
the user inputs min max of the x y and z values of the box

6458245
width	height
setting the height width of the component you want to slide fixes a bug that causes jumpyness using a line like reference

6458246
prepare	execute
probably because pgbouncer switches the connection between a prepare and execute

6458246
prepare	execute
i ve added begintransaction and commit around each prepare and execute call - but then i get the following error very often

6458273
springsource	grails
grails vs roo - why springsource is pushing two very similar technologies

6458282
move	drag
the issue is that when they move the windows to the bounds of the mdi parent scrollbars appear on the mdiparent window and the user can drag the child windows outside the bounds of the mdi parent

6458292
getter	setter
reimplementing the getter and setter for the layout in my code don t work it just returns null

6458293
post	get
wcf services only allow http post requests hence they are not restful otherwise they would pass data via the url in a get request

6458369
min	max
taking the single-dimensional case from which you can generalize the other dimensions you want the object to be disqualified if both the points of the box in that dimension are less than the box min or if they re both greater than the box max

6458373
portrait	landscape
the table s center in portrait should be 384 it s in the detail view right side and 351.5 in landscape

6458377
post	get
i ll post the modified version of greensted s code when i get a chance

6458379
webrat	cucumber
to accomplish the previously proffered answer using webrat you can do the following in your cucumber env.rb

6458688
put	get
in order to get the duration make sure you put it after jsonobject steps legs.getjsonobject 0

6458818
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
the data in qnetworkreply is not ready immediately after the call to qnetworkaccessmanager get

6458818
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
the call is asynchronous and you need to connect to either the finished signal of qnetworkaccessmanager or readyread signal of qnetworkreply before you attempt to retrieve any data

6458821
qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkrequest	qtcpsocket	qnetworkrequest	qudpsocket	qnetworkrequest	qtcpserver	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply	qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkreply	qudpsocket	qnetworkreply	qtcpserver	qtcpserver	qnetworkaccessmanager	qtcpserver	qudpsocket	qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager	qtcpsocket	qudpsocket	qtcpsocket	qtcpserver	qtcpsocket	qnetworkreply	qudpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
it offers lower-level classes such as qtcpsocket qtcpserver and qudpsocket that represent low-level network concepts and high-level classes such as qnetworkrequest qnetworkreply and qnetworkaccessmanager to perform network operations using common protocols

6458825
inherited	properties	groupbox	panel
is there a way to stop any control that has a font properties from automatically inherited the font properties from the container control like the panel groupbox and form

6458836
bazaar	git
constructive remarks on mercurial vs bazaar vs git vs whatever are also welcome.

6458838
put	get
if you are using mvvm or if your textvalue binding is binding to something you can get to and edit you can put the logic you want executed in the setter

6458875
submit	submission
there is a submit event that the browser throws before form submission that you can use

6458931
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i basically added a uiview and an uiimageview added outlets to the imageview and added code in touchesbegan and touchesmoved to perform the animation

6458936
width	height
myimage1_h100.jpg has been resized to a maximum height of 100 with a variable width that conforms to the original aspect ratio

6458946
setinterval	settimeout
timer setinterval or settimeout

6458946
setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval or settimeout to do this timer check

6458949
keydown	onkeyup
onkeyup not keydown or keypress as the input s value won t have the new keystroke in it yet

6458984
onresume	onpause
it would probably be best if you put that logic to close in onpause and then again initialized in onresume

6458997
put	get
if you subclass uiimageview and put that code in it you will only get the touches from that view you will probably need to set the acceptsuserinteraction to yes

6459041
pull	push
i prefer a data pull instead of a push

6459053
width	height
they need a position x y and a width height

6459076
wordpress	joomla
obviously the standard joomla wordpress drupal solutions are there and are so cost effective to build

6459108
ssl	https
first thing running over ssl https will avoid a lot of proxy nonsense

6459110
folder	directory
at this point the everything directory could be deleted or changed into a working folder

6459120
firefox	safari
that works fine for firefox on my desktop not so much for safari on my phone

6459124
int	chars
i m guessing the type of the variable ret is wrong unsigned chars instead of int and thus -1 is getting converted modulo 256 to 255

6459154
zoo	xts
if i understand correctly this is easily accomplished with either zoo or xts

6459154
zoo	xts
now we load the xts package which also loads zoo

6459227
width	height
suppose theta is the angle by which you want to rotate and suppose that the object s width is 2w while its height is 2h

6459227
width	height	cos	sin
so w and h are the half width and height respectively. let c and s stand for cos theta and sin theta respectively

6459278
libjpeg	libpng

cufft has the same behavior as fftw it computes unnormalized ffts

6460822
cufft	fftw
there are some padding differences between fftw and cufft with c2r and r2c that can screw up a simple comparison but not for c2c

6460822
cufft	fftw
i would double-check your data setup and length calculations and verify your plan in both fftw and cufft

6460839
width	height
the library isn t perfect my brief time spent with it i ve leared that it doesn t seem to render radial gradients with more than 2 colors and it doesn t allow scaling it appears you can only change the width and height properties which is both strange and very unfortunate but at least now i can include the code for the graphics instead of using assets

6460845

what s the algorithm for creating hash sha-1 or md5 of an rsa public key

6460845

6461183
prop	each
you need to groupby the prop value and then select the first member of each subset

6461184
int	boolean
you might change the variable foundblock and the return of your connect function to boolean or at least an int since string is overkill for what you re describing and since string checks for equality are not performed with the operator

my sites now use an algorithm very similar to pbkdf2 that i lifted from bruce schneier and niels ferguson s book practical cryptography for which i use 512 bit random salt and sha512 storage is cheap plus many thousands of iterations to hash a clear text

6461290
width	height
this will then tell you the height and width of the string

6461342
mp4	webm

6461397
ppl	tbb
intel s tbb and microsoft s ppl included in vs2010 do not suffer these issues

6461401
onsubmit	onkeyup
so you need to connect to the onsubmit event on the form instead of onkeypress or onkeyup

6461408
oncreate	recreate
normally when there s an orientation change android will actually destroy your activity and recreate it by mean of oncreate again so any data that was obtained will be lost unless the state is saved in the onconfigurationchanged method

6461476
width	height
you need to set the height and width prolly on the containing div as well not just the image

6461480
mouse	keyboard
this happens to me from time to time because i use synergy to share my keyboard mouse between multiple computers

6461489
portrait	landscape
i have implemented the method willrotatetointerfaceorientation and my iphone app nicely animates the orientation movement when i switch between landscape and portrait

6461513
width	height
set each anchor to the height and width of the sprite like you would the divs

6461525
profiling	debugging
i would suspect that may suffer greatly from debugging builds so try some optimization flags if you didn t do that already you always should for profiling

6461542
post	get
so rather than testing specific class behaviors as you do with unit tests you ll want to be creating objects in the database and making get post etc

6461542
rspec	capybara
lately i have liked using steak inside of rspec for my integration tests using capybara to facilitate the web interaction

6461550

6461660
background-color	transparency
the general consensus on creating a uiview with a clear background requires adding html code to set the background-color transparency like this.

6461673

public protected and friends aren t really keywords just the names of important methods which are called during the creation of modules or classes

6461680

is there a way to hide the text and show different text using css

6461683

of course the majority of those stored values are small int or boolean

6461711

i ve been trying to switching two views from two separate view controllers for a while and it never works the simulator always crashes to the home screens

6461742
hide	show
i have had to on a couple of occassions go from a fade effect to a show hide effect

6461803
gif	png
you can use a gif or an 8 bit png here though and get better results

6461803
hide	show
what i do is make a browser check for ie 7 and if i detect 7 i then switch to hide show as opposed to fades

6461812
hash	md5
my first thought was to create an md5 hash of a json encoded value like so body is the variable referred to above

6461818
width	height
i have set up the image size to be the width height of the tablet device in portrait 600x1024

6461818
width	height
my question is how can i get it to change the width height of my images automatically when the orientation changes such that only one image is shown at a time

6461827
firefox	safari
therefore when safari which in my experience is following the appcache standard a little more strictly than firefox sees a request for a web address that is not in the appcache it does not allow access

6461832
background-color	transparency
one thing you can do to fix this is easily is that if the background behind the transparency png is a solid color you can give the div element with the png image background-color attribute as well

6461869
hide	show
need to use one single button to toggle the show and hide for div

6461869
hide	show
but after i show and hide it once whenever i tried to show it again it starts chaining show hide show hide by itself without any clicks

6461869
hide	show
it seems it s just a loop that everytime it doubles the amount of looping like show hide for 2 4 8 16 32 times .... the more i do the longer it loops

6461869
hide	show
i tried to remove the click part in the hidetable function the loop stops but still whenever i try to hit showtable it will show then hide it self automatically like it s auto executing the stuff in the click function without any clicks.

6461869
hide	show
because i need a way to track which div to show and hide and change the the text in corresponding button

6461870
width	height	portrait	landscape
also i want it to change its appearance layout when due to screen rotation the widget size changes because 3x1 has different height and width in landscape and portrait

6461901
qapplication	qstyle
internally when you call qapplication setstylesheet qt creates a qstyle sub-class called qstylesheetstyle

6461907
google-chrome	firefox
i have known ie to choke on trailing commas in object or array definitions though firefox and google-chrome usually seem to be able to handle it

6461940
hide	show
this will put an onlick on your buttons inside your div which will find the closest parent div with class toggleable and will either hide show your div

6461943
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
google java read file java write file java list directory - that is basically everything you need. the important thing is the use of bufferedreader bufferedwriter for pulling and pushing the text in to the files and realising that there is no particular code science involved in writing html to a file

6461961
firefox	safari
i usually just use the following jquery for mvc project on fields which need a watermark the code compatible with ie 6 - 9 firefox 2 - 4 safari 4

6461965
post	get
just change the method from post to get

6461965
post	get
now when it the form is submitted the data will be submitted using get instead of post params

6461980
put	get
these work fine in high-level stuff like when i put the text into a table but when i try to write them to a uiview by hand the accents get mangled

6462004
nhibernate	queryover
i know there are other ways but i m trying to think of ways that nhibernate will allow me to do using queryover syntax

6462028
google-chrome	firefox
note i am testing in google-chrome and firefox running flash v10

6462045
children	parent
however since i defined a relationship how can i take advantage of that to filter children by parent using a where clause

6462053
int	chars
with primitives we are passing the actual value of the primitive into the method or constructor be it the int 5 the chars c or what have you

6462056
hash	salt
the short answer to your question is that you combine the password and the salt and hash them repeatedly to create your key

6462056
rsa	aes
i ve used the rsa pkcs #5 standard for password-based encryption key generation and padding adapted for the aes encryption algorithm

6462071
getter	setter
the problem is when i go to set the name for the person in officelife.m displayed below i m not sure how to access the setter getter that were synthesized for me in person.m

6462077
hide	show
you can show hide them using js console directly using show or binding an event mouseover click etc

6462085
listadapter	convertview
if i use create a listview listadapter and make use of convertview in the adapter s overridden getview method how are the properties of each list item view handled

6462106
width	height
you can also change your height since it s just using a background image of 289px x 367px and remove width 100

6462114
post	get
the php file takes in info you sent it via get post methods if required retrieves info from your database and echo s it in xml json

6462115
profiling	instrumentation
once you re code is functioning i recommend you watch the various videos on itunes u regarding profiling and instrumentation

6462119
post	get	post	put	put	get
the api is essentially a url using http get put post or delete

6462151
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
to show and hide links for a list of records on mouseover and mouseout

6462158
rss	feed
layout my leaf-page templates with side navigation rss feed ads etc

6462208
post	get
you need to get the raw post data and parse it with json_decode

6462286
listview	gridview
resizing is for the use of listview gridview etc. that will absorb the additional scrollable space

6462286
width	height	portrait	landscape
also i want it to change its appearance layout when due to screen rotation the widget size changes because 3x1 has different height and width in landscape and portrait

6462307
width	height
drawimage image img int x int y int width int height color bgcolor imageobserver observer

6462307
width	height
drawimage image img int x int y int width int height imageobserver observer

6462312
mouse	keyboard
in particular mouse keyboard and focus all appear normal

6462328
width	height
if the blocked image didn t have a specified width and height it will be invisible so you won t be able to right-click it

6462331
floating-point	integer
in particular posix does not require the time_t type to be an integer and c does not require floating-point zero to be represented as all-zero bytes

6462338
gif	png
so to reiterate is there a way to make part of an image transparent over another image two png or gif files

6462363
post	get
when i do a call on any of the methods from my service using test client it will work but if i call any method using post or get request it will throw an sql exception that says it can t connect with the user....

this section of the geocoding documentation provides a pretty good description of the types of data you get back from the reverse geocode

6462393
put	get	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
all code is in viewwillappear animated - i can get close if i put deselectrowatindexpath in viewwillappear and reloaddata in viewdidappear but this isn t what i want

6462416
getter	setter
2 provide a synchronized getter and setter method for the flag

6462418
getter	setter
taking this even further if the getter setter or dofoo require access to common state the functions and actions will need to close over the same set of variables when you create them

6462446
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie 8 and google-chrome 12 but doesn t seem to work in firefox 5

6462446
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tried using the below based on stuff i found googling and that works in both ie and google-chrome but not firefox

6462454
int	chars	int	double
for new programs it is recommended that one use only bool chars int and double until circumstance arises that one of the other types is needed

6462466
google-chrome	firefox
the downside the spec wasn t finalized until recently as you can see firefox 4 5 implements one approach while firefox 6 will use another and it is only implemented by firefox and google-chrome so far with google-chrome working the same as firefox 6

6462469
x86	64bit
but on a 64bit machine it must point to c program files x86 .

6462550
int	chars
i d like to use cin and i used chars for the int type do you call it like that

6462565
rss	feed
i have managed to parse an rss feed and to save specific elements such as title pubdate link media and description in a database

6462566
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i also see you re using sqlconnection which then implies in sqlcommand sqldataadapter sqldatareader and so on which comes from the system.data.sqlclient namespace - which is specific for sql server represents an open connection to a sql server database

6462570
gmail	hotmail
and gmail but hotmail has me floored

6462615
ati	nvidia
despite being an nvidia extension it is supported on ati hardware too

6462627
screens	tablet
this is moot of course if your background is simply a repeating pattern in which case you can make it extremely large and hopefully compensate for various screens maybe even tablet

6462650
hide	show
so i d have to resize the buttons and their text show hide a set of extra buttons change the uilabel show hide a couple extra uilabels etc

6462682
post	get
i can take a look at your question in the comments later but you can really just post a new question and get an answer from others on the site much sooner

6462741
colorbox	thickbox
i now want to replace that with colorbox by removing the thickbox class and adding the colorbox class using jquery

6462755
width	height
so a page with an iframe with a full width full height flash ad

6462788
rspec	capybara
i also use rspec with capybara and i get along very well with this references

6462805
stdout	stderr
one console displays typical console information stdout stderr etc. and the other displays nothing

6462838
colorbox	thickbox
i think the problem is in the way thickbox and colorbox are written

6462838
colorbox	thickbox
colorbox is implemented as a jquery plugin which is a bit different and better than thickbox s sort-of-self-contained widget model

6462838
colorbox	thickbox
the difference is where thickbox would automatically find things with the class of thickbox and apply the effect colorbox needs you to tell it which elements to work on

6462838
colorbox	thickbox
this will initialise colorbox on any links in the page with the class of thickbox with the default settings

6462849
unsigned	short
basically in short i have the entire file header and all written to an unsigned char

6462887
profiling	debugging
you would first use your command prompt to navigate to your debugging keystore in your automatically made profiling android folder as described in the link

6462890
onresume	onpause
the summary of the approach is to have every activity update a singleton timestamp onpause and then in the onresume of each activity check how long it s been since that pause was set - if the difference is larger than some small amount it means that the activity is being resumed from somewhere other than the app and the pin screen should be shown

6462900
firefox	safari
firefox safari except internet

6462930
getter	setter
allow your myobject constructor to require an options instance and then store a reference to the instance as a field on myobject and refer to its getter setter

6462948
pop-up	dialog
i have a dialog that pop-up in my activity

int	double
in java i want to convert a double to an int i know if you do this

6468730
int	double
however i am wondering since double representations of int sometimes look like 1.9999999998 or something is there a possibility that casting a double created via math.round will still result in a truncated down number rather than the rounded number we are looking for 1 instead of 2 in the code as represented

6468730
int	double
if so is there a better way to make a double into a rounded int without running the risk of truncation

it seems that the liveid setup allows you to post a token to get info like

6469538
getter	setter
make feature_name a virtual attribute in widgetfeature model and then create getter and setter methods for it

6469542
getter	setter
the injection of the dependencies is handled by spring you should not care about the thread safety of the getter and setter because spring is going to inject the dependencies taking in account that you have no synchronization logic

6469543
x86	64bit
you cannot use a 32-bit dll in a 64bit process and indeed this generalizes- you cannot mix and match x86 and x64 code a single process is either entirely x64 or entirely x86

6469560
hide	show
the table has a and a section which along each and have a border applied to them so that so matter what i hide the borders even the outer ones will always be show

6469560
google-chrome	firefox
which works fine on most browsers except google-chrome and some minor display glitches in firefox but i presume they come from the percentage in the widths..

6469567
versioning	upgrade
there is a jsf plugin but i am unsure if it is available in the free versioning or if you need to upgrade

6469588
folder	directory

i then downloaded the source and did perl makefile.pl but i am then told that crypt rc4 0 is not found and digest perl md5 0 is not found

6469614
crypt	md5
found dependencies crypt rc4 digest perl md5

6469632
floating-point	integer
for clarification the mysql reference manual states that for numeric types the default is 0 with the exception that for integer or floating-point types declared with the auto_increment attribute the default is the next value in the sequence. so if you performed an insert on a table without providing a value for the numeric column before the auto_increment was enabled then the default 0 would be used during the insert

6469656
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it works fine without the overflow and white-space but i need to it work in ie6 and ie8 i know they are old but let s not go there i don t like working in it myself

you re telling the preparedstatement to execute the sql q2 rather than executing the sql previously prepare

6469834
inherited	properties	put	get
another thing to bare in mind is that i do not have access to the imagicperson interface so i can t even get the properties to return a new class that inherited ienumerable and put the overloaded operators in there or can i

6469846
pexpect	subprocess
but i ve had my problems with subprocess too and pexpect turned out to be really helpful

6469897
client-side	server-side
the problem i am facing is that some parts of the code need to be only server-side some client-side and some both

6469897
client-side	server-side
for example controllers are pure server-side thing for me so they should not be available client-side

6469897
public	protected
the problem i face is that public folder is the document root and protected is outside of the document root

hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
if i have passwords stored as a salt md5 hash but want to move them to use bcrypt what s the best way to perform that transition

tabcontrol	tabitem
either an explanation of how the tabcontrol s design time behavior functionality actually works to describe the selected tabitem behavior that i described above or just some pointers on how one could achieve what i m tryign to do would be great

now i ve tested the function with int float and double

6470074
int	double
it works fine with int it works fine with double but it does not work with floats

6470082
post	get
this was from a legacy structure that i m not going to get into in this post but i need to be able to implement it

6470125
width	margin
the id container isn t required for the class all it is setting is the width and margin

6470162
equals	gethashcode
so i d say unless you want to write both gethashcode and equals in such a way that they check for equality of all their properties you re better off not overriding either method

6470207
opera	firefox
ie firefox and opera have no problem

6470207
google-chrome	safari
but google-chrome and safari exhibit the issue you mention

6470216
width	height
have a maximum width or height of

6470233

what sql code would i use to get all post after 01.01.2011

6470271
sorting	filtering
here s a pretty straightforward demo of dynamic sorting and filtering of a collection view using mvvm

6470271
sorting	filtering
second it exposes an applicationcommand see below that the view will use to execute sorting and filtering commands and finally it implements an execute method that sorts or filtering the view

6470271
sorting	filtering
i implemented it this way because i didn t want to create a bunch of relaycommand properties in the application view model and i wanted to keep all the sorting filtering in one method so that it was easy to see how it s done

6470290
put	get
be sure to always escape data that came from the outside this time get before you put it into a query mysql_real_escape_string for mysql

6470321
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you probably want to show the uiimagepickercontroller in viewdidappear instead of viewdidload

6470328
mouseup	mousedown
focus happens on mousedown but cursor placement happens on click a mousedown followed by a mouseup

6470335
equals	gethashcode
the primary rule for gethashcode that you must not violate is if two objects are equals then they must both have the same hash code

6470377
jquery	anythingslider
jquery tagsphere anythingslider and jquery cycle

6470378
hash	salt
they seem to also add a salt and then hash this fingerprint before storing it in a session variable

6470378
hash	salt
this is why i am wondering is the salt and hash really necessary on something like this

6470435
ssl	https
beginning with the next release r14 moznet called se7en in the op s post will have support for https ssl and the ability to accept deny certificates

6470451
google-chrome	safari
it works on safari 4 for my 10-year-old mac it works for webos on my palm pre it even works for google-chrome on a linux box

6470460
hash	md5
md5 is a one way hash so the password in the database cannot be converted back to plain text

6470460
hash	md5
instead you have to convert the plain text password the one entered in the login form to cypher text using the md5 hash algorithm

6470492
websphere	ibm
i have added the ibm websphere bin directory to the path variable

6470495
opera	firefox
i ve seen it only once with opera and never with firefox 3.6

6470495
width	height
the height and width of the containing div come back as zero

6470495
width	height
if you load the link above in chrome and hit reload every tenth hit or so the canvas demo will show a similar flaw it will be sized width 100 of viewport height 300px and the demo will not draw correctly

6470518
daemon	cron
i ve made a daemon acting like a cron

6470542
fadein	fadeout
after doing some extensive research on my own i came across this post jquery ie fadein and fadeout opacity

6470542
hide	show
this ie bug appears to only apply to the jquery show and hide functions

6470542
slideup	slidedown
when i switch the animation to slideup or slidedown the transparency works fine without any additional javascript

6470542
hide	show
there is something weird going in with css transparency in ie when applied to elements animated through jquery show and hide

6470564
recvfrom	datagram
it s totally ok for multiple processes to send data to the same udp port since granularity on the receiver side is one datagram per read and you know where each datagram was sent from see recvfrom 2

6470596
hash	md5
if instead you are using md5 to hash the password then it s not actually encrypted

6470611
ienumerable	iqueryable
because you are querying an ienumerable ie linq to objects not iqueryable ie linq to entities given by ef

6470622
public	protected
not public protected private is not the same as private - its a 4th state

6470647
subtract	add
now let s say i wanted to make it so that each instance of either class player or npc could actually have their own separate instance of attributes or skills which could add and subtract values of the enums themselves

6470676
floating-point	integer
values could be numbers integer and floating-point strings dates and lists of these

6470685
button	checkbox
first of all you shouldn t have radio button you should use checkbox as radio button don t allow for multiple selections

6470696
post	get
i am trying to pull the first image from any new post to my slider but having one hell of a time trying to get it to work right this is what i have so far

6470711
implements	extends
you need to implements your own tag may on base of form options but as far as i know there is no concept of extends tags

6470741
hash	salt
create the hash with the password and salt createpasswordhash passwordentered salt

6470741
hash	salt
store the hash password and salt

6470790
spaces	delimiter
if your columns are delimiter with spaces or some other character s using string.split to make an array of columns

6470802
maven	m2e
i m running eclipse s helios ee bundle on linux to which i added the subversive plugins the m2e maven integration and the mylin connector for trac

6470807
hide	show
the options i can think of are changing the positions of elements in the detailview event or to show hide vs open close on an orientationchange event

6470807
width	height
i know that using the native ui components on the ipad should dynamically update to the layout width height of the ipad but in my case the content on each detailview will have it s child objects positions updated on orientationchange

6470841
hide	show
i can currently get a new row for every message and hide show all of them but i am not able to figure out how to get the reply button to target the unique row to reply a message

6470845
portrait	landscape
i don t know why the picture are always landscape even though they were taken portrait

6470845
portrait	landscape
i already send hopefully in the post request enough information to check if it s portrait or landscape but i cannot rotate the image properly

6470851
width	height
the dot language has a graph attribute called size for specifying the maximum width and height of the output in inches

6470851
width	height
so i think to make it one page wide and three pages high assuming the pages are portrait you could set the size attribute s width to the width of a page in inches if you re using american letter size i think that s 8 1 2 inches or a4 is 8.3 inches and the height 3 times the height of a page or larger

6470884
stdout	stderr
the reason why install.sh gets killed seems to be that stdout and stderr are closed when the ssh session is yanked so writing to them fails

6470884
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout stderr into install.out and then tail -f it

6470922
margin	height
shouldn t the p tag s height padding and margin be calculated into the height of the body

6470942
int	double
then that data has to be cast to the appropriate types be it bool int double etc

6470942
int	chars	int	double
bytebuffer has functions that return int double long short float and chars as well as ones to put all of those types and a few other useful functions like translating the entire structure into an int array

6470942
for-loop	arrays
as for the bit shifting shift the entire arrays before wrapping it as a bytebuffer as suggested by vidstige in the same way the first if else in the for-loop does and everything will be in order

6470947
awt	swing
for instance you would do well to learn how to use the swing awt layout managers and avoiding using null layout setbounds

6471004
stdout	fflush
so it looks like node.js can t fflush the stdout stream and everything is kept in memory

6471027
hide	show
edit sorry about it being vague what i currently have is 2 buttons in a contentcontrol when clicking one of the buttons it hide that contentcontrol and show a different contentcontrol with its own set of controls and a back button

6471027
hide	show
when clicking that back button it hide the current contentcontrol and show the original

6471051
stdout	fflush
if you want your code to look sync use streamlinejs as described here node.js stdout fflush

6471061
hide	show
you should probably make two user controls and hide show them when clicking the buttons

6471091
equals	gethashcode
equals or gethashcode

6471141
calloc	malloc
being bored with calloc in fact always have been since my early c coding days i changed the arrays to be nsmutablearrays and guess what guard malloc again stopped at the same line of code this time with the nsmutablearray replacing the float32 pointers but because it is objective-c it also told me that the index was out of bounds and gave me a stack trace

6471141
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
there you have it when you get a exec_bad_access in your main watch out for calloc malloc free and check double check and recheck your indices

6471150
mouseleave	mouseenter
in that case the mouseenter event on the child menu should cancel the normal behavior of the mouseleave event on the parent menu the dropdown should not close

6471150
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem when you try to set this up in a normal straightforward way is that the mouseleave event on the parent menu fires before the mouseenter event on the child menu and the child menu closes before the mouse can enter it

6471150
mouseleave	mouseenter
there are separate handlers for mouseenter and mouseleave events for the individual menu item its parent menu and its child menu

6471159
width	height
a quickie how does one specify a custom field size width and height in a schemata using dexterity

6471159
width	height
i d like to specify a default width and height to make it more useful

6471190
caliburn	prism
the framework that i like most because it s simple to understand and learning curve is not so steep is the mvvm light toolkit but there is also prism and caliburn

6471192
mouse	keyboard
you need to set up a global hook to listen for keyboard and mouse events

6471192
mouse	keyboard
i have a c# class that does this and raises .net keyboard and mouse event args but i am not going to post the code online as this type of activity can be used for nefarious means

6471192
mouse	keyboard
we embedded powerpoint into our application but we didn t want the user editing the powerpoint slides while viewing them so from our c# application we set up a hook to monitor and intercept mouse and keyboard events if they were in the powerpoint control

6471208
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
to compare the md5 hash you would need to query the database based on the user name enter in the login and return the known md5 hash and the salt if there is one

6471208
hash	salt
then hash the given password with the known salt

6471347
google-chrome	safari
they come with google-chrome and safari i believe

6471380
getter	setter
the relevant sections of the jpa-annotated java classes are below getter and setter mostly omitted

6472042
for-loop	loops
it seems you are resetting the variable e in the second for-loop causing it to loops endlessly

6472101
jar	war
my opinion is that the package checkbox see the screenshot below has been unchecked for the apache commons fileupload library or jar file and therefore netbeans will no longer package this into the war ear file

6472104
dom4j	xerces
basically i used jxpath and xerces as well as dom4j and javax

6472145
width	height
the call to cudamemcpy2d as written assumes that h_ref is a 2d-array of width x height float elements stored contiguously when in fact it is a 1d-array of width pointers

6472145
width	height
instead of representing the matrix as a 1d array of vectors i would suggest storing it in a 1d array of width x height floats and using macros for access based on row column

6472153
pow	math.h
use the pow function from math.h

6472156
getter	setter
how do we handle validation when using implicit setter and getter

6472156
getter	setter
i imagine when using explicit getter and setter we would do something like

6472156
getter	setter
if we use implicit getter and setter we can define validation rules within the cfc itself such as

6472160
min	max
my volumechanged method gets hit every time the button is pressed even if the volume does not change as a result because it s already at max min

6472163
rsa	dsa
putty has a very handy tool for going back and forth between dsa rsa and ppk certificates which you can download here

6472163

you can t change the ivars in a superclass without recompiling all subclassing known and unknown or you ll risk crashing

6472282
children	parent
if so then if you build not save the pages and then save the report rails will try to save the dependent children and will not save the parent if the children fail to save

6472304

i m working on a image editor uploader based around pixastic where i grab image data out of an tag put it into a canvas and after manipulating it encode the data in base 64 and post it to my app with javascript where it will be saved as a new image file

6472329
public	protected
the webmethod attribute is attached to a public method cannot be attached to a private protected that you want the method exposed as part of the .net web service

6472333
width	height
the interface you re looking for is iamstreamconfig on the source filter s output pin this lets you specify fps and height and width etc

6472348

i just needed to configure the superhuman to map inherited properties like so

6472421
postgresql	mysql
also since we are moving from this model where each site is independent each site has its own database and i quite like it that way especially since we are using relational databases mysql but migrating to postgresql so its much easier to shard this way

6472429
inherited	subclassing
it s just important to note that inherited arrays and objects are not copied to instances with this implementation - so if you inherited an array you ll want to redifine its values in the subclassing constructor function otherwise all instances will share a single array - i can post an example for you if you want to see there is also one in the comments of that post

6472438
fseek	ftell

6472629
uiapplication	uiwindow
i don t think there is any official documentation on how the modal is implemented but any view can get the uiwindow of the uiapplication and call -presentmodal.

6472636
int	boolean
easiest way to do that is keep a boolean or int track of occurrences nmatches then print no-match-message at the end if nmatches is 0 or false before you close the file or the pathname goes out of context

6472636
int	boolean
also you might like to abstract the functionality into a function find_occurrences searchstring pathname which returns int or boolean noccurrences .

6472648
children	parent
i m having a hard time using updatedata because i never actually call domodal on the preference boxes because they re children of the parent dialog container and they are just bound to the picture control in the dialog

use md5 sha1 or whatever encryption you want with a salt

6472690
google-chrome	safari
however the latest versions of google-chrome and safari have support for websockets

6472735
hash	md5
if an attacker would get to your database and get the md5 hash it is almost certain that he will be also able to crack them

6472735
hash	md5
md5 hash of weak passwords can be cracked even bruteforce by a casual computer

6472761
keydown	onkeyup
onkeyup attach keydown listener again and computer the time

6472788
hash	salt
it doesn t affect how fast an attacker can try a candidate password given the hash and the salt from your database

6472791
stdout	stderr
but you could have in input stderr and stdout of ffmpeg

6472846
profiling	debugging
one other issue is that i had to run ngen with both the profiling and debugging flags to make sure i could do both

6472858
folder	directory
however when the process is started the program it launches ends up looking for all resources in the workingdirectory instead of pulling user content from that folder and all other content from the directory the exe resides in

6472959
rss	feed
i have an input rss feed with some elements already added with namespace prefix for itunes

6472961
put	get
you need to use method calls get put etc. for that

6472982
division	multiplication
although it has been two years i felt i might as well add my penithworth for a really fast way to detect overflow for at least additions which might give a lead for multiplication division and power-of

6472997
int	double
i m running into a bit of an issue with determining if the user input is an int or double

6472997
int	double
i need to figure out how to determine based on the scanner if the input is a int or double for the above methods

6472997
int	double
is there anyway of possibly taking the input as a string and checking to see if there is a . involved and then storing that into an int or double

6473010
versioning	upgrade
what kind of development environment needed to upgrade a webapplication developed in older versioning of ruby deployed in linux to latest versioning 2.3.11

6473018
stdout	stderr
the output can be captured within c# by redirecting stdout stderr

6473042
hide	show
an entirely different approach would be to tie the selection to the addition removal of one or more css classes to the form container coupled with css rules to hide show portions of the form

6473068
hide	show
because jquery is the bee s knees instead of separate hide show functions this will suffice given just as above

6473075
autofac	ioc-container
using an ioc-container like unity autofac or others you have to register and resolve the iinterface to get the instance

6473218
int	chars
of course the above will work only if sizeof chars isn t the same as sizeof int

6473245
int	double
in this case you can detect if an input is an int double or just obtain an entire line

6473276
spaces	delimiter
i m writing a regular expression to parse arguments in a fashion similar to shell arguments with spaces and quoted strings as the delimiter as well as backslash escaping

6473318
keydown	keyup
inside the keyup handler you determine if the key was being pressed and if so calculate the duration by subtracting the time-stamps of the keyup keydown events

6473373
submit	submission
submission is only allowed when a user manually loads a page and submit the

6473398
implements	sealed	implements	extends
wcf is very extensible except scenarios where you want to extends already implements protocols - those classes are mostly sealed internal and cannot be reused

6473407
post	get
maybe if you do an ajax http request post to a php serverside script and get back the response and then do the alert based on that response you could do what you re wanting

6473419
cucumber	simplecov
does anyone have any experience using cucumber and the code coverage tool simplecov

6473420
int	double
the decimal tells the compiler that you want a floating point number instead of an int and the f tells the compiler to use the float type instead of double

6473533
post	get
yes just use a post method instead of get

6473550
width	height
iframe src height 100 width 100 iframe

6473600
width	height
it becomes very hard to check conditions that involve multiple attributes if a product s size medium then the weight must be between 1 and 10 pounds if a product s height is specified then a width is required as well so people don t make those checks

6473600
width	height
and then you ll discover when the application is being configured that you missed a ton of requirements that only became clear when the attributes were defined-- you can t know that width is required if height is specified if you don t know whether they re going to store height or width in the first place

6473624
nsscanner	nsxmlparser
for a simple result you can even use nsscanner and not go deep into the nsxmlparser

6473646

6473654
width	height
for the progressbar you may wish to hard code a small size say 40dip width and also height

6473656
margin	height
use js to calculate the necessary positioning or padding margin needed to center the element after calculating the height of the container and child element

6473673
accessor	properties
if the mailaddress constructor or its argument expressions or the assignment to from if it is a properties accessor throws an exception the mailmessage will not be disposed

6473677
int	double
it is an interesting detail that the int will be retrieved as double from javascript indicating that there really was a forward and backward mapping to a javascript data object

6473698
javassist	cglib
i m not sure whether this is what you re looking for but consider javassist or cglib library

6473698
implements	extends
cglib is a powerful high performance and quality code generation library it is used to extends java classes and implements interfaces at runtime

6473737
cassette	squishit
cassette similar to squishit and requestreduce which is quite different than anything else by automagically doing everything for you

6473750
vim	emacs
do yourself a huge favor choose to learn either vim or emacs suffer with the mental phase shifting for a week and do all of your work via ssh to the linux box

6473769
postgresql	mysql
i haven t tried using postgresql with ado.net but from my experience using it with mysql you might be better off sticking with sql server if you plan to use linq to sql or entity framework

6473780
cocos2d-x	libgdx
i m new to cocos2d-x library i worked before with libgdx and pure opengl

6473790

deselect	multi-select
i have 2 multi-select dropdown boxes ddb i use jquery mobile .once user selects the items from ddb1 based on his selection i need to populate ddb2.i have used jquery.change in ddb1.but the issue i face is that onchange is called every time the user selects deselect an item from ddb1 i understand that this is the expected behavior and not when the whole selection is over

6473856
httpresponse	request
when that class handles the request it returns an httpresponse instead of the standard file like object

6473875
int	double
however i doubt you re lecturer is trying to catch you out with and will probably just be giving you int and double

6473875
int	double
casting a double to an int results in the decimal portion of the number being discarded

6473892
copying	overwrite
note that tenuring an object will have exactly the same effect but instead of copying it to to-space it s copied to the old generation heap - we end up with a copy of the data in from space that isn t overwrite

6473901
hide	show
for the first part since after hours of looking i cannot find a jquery plugin that allows for multiple divs that show on click and hide any current div that s open

6473918
jfreechart	jchart2d
libraries that aren t acceptable thus far those without 3d points jfreechart jchart2d

6473931

the author of the superclass should be able to rewrite it without breaking subclassing and vice versa

6473972
clang	llvm
like mkroehnert and puzzle said neither llvm clang nor gcc actually come with a set of frameworks

6473972
nsstring	nsobject
gcc comes with only a small runtime that doesn t provide nsarray nsstring not even nsobject

6474016
daemons	launchd
and if you want to launchd you daemons when you linux start you should find out which init version you are using in you distro but usually you can just add command to execute you daemons to etc init.d rc but it seems to be no so good idea

6474039
ubuntu	linux
my first choice of linux distribution is ubuntu but i ve heard that in ubuntu eclipse is can be bugged or slow

6474094
png	ico
for now im using server generated png - ico - tray but this is ugly and slow ....

6474132
post	get
the webclient provides the querystring namevaluecollection which is designed exactly to pass parameters in a querystring and it works just on get methods so in my case the querystring collection doesn t fit because while uploading the file the webclient is actually doing a post

6474177
post	get
the solution is to do a post redirect get or to use a nonce key

6474184
hash	md5
i m using the md5 algorithm to hash the key for an on-disk hash table i know it s questionable whether this is the best algorithm to use for this but i m going with it for now

6474184
hash	md5
where key is the value being hash and n is the number of bits of the md5 result i want to use

6474199
entities	entitymanager
i have a dao in which most of the entities are mapped directly to columns using jpa annotations so i use the entitymanager and it works great with no issues

6474215

it seems as though most of the gems god whenever etc... rely on calling cron jobs

6474215
jobs	cron
are cron jobs the best only way to do this that is robust and scalable

6474270
nsuinteger	nsmutablearray
the reason for this is that an nsarray stores nsobject s so any time that you have an int float nsinteger nsuinteger etc that you wish to store in an nsarray or nsmutablearray you will need to convert it into an object

6474302
jar	.war
don t include the jar file into the deployment assembly so that it will not get exported to .war file

6474344
backgrounding	multitasking
how can i get multitasking to properly work in my application and not have the app terminate when it enters the backgrounding

6474404
width	height
because the preview will require some manipulation it will be a smaller percentage of the original height and width i would like to use jquery to calculate the dimensions of the preview programmatically rather than simply hard-code it

6474405
bmp	png
build up the image that you want or convert from jpg bmp png as a dib and convert to an hicon

6474441
accessor	properties
if you still want a single access point you can map a third ignored properties that implements it s get and set accessor with the two first properties

6474453
post	get
actionautocompletetest will get the data sent by cjuiatocomplete via post

6474515
entities	entitymanager
update statements are usually pretty simple so you might as well use the normal doctrine2 way programmatically updating entities and calling entitymanager flush or using dql updates

6474538
google-chrome	firefox
edit 3 - ok here s the code but google-chrome and sea monkey and firefox don t display it correctly

6474548

6474591
innodb	myisam
the table may be myisam or innodb

6474613
post	get
the technique mentioned in another post on this page of getting a page with a comments plugin on it probably wont work unless your getter is actually a browser than will run javascript - i have tried this with a like button on a page i want scraped and no dice an admin on that page actually has to click like for it to get scraped

6474635
folder	directory
these folder are stored within the mysql data directory

6474678
post	get
in the ajax call i would make post call instead of get

put	get
the only thing you get out of a bundle is what you put in

6474768
webchromeclient	webviewclient
from this great explanation about the differences between webviewclient and webchromeclient it seems that if you use one you shouldn t be using the other for the same webview object

6474768
webchromeclient	webviewclient
if not when would one use both webviewclient and webchromeclient for the same webview object

6474768
webchromeclient	webviewclient
is there an example of a situation where only use both webviewclient and webchromeclient for the same webview object would accomplish a certain goal

6474771

6474876
ant	maven
i have a project that i am migrating from ant to maven

6474876
maven	pom.xml
i figured i would just import this build into our internal maven repo and list it as a dependency in the project s pom.xml file

6474877
children	parent
each parent has_many children and accepts_nested_attributes_for children as in railscasts #196 and #197

6474893
google-chrome	firefox
i m clicking on a link that loads another page and the page loads fine in google-chrome but firefox does absolutely nothing when i run this code in firebug or even when i execute it as a bookmarklet

6474899
inherited	subclassing
this is important as inherited is specilisation if would be a subclassing of it should be able to contain but it s not

6474904
innodb	myisam
sure the records are all there in plain text .myd files for myisam the ibdata1 file for innodb tables but it would be a complete time-waster devising a custom app to parse or update the file structure as well as trying to tie in table structure contained in the related files for each table

6474907
pull	push
gitslave is useful when you control and develop on the subprojects at more of less the same time as the superproject and furthermore when you typically want to tag branch push pull etc all repositories at the same time

6474917
screens	tablet
i would assume that things like screens dimensions and orientation would matter on a tablet but in the bits of basic sample code i ve found there hasn t been anything about this

6474918
superclass	subclassing
then override the method in your subclassing you could probably just call the method in the superclass

6474929
int	double
this works great but i want the output xml to include the data type of object properties string int double etc

6474931
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 4 you didn t need to list binaries in the manifest things in components folder are loaded and checked for functions to see if they are xpcom so a google-chrome manifest might have looked like

6474931
google-chrome	firefox
from firefox 4 the google-chrome manifest needs to list your binary files so it then looks like

6474971
put	get
a is a list in which you can put any object implementing record and every object you get out will implement record

6474971
put	get
a is a list in which you can put any object implementing subrecord and every object you get out will implement subrecord

6474978
portrait	landscape
i usually start by making a portrait layout then you can simply make a landscape version of the same layout but for tablet you ll probably want to start landscape since that is the main orientation

6474990
portrait	landscape
this allows the application to load a different layout if you specified a different layout for landscape portrait

6475006
width	height
now i am using timthum for resize the feature images i want to resize with fixed width and height but here the image size was crop here is my code

6475015
put	get	int	double
put a double or a long long int on an address that does not end with 8 or 0 when printed in hex and you are likely to get a core dump

6475015
int	double
double and long long int need to be aligned to 8 byte boundaries

6478188
bluetooth	usb
i have set up a connection between a bluetooth module and a pc bluetooth usb dongle on the rfcomm protocol

6478205
equals	compareto
different events can have the same timestamp so - if i understand correctly - compareto and equals would be inconsistent

6478205
comparator	comparable
my first approach was to let the event implement comparable and provide comparator like this

6478205
equals	compareto
so compareto would return 0 because they have the same timestamp and are equals for the purpose of sorting

6478205
equals	compareto
i looked at sortedset but it had the same warnings about the consistency of compareto and equals

6478210

tested on win7 in ie7 ie8 ie9 opera 11 google-chrome 12 firefox 4 safariwin 5

6478286
comparator	comparable
when you implement comparable then you should also override equals object because comparator should only return zero if and only if equals return true

6478286
equals	compareto
compareto t should only return zero if and only if equals object return true

6478286
equals	compareto
compareto equals and hashcode implementation was taken from the implementation you can see in java.lang.long

6478286
comparator	comparable
if you want to have a comparator that evals to 0 when equals must return false as stated in another comment then you must implement a comparator instead of implementing comparable

width	height
the png itself is only 1 x 1 000 pixels w x h in size but will accommodate an area of unlimited width or height

6478974
background-image	background-color
what makes this simple technique work is to specify the bottom-most color in your image #000 in my example as the background-color and allow the background-image to repeat horizontally along the x axis repeat-x

6478974
background-image	background-color
so when the background-image ends the background-color takes over and ensures a smooth transition without a hard cut-off

post	get	post	put	put	get
get post put delete etc are all http methods that are sent to a server from the client the browser

6486141
post	get
post get etc have no context at the client side outside of dictating how a request should be sent to the server

6486414
folder	directory
i need to run a python 2.7 script into a client critical machine so i have permission to install nothing and when i say nothing i mean nothing even into local directory so the solution i found is to pass him the script as a binary created with the batteries-included tool freeze.py and i also added required and unembedable .so libraries into the same folder _io.so _heapd.so ... and give them executable permisions

6486433

6486787
int	boolean
however you implement in terms of binary arithmetics using on int fields which makes this implementation of not compatible with the boolean logic you expect which means in your interpretation of mystruct boolean value

6486793
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
however you could replace your depth-first-search with breadth-first-search which would result in nodes closer to the root being visited earlier thus yielding a more natural tree in your picture you already numbered the nodes in bfs order

6486793
equals	gethashcode
if you override gethashcode and equals the algorithm will no more be able to distinguish between two different nodes with same value which is probably not what you want

6486818
client-side	server-side

parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
why is the modalviewcontroller which is presumably presented by an instance of parentviewcontroller instantiating a new parentviewcontroller

6486847
parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
i think what you need to do is pass a reference to the existing parentviewcontroller to the modalviewcontroller when you create it then in modalviewcontroller it can set the hidden property on the parents button

6486847
parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
if you want to follow good design practices the parentviewcontroller needs to delegate the management of its button to the modalviewcontroller

6486847
parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
parentviewcontroller would conform to a simple protocol exposing the button and would set itself as the delegate of the modalviewcontroller before presenting it

6498134
prepare	execute
tcl s quite thoroughly embeddable as long as you remember to call tcl_findexecutable before tcl_createinterp so you could do it that way using a small amount of python code to prepare tcl scripts that you execute in the same process

6498146

in ie and google-chrome this works but in firefox event.stoppropagation gives me a null pointer which makes sense because i m not taking in an event parameter into edititem this

6498800
free	strdup
check the return value of strdup for null and free those pointers when you are done with them

6498803
int	chars
try to use a fixed-length key - int bigint chars x for x 6 chars - those tend to be easier to deal with and give sql server less overhead to work with

6499058
inherited	properties
in simple apps if all i want to do is augment a domain model my view model will directly inherited from the domain model and add the extra properties i want to display

6499058
inherited	properties
you could get away with this if you write the mapping layer for this model yourself to take into account the privileges of the accessing user but that is probably more overhead than just creating a second admin model that inherited from the regular view model and augments it with the admin properties

6499092

i ve tried text-align float margin padding and position properties but none of them seem to solve this
