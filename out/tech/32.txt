2700182
int	chars
when the compiler passes that value to printf it promotes the signed chars value to type int and it retains its negativity

2700208
int	chars
when the chars 0xda is promoted to int to pass to printf the compiler is doing a sign-extension converting it to 0xffffffda which is the 32-bit representation of -38

2700208
integer	unsigned
signed integer types are widened by sign-extending and unsigned integer types are widened by zero-extending

like i said in my comment on marcus post you should put a try catch around the call to the function itself to ensure that any other exceptions are being caught

2700948
phpunit	simpletest
as for the choice between simpletest and phpunit check out my recent question about phpunit vs

2700948
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest - the answers to that question notably gordon s managed to convince me of phpunit

2700961
for-loop	loops
i still remember when first learning about the for-loop in c the mental effort that had to go into understanding the execution sequence of the three control expressions relative to loops statement

2701004
hide	show
only in firefox when i click the a href link to hide show the div firefox display a dotted border around the href link which i don t understand why and it shouldn t be

2701045
uiview	uiwindow
as techzen mentioned the code is trying to send a uiwindow message to a uiview which does not have the method

2701045
uiview	uiwindow
here window was used separately by the main application as a uiwindow and window was also being used by wpgamestate as its viewport a uiview causing ambiguity within the frameworks

2701092
inherited	properties
the problem i m running in to is i am wanting to have a single base class that all my properties classes inherited from so that i can store them all together

2701092
inherited	properties
so my problem is i cant figure out how to implement a properties structure so that i can have them all inherited from some base type but code like what i have above would throw a compile time error

2701092
min	max
if i want to get the max and min values of a property given its string name i have methods that are completely generic that will pull out the associated abstactproperty from each element and find the max min no matter what the type is

2701095
getter	setter
that s why java has getter setter

2701095
getter	setter
the java getter setter equivalent would be

2701108
getter	setter
nope you would use getter and setter methods instead

2701112
jar	manifest.mf
recently logback and other logging frameworks have had added code that adds jar versions to stacktraces based on information in manifest.mf which is very helpful in reproducing bugs

2701132
google-chrome	firefox
non ie browsers that we have tested firefox google-chrome do not exhibit this behavior

2701136
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter

mouse	keyboard
load the page and reproduce the behavior by the following -- note that this is all done using the keyboard no mouse clicks

2701361
google-chrome	firefox
there are many options out there but your best bet is to write your tests with firefox firebug or google-chrome

2701397
decoder	encoder
asn.1 would be ideally for me but its implementation in python cannot generate encoder decoder out from notation

2701422
mouse	keyboard
it also aims to minimize the number of mouse clicks necessary to select a date and or time and provides wai-aria keyboard accessibility for users without a mouse

2701427
inherited	properties
i guess the ideal situation would be to inherited from some kind of class that wouldn t even have the text properties defined but that d have position size etc properties available

2701433
firefox	safari
after some more work on this i figured out that it worked in firefox and safari

2701443

i came from the web-app web 2.0 crowd who normally hear news about mysql postgresql or even key-value column-oriented storage solution

2701444
post	get
why would post work but not get

2701462
superclass	subclassing
this is implicit and does not need a hard cast because java knows that everything the superclass can do the subclassing can do as well

2701462
superclass	subclassing
the reason for this is because the subclassing could have some weird methods that the superclass doesn t have

2701462
superclass	subclassing
in general if you want to instantiate a class to call something in its subclassing you should probably just instantiate the subclassing to begin with -- or determine if the method should be in the superclass as well

2701500
portrait	landscape
will scaled pixels work with changing from portrait to landscape ie will it fill up the new found space

if anyone can post anything relevant to the user name placed into the report server db and how that relates to sharepoint integrated mode you ll get the bounty

2701588
daemons	systemd
everyone already thinks this way this is why my tiny linux systemd with only 10 daemons will never be secure because i can t be bothered to go find all the insecure by default things and fix them

2701638
apache	nginx
where 8888 is what apache is listening on nginx s 80 - localhost 8888

2701679
unix	solaris
i got the same problem in a unix solaris

2701680
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
a little mousedown mousemove and mouseup logic on the usercontrol itself will let you easily move the splitter left and right and the two panels will properly block this everywhere but over the splitter so your logic for checking if the mouse if over the splitter is as simple as can be

2701700
super	extends
replace extends by super

2701719
width	margin
if you know the width you can set the position and then back the margin off

2701981
hash	md5
don t use md5 it s just not a very secure hash

2701981
hash	salt
don t just hash the password you ll want to salt it too

2701981
hash	salt
as for generating the password i think you are on the right track - i would just generate it when they create their account email it to them then hash it and store the hash and a random salt on the user record in the db

2702001
screens	mdpi
if your app does not say it supports densities then android will run in compatibility mode where it makes the screens look like an mdpi screens scaling all coordinates and drawing to match the real screens density

2702001
screens	hdpi
running in an hdpi screens like droid this is a 1.5x scaling so every other pixel will be mapped to two pixels on the screens

2702038
vbscript	jscript
you may consider switching from vbscript to jscript jscript is what microsoft calls javascript

2702038
vbscript	jscript
note that you don t have to quit vbscript cold-turkey you can still interoperate between the two in the same asp file but if you declare jscript first you need to confine your vbscript to sub or functions and vice-versa otherwise unpredictable things can happen

2702049
maven	m2e
it looks like it would better be managed with maven integrated in eclipse with m2e

2702055
mouse	keyboard
is it a differentiation between capturing keyboard or mouse input or something else

2702105
width	height
for your scaling just set your expanding controls to have width and or height of 100 in the mxml

2702113
folder	directory
the path is always relative to your current directory which in most cases is exe file- change rdlc files so that they are copied to the destination folder instead of embedded in resources usually that s how this is done

2702118
subreports	localreport
if your report has nested subreports the report will fail unless you also set in your localreport subreports definition another such reference to your subreports .rdlc file

2702214
button	checkbox
and i but it checkbox front each member name becuase it allowed to select multiple name then click delete button the following code works

2702244
folder	directory
the directory structure will also be created for you at runtime so you don t have to explicitly create the folder

2702427
post	get
get your post into a variable in this case and then just remove the first 30 words

2702435
getter	setter
you re coming from a java background where one of the basic rules is always to use getter and setter methods rather than let users access attributes

2702435
getter	setter
since in python we have properties we would not need an api change in that instance so we can safely avoid the boilerplate and cruft of setter and getter

2702445
gedit	kdevelop	anjuta	kdevelop	anjuta	gedit
i personally use xcode on mac os x gedit or anjuta or kdevelop on linux and code blocks on windows

the above code create the div sets some html for it using html and hide it initially on because later you want to show it

2702493
printf	strtod
if you re really concerned with portability i m not sure that there s any better option than using printf and strtod and assuming that you may not necessarily have any more accuracy than the absolute minimum required by he relevant specification section 5.2.4.2.2 of the c99 spec.

2702499
width	height
using containercontroller.getcontentbounds returns me size of whole sprite of the letter with ascent descent empty parts not the height width of the actual rendered letter

2702825
filesystems	fat
but how can i set or remove the executable bit on a file on a fat filesystems

2702891
width	height
you ll need some sort of javascript on the client-side set up to pass back the height and width to the server through querystring parameters cookies hiddeninput etc. so that on your next page load you ll have those parameters on the server side

2702891
width	height
this would redirect you for example to and then you could pull out the height 1240 and width 300 parameters in php fairly easily

2702891
width	height
despite being called window height width you will actually be getting the height and width of the browser viewport

2702891
width	height
it might be annoying for clients to have to go through a redirect like that but there is no way to know what the client s height width are on the first http request you receive on your server

2702893
crypt	md5
it should not over-rely on built-in libraries md5 crypt etc - because i want to benchmark the quality of the php-to-scala conversion not the quality of the library implementation

2702920
pop-up	dialog
i m in the process of implementing facebook connect for my site everything seems to be working fine so far except that the look of my pop-up dialog upon clicking on login with facebook is totally different from what i see on other sites like say posterous

put	get
each one of those objects could potentially have an array of errors and i d like to get just the unique message out of them and put them in another array say called error_arr

2702983
nfa	dfa
i have a main question which is how to judge whether a regular expression will be accepted by nfa and or dfa

2702983
nfa	dfa
do we have to draw the nfa and dfa and then find through minimisation algorithm

2702983
nfa	dfa
if we do then how do we come to know that which regular expression is accepted by nfa dfa so that we can begin with the answer

2703015
union	distinct
given two sorted lists each containing n real numbers is there a o logâ n time algorithm to compute the element of rank i where i coresponds to index in increasing order in the union of the two lists assuming the elements of the two lists are distinct

2703026
nfa	dfa
if you are asked to show that some language is not accepted by a dfa nfa you almost always have to apply the pumping lemma which is used exactly for that purpose

2703034
nfa	dfa
nfas and dfas accept equivalent regular languages so one way to show that a language is regular is to create an nfa or dfa for it

2703057
touchesbegan	touchesended
i suppose you could simulate the touches by calling the touchesbegan touchesended methods directly on the uiview check the uiresponder class

2703098
google-chrome	firefox
this jquery statement works in recent versions of firefox and google-chrome but throws an error in ie 8

2703114
post	get
the number sign isnt a url request like get or post its more of a ahref name but this was with ajax where it would change the whole frame wondering what its called

2703235
opera	safari
the declaration compensates rounding errors in particular in older versions of opera and safari

2703255

2703293
firefox	safari
the following code works for me on firefox mac windows safari mac windows and ie8 windows of course

2703304
google-chrome	firefox
btw this is for a google-chrome firefox extension so ie compatibility does not matter

2703304
tostring	getter
ended up using tostring because getter don t allow me to redefine the whole attribute a function must be associated with it

2703314
firefox	safari
the below code works in firefox mac windows safari mac windows and ie8

2703333
getter	setter

2703347
accessor	properties
using a function is your best option for now however the new javascript standard ecmascript 5th ed. which is being implemented now by all major browser vendors gives you a method to create accessor properties where you can define a properties with a get and set functions that will be internally called without worrying to treat this properties as functions

2703352
getter	setter
see john resig s post javascript getter and setter and the defining getter and setter page at the mozilla developer centre for more information

2703354
min	max	minimum	max
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

2703437
drive	createfile
you can use the createfile function to open a physical disk drive or a volume

2703444
width	height
then we go through some css gymnastics to get the width height position correct

2703445
width	height
the best approach is to change the frame height width and positions when the orientation changes

2703448
vim	emacs
a slightly tougher choice might be emacs again using the same approach as with vim

2703518
hide	show
if it needed you can makes div with jqgrid sometimes visitable and sometimes invisible using using hide and show jquery functions

i want it to be such that the children are 100 width and height of the remaining space after padding is calculated not before

2703631
width	height	children	parent
how do i make it so using position relative or position static and percent sizes the percents size the children according to the parent s width height minus padding and margins

2703668
profiling	debugging
pragma error and message are very handy especially inside conditional compliation blocks error the release for ephone build is unimplemented message extra debugging and profiling code is enabled in this build

2703732
webclient	httpwebrequest
i don t know enough about vb.net yet to use the richer httpwebrequest class so i figured i d use the simpler webclient class to download web pages asynchronously to avoid freezing the ui

setinterval	settimeout
in example dividing all work into small pieces and then running them sequentially with some delay using settimeout or setinterval between each task

2703796

2703815
pull	push
if you later improve the skeleton and push changes to it you can work them into an existing project with git pull myserver skeleton and then merging

2703823
children	parent
note that this actually removes the parent element and inserts a new one so all details such as event handlers and data will be lost on the parent but is preserved on the children

width	height
that s another way but â edge positioningâ positioning top and bottom but not height and similarly for left right width won t work on ie before version 7

2703873

... the second rule is that members inherited from a private base class become private members of the derived class even if they were protected or public in the base class

2704591
profiling	instrumentation
as your performance test environment will never be perfect you should have sufficient instrumentation monitoring that you can measure performance and profiling your app in production

2704689
bash	zsh
i do not know how it is in bash but in zsh you can define preexec and precmd functions so that they save the current time to variables preexec and precmd so you will be able to find the approximate running time

2704930
getter	setter
set a unique reuse identifier for that cell configure it when you create it and from then on simply reset the data components this is easiest to do if you create a custom cell controller class so that it can track all the parts and use setter getter for the data

if i have an outer div and an inner div element i want a single mouseout event to be triggered when the mouseleave the outer-div

2705220
mouse	keyboard
the way you handle user input events whether you handle everything like which key was pressed etc in lua or whether there are for example separate events for each keys on the keyboard in an extreme case depends on the game you re trying to make a turn based game might have only one event handler for all events an rts should have more events and an fps should be dealt with care mainly because moving the mouse will happen every frame

2705224
mouseleave	mouseenter
what you more often want is the mouseenter mouseleave model which considers element trees as a whole so you d only get mouseleave when the pointer was leaving the element-or-its-descendants and not moving directly into the element-or-its-descendants

2705224
mouseleave	mouseenter
unfortunately mouseenter mouseleave is currently an ie-only event pair

i ve read that it s important to call setcontentview early in an activity since it builds the view objects that may be manipulated by subsequent code in oncreate

2705648
oncreate	setcontentview
in terms of lifecycle does the view get drawn to screen as soon as setcontentview is called or does it allow the oncreate function to build populate the information in the view objects and wait to actually draw it after oncreate completes

when i debug the post request when sending 3 characters â aâ with firebug i get e2 82 aca e2 82 a4 which is correct since e2 82 ac is the code for â and e2 82 a4 is the code for â but â is stored as

2706140

thin	webrick
if thin doesn t work either try using webrick merb -a webrick

2706505

rsa	aes
this key is then used to encrypt communication between the webservice and silverlight client with aes which is also encrypted with the rsa public key

you can do that if you re using a java ee app server like weblogic jboss glassfish geronimo or websphere

2707035
many-to-many	one-to-many
i think the reason that i m a little confused by this question is that technically it s actually a many-to-many relationship not really a one-to-many

2707053
hash	md5
i ve used php s md5 function to hash images as they were uploaded to a gallery

2707062

2707203
redmine	trac
i was wondering when is the right time or the correct project size to start using project management applications like redmine or trac

2707216
redmine	trac
i m not familiar with redmine but assuming it has functionality and complexity comparable to trac i would recommend going for it earlier rather than later -- and i wouldn t really call trac a project management tool a term which makes me think of microsoft project gantt charts etc and whose appropriateness to software development projects is much iffier and debatable but rather an issue tracking tool

2707234
pull	push
kinetic scrolling a scrolling mechanism where you don t use a scrollbar to scroll the content but you touch the list itself and pull and push it

2707245
int	chars
the above will work for real ascii because the first 128 code points of utf16 the encoding used in c# s string type have the same numeric values as for ascii and so casting the c# chars value to int is fine

2707261
punctuation	words
the regex to match all words and punctuation would be

2707316
getter	setter
i do not know what you mean by how does each loanapplicaiton instance know which person attribute it is to go with but assuming your getter setter are public then you can invoke those functions from your loanapplication class

2707320
g++	gcc
gcc runs fine but with g++ i get a long list of errors

is that right to set the height and the width of the cell in pixels

2707471
width	height
make sure that you are assigning width and height in pixels rather than percentage to the table as well as its cells and rows

yslow	pagespeed
i have gone through most of the yslow and pagespeed stuff but am left wondering about a particular detail

2707556
jboss	geronimo	jboss	jonas	geronimo	jonas
if you stick strictly to the java ee apis in your code then jboss or geronimo or jonas or ... will run it as well as any other compliant application server with the only changes being required in the server-specific deployment descriptors

2707573
gif	png
when draw method is called for pngs and gifs some internal alpha blending method make its work it does not touch alpha channel of bitmap selected in dc it only combines color channels using internally stored alpha channel data of the png gif image

2707583
put	get
strangely there is a lot of resources on the web on how to create bundle jar creating the metadata creating the jar provided you have the classes inner jar to put inside but very few things on how actually get theses classes compiled

2707593
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
it extends runtimeexception meaning it s an unchecked-exception

everything works fine in ie firefox safari

2707684
ant	maven
an osgi bundle is usually packed by ant or maven which are supported by eclipse

2707694
multiplying	add
an alternative would be to call random.nextdouble instead and multiplying it by the size of the desired range then add a base value.

2707708
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

2707710
width	height
the returned size always has the correct width calculated however the height is always slightly shorter than what is expected

2707737
innodb	myisam
note that this will run much faster in myisam than innodb because count is expensive in innodb but nearly instant in myisam

2707807
openfire	ejabberd
i would use an xmpp server like ejabberd or openfire to power the backend

2707839
std	ostream
std ostream is not the best place to implement filtering

2707839
std	ostream
you probably want to write a class derived from std streambuf containing a wrapped std ostream or a wrapped std streambuf and then create a std ostream using this std streambuf

2707884
toolbar	tabs
making a command group available makes it possible for these methods to be used however they can be turned on and off with more fine-grained control via the menu visibility and toolbar visibility tabs of the customize perspective dialog

2707889
google-chrome	firefox
during preview the urls get opened firefox spaces are spaces google-chrome spaces are 20

2707909
allocator	stl
i ve read the documentation and lots of forums but it doesnt make sense some of them say to use the stl others use custom allocator

2707912
getter	setter
in eclipse is it possible to create automatically getter and setter for a field

2707912
getter	setter
is somewhere in eclipse a create getter function which does not create setter too

2707916
getter	setter
my plugin lets one create fields with getter or setter

2707916
getter	setter
i should mention that eclipse has create getter setter from the source menu

2707916
getter	setter
problem with that is it creates both getter or setter

2707919
getter	setter
on the generate setter and getter screen you have select getter button on the right - use it

2707925
equals	gethashcode
i ve overridden gethashcode equals methods as follows

2707933
put	get
on a lan local area network a home or enterprise network an arp or rarp request will get you a mac address and many more informations as much as the network administrator put when they configured the network possibly the exact location of the computer

2707947
equals	gethashcode
your equals and gethashcode implementations do very different things

2707947
equals	gethashcode
you have no mention in gethashcode to the m_ownertree that you are using in your equals implementation

2707948
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
if thickness were a class i would inherited from it and define properties in the subclassing to store my additional data items

2708068
hide	show
there are 2 properties to do this directly errorcontainer and errorlabelcontainer for example of you wanted a list of the errors in your and the to hide show based on if any are present you d do this

2708068
hide	show
the above will hide if there are no errors show it if there are any

2708068
hide	show
this works even if you have a description help message or something at the top of the div and the errors are just a portion of the div determined by the errorlabelcontainer selector...it ll still hide show based on any errors and leave your message help untouched

2708081
typedef	struct
i often work on private projects using the winapi and as you might know it has thousands of named and typedef struct like memory_basic_information

2708150
width	height
a better solution is to specify the height and width of your images in the html

2708183
width	height
i have an uiimage which loaded from sqllite with method imagewithdata nsdata i just find the height and width of the size both be zero

2708183
width	height
i wanna get back the original height and width of the image is it possible

2708208
int	double
i need to see account.in to confirm but i suspect that the int transaction type appears before the double transaction amount just like the problem statement says

2708208
int	double
this would attempt to read the int as nextdouble which is okay but the double as nextint would throw inputmismatchexception

2708243
width	height
i am trying to create a custom command button that defaults width and height to specific settings

2708243
width	height
however it won t compile because it tells me that i can not override width or height

2708294
jrails	ujs
the trend in rails especially rails 3.0 seems to be towards using ujs but it is not clear to me why this is better especially when you get so many useful helpers such as remote_form_for from rails jrails

2708297
width	height
width and height are not virtual members check control class in reflector so the simpliest way is to override defaultsize property

2708297
width	height
if you check control class in reflector you will see that height and width use a lot of internal private members

2708327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and safari and google-chrome

2708346
ready	each
each user other then the creator should click a ready checkbox

2708346
ready	each
each user will also have an ajax request every second or less to see who else is ready if the game has started etc

2708352
int	double
so for and max_size will differ that much as int and double differ

2708364
rel	attr
just off the top of my head have you tried accesing your rel value without using live ie with direct id inputid attr rel

2708385
getter	setter
i added my own implementation not because yours didn t work but to show how you could delegate responsibilities to classes which reflect the problem domain making the code a bit more readable though considerably longer with boilerplate getter and setter

2708412
instances	transient
instead of trying to merge the transient instances

2708436
put	get
in the end i m trying to get what s left for customer and what s left i put into 3 array lists

2708460
hex	binary
the visual studio binary editor displays lines hex and ascii versions in a fraction of a second

2708466
accessor	properties
you should either create it as a properties or create accessor variables for it

2708490
postgresql	mysql
you maybe a ruby and rails veteran but you might still not be a master of things mysql specific if you always used postgresql

2708512
for-loop	arrays
note that your for-loop skipped the first element of the arrays mine doesn t

2708571
inherited	properties
the default value of the viewstatemode properties for a web server control in a page is inherited

2708585
tabcontrol	tabitem
the resource dictionary xaml i use to style the tabitem of a tabcontrol is given in full here

2708609
inject	interceptor
probably the simplest is to use an interceptor to add a request attribute and inject the value of from spring config

2708621
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
given the need to loops up to an arbitrary int value is it better programming practice to convert the value into an arrays and for-each the arrays or just use a traditional for-loop

2708621
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2

2708636
datediff	difference
it looks like you ll want to use the datediff function which returns the difference between two dates in days

2708642
hide	show
or the other way round initially hide it and then show it when js is enabled

2708661
width	height
.newentry .colorbox width 80 height 80 iframe true onclosed function location.reload

2708662
int	double
i would like to make sure that int and double types are entered and if the user enters garbage lets him repeat the procedure

2708705
puts	gets
so a user puts in his emai and date in a form and it gets stored in my database

2708720
post	get
incidentally this isn t really a programming question so if you want to post more details and get help you might have better luck at serverfault.com the companion site to stackoverflow.com that deals with system administration questions

2708734
hide	show
i m using jquery to show hide different li-elements based on their classes

2708738
ubuntu	debian
all these systems are affected running ubuntu karmic ubuntu hardy debian etch

2708753
uiview	subviews
i didn t use subviews but painted my things with -drawrect inside an uiview subclass

2708760
mvp	presenter
i also suggest you to look for another variation of mvp called presenter first

2708773
typedef	struct
what if you get rid of the typedef and define your struct like this

2708839
hide	show
here is a tutorial called simple jquery show hide div that show how to accomplish this

2708849
glut	glew
the simplest way to achieve that is by using opengl glut glew

2708855
integer	fractions
some causes include divide by zero integer overflow etc. and integer divide by zero is most likely the reason since you re implementing a fractions class

2708970
folder	directory	folder	dir
basically i want it to look at the output of dir see all the folder for each directory cd into it unzip all the zip archives then remove them then cd back and do it again until there are no more

2708985
width	height
dx is the width and height

2709018
translation	localization
localization often is crap and it s hard to get help since the tremendously well done translation makes it impossible for you to find out how the feature you re having problems with could possibly be called in english while at the same time german help is not available

2709022
division	multiplication
few processors implement remainder in hardware rather it s synthesized from a division and a multiplication

2709023
postgresql	mysql
if you want full utf-8 support upgrade mysql to at least 5.5 or go for another rdbms like postgresql

2709026
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails is a cross-platform ide that will run on windows

2709042
integer	unsigned
at the end of all my calculation the answer is ax and it is treated as an unsigned 16 bit integer

2709061
pkcs#12	pfx
however you must export the certificate as pfx pkcs#12

2709077
expression-blend	silverlight
i have expression-blend 4 and i want to create a button to export to an image file the current view in silverlight

2709100
cos	sin
cosf and sinf are simply the float versions of cos and sin

2709100
cos	sin
the normal cos and sin functions return double values instead of float s

2709163
prop	each
once you do some small optimizations may make sense -- for example start with summing constants equal to one more than the smallest negative value of each propriety to all the property values and targets so that every prop value is 0 -- now you can sort the slots by value for some property or the sum of all properties and do some pruning based on the knowledge that adding one more slot to a partial hypothetical solution will increase each cumulative prop value by at least x and the total by at least y so you can prune that branch if either condition makes the running totals exceed the target

2709164
mouse	keyboard
how does one react to menuitems that are clicked via mouse or invoked via keyboard e.g cmd+q

2709180
jobs	cron
now just add the heroku rake cron command to a crontab on any unix server of yours or even directly to your personal computer s crontab if you re running linux or mac os x and you can be scheduling cron jobs for your heroku application as you please and without being charged for it

2709203
ssl	https
to start why are you sending your account password over plain http and not ssl https

2709207
mouseup	mousedown
i ve found that if you mousedown in the div#canvas and mouseup with your pointer over a placed or vice versa then a new doesn t get placed

2709247
mouseup	mousedown
i believe its not a click unless the mouseup and mousedown occur on the same element

2709248
uilabel	nsstring
here s the code where i m trying to put the nsstring into the uilabel

2709307
google-chrome	safari
i want to use like the safari google-chrome type of css3

2709355
getter	setter
and use getter setter instead of directly accessing the properties

2709434
boost	stl
i can write a wrapper class around boost regex to do the first one but i was hoping there would be a built-in or a more elegant way to do this in c++ boost stl c

2709439
int	double
this means that in the method when the compiler does know it is dealing with a float f is the float formed by the first four bytes of the double passed to the method and i is an int formed from the second four bytes of the double passed

2709448
integer	fractions	base	fractions
while basing the condition on t may seem appealing is unlikely to work unless the t_step is a multiple of for some integer n -- fractions cannot be represented exactly in a float unless this condition holds because floats use a binary base

2709460
inherited	subclassing
because inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s implementation it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation

2709474
mouseup	mousedown
i can listen to events for focus blur mouseup mousedown etc. but i don t think i can reliably figure out the state of the menu from those events

2709474
mouseup	mousedown
for example mousedown followed by mouseup could mean the user clicked and dragged to a selection and released in which case the menu is now closed or clicked and released to open the menu in which case the menu is open

2709474
onfocus	onblur
for my own use i m just keeping track of whether the select has focus using onfocus and onblur

2709518
mamp	wamp
to run a test environment in mysql php download mamp the mac counterpart to wamp

2709560
inherited	properties
why not have both of the possible classes inherited from one base class that implements the properties you are trying to define

2709573
ceil	floor
the problem there is that the approach of examining the lines along the ceil floor of the point of intersection only works if the section is aligned with the vertical or horizontal axis though the intersection point

2709573
ceil	floor
more likely the thin section will be inclined at some angle away from the axis and the ceil floor neighbors will not intersect the section on integer coordinates

2709585
np-hard	np-complete
it was ... shown to be np-complete in 1972 and the optimization version of set cover is np-hard

2709590
post	get
in the page you select a station and post it then you get new page with data

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
is there a mechanism which will work across all major browsers like ie firefox google-chrome opera

2709685
pull	push
however watching for .hgtags is fine too so long as you re sure hg update is being run the push in and of itself doesn t update the local working copy outside of the .hg repo without hg update or hg pull -u

2709752
integer	unsigned
for a long value you need to add the length info l and u for unsigned decimal integer

2709756
haskell	ocaml
you could certainly launch your program as haskell or ocaml then have it do a foreign-function call right out of the starting gate mdash

2709764
g++	gcc
gcc g++ and clang to compile code in various versions

2709764
textmate	textwrangler
if you don t like it try textwrangler free or textmate paid

2709764
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are two other good editors but i don t recommend you to try them right now because they use obscure and non-standard key combinations so you will spend a lot of time learning how to use them instead of programming

2709767
printf	strlen	strlen	calloc
the usual answer is to allocate a very generous buffer unlikely to overflow let printf output to that and then use strlen to determine the actual string length produced calloc a buffer of that size + 1 and copy the string to that

2709782
subset-sum	np-complete
this problem is essentially a generalization of the subset-sum problem which is np-complete yes to multiple dimensions

2709866
int	double
the int version took 0.3 seconds the double 0.66 on my 2 ghz single-core machine

2709878
versioning	upgrade
when we want to upgrade the spreadsheets we push a new versioning out to a shared drive but dont have any way of enforcing that people dont use the old versioning of the spreadsheets

2709878
versioning	upgrade
is there some best practice here to deploy vba spreadsheets so if someone loads an old versioning it wont open or will ask you to upgrade

2709880
children	parent
the virtual tree viewer is helpful if there are lots of children per parent or if it expensive to compute the information needed for each child

2709904
min	max
to find the length of the current pangram subtract the max value from the min value in our map

2709907
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome but in internet explorer 8 there are no images

2709921
cucumber	autotest
comment that row and autospec autotest and cucumber works ok

2709928
getter	setter
is it possible to change external class field accesses in java to getter setter calls automatically and also hide the exposed fields

2710005
getter	setter
your best option is to break the api and introduce setter getter

2710017
opera	firefox
it appears in the right place in ie8 and opera but firefox seems to have a problem with it

2710036
put	get
b if i set the main cell to auto it seems to be working both in ie and ff but then i have the problem that anything i put inside the maincell table or div cannot get maincell s full height in ie

2710100
inline	inlining
the jvm seems to be quite good at inlining when it s possible and even if you ask for inline in scala it can t always do it and sometimes i ve noticed that it doesn t even when i think it ought to be able to

2710105
post	put
i have put another simpler instance in the comments of the original post

2710130
int	chars
i therefore need to convert the int into a chars s

2710147
inherited	properties
if so the ideal thing to do in wpf is to define the properties such that it will be inherited by elements in the visual tree

2710163
hide	show
one option is to hide the .address i m guessing this is a drop-down list via css and show it inside the success callback from the ajax method

2710177
ant	maven
personally i would consider apiviz that you can call from build tools like ant or maven

2710180
inherited	properties
you can make a class that inherited control call setstyle in the constructor to make it double-buffered and user-painted then override the onpaint method to call e.graphics.drawstring and draw the text properties

2710187
x86	64bit
there is no 64bit version of xna thus you must target your assembly program to x86 based processor for windows

2710196
cos	sin
on an unit circle r 1 the x y coordinates of the points i 0..n is cos x sin x

2710196
multiplying	add
multiplying those coordinates with the respective radius router or rinner depending of whether i is odd or even and add that vector to the center of the star to get the coordinates for each vertex in the star path

2710200
swt	swing
i have found swing code that enables me to do that but i can t find swt code

2710218
javadb	hsqldb
you could use an embeddable database written in java like javadb sun s supported distribution of apache derby hsqldb or h2 by the creator of hsqldb

2710238
directx	gdi
i would start building a project like this using directx or i should use just gdi and the multimedia api of windows

2710255
liferay	nuxeo	liferay	alfresco	liferay	magnolia	nuxeo	alfresco	nuxeo	magnolia	magnolia	alfresco
you can find here and here an overview of them all the popular ones being alfresco nuxeo magnolia and liferay

2710260
getter	setter
c do you have to set attributes for enumeration types differently in a constructor or getter setter methods

2710270
ant	maven
i would like to start it from ant maven and i don t need any features like clustering persistence performance and so on

2710270
maven	pom.xml
just a mock rabbitmq-like instance without installation just as a dependency at maven pom.xml and configuration

2710282
superclass	subclassing
what you need to be careful with is calling the superclass constructor which you can only do once and at the beginning of the subclassing constructor

2710284
google-chrome	firefox
im having problems with this function applying css using a text variable working with internet explorer but it works in firefox google-chrome

2710302
apache	nginx
assuming nginx is working okay you do have appropriate namevirtualhost directives set in apache so that it will map virtual hosts correctly

2710316
ant	maven
maven ant tasks use maven s repositories to provide dependency management and more to ant builds

2710316
ant	maven
ant ivy is another alternative to maven ant tasks

2710337
google-chrome	safari
the animation i m using is the -webkit-transition which is of course limited to working on webkit google-chrome and safari browsers

2710347
vsto	add-in
i have a requirement to create an installer for an outlook 2003 add-in that was created with vsto

2710356
put	get
on the other hand if you feel comfortable writing your own extentions and taking the risk that drupal 7 could have one or more issues then go for it it s a tougher road but you d get a headstart if you put some effort into it and won t have to deal with converting later on

2710358
integer	unsigned
so here it is again what are the possible ways to store an unsigned integer value 32-bit value or 32-bit bitmap into a 4-byte field in sql server

2710364
put	get
i get an error while validating saying that i should put outside of

2710390
next	except
if this modifier is set whitespace data characters in the pattern are totally ignored except when escaped or inside a character class and characters between an unescaped # outside a character class and the next newline character inclusive are also ignored

2710416
folder	directory
instead of uploading individual files make the entire directory into a zip folder or any compressed folder to save bandwidth and time

2710453
jstl	taglib
you can use the jstl functions taglib for this

2710464
linkbutton	addhandler
in the sub createtagstyle the addhandler is not firing when the linkbutton is clicked

2710529
ubuntu	linux
check out the ubuntu linux troubleshooting section

2710531
directx	gdi
you re talking about using directx to write the compiler - but if you re compiling it to some bytecode then the compiler shouldn t care whether you ll end up using directx gdi opengl or something completely different

2710531
directx	gdi
when you have your instruction set you can easily write an interpreter for it using whatever you want to handle the graphical stuff directx opengl gdi sdl... - it s pretty much just one big switch statement with the opcodes implemented as the cases

2710536
google-chrome	firefox
however it doesn t appear to work properly in ie8 while it does work in google-chrome firefox

2710536
google-chrome	firefox
here is a screenshot of it working properly in firefox google-chrome with my mouse in the exact same position

2710584
post	get
you just send the value of the first email form via the get or post method and in the php html for the second form use

2710590
put	get
edit put in the full link as i can t seem to get urls with brackets to escape properly

2710592
ubuntu	debian
just for the record i love ubuntu and their well debian s package management system

2710595
mouse	keyboard
it s rare that you would need to call either since its usually appropriate to let the user s keyboard mouse actions determine focus

2710601
getter	setter
there are some good guidelines for this particularly concerning getter and setter at the junit faq

2710624
client-side	server-side
for the server-side i used the built in .net functions to retrieve the regexes from the xml file and on the client-side used jquery s ajax request to get the regexes in javascript

2710630
innodb	myisam
for example using mysql will be fast under a myisam table but slow under an innodb

2710681
stdout	stderr
-xverbosegc help | 0 | 1 file stdout | stderr |

2710720
iboutlet	ibaction
you set up the interaction with the views using the target action pattern with iboutlet and ibaction see here for a complete guide

2710745
awt	swing
swing awt is a single threaded library so once a component is shown just changing it s appearance won t work correctly

2710763
width	height
here things are ordered first by width and then by height if widths are equal. if you are only using the ordering to find identical elements that s probably what you want

2710764
portrait	landscape
...my question is how can i format the hyperlinks so that they don t change size when viewed on an iphone and the accellerometer switches from portrait - landscape

2710771
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this has been tested to work on all major browsers google-chrome safari firefox opera ie including ie6 7+8

2710777
width	height
first look at height arranging by shortest first if height are same look at width arranging by narrower first

2710784
perforce	cvs
that s a very different development model than perforce cvs subversion vss-- take a look at hginit for a tutorial on distributed version control before going this route it will really help

2710824
hide	show
which will show or hide elements depending on what you choose from the forms that are revealed

2710824
button	checkbox
the labels will be visible even if i did not yet click on the button that will make it visible but without the checkbox

2710824
button	checkbox
and when i click on that button that s the only time when the checkbox will appear on the left side of the labels

2710890
children	parent
the approach is easy simply include a reference to an instance of self called parent and a collection of children

2710890
children	parent
you can enforce this using the class constructor require the parent to be passed to the constructor and simply set parent to that value and then add this to the children collection on the parent class

2710892
put	get
to get this code to run before all other imports you can put the path managing code in a file of its own in your app s base directory python recognizes everything in that directory without any path modifications

2710897
implements	extends
when i try to use the home_loan_terms.thirty_year in my loanmanager class that does not extends or implements the loan class i get an error saying it cannot find symbol home_loan_terms. so i did not know if my loanmanager class needed to implements the two different loan classes

2710963
for-loop	arrays
looks like array.reverse has native code for reversing an arrays which sometimes doesn t apply and would fall back to using a simple for-loop

2712346
changelistener	listeners
it s worth mentioning that changelistener has been deprecated since gwt 1.6 as have all listeners so sliderbar should probably be updated to use the new hotness changehandler but adding a changelistener will still work in the meantime

2712350
width	height
all blocks have known width 200px and unknown height

2712368
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram suck as start - because they contain less information than the object diagram which includes a lot more information about methods on objects and inheritance trees - both elements the entity-relationship diagram will miss

2713987
organization	naming
you can of course adopt one for any package you develop yourself but you might have to invasively edit any package you may adopt from third parties and the culturally alien naming convention will probably sap the changes of your own packages to be widely adopted outside of your organization

getter	setter
getter setter being a prime example of that.

2714036

2714085
width	height
apparently this is hero bug in function surfacechanged switch width and height parameters

2714088
integer	fractions
if you need exact representation your code is about accounting and money where every fractions of a cent matters then you must indeed avoid floats in favor of other types that do guarantee exact representation of the values you need depending on your application for example just doing all accounting in terms of integer numbers of cents might suffice

2714100
actionscript	mxml
it explains the actionscript code behind the mxml components and it s important to be familiar with because if you implement your components incorrectly it can really slow down your application

multiplying	add
yes multiplying two 3 bit numbers will result in either a 5 bit number or 6 bit number if there is a carry in the add

2714389
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add
just like decimal math in school you can start with the least significant bit on the lower operand and multiplying it against all the locations in the upper operand except with binary there are only two choices you multiplying by zero meaning you dont have to add to the result or you multiplying by one which means you just shift and add no actual multiplication is necessary like you would have in decimal

2714396
allocator	stl
ok best i got was to make loki s small object allocator compliant with the stl

2714402
rss	feed
anyway to begun because there is no rss feed available i m screen scraping a webpage hence it does a fetch then it goes through the webpage to scrap out all of the information that i m interested in and dumps that information into a sqlite database so that i can query the information at my leisure without doing repeat fetching from the website

it looks like uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller just reset some of uiviewcontroller at some point

2714581
children	parent
alternatively since it looks like at least most of the data in an individual node has a fixed size you might create a database-like structure of fixed-size records and in each record record the record numbers of the parent children

2714622
daemons	launchd
it seems that the behavior is completely different because here your daemon.py is launchd in background as a daemons

2714625
rsa	aes
if you do use this one and have the last service pack installed then it can be needed to use explicitly microsoft enhanced rsa and aes cryptographic provider or microsoft enhanced rsa and aes cryptographic provider prototype as it s called on windows xp sp3 or prov_rsa_aes or ms_enh_rsa_aes_prov instead of default prov_rsa_full provider

this could be made a little more generic by replacing m_value by using pure virtual protected setter and getter

2715202
iprincipal	iidentity
create an http module which then creates a classes that implements iprincipal and iidentity objects

2715202
iprincipal	iidentity
this is easier to implement than the membership providers since the two interfaces iprincipal and iidentity is quite thin

2715220

min	max
expr between min and max

2716454
width	height
is there any way to detect the contents height width in the webbrowser control

2716470
int	chars
it s true that if you use an int or bigint as your primary key you can only have as many rows as the number of unique values in the data type of your primary key but you don t have to make your primary key an int you could make it a chars 100

2716491
setinterval	clearinterval
the setinterval method will continue calling the function until clearinterval is called or the window is closed

2716529
vbscript	vb6
you should be able to use the .net proxy class in vb6 or classic asp vbscript using com interop i haven t tried with wcf but it should work the same as any other interop scenario the soap toolkit or the xmlhttprequest object

2716592

the browsers i intent to use is firefox and safari

2716731
cos	sin
y r sin long cos lat

2716767
width	height
you should devise some kind of mapping from the screen window which goes from 0 0 to width height to the complex plane which should have values in the neighborhood of -2-2i to 2+2i or so

2716767
int	double
a quick fix would be to divide the x-h and k-y expressions by 100 before passing them to renderpoint and changing the arguments of renderpoint from int to double

2716783
prepare	execute
second in order for the gpu to get to execute some command the cpu has to prepare a command description to pass down

2716809
width	height
you should start your attributes width and height with small letters width and height because that is a java convention which helps differentiate classes and attributes

2716840
put	get
make a simple function that just returns 0 get all of the save load stuff working to your satisfaction then put the slow bits back in

2716859
range	max	range	min	min	max
i have an nstextfield into which i need the user to enter a number between a max and min and it would be nice if i could detect when the nsnumberformatter fails that particular test so i can either display a nicer message the number is too large is not very helpful it needs to display the valid range or simply set the field automatically to the nearest valid value

2716870
collabnet	svn
i tried add this file path to c svn_repository making it c svn_repository var svn repos i also tried adding the path to c program files collabnet subversion server

2716933
keydown	mouseenter
this means when you hover it s starting the animation then immediately stopping it because when keydown was pressed it added a handler to do this on mouseenter

2716976
uialertview	uipickerview
is it possible to put uipickerview into uialertview

2716986
width	margin
the basic approach is your sidebar floats left but inside the main div and the #page-wrap has the width of your sidebar as it s left margin to move that far over

2716994
centos	linux
i logged into a linux box centos but that shouldn t matter

2717036
textarea	textbox
i have a huge form like 50 questions involving checkboxes drop downs textbox and textarea

2717153
children	parent
because you tell your table to fill its parent and then set stretchable columns to all your layout forces its children to fill the required space

2717197
cpu	hyperthreading
if your cpu supports hyperthreading then at least in theory you can squeeze 2 threads per core and see what comes out of it

2717214
strlen	substr
after you check the string length with strlen use substr

2717216
hash	md5
so far i ve only been able to tap into more cores if i happen to need multiple hash of the same file say an md5 and a sha256 at the same time

2717294
post	get
i only need to respond to get post and i can t use an application server

2717378
post	get
parse the request text specifically the headers where you will see if it is a get or post and the parameters passed

2717389
post	get
post requests usually have less problems than get requests do when it comes to caches

2717419
hash	md5
i think you may be confusing an md5 hash with compression or encryption

2717419
hash	md5
md5 hash don t contain all the data just a probably unique representation of a thumbprint of the data

2717442
hash	md5
md5 has several ways for people to find collisions for a given hash

2717444
swt	swing
you could try embedding the crystal reports swing components inside your swt application using org.eclipse.swt.awt.swt_awt

2717463
hash	md5
note that while some people even trying to answer you re question think that md5 is insecure the reality is that it is still more than adequate for most purposes although i d recommend one of the more recent hash if you run paypal or control the launchpads for a fleet of nuclear weapons

2717468
uiview	subviews
use a uiview or any subclasses of uiview for any subviews within the mainviewcontroller

2717475
qscrollarea	qvboxlayout
the qvboxlayout is contained within a qscrollarea

2717515
children	parent
the children have to be embedded in the same parent tag

2717564
subtract	add
i need to get the current balance and when money is transferred from either checking or savings it should add it to checking and subtract it from savings

2717582
subtract	add
i want to be able to add subtract increment and decrement these numbers what is the algorithm for doing this

2717582
division	multiplication
at the moment i m not interested in multiplication and division but i might be in the future so bonus points for that

2717593
ssl	https
but since i have encryption the site using https ssl support the google map api stopped working

2717646
subtract	add
then you just have to add subtract from the least significant byte and handle carrying

2717684
hide	show
which as you can see makes use of explicit interface implementations to hide failuretask and instead show failurestate property

2717684
hide	show
the problem comes from the fact that i also want to define a stateschain that inherits both from istate and ihasstatelist and that also imples itask and ihastasklist implemented as explicit interfaces and i want it to also hide ihastasklist s tasks and only show ihasstatelist s states

2717759
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can then use the mouseenter and mouseleave events for hover effects or even create triggers based on that

2717761
jsf	seam
it appears that seam is not properly bound to any jsf lifecycle as i m getting no active application scope

2717787
inherited	properties
objects can have properties of their own and properties they inherited from their prototype object

2717787
inherited	properties
a for-in loop spec | mdn with or without a hasownproperty guard inside the loop to differentiate between own and inherited properties

2717787
inherited	properties
reflect.enumerate spec | mdn es2015+ which returns an iterator for the names of the enumerable properties of an object including ones it inherited

2717787
inherited	properties
for-in loops through the names of all of an object s properties including ones it inherited from its prototype whose names are strings leaving out any whose names are symbol s

2717787
inherited	properties
if we wanted the loop but ignoring inherited properties we can add a hasownproperty check

2717787
inherited	properties
so it doesn t include inherited properties properties marked non-enumerable or properties named with symbol s

2717787
inherited	properties
it returns an iterator that will iterate over the names of the string-named enumerable properties of the object including inherited ones skipping ones named with symbol or that aren t enumerable

2717787
inherited	properties
first it visits the own properties in the order defined by and then inherited properties unless they ve been hidden by own properties

2717787
inherited	properties
one is at the end because it s inherited and own properties come first

2717787
inherited	properties
since inherited properties are ignored we ll keep it simple

2717787
inherited	properties
it ignores inherited properties

2717861
for-loop	loops
also i need it to loops to however many rows that were retrieved from the query as 3 in the for-loop above

2717866
subclass	abstract-class
you cannot directly instantiate an instance of an abstract-class but must instead instantiate an instance of a fully implemented subclass

2717936
filesystems	xfs
note i m currently running linux with an xfs filesystems

2717936
filesystems	fat
the msdn link mdma provided further notes that fat filesystems is accurate for creates with 10 ms resolution but for access is only accurate to 2 seconds

2717950
hash	md5
how come md5 hash values are not reversible

2717950
hash	md5
also since multiple strings can create the same md5 hash due to it being less data than the input string how would any other hashing system be any better

2717958
hash	md5
it s similar with md5 except that the hash is computed via a complex procedure instead of just chopping off part of the data

2717960
hash	md5
therefore reversing a given md5 hash would result in an infinite number of possible plaintext values

2717968
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
first view tableview on the stack of a uinavigationcontroller that is a tab of uitabbarcontroller

2717968
portrait	landscape
when you make a selection on this view it pushes the uiscrollview onto the stack but because the tableview only supports portrait the uiscrollview comes in in portrait while the device is in landscape mode

2717969
typedef	struct
no you need to typedef your struct and you should pass the array to it

2717979
typedef	struct
typedef struct int a

2717982
post	get
in a web application it could be an extra post get parameter

2717986
width	height
i have a element that is generated by js and i need to get the height and width of it

2717986
width	height
how do i check to see if the video has received a dimension and if it hasn t wait till it has to get the height and width

2718016
typedef	struct
either stick the work struct in front of estructure or typedef it to some other type and use that

2718018
hash	md5
the md5 is a hash algorithm like f but much more complexer

2718030
int	chars
i have a string of hexadecimal chars which encode 8-bit signed int

2718030
int	chars
is there a more streamlined and direct approach to reading two hex chars and converting them to an int when they represent a signed int -127 to 127 using the leftmost bit as the sign

2718049
hash	md5
incidentally the md5 sum of a plaintext is not necessarily safe because it contains less data or is lossy but because from an arbitrary plaintext it computes a sum-value within a fixed range for plaintexts 128 bits the md5 sum in fact contains more information than the plaintext... and therefore a number theoretically infinite of plaintext could all align to the same md5 hash

2718070
hash	md5
create the same md5 hash due to it

2718070
hash	md5
for md5 the size of the hash is 128 bits

2718070
hash	md5
however some hash algorithms like md5 have weaknesses that allow attackers to reverse it find a message with a given hash with significantly less effort compared to just brute force attempts

2718099
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
after more research i am thinking about using a hard coded salt key on both ends then sending an md5 hash of the base64 encoded image bytearray+salt to be matched on the server side

2718121
client-side	server-side
however this is all client-side so if you really need to validate the input that must be built into the submission target s server-side logic in the case of a form

2718132
int	double
at this point it doesn t matter if timeinsecs is a double or a float because the int division has already been performed

2718168
hash	md5
the main use of md5 and similar cryptographic hash codes is to encrypt passwords

2718168
hash	md5
obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

2718188
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have a page with a flexigrid on it and it works on firefox google-chrome opera except ie

2718295
for-loop	loops
also note in the code above i have corrected loops index over-run on the for-loop

2718327
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
filesystems do not store time precisely and often not at millisecond resolution fat has a 2-second resolution for creation time and ntfs can delay updating the last access time by up to an hour

2718356
getter	setter
do you need to intercept getter setter in domain classes

2718363
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
subclass the uiview and use touchesbegan and touchesmoved to determine where to move the view as its being dragged

2718500
width	height
i used sizewithfont constrainedtosize linebreakmode to get the width and height of the text content and accordingly set the frame of my tableview cell

2718555
hash	md5
there are multiple inputs to the md5 algorithm that will despite being different inputs yield the same hash value as a result

2718555
hash	md5
this is indeed how people are able to break hash functions including md5 which is it turns out not a very good cryptographic hash function

2718555
hash	md5
all you need to do is take the md5 of those password and compare it with some hash and if they match then it is a pretty reasonable guess that it came from that password

2718555
hash	md5
you may also be interested in reading about one-to-one functions injective functions cryptographic hash functions md5 sha1 and don t hash secrets from the benlog security blog

2718621
stdout	stderr
i am however printing to stdout and stderr from java

2718718
stdout	stderr
this will brief you all the details about capturing and discarding stdout and stderr

2718748
min	max
where only min max coordinates are known for the boundingbox cube

2718748
min	max
static indices array of 12 triangles which can be defined by min max vertices of the cube

2718750
submit	submission
4 user submit a form and then browser starts to unload current page and load page with results of form submission

2718810
implements	extends
the key is that the myhandler class extends the defaulthandler class which implements the contenthandler interface and overrides the empty implementations of each callback method

2718835
filtering	grouping
you can create an object from each item containing it s index then grouping on the value and filtering out the grouping containing more than one object

2718841
error-handling	exception-handling
there are other advantages to exception-handling compared with conditionals exception-handling separate error-handling from other code

2718854
mp3	wav
creating an avi file is actually pretty easy - you basically just set a frame rate and dump in a bunch of bitmap files then add a wav or mp3 file or files for the audio and that s it

2718864
mvp	presenter
for ex in case of mvp not asp.net mvc architecture the presenter should always bind the model and view

2718884
hash	md5
the next part of the url is the hexadecimal md5 hash of the requested user s lowercased email address with all whitespace trimmed

2718891
sorting	filtering
but sorting and filtering wouldn t work

2719018
stdout	stderr
however i want to just redirect the stdout to some filehandle no stderr

2719024
folder	directory
as part of my mvc directory setup i place libraries outside the project in their own folder structure and add references to those libraries

2719035
jobs	cron
if you are running on a shared hosting server look for the possibility of setting up timed actions cron jobs

2719048
hash	md5
also since multiple strings can create the same md5 hash due to it being less data than the input string how would any other hashing system be any better

2719048
hash	md5
an attack is known against md5 which makes it possible for the attacker to create multiple documents with different contents but the same md5 hash

2719048
hash	md5
like md5 it is a hash function in which the output is not reconstructable from the input but given any output it is trivial to construct a document with a given crc-32 or crc-64 signature

2719048
put	get
worse you can put any text you like in such a document then get the crc you want just by adding junk at the end

2719113
ftp	telnet
another doubt is that can i use a tcp server socket without using http or ftp or telnet session

2719127
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you should place the redirect inside the definition for example.com in the httpd.conf or equivalent instead of .htaccess

2719129
hash	md5
compute the md5 or sha1 hash

2719162
hash	md5
will be false when the url fails to load otherwise it will return the md5 hash of the contents

2719190
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
in jquery 1.3.x only the following javascript events in addition to custom events could be bound with .live click dblclick keydown keypress keyup mousedown mousemove mouseout mouseover and mouseup

2719202
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
major upgrade which will uninstall the old versioning so you need to be aware of this

2719204
int	chars
with native types the compiler knows that when is called it should promote the chars to int and call rather than casting the int to chars for example

2719263
mp3	wav
as a former contributor to the jlayer mp3 library i m fairly sure that it doesn t do wav to mp3 - just mp3 playback and conversion to wav

2719283
folder	dir
after few days a source config dir has changed and i am wondering how to diff that folder in 2 projects to apply that changes in new project

2719351
punctuation	words
you might miss words if they are split by other punctuation

2719418
spaces	delimiter
the difference is that with this solution spaces are accepted with spaces are treated as delimiter iirc

2719484
vsts	tfs
there are a lot of third party add-ins for vsts to enhance the tfs experience thankfully as raw tfs provides very basic and clumsy ui and you can use the api to write your own tools to query the tfs database too so you shouldn t have too much of a problem getting a dashboard thta you find useful

2719520
dreamweaver	aptana
aptana is actually what i replaced dreamweaver with since adobe bought macromedia i use it on windows and linux without trouble

2719567
user-controls	tabcontrol
in my case i had a button and a listview within a groupbox that was inside a splitcontainer which was within a user-controls on a tabcontrol

2719615
int	chars
as byte the same as unsigned chars - 1 byte unsigned int and nsinteger the same as int - 4 bytes signed int are both of simple int types and can be converted automatically

2719631
git-rebase	amend
you can try a git-rebase --interactive session to amend your old commit provided you did not already push those commits to another repo

2719631
git-rebase	amend
by replacing the command pick with the command edit you can tell git-rebase to stop after applying that commit so that you can edit the files and or the commit message amend the commit and continue git-rebase

2719651
httpresponse	request
the only limitation is that views themselves have to take a request object and return a subclass of httpresponse

2719672
public	protected
there is no limit to how many of these access qualifiers public private protected you can have in a class

2719672
public	protected
for example i might want all the member functions public protected or private declared before the say private data members

2719678
redhat	fedora
redhat uses publican for all their docs as does the fedora project

2719680
int	chars
i have a uitextfield in my ib and i want to check out if the user entered only numbers no chars and get the int value

2719686
public	protected
as marcelo says you can use the public private and protected qualifiers as many times as you wish

2719705
rtp	rtsp
in general rtp rtsp should work pretty easily

2719772
post	get
alternatively and generally more usual if it is an html form you will need to deconstruct the form fields from the original html and send those as key value parameters in the http get post request

2719832
boost	stl
why is having an overloaded prohibited for classes stored in stl containers while the boost addressof workaround exists

2719838
google-chrome	firefox
this particular quirk is one part of a tax calculation that doesn t get sent to the browser in ie for pc and google-chrome firefox for the mac

2719838
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it s not in the output source in the browsers but is in firefox google-chrome and opera on the pc

2719841
google-chrome	firefox
the list in the left side of the page the names of the cities are correctly displayed in firefox and google-chrome even ie8 but in ie7 and ie6 the list disappears

2719884
pyexcelerator	xlrd
how can i go about creating a worksheet within an excel workbook with a pivot table using python libs like pyexcelerator xlrd

2719902
jobs	cron
you need to find out where the crontab script is located try crontab -e for a list of currently defineded cron jobs and start it uing a php system or exec command

2719910
width	height
i have a flash object which im currently displaying with 100 width height fullscreen

2719918
put	get
if you write you have stated that this set must only contain string s and will get a compilation error if you try to put something else in there

2719947
mouse	keyboard
when pressing the c on keyboard the navigation makes the same as i go with my mouse over that navigation and the point over categories

2719959
ready	each
i have build scripts that builds test version and packages my projects as artifacts to a staging area for each of our environments ready for a versioned release to a given environment and labels the changeset

2719960
min	max
the nserror error codes documentation defines errors for both max and min validation fails

2719978
google-chrome	firefox
i ve started to add http support to a custom c# non-webserver application which seems to work fine from firefox ie google-chrome when typing in the url directly to the browser - where i can see a returned text string in the page from my application

2719978
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is when i try do the same from a httprequest in javascript on a web page i don t get a response with google-chrome or firefox it s fine in ie - rather i get a status of zero from the httprequest object

2719978
post	get
i ve swapped between trying different post and get requests to no avail - eg

2720057
post	get
i followed this blog post on how to get the build working and i m almost there

2720062
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
common frameworks that do work on app engine include django web2py and pylons

but i need to show only if i stay inside 3sec and it need to hide there after again i stay back 3sec

2720150
vim	gedit
i have a dsl for which i intend to create a syntax highlighter for editors like vim gedit and netbeans

2720167
mouseover	mouseenter
this is only a guess but it could be to do with your use of mouseover instead of mouseenter

2720167
mouseover	mouseenter
try changing your mouseover event to mouseenter instead

2720167
setinterval	settimeout
i would also consider changing setinterval to settimeout as setinterval will set a timer to run a function recurring every 3 seconds here unnecessarily applying the .css again

2720173
persistent	transient
using the id of an entity is not a good idea because transient entities don t have an id yet and you still want a transient entity to be potentially equal to a persistent one

2720197
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this all is working fine in firefox only but not in other browsers like safari google-chrome and ie .given below is the code

2722311
put	get
if you re creating a windows executable put the data into a binary resource in the executable instead of just encoding it into an array -- you can then use normal windows resource functions findresource loadresource etc. to get the data though this is a bit trickier to get working correctly than it initially seems like it should be

2722320
writetofile	nsdata
once all the operations are joined you can simply write the mutable data to a file using the writetofile convenience methods on the nsdata class

2722341

where is evaluated before grouping ing and sum ming happens having evaluates on the result set after records are filtering and grouping

2723740
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari opera google-chrome and on the iphone ipad i capture a keyup event on a text input box like this

2723740
keydown	keyup
on the droid however neither this keyup nor an equivalent keydown event fires until the user backspaces over every character in this

2723749
memcpy	strcpy
there are a bunch of functions in string.h which return the destination parameter memcpy strcpy strcat

2723805
folder	directory
ability to get all the files and folder in a folder and potentially also the entire directory tree

2723805
children	parent
tree traversal getting the parent all children etc

2723914
unix	bsd
you may still need to do a little os specific coding in java for this though as you ll probably not find the same system calls available in windows and unix linux bsd os x

2723955
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ are treating static inline a little differently

2723978
google-chrome	safari
however in webkit tried mac safari and google-chrome the right hand edge loses its little shadow entirely

2723994
pop-up	dialog
however this is not that useful because it halts the program and pop-up a dialog box until a user presses something

2724041
width	height
i m using the jquery ui button control but don t seem to be able to adjust the size width and height

2724088

i ve noticed there is no onclientclick property for the radiobuttonlist in the asp.net control set

2724112
swt	swing
anything java and in desktop gui style is fine gwt swing swt

2724151
profiling	debugging
it uses the debugging and profiling api to capture the stack traces of the threads in a running .net application without the need to modify the application

2724197
int	double
i am confused because in this case we are downcasting from a bigger double to a smaller int but in case of classes we downcast from a smaller base class to a bigger derived class

2724213
int	double
the primitives int and double are not objects in c++ and are not related to each other in the way two objects in a class hierarchy are

2724218
int	double
no you do not downcast since double and int are not classes

2724233
put	get
i put that url in the edit box and get an error

2724234
int	double
int and double are both primitives and not classes so the concepts of classes don t apply to them

2724245
nhibernate	automapper
i am using automapper in my project along with nhibernate and asp.net mvc 2

2724252
folder	directory
is there a way for a qt application to find out the directory corresponding to where drop event occurred when the icon was dropped onto the desktop or into an open folder window

2724323
getter	setter
you can even make the accessibilty of the setter and getter difference

2724323
getter	setter
if you do choose to use auto-properties be aware that you cannot access the underlying field nor can you supply an implementation for just one portion just the getter or just the setter

2724329
hide	show
so i had to show it first set scrollleft then hide it again

2724336
put	get
normally it s a great thing to put on a resume to get you a paying gig

2724358
width	height
you can see that i pass in the url as well as the height h and width w of the window

2724359
floating-point	integer
i know that modern computers have all a standard integer format but i have heard that they may not all use the ieee standard for floating-point integers

2724372
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stdout first then stderr

2724405
udp	rtp
rtp typically uses udp which is inherently lossy

2724437
inherited	properties
it s a properties of uiscrollview from which uitableview inherited

2724465
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream is the standard way to do this in c++

2724465
ostringstream	std
i d say the real problem with the std ostringstream solution is not about efficiency

2724527
post	get
enable asp.net asmx web service for http post get requests

2724601
post	get
however if i post my editted data to the second action i get the following error

2724602
margin	height
with a fixed height footer like yours that is easy to fix using a bottom margin on the page body and some more absolute positioning for the footer

2724638
setcontentview	findviewbyid
then you can access any inflated views in your activity after calling setcontentview by using findviewbyid in conjunction with the automatically generated r.java

2724660
nsbutton	nspopupbutton
nspopupbutton nsbutton nscontrol

2724722
int	chars
so i ran this with chars int ci

2724722
int	chars
also why is the jump for chars so much larger then int and a structure that contains both an int and chars

2724734
width	height
i also tried using height inherit and width inherit instead of specifying a size

2724743
post	get
you can then use other command line options to get just the frames you want or do some other post processing like resizing or deinterlacing

2724792
onresume	onpause
if you aren t familiar with onpause onresume read up on the activity lifecycle

2724792
onresume	onpause
i don t think your cursor would persist across the onpause onresume since they re generally closed in onpause to avoid memory issues

2724821
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
premake can generate project files for visual studio monodevelop sharpdevelop xcode code blocks codelite and plain gnu make and it supports building c# c++ and c projects for tons of platforms from unix linux osx windows to crosscompiling for playstation 3 and xbox 360

2724951
strncmp	strcmp	strncmp	strlen	strlen	strcmp
you need to use strncmp rather than strcmp and set the comparison length equal to strlen search

2724980
width	height
i belive that what is going on is glteximage2d can sometime handle width and height that are not a power of 2 but can then scale the input image thus filter it

2724995
post	get
url post get controll name - router.php

2724997
ffmpeg	libavformat
also you could interface directly to the ffmpeg libraries libavformat and libavcodec

2725000
boost	allocator
when you do care about allocator behaviour you should always use a special purpose allocator boost pool something you write yourself etc.

2725005
setcontentview	findviewbyid
at first i was about to post a stupider question as to why this is happening a quick test of playing with the setcontentview made me realize the cause of findviewbyid returning null i just do not know how to remedy this issue

2725062
post	get
sorry don t have time to recode it and post but that should just about get you started nicely

2725066
postgresql	mysql
i saw the same question posted but for postgresql and tried to adapt it to mysql but so far no success

2725088
int	double
during the instanciation of myclass i pass a big vector vector int and i find that the object is actually copied and not only the reference so it takes the double of the memory .

2725102
client-side	server-side
i tried both server-side and client-side redirect with the expected results

2725105
int	boolean
edit2 then again it is probably worth noting that while the boolean values themselves always convert to zero or one a number of functions especially from the c standard library return values that are basically boolean but represented as int s that are normally only required to be zero to indicate false or non-zero to indicate true

2725126
google-chrome	firefox
have two different browsers google-chrome and firefox that each have a different cookie and then visit the same captcha url and you will get two different images

2725128
min	max
as i recall early delphi 1 had a bug where the results of min and max were reversed

2725140
persistent	transient
it should be persistent the transient value because of your cascade type

2725140
persistent	transient
if you are actually trying to persistent the first element before you ve set the other transient element then you d expect this error

2725143
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
first of all you should use svcutil.exe not wsdl.exe unless you have no other choices

2725176
stdout	stderr
otherwise it will just run as a foreground process logging to stdout and stderr

2725177
boost	allocator
for small allocator boost has a very simple allocator i ve used called boost simple_segregated_storage

2725188
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox and friends the results are as i d expect

2725201
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

2725209
width	height
the div had a fixed height and width so can we do something with that

2725237
width	height
you can use different overflow values in css auto should cause a scrollbar to appear when text is bigger than the height width will allow or hidden to cut it off

2725240
post	get
did you verify that the call from jquery is actually a post and not a get

2725245
stdout	stderr
2 1 is to redirect stderr to stdout as strace writes to stderr by default

2725283
screens	tablet
having a large-size tablet computer is also a significant departure from touch screens smart phones

2725287
dictionary	map
the new dictionary will map values to lists of values

2725296
rss	feed
i have a c# project that plays morse code for rss feed

2725309
fgets	fread
you use fread as well which is faster than fgets and which reads the file in chunks of a specific size that you can define

2725345
rss	feed
got an established libsyn rss feed got a new drupal website for the podcast

2725345
rss	feed
just want to use the mp3player modulee s flash player in a drupal page which feed the latest mp3 file from a libsyn rss feed

2725397
width	height
the height 437px and width 700px of the image is greater than the dimensions of your div

2725397
width	height
set an appropriate height and width for your div to allow for the image to be shown

2725416
width	height
since you re setting height and width to 100 the amount of the image you see will depend on the divs containing the yellow class

2725416
width	height
try changing the width and height on the status class and you will actually see your the bg image on yellow

2725426
restrict	shared
prior to 3.5 sp1 if you try to run an app from a network shared it will run with restrict permissions

2725470
google-chrome	firefox
if you use firefox or google-chrome as your browser then you could write a greasemonkey script that would change the page s appearance for each admin console

2725532
post	get
cocreateinstance clsid_createcapturegraph2 and post up the code you use in cocreateinstance and any hresult value you get returned

2725536
suppressfinalize	finalizer
and with reference to your unmanaged code note it s a finalizer that s typically implemented for that although dispose and suppressfinalize are typically called to free up the resources sooner.

2725620
gauge	progress
for large files you ll definitely want to provide some kind of progress gauge for end-users

2725642
aggregate-functions	sum
one way to do is to exploit the aggregate-functions usually sum and count help you the most in this situation along with mysql s if function

2725657
min	max
my first thought was a groupby id and then do some min and max with the arrival and departure but the 01 01 1753 value is messing aronud

2725683
google-chrome	firefox
you can probably achieve whatever it is you are wanting to do by using the firefox firebug plugin google-chrome s development tools or the firefox greasemonkey plugin

2725696
pow	sqrt
change pow r2 -1.5 to 1 r2 sqrt r2 to lower the cost of the computing r 1.5

2725701
x86	64bit
again assuming this is intel x86 if you have a 64bit cpu then build a 64bit executable if you re not already - the extra registers can make a noticeable difference around 30

2725707
uiview	calayer
on the iphone content is drawn into a calayer or into a uiview s backing calayer using quartz drawing calls or from a bitmapped image

2725712
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
apart from straightforward add subtract divide multiplying pow is the only heavyweight function i see in the loop body

2725717
openjpa	datanucleus
jpa compliant alternatives to hibernate include toplink essentials the ri in java ee 5 eclipselink which is also the ri of jpa 2.0 in java ee 6 openjpa datanucleus

2725738
mouse	keyboard
it does work when i connect keyboard mouse and monitor to the mini and work on it directly however it is a lot more convenient for me to run it through a vnc connection

2725769
mp3	wav
once i ve got this wav data it won t be too far of a stretch to convert it to an mp3 woo

2725796
folder	dir
you can use the dir command to get a list it is actually a structure array of the files in a given folder

2725815
zlib	libtiff	zlib	libpng	libtiff	libpng
i m trying to use a library named dcmtk which used some other external libraries zlib libtiff libpng libxml2 libiconv

2725895
jquery	livevalidation
let s say your page header includes menu livevalidation and jquery

2725957
webkit	gecko
and there is lixto its eclipse based and uses mozilla gecko as rendering engine unless they already changed it to webkit as they said they ll do years ago

2725993
content-length	content-type
if you can ensure that the http content-length and content-type headers are present in the upload request or in the multipart body when it s a multipart form-data request then it would be an easy job with help of randomaccessfile

2726006
centos	linux
even on the same platform i ve tried windows xp 7 and centos linux some work some don t.

2726053
width	height
if you reduce the size of height and or width then it works fine

2726055
next	except
it works except for just one problem that when i select or press one list item it seems that the selected item overlap the next one a little bit as i can see some pixels of the green background image is on the top of next item

2726057
hash	md5
so you can tell someone here is a file and here is its md5 hash

2726057
hash	md5
if the file has been corrupted during then the md5 hash will be a different value

2726057
hash	md5
in practice a hash function will always produce a value of the same size for instance md5 is will alway return 128bits no matter the size of the input

2726057
hash	md5
md5 sha0 and sha1 are all vulnerable to a hash collision attacks and should never be used for anything security related

2726105
hash	salt
i ve got the general approach concatenate my information user name product version a salt into a string and generate a sha1 hash from that then encrypt the hash with my private key

2726130
int	double
i have implemented an insertion sort in a double link list highest to lowest from a file of 10 000 int and output to file in reverse order

2726134
centos	linux
type following command to install tree command on rhel centos and fedora linux

2726134
debian	mint	debian	linux	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
if you are using debian ubuntu mint linux type following command in your terminal

2726135
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing simply needs to call a constructor in the superclass

2726135
public	protected
if the superclass has a public or protected no-arg constructor this is called automatically otherwise you need to be explicit

2726138
subtract	add
note that i performed the query on an postgresql database - maybe the syntax differs on ms-sql-server maybe at the alias from one as o1 perhaps and maybe you cannot add subtract in that way

2726179
keydown	keyup
record the keydown and keyup events and do a diff on the timestamps of each

2726193
lisp	scheme
or my personal favorite use macros if your language supports it scheme and lisp

2726193
lisp	scheme
i think lisp scheme macros would solve many of these problems

2726199
keydown	keyup
you won t see keydown keyup events like you could if you trapped x events but it s probably easier especially if you re just running in a console or terminal

2726201
keydown	keyup
if your languages environment has interactive keyboard support that offers keydown and keyup events then you catch both events and time the difference between them

2726203
memcached	apc
is there a way to disable memcached apc as a page directive rather than at the server level

2726222
rss	feed
i m trying to build a firefox extension which can get rss feed and display them in a popup panel

2726246
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
webkit browsers google-chrome and safari and apparently firefox 3.6 now support css gradients

2726248
happy	alex
edit i had to install cabal alex and happy from source but after that everything did seem to work fine

2726253
awt	swing
it looks like all of the classes belong to your application so i am guessing you are working with awt or swing

2726263
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the sample code below displays as intended in google-chrome safari and firefox

2726276
actionlistener	focuslistener
i d use an actionlistener on the text field but a focuslistener should workâ just don t rely on the the order in which treeselectionlistener events arrive

2726334
margin	height
if javascript is an option you can calculate the height of your content box and set a top margin according to the formula you prefer

2726337
internationalization	translation
the django internationalization system will automatically insert the correct translation for you if you provide the translation files

2726374
int	chars
random_integer is an int you are comparing it to a bunch of chars from the ascii chars set - 1 as a chars literal is actually 49 in decimal

2726376
int	chars
1 does not mean int 1 rather it is chars 1 which translates ascii to int 49

2726377
pop-up	dialog
when you click the button a confirmation dialog is supposed to pop-up but it doesn t show in my webview

2726377
pop-up	dialog
anyone know how to handle pop-up dialog coming from a webpage inside your webview

2726386
erd	diagram
i am trying to define db dependency for a web based application and was thinking that perhaps the hibernate mappings used in the application might be importable into some sort of tool to produce a visual erd diagram

2726388
folder	directory
another option is to create the folder blank on the repository directory and then checkout just that folder to where you want it

2726476
post	get
all of the form fields display correct but when i submit a post i get an error

2726479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have been having some serious issues trying to get this web page i have been working on working correctly with ie7 firefox google-chrome safari ie8 all work fine

2726480
integer	unsigned
most machines actually store the 16-bit value in a 32-bit integer and that is handled with unsigned arithmetic

2726482
button	checkbox
the above sample code works now i need to create a grid with a column with checkbox so that i can click a couple of those checkbox and click delete button it should get all the id in which the checkbox are checked to and create a delete query and execute

2726503
pop-up	dialog
in order to handle a pop-up confirmation coming from a webpage in your webview you need to override the onjsconfirm method in webchromeclient to display the pop-up as an android alert dialog

2726513
setinterval	settimeout
i mean i ve seen shoutboxes that work surperb and doesn t seem to be using any setinterval or settimeout javascript functions to do this

2726513
setinterval	settimeout
can anyone suggest any ideas or an approach to this that doesn t use setinterval or settimeout

2726527
pull	push
in other words rather than a pull model - where the client pull data from the server - it is a push model where the client provides the sink stream and the server writes into it

2726529
children	parent
you can put an iframe on the parent entity that shows all the children entities

2726529
post	get
this post should get you pointed in the right direction

2726627
put	get
though you could get creative and put a space between the number as in 7 .alert but people would probably hunt you down for it when they get stuck maintaining your code

2726642
uilabel	uitextview
are there any features of the uitextview that you need that would not be available with a uilabel in a uiscrollview

2726644
memcpy	strcpy
some of the confusion with terminators would be mitigated if you used the usual c idiom for copying a string strcpy ptr hello n rather than memcpy

2726655
websphere	ibm
the default location for these is c program files ibm websphere mq tools jms samples and they include both pub sub and point-to-point examples

2726673
put	get
but in rails 3 everything s been changed around and no matter where i put that configuration line i get an undefined method or undefined object error

2726680
wav	riff
i used a memorystream and binarywriter to crib a wav file complete with the riff header and chunking

2726680
wav	riff
i also implemented a frequency property which re-generates the samples and uses the seek binarywriter trick to overlay the old data in the riff wav memorystream with the same number of samples but for a different frequency and again did the same thing for an amplitude property

2726684
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested with google-chrome 4.1.249.1064 45376 and firefox 3.6 on windows 7 ultimate and they both work fine

2726684
firefox	safari
as do both safari 4 and firefox 3.6 on osx 10.6.3

2726684
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and here is the offending bit of code which works on google-chrome firefox and safari just fine

2726722
ord	chr
ps many answers including mine at one point used chr ord c + 2

2726722
ord	chr
to avoid the typeerror you could use chr ord c + 2 256

2726809
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
another situation that makes the choice easier is when you want to use aggregate-functions like sum min max etcetera and complex queries like in the financial system mentioned above then a relational database is probably more convenient then a nosql database since both are not possible on a nosql databse unless you use really a lot of inverted indexes

2726811
put	get
to put it another way suppose you have a shopping list of items you want to get

2726947
int	boolean
i guess its because the operator xor is defined for boolean and int

2726962
openssl	m2crypto
if you try this with a cert that you created with openssl command line tools for example the server.pem in tests directory sans the key and text by loading and saving it with m2crypto you should get identical files

2726983
webkit	gecko
gecko webkit and opera all wait until they encounter html that matches a css rule with a fontstack including the font-face font

2727022
int	chars
i have a problem getting a chars from the user in vc++.the function i want to use uses the chars format so when i get the input using getch it gives me an error that can t convert int to chars

2727050
slideup	slidedown
i m currently using the jquery slidedown slideup effect and am not accomplishing what i want

2727050

md5 message-digest algorithm and returns that hash

2727143
teamcity	nant
i would recommend teamcity - free for up to three agents 20 projects and 20 users runs a variety of builders nant included and can parse nunit results hudson can do all this too i believe however i have no used it so i can t speak from experience

2727153
width	height
so i would like to hard code the framelayout width height to match the dimension of the image

2727173
many-to-one	one-to-many
addparent and addchild seemed quite logical for the many-to-one one-to-many and addsuperclass for one-to-one inheritance but addmanytomany would sound quite unintuitive to an object-oriented programmer

2727277
ant	maven
a new developer machine needs a variety of software java eclipse ant maven svn client are there any scripts or tools which will set the environment path variables after retreiving the software from binary distributions

2727287
int	double
it seems like a simple problem to resolve for int but for double and floats the solutions i have found won t work

2727297
floating-point	fractions
it might not be the answer you re looking for but floating-point numbers are not suited to financial calculations because fractions like 1 100 cannot be represented exactly

2727341
free	malloc
fault address occurred when i malloc pthread_t to save a newly created thread id and free it in another thread

2727364

2727372
gwt	dwr
try out extjs as your presentation this can be incorporated with struts or spring mvc it has a very rich ui library which would enable you to do all kind of operations alternatively you can also use ajax with dwr dwr has its own ways of populating the grids and do different operations gwt flex are also some of the product

2727513
hide	show
i would like to show hide certain fields in my drupal view accordingly to the user role

2727549
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
where id is just autoincrement username is a varchar of 20 or so depending on your needs and password is an md5 or sha1 hash password with a salt

2727554
hash	salt
just store their salt hash

2727565
hash	salt
just make sure that you are storing passwords in a hash form using a secure hash like sha-2 and a salt

2727581
folder	directory
or alternatively you may create a symbolic from artifacts folder pointing to phpcb s output directory

2727601
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is a pseudo event for mouseenter and mouseleave

2727602
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events

2727602
mouseleave	mouseenter
so inorder to unbind you will have to unbind mouseenter and mouseleave

2727603
folder	directory
this will extract the framework files to a folder named â œwcuâ in the current directory

2727604
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover is a wrapper for mouseenter and mouseleave

2727652

so the clearest explanation i see is this qplaintextedit does not inherit from qtextedit

2727853
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
the documents used by qplaintextedit use qplaintextlayout objects and qtextedit has something else that i cannot determine

2728122
versioning	upgrade
however you won t be able to open the newly upgrade solution file in previous versioning of visual studio so back these up first if you want to retain them - though it may be possible to hack the .sln files to go back if really necessary

2728122
versioning	upgrade
personally i think you just need to bite the bullet and upgrade everything - it s not really practical for people to use different versioning for the same solutions

2728129
try-catch	exception-handling
i recently moved from netbeans to eclipse and i very much miss one great feature - whenever i use method which throws some kind of exception-handling netbeans alerted me and i needed to add try-catch and netbeans automatically generated exception-handling type for me

2728218
google-chrome	firefox
...whereas firefox and google-chrome are pretty close to your original

2728219
rss	feed
however when this method is used in an rss feed it seems that feedburner and google reader at least maybe other feed readers too strip the whole object tags and only leave the alternative content

2728235

inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
of course if you don t want overriding the one and not the other to work you can simply make this an error in your metaclass. you can do the same thing as the metaclass using class decorators in python 2.6 and later but it would mean requiring the class decorator on every subclassing of base -- class decorators aren t inherited

versioning	upgrade
you upgrade the app in the market to versioning 2

2728558
google-chrome	safari

nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
eclipse relies on compiler errors to suggest try catch exception and numberformatexception extends runtimeexception which does not give an error if it s not surrounded by try catch block to avoid putting everything in blocks - think of nullpointerexception which is also a runtimeexception and everything that can cause it

2728650

from what i understand an assembly specifically built for x86 and running in a 64bit operating system can only load libraries built for x86 or a badimageformatexception will be thrown

2728678
x86	64bit
in a 64bit os an assembly built for any cpu or x64 will throw the same exception when trying to load an x86 library

i know actually learned today about levenshtein distance soundex and metaphone algorithms but currently not having a solid idea to implement this to querying against database

2731175
late-binding	early-binding
in closure terminology python s closures are late-binding not early-binding .

2731175
late-binding	early-binding
fortunately it s fairly easy to make a late-binding closure into an early-binding closure

2731200
mouse	trackpad
you don t want to be doing too much dev because of the small screen though it was only really an issue for me because i got sick of the trackpad and didn t have a separate mouse but it s honestly pretty fast and easy to use for .net mvc development in visual studio

2731208
sorting	grouping
if i ve determined that a new grouping has started if the previous item started with a different letter than the current item and i am sorting alphabetically and grouping by letter then i inject the appropriate html markup into a literal control in the itemtemplate to create the visual grouping

2731211
zlib	libtiff	zlib	libpng	libtiff	libpng
so i need to build the support libraries zlib libtiff libpng libxml2 libiconv with multithreaded dll md multithreaded dll debug mdd run-time options

2731274
sorting	grouping
this has built in support for sorting and a kind of grouping whilst still offering the layout flexibility you get with a repeater

2731296
public	protected
the goal behind having public private protected methods is to encapsulate logic and make it easy to change parts of your code without having to worry about how one function or class interacts with another

2731297
post	get
and which request type get or post should i use to send json data when using client side xmlhttprequest

2731306
post	get
your second question is easy get has a size limitation of 1-2 kilobytes on both the server and browser side so any kind of larger amounts of data you d have to send through post

2731321
delphi	oxygene
3 as jamiei suggest translate the c# or vb .net code to delphi prism is not difficult you can use the c# to oxygene tool or you can do it manually

2731338
post	get
server-side there s no reason to use the raw input unless you want to grab the entire post get data block in a single go

2731343
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me on google-chrome opera firefox .

2731350
for-loop	loops
this code accomplishes exactly the same thing as your original for-loop except it uses logical tests to determine whether or not it should continue to loops

2731379
google-chrome	firefox
i have an issue in ie6 but not ie 7 firefox or google-chrome

2731384
for-loop	arrays
i can implement this by splitting the second arrays and compare it in a for-loop but i was wondering if there is something similar to path.combine available or if this can be accomplished with regular expressions or linq

2731404
stdout	stderr
after you call fork you are not closing the standard streams stdin stdout stderr in the child process before your call to execve so they are still connected to rsh

2731404
daemons	systemd
the daemons convenience function exists in some unix systemd

2731404
daemons	systemd
the daemons function is for programs wishing to detach themselves from the controlling terminal and run in the background as systemd daemons

2731408
post	get
both are applied to a given url pattern security constraint can also be applied only to specific http methods get post ... so they are quite independent

2731449
width	height
the problem is that when a div is hidden it has no height or width

2731479
put	get
these things get a lot more obvious when you don t give different things the same name and also when you don t put classes in separate modules for their own sake

2731501
int	boolean
i seem to have an inordinate fondness for using boolean as int

2731506
java.util.date	simpledateformat
it depends entirely on the format of your string so i would use a simpledateformat to parse the string into a java.util.date

2731564
int	boolean
then there s setselection int position bool animate but the extra boolean on the end there doesn t appear to do anything

2731565
width	height
the user can include images in their markup and drag resize those images affecting the final width height attributes in the img tag

2731565
width	height
but one big problem is that i am now sending a possibly much larger image to the client only to have the browser resize the image into the requested width height attributes

2731565
width	height
so my solution is to pre-process my users markup content scanning all of the img tags and parsing out the height width src attributes

2731565
width	height
then set each img s src tag to a phpthumb request with the parsed height width passed into the thumbnails url

2731565
width	height
only img tags that need this processing will have an existing width height attributes with the double quotes and lower cased text but i suppose matching the text case insensitive would be better if tinymce changes

2731565
width	height
so a regex to match only the necessary img tags and maybe another three regex s to extract the src the width and the height

2731567
updatepanel	scriptmanager
solution would be either using ajax updatepanel and scriptmanager or removing

2731573
post	get
post vs get

2731659
int	chars
validates_length_of uses size method to find out length of the field and for the int it just gives you size of the variable in bytes which is probably 4 for first 11 chars and 8 for 12+

2731662
mouseleave	mouseenter
in your case add one action for mouseenter and one for mouseleave

2731673
mouse	keyboard
but instead of mouse if we simply use the arrow keys from keyboard the respective div id s are not showing

2731675
hash	md5
another option would be md5 which is a very strong hash practically secure but it is a 128-bit hash so you have the slight disadvantage of having to deal with 128-bit values

2731675
hash	md5
i would say md5 is overkill for these purposes-- as i say with a 64-bit hash you can deal fairly safely with in the order of a few million strings

2731675
hash	md5
sorry i should clarify -- md5 was designed as a secure hash it s just that it s since found not to be secure

2731678
cdr	cons
mccarthy s original lisp 1.5 programmer s manual did it with five functions car cdr cons eq and atom

2731742
int	double
first one is an int second is a string third is a double

2731742
int	double
now i know how to format the only problem i am having is parsing the string elements into their respected data types int string double

2731742
int	double
but that only separates each string into a new line and i couldn t for the life of me figure out how to have each line check if it s an int string or double

2731789
int	double
if you have lines with the format int string double you can do

2731824
google-chrome	safari
i have a rather strange bug which i can t make sense of that is apearing in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari

2731834
implements	extends
like mindas suggested you could extends abstractfield to implements this

2731836
actualheight	actualwidth
i think that the actualwidth or actualheight properties are not settable only gettable

2731847
int	boolean
and function s are primitives in actionscript much as int s or boolean s so there is no meaningful way to extend them

2731921
hide	show
now depending upon what data is typed into the textboxes i need the table trs tds to show or hide

2731934
hash	md5
in cases where you need to be absolutely sure you d use a real hash algorithm like sha1 md5 etc

2731946
bazaar	git
is there a git hg bazaar standard way of creating an environment like this and breaking out the projects into their own repositories

2731969
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and i am guessing other webkit browsers as well but there are weird selection issues in firefox so i m assuming its a non-standard practice that i should stay away from

2731976
folder	directory
i would like to be able to pass an xml file to an ant build script and have it create a folder structure mimicking the nodal structure of the xml using the build files parent directory as the root

2731979
public	protected
search bots won t be able to access to your protected pages while they ll access without problems to the public content as long as you don t explicitly disallow it on robots.txt

2731984
adplus	procdump
if you have a customer who is willing to work with you a bit it might shed some light on the situation to get a crash dump with adplus or maybe simpler with sysinternals procdump when the error message is showing

2731987
rss	feed
is there a way to have treat google serach results as an rss feed

2731990
converter	multibinding	division	subtraction
if you wanted to incorporate both division and subtraction in the same binding you would need to either create a special converter or use a multibinding which would also require you to create a special multibindingconverter

2731998
extjs	prototypejs	extjs	mootools	prototypejs	mootools
jquery mootools dojo extjs prototypejs and many other libraries provide a wrapper around javascript to abstract away browser differences and provide an easier interface to work with

2732008
google-chrome	firefox
when i click on the image in firefox ie it works as expected but does not work in google-chrome ver

2732031
width	height
that will match any image tag and if the src width and height attributes are present their values will be stored in groups 1 2 and 3 respectively

2732037
division	multiplication
if you know that icf isn t going to cause anything to go out of range and if your hardware can perform 3 multiplication faster than a division

2732043
switching	screens
granted that adds two extra objects to the screens but for some reason they all stay smoothed and scaled that way where as before switching sources was going from smooth to jaggidy and un-readable

2732047
folder	directory
if you site supports user s uploading files and they are stored inside the site s directory say in a folder called uploads then you would want to exclude such a folder from the source control

2732105
range	min
range validity check o min last-first container.end -first

2732140
width	height
i have to do the double source assignment because it appears that many images are lacking in width height parameters in the places where the microsoft bitmap loader expects them to be

2732193
multiplying	subtract
instead of subtract one-fifth why don t you just multiplying by .8

2732195
udp	tcp
the purpose of the application is to listen for a specific udp multicast and then to forward the data to any tcp clients connected to the server

2732276
eiffel	smalltalk
examples smalltalk eiffel ruby jade vb.net

2732288
super	self
it will work fine if you don t pass value to super namedinteger self .__init__

2732319
lisp	smalltalk
like smalltalk or lisp

2732333
inherited	subclassing
as of python 2.6 the preferred way to extend numeric types is not to directly inherited from them but rather to register your class as a subclassing of the number abstract base class

2732351
for-loop	arrays
now imagine that you realize after writing the above for-loop in 5 different metods that you are constantly inserting in the middle of the arrays and that a std list would be much better suited for the job

2732369
versioning	upgrade
class libraries that have been upgrade from earlier versioning of asp.net and that use membership types that have been moved might fail to compile when used in an asp.net 4 project

2732414
centos	linux
in linux centos 5.4 how do you force a process to stop locking a file system without killing the process

2732415
vsto	add-in
if i use project output in my setup the vsto add-in installs fine the first time

2732483
integer	fractions
a fractran program is an ordered list of positive fractions together with an initial positive integer input n

2732483
integer	fractions
for the first fractions f in the list for which nf is an integer replace n by nf

2732483
integer	fractions
repeat this rule until no fractions in the list produces an integer when multiplied by n then halt

2732490
twig	smarty
webbiedave s answer is perfectly fine but in the long run you should really learn to use either a decent template language smarty twig or a php framework that has it s own templating

2732490
codeigniter	kohana
kohana and codeigniter are both pretty easy to get into

2732610
gridview	rowdatabound
in your page you ll have to override the gridview s rowdatabound event find the time and convert it using datetime s conversion methods

2732612
nginx	lighttpd
nginx with x-accel-redirect or lighttpd with x-sendfile headers

2732642
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller with a uiviewcontroller vc1 as the root view controller

2732646
innodb	myisam
if you re running an alter table...add index command on an innodb table not so sure about myisam then it will just run and run as it copies the whole darn table lock-stock-and-barrel first if it s in the middle of copy to temp table then it s pretty much unstoppable

2732659
getter	setter
i have an object that has a lot of attributes each one with it s getter and setter

2732723
preorder	postorder
this produces the elements in a single flattened list much like preorder and postorder do and is the usual definition of a breadth-first traversal

2732825
hide	show
how efficient usable would it be to hide the cursor and show a png instead

2732854
sorting	filtering
bindinglistcollectionview does not support filtering nor sorting

2732857
prepare	execute
some people suppose that there s some overhead because you re making an extra round-trip from the client to the rdbms -- one to prepare the query the second to pass parameters and execute the query

2732899
implements	extends
i recommend you to extends an abstracttablemodel and implements an void addrow yourobject row that fits you

2733071
bellman-ford	dijkstra
bellman-ford + dijkstra shortest paths navigational systems

2733107
width	height
yes i know its a bad interface but you are only read a byte not the full width and height

2733131
rar	zip
since the files are all zip exe rar and so on the default handler isn t being applied and session state isn t available

2733152
uiview	calayer
on iphone or ipad someone know how we can get a cglayer not a calayer from an uiview

2733178
nsmutablestring	nsstring
also you can just use nsstring to get a formatted string no need to use nsmutablestring or cast it.

2733280
chunked	transfer-encoding
if i set the server to content-encoding gzip and transfer-encoding chunked will any svg viewers take advantage of that and render it partially as it is transferred

2733292
sorting	filtering
read the section sorting and filtering here

2733295
hide	show
i d like to click a header link and have the block directly underneath hide or show with slidetoggle

2733360
noscript	meta
since meta isn t allowed in the body of a page and noscript isn t legal in the head section perhaps the bots are just giving up on a page where they hit bad html

2733365
factors	matrix
you should do an lu or cholesky decomposition of the matrix depending on if your matrix is hermitian positive definite or not and then do back substitution with the factors

2733479
awt	swing
i also remember that when i worked with awt and swing i had some problems with using float or double like using point2d.float or point2d.double

2733492
implements	extends
yui compressor - initially i thought i would extends the yui compressor to do this but found that it is implements as a bunch of regex s and not a parser

2733550
cpu	affinity
you can use the data in the proc filesystem to get cpu affinity info for running processes

2733579
int	boolean
all int types including boolean except long are stored as 4 byte int in the java memory model unless stored in an array

2733589
voip	sip
i m trying to build a voip application and would like to add a sip address name domain field to it

2733601
multiplication	modulo
hashes boil down to multiplication and modulo operations which means that you never want to use numbers with common factors if you can help it

2733640
factors	matrix
you can also write shaders etc that do more complicated math factors in multiple vectors and matrix and what-not but this is the basic idea.

2733686
rel	src
i ve also tried to add the src path as a rel attribute to the label but also without any success

2733688
javadb	hsqldb
which of the following databases is best for a big desktop application firebird javadb hsqldb

2733710
webkit	gecko
for example if the browser was trident presto or gecko return null whereas if the browser is webkit return it s version number

2733728
put	get
of course the other method to accomplish this would be that when i make each cell i iterate over the events json and apply the appropriate html to the cell at the time but that means repetitively running over the entire json in order to get the event to put in the cell

2733732
folder	directory
i ve been playing around with trying to load the files into strings via the apache readfiletostring but i can t figure out how to load files from a specific folder within the webapp s content directory without hardcoding it in and having to worry about it breaking if i deploy to a different system in the future

2733736

2733745
migrate	upgrade
upgrade the .net apps to vs2010 strip out all the common header footer controls and migrate the styles to use the style sheets used in the cms

2733749
folder	directory
but i can t figure out how to load files from a specific folder within the webapp s content directory without hardcoding it in and having to worry about it breaking if i deploy to a different system in the future

2733749
freemarker	velocity
as to the complete picture i question if you have ever considered an existing templating framework like freemarker or velocity to ease all the job

2733754
redmine	trac
my recommendation would be redmine or trac

2733756
folder	directory
but when i create a new application and try to add it to additional library directory i go to the exact folder and it does not show up

2733782
hash	md5
generating a signature is pretty much the same process all over create a md5 hash object then you digest all the bytes of interest then you extract the hash value

2733782
hash	md5
private key encryption of an md5 hash and save your self from all key provisioning and master secret exchange problems see rsacryptoserviceprovider.signhash

2733811
folder	dir
i have the file nav.php in a folder named includes in a main dir called testsite

2733845
setinterval	settimeout
a coding mistake i ve seen more than once is code that uses setinterval settimeout and the handle gets overwritten and the interval persists unexpectedly

2733962
mouse	keyboard
java.awt.robot class is used to take the control of mouse and keyboard

2733962
mouse	keyboard
once you get the control you can do any type of operation related to mouse and keyboard through your java code

2734004
getter	setter
objects can have members object variables and properties members with setter and getter

2734047
setinterval	settimeout
note to others commenters even though settimeout setinterval http-request onload events xhr and ui events click focus etc. provide a crude impression of multi-threadedness - they are still all executed along a single timeline - one at a time - so even if we don t know their execution order beforehand there s no need to worry about external conditions changing during the execution of an event handler timed function or xhr callback.

2734057
ant	maven
there are plugins for maven and ant that can help integrate this additional source into your build

2734063
superclass	subclassing
thing is i have a user superclass and two subclassing privateuser and businessuser

2734063
getter	setter
each field has its getter and setter

2734067
post	get
yes you re right.you should get data in the controller then display it in the view.and what you describe in your question is exactly like the example in the cookbook .assume you have related then with post hasmany comment you can find the count using

2734084
post	put
i decided to put it out explicitly here because although his link does have the answer to my question the post itself does not

2734108
post	get
i found a blog post which advocates mapper.reset to get round the problem however the static nature of the mapper class means that it is only a matter of time before a collision and crash occur

2734128
int	double
unfortunately they only have overloads for 2 args for int long float and double arguments

2734153
apache	nginx
the only scenario where can think this might occur given that cant see why django would generate a 502 is that you are using mod_wsgi embedded mode with nginx front end proxy and the apache server child process is crashing

2734154
inherited	properties
the line-height properties is inherited from parent to child - so specifying a line-height on will affect all elements on the page except the ones that have their own line-height properties set and their descendants

2734158
union	distinct
unfortunately the list of disqualifying query elements for auto-parameterization is long for example forget about using distinct top union group by or etc. so you really cannot count on this for performance

2734158
sorting	filtering
if the literal values change based on user actions for example like filtering or sorting viewed data then the queries will not benefit from caching except occasionally when they accidentally match a recent query exactly

2734167
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are examples or at least pseudo-examples of a host environment providing a way to do some concurrency even if it s not exactly concurrency

2734224
public	protected
what i ve done is created a class with only one protected int property and next i made a public method to set the int property to a given value

2734224
inherited	properties
the way i could think of doing this was to create a sub class to inherited said class and then create a method to get the int properties of the super class

2734224
getter	setter
p.p.s also i know it s a bad idea to expose the property instead of making it private and use public setter getter methods but i like it this way

2734241
subtraction	addition
furthermore it seems like you are only supplying one argument to your all your arithmetic methods addition subtraction etc although they require two

2734255
entities	entitymanager
3 to test its navigation properties properties that return other entities you first new an entitymanager our unit-of-work context-like container add or attach the entities to the em and off you go

2734255
entities	entitymanager
8 i can export an entitymanager s cache of test entities to file or a test project resource

2734285
superclass	subclassing
however one can generate subclassing of the type being processed or the superclass of the type being processed

2734378
hide	show
the way i have done it is in the function where i do an ajax post i show a dialog before the post and after the ajax post i hide it

2734399
width	height
width and or height of elements may grow or shrink by at most 1 pixel

2734456
maven	pom.xml
with maven it s just a case of opening the pom.xml file in the ide

2734456
maven	pom.xml
in tackling dependency issues maven makes any dependency tweaks explicit a change to your pom.xml overriding the dependency rather than implicit as is the case with manually managed jars in version control where the jars are simply present with nothing to support weather they are the correct dependency or not

2734543
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried in google-chrome and firefox

2734547
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both show it normally and even in firebug when i add padding-top it doesn t work

2734603
hash	md5
if you need a zero-setup option take microtime when the user is created convert it to a string and then hash that with md5 or some such

2734642
hash	md5
the md5 hash for that is 0a74d5fb3da8648126ec106623761ac5 so you might store it at.

2734685
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i don t think any browser obeys clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml for xmlhttprequest

uiview	subviews
i have a uiview called activityview which contains two subviews activityindicator and canceloperationsbutton

2734788
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you could go the c way and use malloc realloc but realloc will just allocate a new block copy the old stuff into the new stuff and free the old block sometimes anyway

2734860
drawrect	touchesmoved
basically in drawrect i will draw the line from touchesmoved as finger touches and i will call needsdisplayinrect for redraw

2734925
folder	directory
i have made a folder in joomla directory

2734941
equals	gethashcode
these structures make heavy use of gethashcode and equals

2734946
persistent	transient
it s no longer a detached entity but rather a transient one that just happens to have the same id as the persistent one and updated fields

2734946
persistent	transient
i could copy the fields from the transient entity to the persistent entity one by one but this doesn t work too well when it comes to relationships and i d have to handle version comparisons manually

2734949
equals	gethashcode
equals object and gethashcode

2734951
post	get
this is soley so that when people comment on a post users watching the post can get an email about it

2735045
switching	screens
in both these cases if you reduce the screens size say by switching to 800 by 600 resolution the button and every other screens element will appear proportionately larger

2737457
googletest	cppunit
googletest and cppunit seem to share somewhat the same syntax for invoking tests but as i suspect have too much differences in that syntax

2737457
googletest	gmock
i m almost sure you can t somehow automate it and this operation would require rethinking and recompositioning of your tests to follow the googletest semantics if you use something specialized to create your mocks then porting them to gmock would require even more effort simply because gmock s approach is not the obvious one and is actually complicated

using the user name or hash thereof as a salt leverages user name uniqueness usually on a given system at a given time user names are unique

2737638
hash	salt
however this does not prevent time-wise sharing the attacker precomputes a hash dictionary with the salt corresponding to user bob and will regularly try to guess bob s password assuming that bob changes his password on a regular basis because this is mandated by his system administrator

min	max
in c++0x numeric_limits will have everything marked with constexpr meaning you will be able to use min and max as compile-time constants

2738559
fileoutputstream	filewriter
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo

2738576
min	max
as others already mentioned numeric_limit s min and max simply aren t integral constant expressions compile time constants

2738585

versioning	upgrade
as a rule of thumb increase the versioning number when you move or export the code when you swap or exchange or upgrade between locations when you make a demo and after each feature or milestone and each time when you do a full backup

2738624
versioning	upgrade
the problems were fixed in newer versioning of oracle but we do not have those versioning and since there is no immediate plan to upgrade we have to code around this

2738627
min	max
also your two comparisons operators should be or equal since the min max values are also valid

2738627
min	max
you could try catching the exception and returning false but at that point it likely would be much faster to do the min max testing yourself

2738634

did you try tracing min and max to make sure that they are the numbers you think they are

2739077

if i have an image of which i know the height and the width how can i fit it in a rectangle with the biggest possible size without stretching the image

2740074
post	get
i don t get any errors so i m not sure what else to post

2740105
folder	directory
i know that when i want a viewresult using the view or partialview methods the default view engine will search through the folder in the views directory associated with the controller if my controller is called register it will look in the register folder under views and also in the shared folder

2740112
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my code works well in ie and firefox but the return false don t work in safari google-chrome and opera

2740112

click on the title in the balloon the link should open in a new window work in ie and firefox but not in safari google-chrome and opera

2740112
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
one on the left created with dom function as shown in this question which works in all browsers and one in the balloon created with an html string this one don t work well in safari google-chrome and opera the link is followed after the new window open even with the return false

2740125
typedef	struct
are you sure you haven t missed a typedef from before struct

2740128
inherited	properties
i would like to set up a table-per-hierarchy inherited mapping for the base sub1 sub2 relationships but using the disciminator properties from the joined class as the discriminator

2740132
width	height
determine the aspect ratio of both height divided by width say so tall skinny rectangles have an aspect ratio 1

2740142
minimum	max
it s not quite as simple as multiplying by the max and then adding the minimum value of course

2740177
innodb	myisam
if you weren t to require innodb on the servers you d have to do some more coding to rollback changes on myisam tables

2740180
terminate	timeout
retry the attempt if it fails until the console application terminate or a reasonably short timeout period expires

2740186
free	malloc
if you are actually using c++ you should consider using new and instead of malloc and free or better yet use std vector instead of an array as neil pointed out

2740197
post	get
while this isn t directly addressing your question the standard way to eliminate duplicate form submissions with the refresh button is post redirect get

2740205
subtract	add
then i recursively subtract the first and add the last value

2740239
pop-up	dialog
ideally in viewdidload i would like to perform some sanity checking and if it fails pop-up an error dialog and automatically close the current view remove from parent n.avigation controller

2740242
getter	setter
create a class that overrides the x and y setter and getter to handle the calculations

2740317
uiview	subviews
i have some a uiview with several user created subviews

2740341
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the error says that you re sending the message bytes to an instance of nscfstring which is a nsstring even though you declared it as a nsmutablestring because this is a dynamically typed language but the class types are not automatically converted if you try to cast it to something else

2740368
rpm	yum
i ve added a little groovy script in the maven build for my needs at the end to auto update a yum repository that hosts the builds but in your situation i d probably use the script before the rpm plugin is used to call make

2740374
fdt	swc
i ve made a library which i d like to compile to an swc file i ve tried to do this in fdt by choosing fdt as3 library as run settings but all i end up with is a 0kb .swc file

2740472
int	double
int or 0.0-1.0 double format

2740480
width	height
which will paint all the text red when the window width is less than its height

2740539
ati	nvidia
they also need to be tested on both nvidia and ati hardware to be sure they work properly

2740555
versioning	upgrade
how does one upgrade a client-created 1.4.3 repository to a 1.6.x compatible versioning without access to the underlying machine the repository resides on

2740564
post	put
i have put the code for the postscontroller commentscontroller and post index.html.erb below and also my view code but will post more if needed

2740568
google-chrome	safari
in any browser other than safari or google-chrome i can tab into a set of radio buttons and select one using the arrow keys and the change event will fire

2740568
google-chrome	safari
in safari or google-chrome i can tab into a radio group and select a radio button with arrow keys but the change event never fires

2740597
jython	pypy
other versions of python jython ironpython pypy etc may not behave in the same way

2740633
mouseout	mouseleave
i had it working with mouseout but when i entered over a child element the mouseout triggered so i know i need to use mouseleave

2740633
mouseleave	mouseenter
it seems functions won t work when i use mouseenter and mouseleave but

2740633
mouseover	mouseout
they do work when i swap them to mouseover and mouseout

2740662
range	max	range	min	min	max
are there any constants in t-sql like there are in some other languages that provide the max and min values range of data types such as int

2740662
range	infinity
i have a code table where each row has an upper and lower range column and i need an entry that represents a range where the upper range is the maximum value an int can hold sort of like a hackish infinity

2740670
cos	sin
so you would need to figure out the quadrant of the transform which 90-degree section of the circle it s in and take the reciprocal of the sin which is the cosecant and the reciprocal of the cos which is the secant of a and c of the matrix

2740686
min	max
setup a table that has three columns typename max and min

2740686
min	max
you can find all the max min values here

2740711
retaincount	dealloc
the dealloc method in my custom object gets called the nsdata object is released its retaincount 1 just before

2740753
hide	show
i am using a bit of javascript to show hide sections of a site when a tab is clicked

2740792
int	chars
the author probably one prone to writing obfuscated code may have wanted to ensure that a string of minimum of 5 chars converted to hex was not an considered an int

2740835
clearance	devise
sorry for this stupid questions i know what i can easy use any nice auth-plugins authlogic clearance devise but i want to fully understand sessions

2740837
mongoengine	ming
ming represents an interesting middle ground between pymongo and mongoengine though i haven t had the opportunity to take it for a test drive

2740838
free	malloc
technically speaking free is used to remove memory allocated using malloc from the heap

2740844
post	get
if you authorized your application to access your twitter account when the application was set in read only access mode and you get the read-only application cannot post error after changing the application settings to be read and write access then you have to revoke access to the application on and then reauthorize it

2740871
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up works fine but when the user hits enter the alert closes as expected but the textarea listener receives the enter event from the alert and pops the dialog up again

2740932
casting	autoboxing
looks like you are writing an integer through autoboxing to the serial file and attempting to read two objects casting them to biginteger

2740966
equals	gethashcode
this is weird because i ve overloaded equals and gethashcode on both the base class and the superclass

2740978
portrait	landscape
am i missing a parameter i need to set in order to ensure the imageview shows up in landscape instead of portrait

2740987
post	get
this blog post seems to be reporting a similar error but i still don t fully understand what i need to configure to get this fixed and also i am hoping that there is a simpler solution than another third party library

2740992
realloc	malloc
they key situation in which you must use malloc is if the original code ever calls realloc

2741011
disk	ram
with 4 gb of ram i should be able to save a lot of disk access and make it cpu-bound again no

2741041
children	parent
right now i have a db class that deals with connection and escaping values etc a parent db query class that deals with the common queries and methods and all of the other classes thread upload session photo and ones thats aren t used post user etc are children of that

2741043
clang	llvm
would llvm s clang compiler

2741048
free	malloc
also you should call mpz_clear at most once for every mpz_init they re like malloc and free in this regard and for the same reasons

2741048
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
small numeric optimization you can update last_row_pos using an addition and subtraction rather than two subtractions a multiplication and division

2741052
free	malloc
the key point on this is that what is allocated with new must be free with delete and what is allocated with malloc must be free with free

2741052
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
so about the only time you need malloc is when you need to pass data off to some c code that might free or realloc it

2741104
disk	ram
you can try installing some of those ram disk utilities and keep your obj directory on the ram disk or even whole project directory

2741113
int	double
one way to do it is to downcast your floats or double to int at the last possible moment when you need to pass the values to a method call

2741161
datamapper	activerecord
basically there is four prominent data source architectural patterns from patterns of enterprise architecture table data gateway row data gateway activerecord and datamapper

2741177
put	get
originally it was used inside the page now i ve put it in a file on its own and does not work anymore so i m dividing it in parts because i fail to get the whole thing

2741217
margin	height
the height of the div will be the paragraph without the margin

2741217
margin	height
the height of the div will be the paragraph plus its margin

2741219
int	boolean	int	chars
i m not allowed to use global variables and i must assume 32-bit int 16-bit chars and 8-bit boolean

2741228
mongoengine	ming
both mongoengine and ming depend on pymongo - they just put some nice functionality on top of it

2741252
children	parent
now when it copies over any related children it can look up the new parent pk to set the fk on the new record

2741256
daemons	systemd
for more on multiprocess and multithread models in relation to apache embedded systemd such as mod_python and mod_wsgi and mod_wsgi daemons mode see

2741295
mouse	keyboard
input emulation fake keyboard or mouse signals can be generated in lieu of direct human interaction

2741347
udp	tcp
good network support udp tcp

2741353
folder	dir
i have used the dir command in microsoft access 2003 to loop through the files in folder a

2741353
folder	dir
the problem is that checking for the file existing in folder b also uses the dir function and this then resets or confuses the original one with the result that no further files are found in folder a

2741360
fadein	fadeout
i want to fadeout the first div in a collection and then fadein the next div

2741360
fadein	fadeout
when it got to the nth content it would start over fadeout the nth content and fadein the first content

2741374
division	modulo
you could adopt j s somewhat nonstandard convention of for division because it kinda looks like the division symbol and | for modulo

2741402
inherited	properties
both entities don t share a common superclass to implement some kind of inherited with the id properties

2741407
width	height
i ve got a flex app running at 100 width and 100 height

2741441
google-chrome	safari
has anyone come across any of these issues with browsers such as google-chrome safari ff3 up and ie 7 up

2741442
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	lisp	scheme	ocaml	scheme
if you want to look at some powerful tools commonly used by academic language designers i suggest that you check out functional programming languages ml scheme lisp haskell ocaml scala clojure etc.

2741442
yacc	cup
tools off the shelf like yacc antlr flex and cup can make building your compiler easier like buying wood from a lumberyard to build your house is easier than going off into the woods and cutting down trees

2741444
int	boolean
the company i work for now uses a set naming convention for their c# variables such as isomename for int ssomename for string asomename for arrays bsomename for boolean dsomename for datetime and so on

2741476
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you name your new entity userclub you would need a one-to-many from user to userclub and from club to userclub and many-to-one from userclub to club and from userclub to user

2741506
jruby	mri
for example ruby have ruby mri interpreter jruby java .net ironruby etc

2741553
perl	tcl
thus c perl python ruby and tcl are born

2741553
haskell	scheme	lua	scheme
thus haskell lua ml pascal scala and scheme are born

2741553
lisp	scheme
for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash

2741565
webkit	gecko
en-us applewebkit 525.13 khtml like gecko version 3.1 safari 525.13 this regular expression would return webkit 525.13 webkit 525.13

2741573
inherited	properties
generally the way you do inherited in javascript is by assigning the child class s prototype properties to an instance of the parent object

2741573
inherited	subclassing
they re truly private not protected subclassing can t see them except by methods they inherited

2741589
concave	convex
if i run a convex hull algorithm on it it would not preserve the concave part of the polygon. unless i m mistaken

2741629
put	get
i can do a crude implementation where following every get i do a put

2741637
put	get
i want a centralized repo at each location as 1 i m new to git and do break my personal local repo by playing around and 2 some projects get put on hold so i want to be able to free up disk space by deleting them

2741691
put	get
simply put the convex hull is the shape you get if you put a rubber band around all of the vertices

2741693
for-loop	loops
i would also add that even if a declaration were allowed where you had it the variable would belong to the scope of the for-loop and so the variable would no longer be visible after loops out of the scope

2741755
post	get
1 this page does support post get i think it does

2741777
stdout	stderr
as a side effect you won t be able to see stdout and stderr without redirecting them to a log file.

2741784
for-loop	arrays
how would i print a 2d arrays in c using scanf for user input arrays called grid and a for-loop

2741784
strcpy	strcmp	strstr	strcpy	strstr	strcmp	strlen	strstr	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strcmp
functions allowed and should be included in the code string functions - strlen strcpy strcat strchr strcmp strstr

2741814
width	margin
imo this works better then using divs with the width style attribute especially when using it for dynamic resizing calculations the table will have a simpler dom which makes manipulation easier because corrections for padding and margin are not required

2741833
gitorious	gitosis
you can pay for a private github repository or roll out your own git repo on linux using gitorious or gitosis

2741833
pull	push
then the usb stick comes in and they pull push their changes

2741842
width	height
determine the height h s and width w s of the square you re placing

2741878
for-loop	arrays
if you don t do this then the variable basically gets passed in by reference and the index will exceed the bounds of the arrays at the very end of the for-loop which may happen long before the closure is ever executed

2741897
subtract	add
the way i think of it is like this a unit test establishes that the code does what you intended the code to do you wanted to add parameter a and b you in fact add them and don t subtract them functional tests test that all of the code works together to get a correct result so that what you intended the code to do in fact gets the right result in the system

2741898
int	chars
if the field is a byte chars short int compute int f

2741916
mouse	keyboard
i have solved this issue i used low level mouse hooks and low level keyboard hooks to implement the solution

2741949
hash	salt
the salt should definitely not be hash otherwise it s unusable

2741956
svcutil.exe	basichttpbinding
the solution to this was the simplest just change binding wshttpbinding to binding basichttpbinding in the service s web.config and the client s web.config or re-run svcutil.exe after changing the service s web.config

2741978
sorting	filtering
but i haven t found any that truly extend the control to the extent that you could have custom sorting with header images filtering by putting drop downs or textboxes in header columns on a column by column basis and custom paging one that doesn t return all records but just returns the ones requested for the given page

2742002
junit	jmock
i come from a java eclipse background and i fear that i am spoiled by how easy it is to get junit and jmock running in eclipse and have that gui with the bar and pass fail information pop up

2742003
width	height
it takes parameters for width height and bits per pixel and they are dwords 32-bit so do a search for 58 02 00 00 20 03 00 00 and 18 00 00 00

2742014
dictionary	map
now if you have arbitrary dynamic attributes that can change at runtime then a good way to accomplish that is with a map or dictionary type

2742024
udp	tcp
you can set key with tcp protocol and get with udp protocol

2742024
serializable	deserialization
support customized serializable and deserialization

2742031
put	get
i went ahead and put a bounty on this question so maybe i can actually get a good answer to this

2742064
filtering	grouping
uncheck grouping items by category and in the filtering box type doc

2742065
subtract	add
use paste special with operation add i guess subtract would work too

2742066
ubuntu	linux
2 ldap authentication what could be the best alternative in ubuntu or an other flavour of linux

2742118
cpu	hyperthreading
unfortunately each mysql thread is bound to one cpu but i have 4 cores well 8 with hyperthreading

2742133
ivar	subclassing
at the moment i ve subclassing nsapplication and added an exitstatus ivar which i set in my app delegate when necessary then overridden -terminate so that it calls exit exitstatus

2742184
hash	salt
in the context of your other questions you should reference this code in both the code that you use to create a new user in order to log the initial password hash salt and format and in the onpasswordchanging so that you can check reject insert

2742207
subtract	add
add the volume of this prism to your total if the triangle runs ccw and subtract that volume if it runs clockwise

2742258
google-chrome	firefox
when i look at this published google docs document i see the latest version with firefox and google-chrome but an older version with ie8

2742259
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
of course this would only apply to explicit throwing of runtimeexception and not implicit ones like nullpointerexception

2742296
post	get
ideally get a call stack of the devenv.exe main thread with symbols loaded and post it here or even better attach to the connect bug

2742307
dygraphs	fusioncharts
devexpress componentone tel.. mschart fusioncharts jplot dygraphs ifragestics dotnetcharting amcharts are no goods.

2742319
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 firefox and google-chrome but in ie6 7 the table is incorrectly stretched to fill the width of the page

2742370
post	get
i am just curious if i can get from where i am using the current_user methods across controllers to display in post index.html.erb to where i want to be

2742379
width	height
i would need to detect the original width and height of the input source video an h264 f4v

2742402
width	height
make an image of the same width as the uitextview make it the right height for your requirements and position it so that it covers the lower edge of the uitextview

2742429
hide	show
i m using jquery to show hide the table rows that do not have the search term as text within the tr but i d ideally like to take the additional step of taking the search term the entered value and matching any of those text terms in the remaining showing rows and adding say a yellow background to the word s

2742437
public	protected
yes a public ctor on an abstract class is meaningless and a bit misleading as it will behave as protected in that only derived classes may call it

2742446
public	protected
i d assume that the reason that the compiler doesn t complain is as simple that they just didn t spend time covering that since it really doesn t matter if it s public or protected

2742447
int	chars
given a string consisting of a single chars followed by a number one or two digits i would like to split it into a chars and an int

2742463
superclass	subclassing
in .net one can specify a mustoverride attribute to a method in a particular superclass to ensure that subclassing override that particular method

2742463
superclass	subclassing
essentially what i want is to push for subclassing to override a method in a superclass that itself has some logic that must be run-through

2742463
super	abstract
i dont want to use abstract methods or interfaces because i want some common functionality to be run in the super method but more-or-less produce a compiler warning error denoting that derivative classes should override a given method

2742473
agile	sprint
their v3 template looks pretty good but microsoft s agile template has some awesome reporting capabilities and their planning spreadsheets look very handy as well - i found that sprint planning using sfts was painful

2742481
rss	feed
any example on how to parse have access to simple rss feed elements in js

2742484
hide	show
then simply build some basic javascript logic that when you chose building a as starting point and building c as destination you hide all polylines and show the a c line only

2742485
public	protected
the answers on that question come down to the same thing in the end it does not really matter if you declare it protected or public

2742487
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the following code in both google-chrome and a smil-enable firefox nightly but it has no effect

2742549
boost	stl
stl is preferable as i don t use boost for any other parts of the code though i wouldn t mind an example with it

2742601
nsurl	nsstring
do we have any nsstring length restriction when creating an object of nsurl class

2742611
debhelper	apt
to reproduce the builds its a good idea to have debhelper installed or let apt satisfy the dependencies automagically by using

2742616
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
no runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception

2742616
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the subclasses of runtimeexception are unchecked-exception classes

2742647
maven	pom.xml
now when you do a maven package or a maven install it will copy the version.properties file into the web-inf classes and do a search and replace to add the pom.xml version into the file

2742717
min	max
make the following substitutions for max and min

2742717
min	max
there s also another min farther down and a max near the beginning of the function so do the same with those

2742717
min	max
replacing the min s and max s really helped to reduce the time

2742747
folder	directory
in our cms we have a header folder inside the template directory

2742749
hash	salt
the text of their password must be concatenated with the salt and then this combined string may be hash and stored in the database in an nvarchar field

2742800
put	get
interestingly i m able to get this to work just fine on my local machine but when we put it on our main server which is a multi-node cassandra setup i get the behavior described above

2742834
width	height
if the textfield appears but the foreignobject element lacks a width and height attribute technically the browser that does that doesn t follow the svg spec since those attributes are required for the foreignobject to be visible inside the svg

2742857
width	height
if you move all attributes i.e modified width height and expiration to elements then customers can automatically map your product specification 1 1 to json or their internal object

2742863
gif	png
clear out the parts you want to be transparent and save it in a format that handles transparency such as png or gif

2742915
children	parent
please note that if the parent of t1 has any other children the above will remove all those children too

2743077
error-handling	exception-handling
2 the normal error-handling for new is to raise an exception-handling so checking the returned pointer is useless

2743124
google-chrome	firefox
how can i see what caused firefox or ie google-chrome to drop the ssl and why

2743240
int	chars
if we type in now 3992999 the auto-complete function should top showing anything up ...but unfortunately it still does could the problem lie within the fact that i am using int instead of strings or chars

2743252
tabcontrol	tabitem
i would like to create an animation which will slide the tabitem from the bottom of my window to the tabcontrol itself and add some fade in effect too

2743316
folder	directory
i have a commonly named .sqlite file contained within many unique user s home folder with file structure home user unique-ip-address folder file.sqlite i ve decided to move all of these .sqlite files to a tmpfs mount and have already done so maintaining the full directory structure so each .sqlite file is now in mnt tmpfs home user unique-ip-address folder file.sqlite

2743316
folder	dir
i would like to append the new .sqlite location used in dev shm to file.ini in their home folder after dir in the file.ini

2743332
opera	firefox
cause opera and firefox did not support non free codecs

2743334
post	get
effectively because you re specifying post the server is expecting all the parameters to be in the posted data not in get variables so it s not checking the url to retrieve the parameter

2743334
post	get
i d suggest using firebug in firefox to debug what s going on with this sort of request in the future but the main take-away is that if you re sending parameters as part of the url use get not post

2743355
execl	fork
to create a new child process in unix you must first call fork which clones the existing process and then within the child call execl or some related system call to replace child process with the program you actually want to run

2743366
uptime	reboot
the problem is that after one week uptime server is running out of memory and needs to be reboot there are quite many users and i cannot run debugger on this production server so i would need to simulate somehow use on my local pc

2743403
implements	sealed
you could expose the interface as public implements an internal sealed implementation of that class and use a factory approach to build instances of the desired interface

2743403
accessor	properties
you could also eliminate the set accessor in the interface and put them in the internal implementation to only expose the properties to the outside world

2743437
rsa	aes
the symmetric cipher aes uses a key length of 256 bits which is 32 bytes about 30 times less data to encrypt decrypt using rsa than the kilobyte of data you encrypt now

2743437
rsa	aes
so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa

2743522
hide	show
when i put the show script into the page this function sottped working as did the show hide on the checkbox lower down in the page

2743535
qtreeview	qmodelindex	qtreeview	qabstractitemview	qmodelindex	qabstractitemview
you can find the qmodelindex of the item receiving the drop by giving the qdropevent pos parameter to the qabstractitemview indexat method of the qtreeview

ant	maven
mixing maven and ant in a way that disables the benefits of both

2743605
accessor	properties
we d like to have trivial java properties accessor using a single line syntax so they take up much much less space and are more readable in terms of seeing the set of accessor quickly

2743605
accessor	properties
in fact we d rather not have trivial accessor at all and instead just annotate the private member variables with properties or something and have the accessor generated for us since writing endless get and set code delivers no real benefit but that s a general java frustration and an aside as far as this question goes.

2743620
ant	maven
10 - mixing maven + ant

2743645
rss	feed
besides sending to an email address instantly daily weekly it allows you to create an rss feed out of it

as you can see not only are the tabs exaggerated but the toolbar is too so is the toolbar on the bottom

2743654
ant	maven
10 mixing maven and ant in a way that disables the benefits of both

2743659
jrebel	hotswap
compilation within the ide and hotdeploy hotswap jrebel will also save you a lot of time

2743696
gmp	bigint
that will be much faster than the php implementation done in crypt_ even if they use bigint or other c large integer implementation like gmp

2743799
google-chrome	firefox
current google-chrome and firefox pre-releases support it and i have a feeling that the google-chrome frame will support it too in a future release which would mean that you can even use it in internet explorer and other browsers

2743802
button	checkbox
then if a user selects some or all of these checkbox then the selected record s can be updated only one field will be updated btw possibly by clicking a button

2743808
many-to-many	one-to-many
however many-to-many relationship in fact uses double one-to-many relationship

2743825
post	get
if you just have a single name across all checkboxes then the list of ids will be passed into a single post variable which you can get straight from request.post assuming you re submitting your form as a post which you should be

2743829
client-side	server-side
this library can be used both client-side and server-side

2743848

i am a javascript jquery prototype newcomer and i have a page that has a prototype function to get info from a database and put it into some input fields

2743911
hide	show
this was made before i came to work on this site and now i ve been asked to add a hide show div function

2743911
hide	show
my question now is how would i go about building a show hide function in prototype

2743911

2744050
postgresql	mysql
i want to know why relational database like mysql or postgresql doesn t good for twitter-like application

2744092

this error might indicate you re running out of ram but alternatively it could mean you re running out of swap disk space

2744101
hide	show
on my new customer page i have successfully implemented a jquery show hide toggle alongside a prototype script using jquery s .noconflict

2744104
onreadystatechange	onload
the other way you could go is to investigate the onload and onreadystatechange events provided by browsers

2744118
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
this works fine when type is png or tiff but with jpeg or bmp it just produces a black square

2744124
versioning	upgrade
so i ve got two options - use regular expressions to filter the email which i m not that skilled at doing and would be more vulnerable to exploitation after i leave turn off register globals and then try to teach the staff what i m doing or try to get them to upgrade their versioning of php and mysql and or change web host

2744125
width	height
i m looking to create a flexible width height page layout with no window scrollbars

2744158
getter	setter
1 use the existing fund model as is ignoring the setter getter for fund amount

2744160
put	get
you re going to find it hard to get the results you want there unless you put a dummy order into the system for every currency on every day which could be easily done in the fill_calendar routine for testing

2744173
getter	setter
option 1 could confuse a person that reads the code and could tempt someone who doesn t understand your code fully to use those setter getter due to some misunderstanding

2744186
packets	multicast
the multicast address will be the receiver s address not sender s address in the packets

2744222
filesystems	ntfs
i am using djgpp compiler for dos in that i have to use windows.h which is a win32 api for conversion of system time to file time for ntfs file system.as windows.h is win32 api it is giving error windows.h-no such file or directory .so how to convert system time to file time 8 byte structure in ntfs filesystems for ntfs filesystems in dos

2744274
division	modulo
integer division of by can be done in php with casting while modulo uses the operator

2744284
xsl-fo	xslt
from your xml source you can use xslt to generate xhtml or xsl-fo but not both at the same time

2744287
post	get
third would be to call cfm with post request which can handle larger structs then get

2744289
firefox	safari
in firefox safari and ie8 automatically vertically align the text of it in the middle correctly

2744309
switching	screens
but if i start my application and switching to another application outlook before the my splash screens is shown the icon is not displayed in the windows task bar

2744319
int	chars
the array of long words looks like strings at first glance so it looks superficially like we re dealing with an int argc chars argv situation except the argv array is inline in the stack frame

2744329
folder	directory
depending on the type of the file you add it in a different folder under res directory

2744364
vb6	vba
a collection in vba and vb6 for that matter

2744384
width	height
in this case i do a uniform scale of the image to be less than or equal to the width and height of the outer jpanel

2744384
width	height
the maximum width and height is respected

2744384
width	height
there is likely some more width and height taken up by the border around the jpanel or something like that

2744410
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
if i replace oracle.dataaccess.client with the microsoft system.data.oracleclient it all works again but is not full of odp.net lovelyness

2744445
gif	png
i have a number of images png gif and jpg in my application resource bundle

2744445
gif	png
also a gif image gets copied nicely and works but this problem occurs for png image

2744452
super	self
never use super self.__class__ self

2744452
super	self
you call a.m method for b instance so self.__class__ is b and super self.__class__ self .m refers to the same method a.m so a.m calls itself instead of calling the method of base class

2744453
public	protected
another problem is that usernames aren t usually protected you can see them through apache s user directories anonymous ftp often allows the public directory to group things up by username etc

2744454
post	get
that way your application will be protected not just from post injections but get injections and cookie exploitations as well

2744493
ssl	https
you re specifying that the address is using ssl https so it would require a certificate for that purpose

2744504
inherited	properties
usually because objects can inherited methods and properties from other objects and in a relationship database there is no equivalent

2744537
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i build the uitabbarcontroller in the appdelegate where i also assign an instance of my uinavigationcontroller for each tab

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
activating the virtualenv doesn t change this because there s no yolk script in your virtualenv bin dir

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
this is why installing yolk into the virtualenv fixes the problem

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
because it adds a yolk script in your virtualenv bin dir that has the virtualenv s python in its shebang line

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
if you don t want to install yolk in each virtualenv you could also just copy the yolk script-wrapper from usr local bin or wherever it is into your virtualenv s bin dir and manually change the shebang line to point to your virtualenv s python

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
this won t work with a --no-site-packages virtualenv though because the script wrapper then won t be able to find the actual yolk packages it needs to import

2744571
virtualenv	yolk
if you want to use yolk within a --no-site-packages virtualenv really your only choice is to install it there

2744609
getter	setter
to figure out whats going wrong i set breakpoints for the clientid and siteid getter and setter in the linq to sql designer generated classes

2744616
firefox	safari
i did some testing with ibrowser and some versions work with firefox 2 and older but not firefox 3 others don t work with internet explorer or safari

2744687
metaclass	subclassing
the first thought was to subclassing the metaclass and put the other registry in

2744730
int	double
by generic i mean the type of list to create may be a list string list int or list double

2744783
min	max
you can find useful tips in the ibm powerpc compiler writerâ s guide isbn 0-9649654-0-2 though - there are a number of examples of branchless implementations of conditional sequences max min which might give you some ideas

2744839
width	height
i used a bg image for my popup window whose size is 500px width and 400px height

2744849

how to generate rss and atom feed

2744961
opera	google-chrome
i guess google-chrome opera will also support something like this

2744981
principalcontext	userprincipal
i am currently using principalcontext and userprincipal to return the users primary groupid

2745014
nunit	mspec
when i add the mspec machine.specifications assembly to the references both resharper and testdriven.net stop running the nunit tests and only run the mspec tests

2745014
nunit	mspec
is there a way or setting that allows both nunit mspec tests to co-exist and run in the same project using r# td.net test runners

2745015
calloc	malloc
i know that calloc or malloc can reserve memory but how

2745028
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer and firefox work fine for this but google-chrome always changes the cursor to the text cursor

2745045
uilabel	uibutton
i have 4 labels uilabel and 1 image uiimage and 3 buttons uibutton

2745072
min	max
so as you cannot use sum or avg you can use the min or max

2745074
division	multiplication
is there a more direct method that avoids the additional multiplication or a second division and branch and that also avoids casting as a floating point number

2745097
pull	push
read more about git push and git pull on gitready.com the article i referred to first

2745099
pull	push
git push is used to add commits you have done on the local repository to a remote one - together with git pull it allows people to collaborate

2745120
postgresql	mysql
for example google uses bigtable rather than an rdbms the likes of mysql postgresql sqllite3 etc for faster read-write

2745131
calloc	malloc
ps to make your code more reliable don t forget to check if a malloc calloc failed

2745146
boost	stl
is there a more natural way to do so using existing algorithm in boost or stl

2745160
post	get
reading the code u putting in the sidebar u are trying to get the last 10 titles of post to show in sidebar right

2745162
flip	slide
but isn t it more stylish to slide in your own layout from the bottom or use the flip animation

2745225
submit	submission
originally i was setting and clearing the disabled property on the specify occupation textbox then i found out that upon submission the form disabled fields are excluded from the submit and the required validator on the specify occupation textbox was being raised because the textbox was being blanked out

2745271
mvp	presenter
i m developing a application using mvp and i have a question about how inject my dependencis in my presenter class

2745290
int	double
you declare a struct and from then on it s a data type much like int or double

2745290
calloc	malloc
or by allocating memory for one with malloc or calloc

2745290
calloc	malloc
the other difference is that malloc returns memory with whatever used to be in it while calloc initializes everything to zero

2745290
calloc	malloc
no cast is required in c it is required in c++ but you usually wouldn t use malloc or calloc in c++ and the only thing it can do is cover up a possible mistake leaving out to be specific

2745292
punctuation	words
i m one of those who prefers words to punctuation -- it s one of the reasons i ve picked python over perl for example

2745310
integer	fractions
date times in excel are stored internally as numbers representing the number of days since year 1900 jan 0 plus a decimal part representing a fractions of 24 hours for the time so your date is coming through as an integer

2745332
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
replace mouseover and mouseout with mouseenter and mouseleave

2745386
aggregate-functions	sum
for completeness having is like where but for the already aggregated grouped values such as max in this case or sum or count or any of the other aggregate-functions

2745400
goto	break
think of break in this case as a goto end_of_switch

2745441
pop-up	dialog
at one point the page i m working with displays a dialog box in which i must click ok or cancel. is there a way to tell the vbscript to click ok when the dialog box pop-up

2745459
opera	firefox
performance of the getcontext approach is 85-90 slower in firefox 11 and opera 11 and about 55 slower in chromium 18

2745466
width	height
the sdk allows changing the width of keys in a row as in thickbuttons but ideally i d like to be able to vary both the height and width of keys within a row and still have the keys occupy all the available space.

2745518
folder	dir
first i created a raw dir and then i added the folder with the audio files

2745542
x86	64bit
however since i cannot use their package with x64 perl on a rhel 5.4 x86_64 box and maintaining a seperate install of x86 perl just for this one package i have made an attempt to get this puppy working thanks to released 64bit .so s that accompany other driver packages for advantage

2745563
getter	setter
there is no real harm in exposing getter in the interface and if you want your implementation classes as immutable declare them as final and don t expose the setter

2745582
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop and break out of loops at the first successful choice

2745591
folder	directory
if you have moved your users directory to a drive that is not called c it will not work - a workaround is to copy the .android folder from e users username .android to e users username .android - then it should work

2745636
rss	feed
there s an rss feed i m tapping into that has the locale set as en-gb

2745661
jobs	cron
quartz is better in my opinion because you can even set it up so that it fires your jobs at fixed points in time like cron jobs eg

2745763
division	modulo
it will be slightly faster than the ops code because the modulo and the division is performed using the same instruction on the processor because the compiler can see that they are equivalent

2745779
folder	directory
the code you posted is going to look in your main directory the folder with the license system user_guide etc

2745823
post	get
so i set a variable in my main ruby file that s handling all my post and get requests and then use erb templates to actually show the pages

2745896
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i tried using position relative with the width height and margin 0 auto

2745917
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera

2745917
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the result in firefox google-chrome opera is what i d expect

2745949
getter	setter
you can try to create a wrapper property in the partial class extending the entity code that will create an instance of the jimsnapshot in getter and write the correct xml in setter

2746004
rss	feed
i ve got part of it working but the part where i m trying to bring in an rss feed of the category into the sidebar to show as recent posts

2746047
ssl	https
if i was setting up a server and had the ssl certificate s why wouldn t i use https for the entire site instead of just for purchases logins

2746096
free	malloc
if you need to create an object that will outlive the process which created it you ll need to use malloc or new to get a block of memory from the heap and remember to free or delete it later

2746098
try-catch	exception-handling
so i have to wrap it in a try-catch to catch that specific exception-handling

2746104
mts	legacy
we have a legacy vb6 component that was com+ mts and is used by asp classic

2746153
jax-ws	jax-rs
if you need something more sophisticated you can use some webservice technology like jax-rs or jax-ws

2746203
postgresql	mysql
why this db are better than rdbms like mysql or postgresql for very large amount of data

2746217
width	height
i want a webpage with a variable height full width header height based on contents

2746230
gif	png
note that gif by melander and png by martijn saly

2746230
versioning	upgrade
anyway i think i upgrade too soon because now embarcadero announced the 64 bit compiler so probably i will have to pay again a lot of money to upgrade to the next versioning of delphi in order to get that compiler

2746244
getter	setter
so all you need to do is to create the property with a public getter and setter

2746285
std	ostream
one great example is that your stream operator for your types is if you re doing it right refering to std ostream as the stream not cout

2746287
inherited	properties
i would like to implement a kind of hierarchy where any elements within an element with class admin will inherited properties set in the admin stylesheet and anything else inherited from the customer stylesheet

2746306
rss	feed
the way it works both systems have to have rss atom feed which represent the data or at least events on the data object at url xyz created .

2746335
versioning	upgrade
so i upgrade the wordpress to the latest versioning

2746351
width	height
a width and height

2746362
profiling	benchmarking
if you hit my blog via my profiling and contact me i will let you know when the tests are complete and you can use them as a benchmarking as to what exactly is expected from the default stack

2746431
ati	nvidia
in fact for a long time the only drivers you could get were not written by ati nvidia etc. but rather by hobbyists

2746478
uiview	subviews
how can i loop through all subviews of a uiview and their subviews and their subviews

2746509
symlink	realpath
if sympath is a symlink to realpath then

2746533
qtreewidget	qtablewidget
if you want to be able to group downloads under different categories you can use the qtreewidget which will also allow for multiple table cells per row like the qtablewidget

2746555
hide	show
i have a javascript where i need to hide and eventually show some text by clicking a button

2746565
button	checkbox
its working fine if i click the button it checks the checkbox

2746590
width	height
the data structure acts as a node in a doubly linked list with sorted insertion as well as containing the coordinates of the top-left corner and the width and height

2746590
width	height
the less straightforward case where the space to be removed can only be found within a column or row of boxes is only partially implemented - if one of the blocks to be removed is an exact fit for width ie column or height ie row then problems occur

2746597
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
the issue is that uinavigationcontroller ideally should be the direct subview of uiwindow

2746597
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
when you add uinavigationcontroller into another custom view of a uiwindow subview you need to take care of the position and size of this custom view by taking into account whether the status bar is shown or not in the uiwindow

2746598
jstl	taglib
what are some good alternatives for view technology or is jsp with spring and jstl taglib and jquery the way to go

2746667
hide	show
however you could use javascript to show a div on mouse over and hide it on mouse out

2746675
prepare	execute
so you can use modelattribute method to prepare the array this method will be execute before the requestmapping method

2746705
integer	unsigned
for example the method getbytes can convert variables of many different types into a byte array and the method touint16 returns a 16-bit unsigned integer converted from two bytes at a specified position in a byte array

2746707
hex	binary
how do i tell the command to convert the input to binary possibly from a hex

2746743
for-loop	arrays
the function creates a closure so the variable you re passing in row is it s own copy scoped correctly for what you want here instead of the i being what it was at the end of the for-loop and your function getting the last element of that arrays

2746746
width	height
i suspect that you ve given the image elements width and height attributes because that s how they re represented in html

2746755
freemarker	velocity	freemarker	thymeleaf	velocity	thymeleaf
other candiates are 3rd party templating frameworks such as velocity freemarker and thymeleaf which can be configured as a view technology for spring mvc

2746755
freemarker	velocity
spring documentation has integration examples with velocity and freemarker

2746776
hash	md5
use an md5 hash of the contents of the file

2746780
fadein	fadeout
jquery offers fadein and fadeout functions

2746786
versioning	upgrade
seriously if that s the only way because an upgrade to the express versioning of sql server 2008 would probably be better than sticking with sql server 2000 at this point imho

2746789
octal	hex
you can use echo to emit specific bytes using hex or octal

2746799
freemarker	velocity
my previous answer was getting badly dated here. freemarker is at least as good as velocity

2746799
stateless	stateful
jsf like asp.net webforms attempts to create stateful component trees on top html markup and the stateless http protocol

2746895
xstream	jackson
the representations sent back and forth between server and client include xml using the xstream serialization library json using jackson xhtml java object serialization and as of yesterday kryo

2746895
int	boolean
we have a set of javabeans that have string float int long date boolean and list fields

2746903
free	malloc
dmalloc is a library that replaces malloc and free with extensive debugging versions capable of using page boundaries to detect memory overruns underruns filling allocated and free memory leak-checking and more

2746948
mouse	keyboard
you don t want to stop methods being invoked on the ui thread because the method invocation mechanism is the same as the one that allows things like mouse and keyboard events to work

2746962
accessor	properties
also make sure the generate accessor and generate objective-c 2.0 properties options are selected

2747017
cpython	ironpython
i would like to know how to use visual studio with cpython the official python.org python interpreter not ironpython

2747041
gnu	groff	odt	opendocument

2747041
textwrangler	bbedit
bbedit textwrangler

2747041
textwrangler	bbedit
bbedit and its free variant textwrangler for mac can syntax-highlight restructuredtext using this codeless language module

2747046
g++	gcc
use g++ to drive the linker not gcc

2747117
instances	transient
note that ifoo and bar are registered with the transient life style which means that the already-resolved instances has to be passed to bar - it can t be re-resolved

2747146
superclass	subclassing
i get a nullpointerexception calling a superclass method in subclassing inner class constructor.

2747146
superclass	subclassing
can you not call superclass methods in the subclassing constructor

2747162
jar	war
if you get a report of a missing class try unzipping your war file or looking in the exploded webapp directory of your app server and see if the necessary jar is there

2747182
superclass	subclassing
i know that the subclassing will call the superclass constructor before calling its own constructor but what if i have some code on the superclass that should only be executed after all the subclassing constructors have been called

2747191
post	get
to get the count of how many comment rows you have for all post you can use a nested select statement

2747239
hide	show
i posted the js since i also changed it to use jquery s show hide

2747242
folder	directory
you should put it in a new folder in the program files directory

2747246
x86	64bit
c program files x86 environment variable programfiles x86 for 32-bit applications on a 64bit version of windows

2747251
freemarker	velocity
i would recommend using freemarker or velocity

2747260
superclass	subclassing
i m not sure what you mean - can t you just call the code in the superclass at the end of our last subclassing constructor

2747285
children	parent
and is there anything in the standard that specifies whether parent domains can access their children s databases

2747314
pull	push
dvcs users clone the dvcs repository pull changes from it and push changes back to it

2747344
pull	push
basically they re saying that if you re using git to access an svn repository don t share your git repository with anyone else via push pull

2747344
bazaar	git
the subversion folks have some dvcs capabilities on the roadmap probably spurred by the success of svk and the growing prevalence of git mercurial bazaar

2747362
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox but safari displays only the inset shadow

2747381
charindex	substr
you can implement something like this by using the reverse function to make searching easier in which case you ll be parsing the string from left to right instead of right to left like i said above the patindex or charindex functions to find spaces and commas and the substr function to pull the address apart based on the positions found by patindex and charindex

put	get
however when i run it and put values 1 2 and 3 on it type is just a alias for int in this case and reverse it i get 2 1 3

2747395
maven	pom.xml
i want to use checkstyle in my maven based project so in my pom.xml i have add the dependency

2747403
post	get
to get to the bottom of this could you please post your code and the actual contents of the error message

2747422
hide	show
i m looking for a way to show hide an arbitrary richfaces component

2747422
hide	show
each row needs to have it s own independent show hide link such that when you click show details two things happen

2747422
hide	show
the show details link is re-rendered as hide details

2747422
client-side	server-side
i also don t want to have a server-side bean keep track of which detailcolumns are being displayed and subsequently re-render everything over ajax this should be purely client-side behavior

2747431
pop-up	dialog
i m using the jquery ui dialog for a modal pop-up dialog

2747431
google-chrome	firefox
it s working great in firefox google-chrome but terrible in ie6

2747435
int	double
particularly int for the digit and long if strictly double the size of the int for intermediate representations when adding and multiplying

2747457
post	get
go post a question pre-sales technical etc. up on and you ll usually get a clear and concise answer within a day

2747503
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
strip the time from mydate you will need to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

2747518
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
the gridview datalist and repeater get their respective databind methods from basedataboundcontrol basedatalist and repeater classes

2747621
width	height
in your regular master.css or css3.css file you would give it your width height rounded corners and drop shadow with styles

2747621
width	height
for that same div#page_container you may alter the width a bit height maybe some padding then give it a background-image to make it look like the drop shadow rounded-corner version

2747621
firefox	safari
likewise because you didn t hard code in the rounded corner graphics that every browser would see your firefox and safari users won t need hit the server with extra image calls

2747627
division	multiplication
for multiplication and division you need to adjust for the offset

2747631
width	height
will all key widths and height be a multiple of the smallest key width height

2747651
rbm	autoencoder
that being said what does tend to make a big difference is pretraining the network weights either as an rbm or as an autoencoder

2747690
ubuntu	debian
for instance ubuntu is a debian derivative so debian is upstream for ubuntu

2747720
xunit.net	specflow
there is an example for specflow with xunit.net in the specflow-example repository

2747721
getter	setter
getter and setter are bad

2747721
getter	setter
briefly reading over the above article i find that getter and setter are bad oo design and should be avoided as they go against encapsulation and data hiding

2747721
getter	setter
in cases where a getter or setter is required what other alternatives can be used

2747746
getter	setter
getter or setter by themselves are not bad oo design

2747746
getter	setter
what is bad is coding practice which includes a getter and a setter for every single member automatically whether that getter setter is needed or not coupled with making members public which should not be public - because this basically exposes class s implementation to outside world violating the information hiding abstraction

2747751
maven	pom.xml
i want to use checkstyle in my maven based project so in my pom.xml i ve add the dependency ...

2747773
getter	setter
java-style getter and setter proliferation are symptoms of ignoring this advice

2747776
getter	setter
the way i read it the author argues that blindly putting getter and setter around fields is no better than just making the field public

2747776
getter	setter
i believe that the author argues that getter and setter should be placed sparsely and with care because the idea of oo is that objects should limit their exposure to what is needed only

2747801
rss	feed
i ve done something similiar with my rss feed but this sitemap refuses to work

2747873
gif	png
just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg

2747882
free	malloc
because of python s malloc frontend obmalloc and how it allocates smaller objects in blocks of its own and how process memory works on most operating systems this means your process will allocate more and not be able to free it

2747888
gif	png
i use this function to resize images but i end up with ugly creepy image with a black background if it s a transparent gif or png with alpha however it works perfectly for jpg and normal png

2747889
getter	setter
2 exposing data members with setter getter with no caution allows callers to ruin the class invariant very easily

2747889
getter	setter
unfortunately there are some frameworks which encourage sometimes require adding setter getter for everything

2747901
serializable	deserialization
they have a custom serializable and deserialization handler

2747918
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
otherwise perhaps you could load your dropdownlists via a sqldatasource or objectdatasource

2747943
activemq	rabbitmq
i ve been looking at rabbitmq hornetq activemq but i m not sure i can get this functionality out of the box any recommendations on a system that gives me this functionality

2747966
nginx	lighttpd
one final note nginx and lighttpd use x-accel-redirect and x-lighttpd-send-file instead of x-sendfile

2748010
getter	setter
as drawnonward points out setting self.containerview is the same as calling self setcontainerview and if you re using synthesize to generate your getter and setter your setcontainerview method will look something like this

2748030
width	height
the problem is the image width is resize correctly but height is devided by 13 instead of 3.9 in my case

2748052
realloc	malloc
use realloc but you have to allocate the array with malloc first

2748054
realloc	malloc
you could malloc a 1000-element array and later resize it with realloc

2748055
width	height
have you tried to set div s width and height to 100

2748091
children	parent
however in this case the children in the tree will need access to it s parent example -- beings on map need to be able to access map data -- ergo the data of their parent

2748113
fgets	fread
use fread instead of fgets

2748114
google-chrome	firefox
it occurs in standards and quirks mode rendering it does not occur in firefox google-chrome or ie8 though switching the rendering engine via ie8 developer tools will provoke it

2748119
put	get
and yes i replaced the uid with a fake one and yes i put in my app id because like i said when i try to get my name it works fine

2748305
getter	setter
in other words use interfaces for both getter and setter methods when they are necessary that way you can maintain encapsulation

2748327
copying	overwrite
would return a new url copying the host port etc but overwrite the anchor

2748327
getter	setter
your service type classes don t need setter set them in ctor and definitely font need getter

2748329
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
those are the sharedpreferences that preferencescreen preferenceactivity will use

2748336
super	abstract
what about using an abstract super class for the channel and a table_per_class inheritance strategy

2748355
rss	feed
and if i try using rss feed about how much delay can i expect

2748357
post	get
normally it d get you the post with a given id but assume that is set to the string 10

2748367
vim	textmate
i would love to have eclipse link to the source but there must be other manageable alternatives too as i know some people use textmate or vim for development they can t all have discovered the apis for the plugins through trial and error

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
generating xsl-fo and xhtml from xslt is not necessarily an either-or choice

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
generally it wouldn t be worth the hassle to have your xslt create xsl-fo and then convert into xhtml just generate xhtml directly unless you want to create both output formats pdf and xhtml with reduced effort

2748415
hide	show
the application has an option to show hide the excel sheet so you can look at it make any final changes and so forth

2748415
hide	show
there is a button which allows excel to be show hidden in case someone wants to check any other information in the sheet if someone exits excel directly then it is still possible to use the show hide button it show the excel application with no workbook loaded and the same excel instance still show up in task manager but when i click the save button

2748423
put	get
if i put the alert inside of the callback function i get back object xmldocument but if i place it outside of the ajax call i get undefined

2748482
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
some browser related issues i am trying to resolve but should work in firefox google-chrome safari

2748495
yslow	pagespeed
use a tool like google s pagespeed plugin or yahoo s yslow to figure out what s actually causing performance issues once you have most of the site in place and optimize the things that matter

2748528
jobs	cron
in unix systems many jobs are started automatically at prescheduled times using cron so you have the notion of cron jobs

2748547
uitableview	reloaddata
if you want to reload all the cells in the table view then use uitableview s reloaddata method but be aware of the performance implications

2748552
cvs	svn
everyone i work with has used svn cvs and vss shiver so this could be quite a large change

2748554
getter	setter
getter and setter are bad oo design

2748574
pop-up	dialog
moreover by breaking the direct dependency on input now if you were to port this code to something else later that didn t use a command line you could just drop in the new code to retrieve input whether that would be a dialog box in a gui application or a javascript pop-up in a web-based application etc.

2748576
width	height
does adding width and height to inline images increase the page load performance

2748580
put	get
you can use which notify-send from your regular terminal to get the path to put into your script

2748665
apache	nginx
likely you ll run hgwebdir behind apache nginx or iis depending on your preferences

2748680
gif	png
you can however consider to save the image interlaced supported on gif and png

2748712
width	height
if you don t set a width at all or a height for that matter than the div will not show unless there is something in it

2748712
width	height
around those divs i would have the container div with a defined width and height and overflow set to hidden

2748720
getter	setter
but best practice is to declare the attributes as private and access them via getter and setter

2748729
width	height
if we are using table for to show tabular data and if we would give width and height to then will it load quickly

2748749
min	max
my approach was to use the max min functions 10 functions to sort 4 numbers no branches iirc

2748753
next	except
exiting at the first match is really easy instead of computing a full list comprehension then tossing away everything except the first item use next over a genexp

2748756
width	height
adding a width and height won t make the total page load faster since that depends on your network speed and the size of your page in bytes

2748799
put	get
it s maybe not exactally testing the function you put forward but you get the idea

2748800
hash	md5
if you only use the first 4 bytes of an md5 hash would that mean theoretically only 1 in 255 4 chance of collision

2748801
agile	scrummaster
here s where the value of a scrummaster lean agile coach comes in

2748811
min	max
the comparators are essentially the same as your s x y function though if you really want this to be fast you shouldn t be using min and max because then you re doing twice the number of comparisons that are necessary

2748835
xslt	xquery
functx -- a library of useful xslt 2.0 and xquery functions

2748840
int	chars
this subtraction trick is broken in general but it works fine here because the subtraction of two chars will not overflow an int

2748887
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can get the html5 video to work in firefox google-chrome and safari just not moblie safari for my ipad or iphone

2748887
apache	nginx
unfortunately nginx does not support byte-range requests but apache does

2748904
filtering	grouping
the having clause filtering the result after grouping so it would elliminate customers not invoices

2748904
filtering	grouping
if you want to filtering out the new invoices rather than the customers with new invoices you should use where instead so that you filtering before grouping

2748940
lisp	scheme
currently i use plt scheme but would like to see answers in different lisp implementations as well

2748956

cassini	iis
are you trying this in iis or on your local cassini development server

2749318
accessor	properties
this means a little more work when declaring them but when later on you wish that you had a properties accessor methods because you need to implement some code it s a lot easier knowing that everywhere else in the code is already using your property.

2749406
post	get
i need to use get and post at the same time

2749414
post	get
you cannot do a get and post at the same time

2749442
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can only have one verb post get put ... when doing an http request

2749446
hide	show
depending on whether you want to keep the show more cell or remove it now either hide the activity indicator and re-enable the cell or delete it by calling deleterowsatindexpaths withrowanimation

2749462
switching	screens
the default is avaudiosessioncategorysoloambient which tracks the ring silent switching and the screens lock

2749469
post	get
as saig by the other answers you can t do a get and a post request at the same time

2749469
post	get
but if you want to unify your php code in order to read a variable received through a get or post request maybe you could use _request

2749529
qlistwidget	qtablewidget	qlistwidget	qtreeview	qtreeview	qtablewidget
i want to add a headers and index to a list in pyqt it s really not important what list of qt qlistwidget qlistview qtablewidget qtreeview

2749557
profiling	instrumentation
broadly speaking profiling a program is to instrumentation the executable with some extra statements that record details of execution which you can later analyse to identify parts that are slow consume too much memory consume too much cpu etc

2749557
profiler	gprof
here s a quickie along with examples on how to use gprof which is the gnu profiler for c

2749563
fgets	feof
another option is the use the less optimized fopen feof fgets and fclose functions specially if you care about getting whole lines at once here is another example i provided in another stackoverflow question for importing large sql queries into the database

2749573
hide	show
you can use the inputmethodmanager to show or hide the keyboard

2749596
mp3	ogg
if i remeber correctly you can only add wave mp3 and ogg files

2749599
rapidsvn	smartsvn
we are currently using smartsvn 6.5 and we have also tested with rapidsvn syncro but we can t use tortoise as we have a lot of ubunutu users

2749613
post	get
post and get as head file delete etc. are http methods

2749613
post	get
the big difference from get and post is that get retrieve a response from an url and post send also some content data to that url

2749641
mouse	keyboard
when i do need the mouse the trackpoint is right there no need to move your hand away from the keyboard

2749717

2750008
openssl	m2crypto
in the pkey class documentation of the m2crypto python package an openssl wrapper for python it is said that pkey is a reference to a public key

2750036
fseek	fread
yes you can use fseek to go a certain point in the file then fread to read it into a buffer or audiofilereadbytes

2750046
move	drag
i implemented the cctouchesbegan move ended methods to drag the ball around

2750087
httprequest	httpresponse
keep in mind that the convention is for view functions to take an httprequest object as their first parameter and to return a httpresponse object

2750087
httprequest	httpresponse
but if you really aren t interested in using httpresponse or httprequest objects perhaps you should just not call your methods views

2750103
mp3	wav
audiofilereadpacketdata and audiofilereadpackets shield you from the details of for instance how big a frame might be in bytes because you might be reading from a wav file which has a different structure to an mp3 file or your mp3 file uses a variable bit rate

2750158
ubuntu	debian
it allows you to deploy a minimal ubuntu or debian version of your choice into a chroot environment

2750172
moq	typemock
coming from moq the syntax and exceptions from typemock confuse me a great deal

2750184
gmail	hotmail
there are servers that support finger to verify that a particular user exists but for hotmail gmail it s just not possible

2750218
put	get
when you run out of registers some values may get put on the stack etc.

2750246
hash	md5
i currently use md5_file to run through about 15 urls and verify their md5 hash

2750255
width	margin
- a left column of fixed width of 1 unit 245px - 1 block + margin to left

2750301
free	malloc
but if data is pointing to a block created by malloc then the above call is fine....and we can free that block using free function

2750341
post	put	post	get	put	get
so in my post class i ve created methods that respond to post get put and delete http methods

2750341
post	put
the current problem i m having is a conceptual one i know that sending a put http message with an edited post to post 52 should update post with id 52 with the body contents of the http message

2750389
hide	show
the advantage is that you can use logging levels to indicate the importance of the information so that you can configure externally which levels to show hide in the output so that you don t get annoyed by the -after all- useless information how the output should look like include a timestamp thread id classname methodname etc and where the output should be written to the console a file an email etc and in case of for example files also how they should be created group by year month and or day

2750390
post	get
as part of a jquery function u use this ajax post statement to get some reaction from a server

2750404
hide	show
the only reason to use the uisplitview controller is the show hide logic it gets you for free

2750416
google-chrome	firefox
in ie the image is still clickable but in firefox or google-chrome its not

2750461
accessor	properties
the jit compiler ensures that an automatic properties is just as efficient as a field it inlines the accessor method call

2750489
int	chars	int	double
the generic method will work well if the type can be known at compile-time or if it s one of only a finite set of types and you ll pick a type that was named at compile-time user will say one of int chars or double and you ll use the correct generic accordingly

2750492
glassfish	weblogic
but if you need a full java ee server and if this is an option i would use glassfish v3 in embedded mode instead of weblogic it will be much simpler

2750518
jobs	cron
is there a way to find out if cron jobs are available on the server

2750552
mp3	wav
i just did a lot of reading and coding to process wav and mp3 files and i don t believe i saw the term packet once

2750554
post	put	post	get	put	get
the action is an http verb get put delete post and is supposed to be a part of the http request and not part of the url

2750574
pull	push
i configured mercurial on iis 7 and i am able tu push and pull without problems some test files

2750575
int	chars
newline chars could work in this case assuming that i don t have n in the name but i could have special chars in the data part so there s no way to know when it ends so i m putting an int value in the file before the data which has the size of the data

2750575
int	chars
i see 4 null chars in the file when i open it instead of seeing an int

2750575
fseek	fread
the code i tried to read didn t work at all i tried it with fread but i m not sure if i should use fseek with it or it just read the other character after it

2750576

post	get
the first ones problem is that it send the custom as get but i want to receive it as post

2750638
try-catch	exception-handling
i want to ask why we don t have to add try-catch block to a runtimeexception while we should do that with other exception-handling

2750645
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception	illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
passing a null argument then throw nullpointerexception or an illegal argument then throw illegalargumentexception or the method is called at the wrong moment state then throw illegalstateexception etcetera

2750658
allocator	stl
in particular this is how allocator s usually implement the construct method which is used among others by the stl container classes to construct objects

2750710
google-chrome	firefox
test this in firefox and google-chrome webkit browser

2750722
hash	md5
the server and client both share the same document and therefore each message the client sends contains an md5 hash which the server compares to after generating its own hash to ensure the server and client documents are synchronized

2750779
installation	upgrade
apple may upgrade components through regular system updates which could interfere with any modifications you have made and if you make a mistake with an installation it s difficult to remedy it without doing a full system reinstallation or having some serious understanding of the operating system guts

2750788
rubygems	rvm
i am running rvm and would like to set up an environment to run this program with ruby 1.8.7 and rubygems 1.3.5

2750790
powerpc	i386
i understand when talking about theses environments we re actually talking about 3-4 different architectures powerpc i386 arm and the a4 arm variant so there may not be a single answer

2750790
int	chars
for instance a plain old c-array of 100 000 chars is smaller than the same 100 000 int by a factor of four but if during an enumeration reading out each index involves a cast boxing unboxing of sorts will we see overall lower performance despite the saved memory overhead

2750843
x86	64bit
can t speak for ppc arm a4arm but x86 has the ability to operate on data as if it was 8bit 16bit or 32bit 64bit if an x86_64 in 64bit mode although i m not sure if the compiler would take advantage of those instructions

2750861
hash	md5
ad does not expose its internal hash externally and besides it doesn t use md5 to hash passwords

2750935
png	ico
converting the icons from ico to png

2750935
png	ico
also in going from ico to png actually increased the size of the icon file.

2751024
multiplying	transpose
multiplying both sides by the transpose of the nx3 matrix and solve

2751032
put	get
i get all of the function definitions from an xml document that i already have put into an array of function names and i need to grab just those functions from the php file

2751033
jar	manifest.mf
how can a clojure program find its own manifest.mf assuming it is packaged in a jar file

2751046
int	chars	int	double
sometimes to make a function accept data of different types int chars double etc one might use template

2751058
matplotlib	scipy
i have access to a cluster of unix machines but they don t have the software i need numpy scipy matplotlib etc so i have to install them by myself i don t have root permissions either so commands like apt-get or yast don t work

2751094
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the unchecked-exception classes are the class runtimeexception and its subclasses and the class error and its subclasses

2751094
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
so because a runtimeexception in a unchecked-exception the compiler doesn t force you to handle it

2751158
getter	setter
getter setter are perfectly appropriate in the right conditions

2751158
decltype	auto
if you wanted to change your interface from long to int then between decltype templates and auto this is easily achievable which is why such constructs rock

2751161
getter	setter
getter and setter are just methods

2751161
getter	setter
spraying the guts of an object all over the place whether directly or through getter setter is always a bad idea

2751161
getter	setter
but raising that to the point of saying that getter and setter are always bad

2751165
fink	macports
the dialog should offer to install to bin by default if it exists otherwise defaulting to usr local bin and offer the macports opt local bin and fink sw bin if they exist

2751223
post	get
i read this post how to connect to host machine from within virtual pc image and was able to get my virtual pc to ping my physical machine using the loopback adapter

cvs	svn
now i m not that cvs svn etc

2751244
integer	unsigned
essentially what s happening is that each separate value 0xff r g b are being shifted the appropriate amount of places 24 16 8 and 0 and then or-ed together to combine them and store into a single unsigned integer variable

2751255
integer	unsigned
it takes four byte values and put together into a 32 bit unsigned integer

versioning	upgrade
if your project is hosted on a shared host you will have to stick with the python versioning installed on the host personally i am stuck with python 2.4.4 hoping my hosting provider will upgrade to 2.5 or 2.6 which will not come anytime soon

2751881
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the first huge advantage is that you wouldn t be choosing one client platform vs another -- just support modern cross-platform browsers like firefox or google s google-chrome and your customers will be able to pick whatever client platform s they prefer if you also carefully check your app on safari which has much rendering logic in common with google-chrome via the webkit framework your web app will then be usable on ipad too

2751881
disk	ram
oh and the computational resources needed to run the application such as ram cpu power disk space ... are cheaper in bulk on a server or small group of servers and thus shared among those clients which are active at a given time than spread out over many clients including many who won t happen to be active at any givem time

width	height
assuming we have a width x height bitmap picture this wrapper class should serve the purpose of allowing me to send to other methods classes itself instead of the original bitmap

2752531
16-bit	64bit
a word is the number of bits a cpu can handle at once 16-bit 32-bit 64bit etc and in your example stores the address or perhaps offset of the next block

2752536
width	height
this way you go from five parameters to two since you don t need to pass in the bitmap and each bitmap presumably knows its own width and height

2752537
16-bit	64bit
it may be as low as 2 bytes 16-bit or as high as 8 bytes 64bit

2752560
int	double
typically this variable has a type -- just like value variables declared as int double string etc

2752618
ienumerable	ienumerator
rx is very general so it has unlimited utility just like ienumerable ienumerator has unlimited utility

2752618
pull	push
being able to look at something from either a pull point of view or a push point of view and being able to control the direction or means is very powerful because now you can push and pull computations around at will using linq query operators for free against an io because it s the mathematical dual of ie

2752627
width	height
using fill_parent and wrap_content for the layoutparams width or height can give some useful results

2752627
layoutparams	viewgroup
be careful with layoutparams because there are lots of them and only the one that matches the viewgroup class should be used

2752712
lxml	beautifulsoup
it uses lxml underneath and is much faster than beautifulsoup

2752852
integer	unsigned
even when receiving byte objects from read the largest unsigned integer will be 255

2752857
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
for 3 you can use an objectinputstream contructed from a fileinputstream see the class-level javadoc for some copy+paste code to deserialize your object s from the binary data stored in a file

2753239
free	malloc
besides why do you use malloc and free instead of and

2753260
superclass	subclassing
if that s not enough you can either override layoutsubviews to account for different sizes or perhaps go with a common superclass to contain the logic and two subclassing to do the different layouts

2753370
typedef	struct
not to do with your problem but in c++ there is no need to typedef classes and struct like this

2753376
multiplying	transpose
to rotate it multiplying it by its transpose and then by this matrix i dentity h orizontaly m irrored

my question is how to you use a hash function to generate a value in this way for example an md5 hash is typically represented by a 32 length hex string how would i use an md5 hashing algorithm to generate a value between 0 and m where i can specify m

2753485
atomic	interlocked
the best solution would be to use a guaranteed atomic api for example the windows interlocked api

2753500
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
this is the quickest and cheapest answer but you ll want to read a little bit more about other dom features offered by javascript such as getelementbyid ... getelementsbytagname ... childnodes addchild ... removechild ... replacechild ... .

2753611
width	height
if you know the width and height of the image you can use text_box to position a text box next to the image and collect the returned string of the text that did not fit

2753674
outputstream	inputstream
the httpservlet behind the url-pattern of reportservlet has just to invoke jasperreports as per its documentation tutorials obtain an inputstream of it and write it to the outputstream of the httpservletresponse along with a correct set of response headers at least the content-type is important

2753683
width	height
can somebody teach me how to estimate or set the width height for the components

2753697
client-side	server-side
jquery works client-side you need a server-side language such as php asp.net etc to do that

rails use the url as well as the http verb get post put delete to determine which action a request should resolve to

2753957
ant	maven
gradle nicely combines both ant and maven taking the best from both frameworks

2753957
ant	maven
flexibility from ant and convention over configuration dependency management and plugins from maven

2753957
ant	maven
on top of that it uses groovy syntax which gives much more expression power then ant maven s xml

getter	setter
and i synthesize a setter and getter in my view controller

2755019
getter	setter
i could just ditch the setter and access the frontleft variable directly but i was under the impression i should use setter and getter as much as possible and logically it seems like the setfrontleft method should work

2755019
getter	setter
why use a setter and getter at all if you are in the same class as those setter and getter

2755024
hide	show
are you using the jquery ui accordian or using the jquery accordian which is more or less a series of show and hide which is used more commonly i would think

2755024

2755464
try-catch	exception-handling
secondly the try-catch block you ve specified is generic enough to deal with any exception-handling that derives from std exception-handling - so having the bulk of your program code within the try-catch block isn t a bad thing

2755464
try-catch	exception-handling
it s outside the scope of your try-catch so an exception-handling here would kill the program unexpectedly

2755464
try-catch	exception-handling
if you were to decide to wrap most of the program in that try-catch block but would still like to dynamically allocate the simplemidiout object you could make the memory management a bit easier by using an auto_ptr to manage the memory for you in the event of an exception-handling

multiplying	add
smooth bleu is calculated like the normal bleu score except that you add one to the n-gram match counts so that you avoid multiplying anything by zero when evaluating short segments of text

2755607
n-gram	words
smooth-bleu should be much faster to compute than the levenshtein distance while still capturing words order information since it looks at n-gram matches rather than just matches between single words

2755620
glut	sdl
all the ones i do find all use crappy sdl and or glut which are just plain useless

put	get
i m confident the mapping isn t accidentally being removed since i ve commented out all calls to remove and i don t use clear or any other mutators just get and put

if you want to prevent constraints checking what comes to my mind is that you can either accept naturally thrown exceptions as polygenelubricants suggested or create an abstract super class to all your data structures based on arrays

2757943

folder	directory
the solution that i found is to make content folder a virtual directory and remove mapping from its configuration

2758961
public	protected
if i don t see an access modifier public protected internal protected internal then i can assume it s private although i try to be explicit about access modifiers

2759090
cvs	svn
fyi to setup a bare repo for use as something similar to a central cvs svn etc repo do the following on the remote

where startloading and stoploading are callback functions that show hide your activity indicator

2759179
strtr	multibyte
i believe strtr is multibyte safe either way since str_replace is multibyte safe you could wrap it

serializable	deserialization
c++ does not have any native reflection system unlike c# or java which prevents for example this kind of automatic printing serializable or deserialization

2759203
serializable	deserialization
another example would be to use fusion.vector or fusion.map to store the attributes of the class and then expose this sequence to automatic print serializable deserialization methods

2759275
outputstream	inputstream
however i don t know how to redirect the outputstream to an inputstream because the setblob method needs an istream as the input parameter

2759297

maven	pom.xml	maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
note the reason i want such a pom.xml and not rely on regular dependency resolution is that i have created a tests jar using maven-jar-plugin test-jar and using that jar as a dependency causes maven to not use its transitive dependencies

2759820
google-chrome	safari
my site behaves properly in google-chrome but has a bug in safari

2759842
hash	md5
assuming that md5 is a secure hash function it turns out it is not secure but for the sake of the discussion let s suppose that it is secure then it should behave like a random oracle a mythical object which outputs uniformly random values under the sole constraint that it remembers its previous outputs and returns the same value again given the same input

2759845
integer	unsigned
i think of the one-bit integer which would be 0 or 1 if unsigned or just the signed bit if signed or the two bit integer which would be -2 1

2759858

however after double clicking on the jlist element the text gets inserted but the caret is not appearing on the jtextpane

2759880
jlist	jtextpane
any idea on how to de-focus the selection on the jlist or make the caret appear on the jtextpane after the text insertion

2759887
integer	unsigned
you should first convert the hash output to an unsigned integer then reduce it modulo m

2759937
inline	inlining
the inline keyword and associated quirks including implicit inlining and auto-inlining

2759941
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat

when a setter and getter function name mismatch i get a an error...but the error is show sometimes and not all the time...how do i log such errors.is there any separate log for this

2760096
free	malloc
if you want to ensure that the array d is no longer eating up memory while your code is running you can either convert the code in curly braces into a separate function or explicitly malloc and free the memory instead of using automatic storage

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am displaying the following html to my browser firefox works however google-chrome and safari are not

2760201
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what is displayed below in firefox is working as intended but safari and google-chrome are displaying a blue question mark with a box around it

2760201
google-chrome	safari
the 1x1t.gif file exists in the same directory as the script and everything works in firefox- however safari and google-chrome display a blue question mark.

2760201
google-chrome	safari
what do i need to do to get safari and google-chrome behaving as intended

2760206
spaces	delimiter
it is very simple to restrict the input characters to but i would like to have it display with a delimiter between bytes so for example if the delimiter is a spaces and the user types 0011223344 i would like the line edit to display 00 11 22 33 44 now if the user presses the backspace key 3 times then i want it to display 00 11 22 3

2760206
spaces	delimiter
in essence i would like to have a validator which conforms to this regex but i don t want the user to ever have to type a spaces as delimiter

2760282

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome and opera all show no performance degradation when i use javascript to insert a lot of data into the dom but in ie it is very apparent

2760297
post	get
i ve read several post in the internet about that silverlight only supports get and post and that the most of the web browsers too

2760297
post	put	post	get	put	get
i m developing a restful web service for a silverlight application still in early stage and i d like to know if i should use just post and get or otherwise i could use put and delete

2760307
firefox	safari
i find that using firebug for firefox the web inspector for safari or the developer tools for msie 8 helps me diagnose issues like this

2760341
getter	setter
if an object of the class is going to be shared by multiple threads you need to syncronize the getter and setter to prevent data inconsistency

2760341
getter	setter
if your instance methods are more than mere set and get you must analyze the threat of threads waiting for a long running getter setter to finish

2760345
ubuntu	debian
you may find certutil in the libnss3-tools package debian ubuntu

2760362
post	get
when using the browser http stack only get ans post are supported

2760387
hide	show
the script gives me the possibility to sort the widgets hide show content and change the color of each widget also it saves everything in a cookie to remember the position and style

2760392
folder	directory
you can put all your jsp files under a jsp folder and then symlink that folder into your web-inf folder in the exploded deployment directory

2760426
webclient	httpwebrequest
i d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponse

2760441
for-loop	loops
now normally you have a for-loop to help you keep track of things but int this instance i m not appending items in a loops and i keep getting an error saying x in undefined

2760472
pop-up	dialog
i want to provide a pop-up dialog editor for this inargument which will present a form to input the values of all properties

2760478
versioning	upgrade
this is a known bug - please upgrade to the latest versioning of php

2760529

so if serializable deserialization is all you need then you can probably use something else

2760570
mp3	flv
so why can t he find the codec since i m testing for a simple flv to mp3 conversion

2760582
range	max
the load is expected to be rather high up in the 100k users per day max range but will be seriously load balanced

2760601
put	get
i am not sure if this is the best place to put it but i wanted to see if i could at least get it working

2760612
integer	unsigned
the resulting unsigned integer type is

2760612
integer	unsigned
the correct reference is â 6.3.1.3 signed and unsigned integer conversion

2760656
hide	show
i can try and provide more detail if it s needed but my basic need is the ability to selectively hide show omit from the measure arrange process certain children of a custom panel

2760689
identifier	ambiguous
however access specifiers may resolve ambiguous identifier overload errors that would otherwise prevent compilation

2760735
groovy	gsp
i have observed the exploded war folder under webapps has gsp files but not the groovy files

2760756
google-chrome	firefox
further if i remove my dtd then it will work just fine in ie8 but still not what i expect in firefox google-chrome

2760766
width	height
keep the width and height the same to make things easy on yourself

2760792
versioning	upgrade
it s silly to upgrade to an out of date versioning

2760804
int	double
if i can implicitly cast an int value to a double like

2760804
int	double
doing the opposite casting from double to int results in the same error

2760809
jsf	wicket	struts	wicket
they could continue to use struts or slowly migrate new code to jsf wicket

2760832
jsf	seam
i d like to be able to make an ajax call using jsf seam richfaces and have the page update with the relevant h messages component

2760832
jsf	seam
does anyone who knows jsf seam a bit better than me have any good advice

2760840
int	chars
there are 3 tables given that store name chars age int and sex bool

2760847
children	parent
i ve tried the recursion thinggy with while getting children s ids move downwards from the parent while searching for the currently displayed item s id

2760849
versioning	upgrade
advanced installer has option product versioning identify by upgrade code

2760850
integer	unsigned
in both offset is an unsigned 32-bit integer and shift is a signed integer value

2760901
google-chrome	firefox
the code works in firefox 3.6 but not in google-chrome v5 or ie8

2760911
hash	md5
is it possible to decrypt md5 hash

2760911
hash	md5
to form a md5 hash of the data aaa

2760926
hash	md5
you cannot decode an md5 hash as hashing is a process that is best thought of as one-way encoding that is to say what is hash cannot be de-hashed

2760939
hash	md5
md5 and other hash functions are one-way you can t reverse the process

2760971
hash	salt
john the ripper is commonly used to break passwords using a dictionary this is a very good method espeically if its a salt password hash

2760975
hash	md5
to add to everyone else s point md5 is a one-way hash

2760975
hash	md5
going from an md5 hash value to the hash input is nonsensical

2761027
children	parent
when the user changes the combo box value i have to update the grid with children details of newly selected parent

2761067
google-chrome	firefox
here is a quick example that works in google-chrome firefox

2761096
put	get
one way to get what you want is to put each of the values in a div inside the td s then set a width and overflow hidden on the div s

2761179
put	get
i am in the process of writing an msbuild script to whenever files are checked into a certain directory in the tree get the latest version of the modules put them in a zip archive and then ftp the zip archive to a testing server where they re then unzipped and processed

2761206
width	height
one partial answer is to set the width and height of the datapoint in the style for the datapoint

2761237
stdout	stderr
if the output is important you should use popen and communicate to get the stdout and stderr

2761273
performselector	delegation
it is true that if you call performselector with a selector that the delegation doesn t implement it will cause a crash

2761330
post	get
use the post redirect get pattern to avoid this problem

2761409
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
that is the scriptable plugin standard suported by gecko firefox as well as opera and google-chrome

2761425
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
i m trying to render a 640x480 rgb565 image using opengl-es on android using glsurfaceview and native c code

2761444
ant	maven
writing an ant script is not hard and ivy gives you better dependency management than maven

2761510
superclass	subclassing
note that a superclass never knows about subclassing the only reason you can call the two method and have b s version run is because the function two was defined in the parent a class

2761512
wxpython	pyqt
i converted recently from wxpython to pyqt and im still facing alot of problems since im still noob in pyqt

2761514
cpu	processors
a processors might use this for a reset vector such that writing to it causes the cpu to reset

2761568
arraylist	treeset
if the dominate time is spent in treeset iteration rather than modifying it then copying the treeset to an array or arraylist only when altered and only iterating over this array arraylist could almost elminate the cost of treeset iteration

2761576
postgresql	mysql
sql conformance in the target areas oracle has funny -- wrong -- null handling mysql is all over the map postgresql wraps unquoted identifiers to lower case

2761578
min	max
aggregation functions vary by db provider but might include things like avg max min etc

2761614
memcpy	strcpy
try using strcpy or memcpy with the appropriate casts

2761623
avr	microcontroller
if i remember correctly in an avr microcontroller the register file is mapped into an address space of ram and register r0 is at the address 0x00

2761627
springboard	backgrounding
this is not a case of springboard itself burning cpu time in the backgrounding it s just how some of this processing looks when running instruments or similar tools against the device

2761639
folder	directory
so here we have a folder with an asp.net 2.0 application within a directory that contains a classic asp application

2761645
put	get
if i use array then the data i get out is nothing like what i put in

2761649
explode	implode
explode the search query wrap each part of the new array to format it so you can implode it and append the new string right on the end of your mysql query

2761655
hide	show
i m trying to hide the post titles using this plugin so i want to show the full breadcrumbs always except when entering to a post in there i just wanna hide the post s title i find it s code kind a confusing i managed to hide the current page title but not the post title only specifically.

2761658
memcpy	strcpy
you ll need to use strcpy or memcpy or something like the non-standard but arguably less error prone strlcpy

2761664
versioning	upgrade
i agree with hlglm that you should upgrade to the latest versioning of access rather than 2003

2761703
for-loop	loops
you will need to rewrite your foreach loops to a regular for-loop be able to do that without creating a bigger mess though

2761748
cos	sin
sin theta cos theta obj.fixedpositions

2761748
cos	sin
sin theta cos theta obj.fixedpositions

2761753
std	ostream
note also that you need to qualify ostream as std ostream since you should not use using namespace std

2761795
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing in firefox and google-chrome both are doing the same thing

2761805
put	get
to get closer to your question i would tend to expect that you do not want to put your input handling in your window class

2761809
next	except
the important thing to know is exception specifications are deprecated in the next revision of c++ except for the no-throw specifier throw which is basically officially saying don t use them

2761853
int	double
int double and so on

2761860
udp	tcp
at that point you begin talking about writing a protocol which will run over tcp or udp so that one side can tell the other side ok send more data or wait my bandwidth limit has been temporarily hit

2761889
multiplying	transpose
i think you want to transpose the matrix before and after multiplying by the rotation

2761959
draggable	droppable
i have the jquery ui framework s draggable and droppable elements working

2761959
draggable	droppable
i would like to programmatically determine which draggable elements are currently dropped on which droppable elements

2761997
typedef	struct
here are the typedef the struct of a hash_map and array_hash_map as well as a couple functions making use of them

2762077
nsurl	nsstring
basically i m trying to read email which appears in webview but not in real source code using nsstring method of nsstring stringwithcontentsofurl nsurl url

2762078
noexcept	throw
throw x was deprecated but noexcept seems to do the same thing

2762089
put	get
however the 4th and final query i know is wrong because there is no projectid to be gained from anywhere however i put it there to help understand what i am trying to get

2762096
cassini	iis
if your asp.net project is setup to use iis and not cassini during the upgrade to .net 4.0 process it ll automatically change the application pool that your site uses to the new asp.net v4.0 application pool

2762130
pull	push
if this isn t going to be just a single repo and you presumably are sharing the branches this will become a problem when you try to push pull as the remote branches will have the last known history

2762131
noexcept	throw
note that noexcept checks for an exception throw by a failing dynamic_cast and typeid applied to a null pointer which can only be done at runtime

2762152
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t happen when setting opacity on firefox or google-chrome but does happen on ie7

2762179
fadein	fadeout
i have a little jquery snippet that will fadein and fadeout a group of divs over a select interval

2762179
fadein	fadeout
i now need to pause this fadein fadeout on hover then resume on mouse out

2762227
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i must ve killed over an hour on what seems to me like strange behaviour that happens in firefox safari and google-chrome

2762234
inline	inlining
yes everything in the header file may get inline but chances are anything you know about function inlining is wrong

2762243
width	height
i have an imageview with max height and max width both set to 100

2762251
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i tried resignfirstresponder in a non-modal uinavigationcontroller with the very same uiviewcontroller and the keyboard hides correctly

2762277
put	get
i think the program is crashing because it doesnt know which title to pick when i need to get all three titles and put them into an array

2762294
post	get
i m following the instructions from this post but cannot get my methods recognized globally

2762296
superclass	subclassing
i don t understand your motivation for rejecting instances of subclassing given that by definition they support all the behavior the superclass supports

2762310
equals	gethashcode
from msdn documentation it seems as both gethashcode and equals haven t been overriden in bitmap

2762338
mouse	keyboard
but if you do it properly you can do some really cool stuff i for example changed the entire game library api that access video mouse keyboard audio... of my game in the middle of development.

2762360
noexcept	throw
there is some overlap in the functionality of noexcept and throw but they re really coming from opposite directions

2762360
noexcept	throw
the primary purpose of noexcept is optimization it allows encourages the compiler to optimize around the assumption that no exceptions will be throw

2762385
equals	gethashcode
i have not provided a demonstration that equals and gethashcode are useless in a bitmap

2762487
textview	imageview
works on textview for text and probably imageview for image

2762487
width	height
set the imageview width and height to wrap_content and set the gravity of the parent to left

2762492
pop-up	dialog
on mac webstart pop-up a dialog to prompt user for the location where to create an user is allowed to change link name there

2762493
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
so what are pros and cons if i use em sizing unit for width height padding margin line-height even for inline images also along with font for fixed width layouts

2762568
boost	stl
for example do the system files stl and boost go before or after the local include files

2762576
put	get
when you have a dae model and you want to put it on a viewportlayer you need to make sure to recurse through the dae model so that all its children get added onto the layer

2762583
boost	stl
you can be sure it doesn t matter what order you include stl or boost headers

2762610
width	height
cache your width and height properties locally rather than accessing them from the size struct on each iteration

2762632
mouseover	mouseout
along with john rashh s answer you could also handle the mouseover and mouseout functions separately.

2762702
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql and sql server 2008 all have geo-spatial features either natively or via extensions which include spatial indexing and implementations of the haversine formula

2762721
jquery	scriptaculous
i am in the middle of the road whether to use jquery ui or scriptaculous for drag and drop

2762721
jquery	scriptaculous
i also kind of get the impression that scriptaculous drag and drop is better than jquery ui drag and drop based on the online demos

2762721
jquery	scriptaculous
scriptaculous or jquery ui

2762759
jquery	scriptaculous
if you re already using jquery but not scriptaculous why add the weight of an additional js framework

2762762
tabcontrol	tabitem
the constructor of which takes the tabitem and the tabcontrol

2762766
hide	show
some javascript to hide and show the div

2762792
folder	directory
to use built custom templates just add a dynamicdata templates directory in your folder

2762827
cpu	hyperthreading
are you running on a hyperthreading cpu

2762843
udp	tcp
so no do not replace tcp with something else udp

2762855
tabcontrol	tabitem
the xaml for your tabcontrol and tabitem would look something like this

2762864
pascal	delphi
fpc lazarus is very similar to delphi but it s a different dialect of object pascal and it would be a mistake to think they re equivalent

2762911
wordpress	joomla
frankly i have little knowledge about internet security and how modern cms such as wordpress joomla handle this

2762911
hash	salt
i only have one thing in my mind that i need to use a salt to hash the password sha1

2762921
httpconnection	downloading
downloading the images into memory or a local cache using httpconnection or similar then use bitmapfactory.decodebytearray to convert the downloading images into bitmaps and assign them to imageviews using setimagedrawable to display them

2762923
domcontentloaded	onload
you d usually do dom manipulation in window onload or domcontentloaded event

2762946
google-chrome	firefox
a very hacky but a css only solution that works okay in ie google-chrome and firefox

2762981
google-chrome	safari
this occurs in both safari and google-chrome

2762981
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately i cannot find a documentation for setfillcolor the coming html5 standard uses a different approach and does not appear to define such a method so i can t check whether that s a webkit bug webkit being what both safari and google-chrome are using for rendering or a difference in what args setfillcolor wants

2763057
uitableview	uipickerview
i just struggled with this for about 24 hours and got it to work by following this tutorial and wherever he mentions his uitableview just think about your uipickerview and replace the appropriate info

2763135
getter	setter
they re just fancy terms for getter and setter

2763136
getter	setter
you can create a simple logger and add a logging instance in the setter or getter function

2763243
accessor	properties
you don t need to use eval you can simply use the bracket notation properties accessor

2763246
jgit	egit
considering that since then eclipse is in the process of mirroring all its projects in git repositories egit based on jgit have made some progress and are part of the eclipse ecosystem and is on par with its mercurial counterpart

2763269
int	double
the actual definition also has the assembly name _fun even though it takes an int instead of a double and the linker will merrily use this when fun double is called

2763269
int	double
c++ on the other hand mangles the assembly names so you ll get something like _fun int for fun int and _fun double for fun double in order for overloading to work

2763306
int	double
fun int has a different signature in c++ and exists as a unique symbol whereas a c compiler or linker depending on visibility would produce an error when you declare both fun int and fun double as c symbols

2763307
domxpath	domdocument
the server works with domdocument and domxpath to get the data the autocomplete plugin has built-in client side caching do ease load on the server

2763345
backslash	double-quotes
but i have noticed from looking at the records in the database that anything i enter in a form-field with double-quotes comes across in the form-processing as though i d escaped the quotes with a backslash

2763349
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
now in safari google-chrome and even opera the canvas text and div text look almost exactly the same

2763362
tunnel	vlan
this might or might not be a security risk if that particular network segment is on its own vlan or inside already encrypted tunnel or on physically secured network

2763400
google-chrome	firefox
with this syntax the image is visible in internet explorer but with the same syntax its not visible in firefox google-chrome etc

2763400
google-chrome	firefox
also tell me that how to give path of the image stored on different machine which works in internet explorer firefox google-chrome etc

2763444
implements	extends
users could choose to extends the base class or go ahead with a working implementation class or additionally they could just implements the required interface in its entirety

2763455
post	get
you can use post and get as any standard html forms

2763468
awt	swing
if you use swing i recommend working with the awt internal drag and drop system

2763470
ddms	adb
maybe the emulator is running so slow and the adb server or another component like ddms is a little desperate because seems it s waiting to the emulator to iniatialize the some home aplication

2763470
ddms	adb

int	double
unfortunately you can t use decimals in attribute values as the clr itself doesn t really know about system.decimal type - it s not a primitive type like int double etc

2764017
int	boolean
the question can therefore be recast as does the documentation officially say that programmers can rely on boolean inheriting from int with the values 0 and 1

2764052

since whatever result you obtain depends on the template parameter typedef typename is necessary

2764059
fancybox	thickbox

super	self
method 2 use object_setclass self theclassiwant in initwithcoder before calling initwithcoder on the super class

2764154

this also works well but not all the subclassing are necessarily going to be the same size as the superclass so this could be very unsafe

2764159
addclass	removeclass
instead of css i recommend using addclass and removeclass respectively

width	height
the header should always retain it s height and the navigation always it s width

2764699
width	height
edit 2 another thing the header has got a fixed height and the navigation a fixed width

like joachim sauer said your best bet is to do your development on ubuntu then do the final compilation on centos

2765220
ubuntu	centos
edit a virtual machine is the most straightforward way to build on centos but if you want to avoid the memory and cpu overhead of running a vm and don t care about differences between ubuntu s and centos s kernel then you can create a subdirectory containing a centos or fedora filesystem and chroot do that to do your builds

2765224

2769308
superclass	subclassing
i want to have a function defined in a superclass that returns an instance of the subclassing that is used to invoke the function

2769312

i ve tested in firefox google-chrome dev and safari on windows and the animation stutters in all browsers but more in firefox though

2769663
hash	md5
yes there is the possibility that you run into two files that have the same md5 hash but that s quite unlikely if your files are decent sized

2769663
hash	md5
thus adding the number of chunks to your hash may help you reduce that since now you have to find two files the same size with the same md5

2769668
udp	tcp
the example appears to be wrong in that it shows a tcp socket rather than a udp socket but changing that back to udp should be easy the trivially obvious change should be the right one

2769710
public	protected
-- if it should be a class should it be protected or public class

2769710
public	protected
how do you decide between implementing a public or protected class

lua	scheme
the computational model underlying lua is pretty much the same as the computational model underlying scheme except that the central data structure is not the cons cell

2769744
public	protected
if your class could be used independently outside your library you could think about making it public but if it accomplishes some task which is specific or tied to your other classes it could probably be protected

2769744
public	protected
for example a class to retrieve content from a url is a good general-purpose class so you could make it public but a class that does some specific type of manipulation of data might not be useful outside your library so it can be protected

2769754
strsplit	substr
since it doesn t utilize strsplit it doesn t do more work than you need -- reading the entire string looking for the characters to split on and creating an array of the substr

wouldn t subclassing be when you inherited from uinavigationcontroller and override that method to do something else without calling the super method

2769934
put	get
periodically #2 adds a task to the task queue while #1 transactionally performs a datastore get and put

2769968

i have a vps linux centos with 256 mb of dedicated memory and mysql 5.0.5

2772013
equals	gethashcode
the base object class implements equals and gethashcode

2772013
equals	gethashcode
it s best not override gethashcode for mutable objects and make 100 sure that objects that return true for equals return the same hash code.

2772014
hash	md5
it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower

2772049
datarow	dataview
you need to use a datarowview instead of a datarow and access the sorted rows from the dataview

2772136
superclass	subclassing
so the superclass should be get wrapped with a subclassing

2772136

google-chrome	firefox
firefox does not show any save or confirm dialogs after you click the install button on google-chrome install web page

2772239
google-chrome	firefox
or might it be due to having an old version of google-chrome already on the computer note the new version was still installed from firefox

for value-types the default implementation of equals and gethashcode uses reflection which is likely to result in poor performance

2772796
client-side	server-side
does the xaml file and its .cs code behind run on server-side or client-side

2772837

postgresql	mysql
first be aware as others have commented that postgresql and mysql have different ideas on what is a schema

2772974
division	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo
note that as long as stride and steps are powers of 2 the scary-looking division and modulo in to_index can be optimised to a shift and a bitwise-and but only if the operands are unsigned - hence i suggest changing those types accordingly

2772975
perl	tcl
i worked a system with around a dozen engineers that used c++ java sql tcl c shell scripts and just a touch of perl

2773226
udp	tcp
it has to do with the difference between tcp and udp

2773226
udp	tcp
since udp is asynchronous as opposed to synchronous like tcp to recieve data you are not creating a binding to another specific machine so for example if you were to try

2773226
udp	tcp
the udp socket does not know where the data is coming from so there can not be a unique mapping like tcp also unlike tcp the port you specify is your machine s port not a remote machine port

2773226
udp	tcp
another way to think of it when you create a udp socket it is like creating a tcp server socket

2773226
udp	tcp
so in a way you can think of a udp socket as kind of like a tcp server socket and that is why you have to bind it to a unique port

2773227

2774319
subtraction	addition
if you can predict the overflow you can do the addition and subtraction at the same time

2774319
division	modulo
the shifting of the modulo you re doing is getting you most of the way towards a full division algorithm modulo is just taking the remainder

2775814
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql hsqldb whatever

2775908
put	get
if you put that data into a table then you can write a single sql query to get the current auto-increment status of all of your tables so you can see how close you are to running out of values

2775960
inherited	subclassing
you can achieve similar results using inherited since two subclassing can inherited fully-functional members from the base

2775960
inherited	subclassing
but the downside of inherited is that your subclassing end up having a hard dependency on the base class

2776016
infobox	infowindow
you might consider using a custom infowindow called an infobox

2776107
for-loop	arrays
i used for-loop for this but i think it will be slow if i have arrays with 700000 rows

2776111

to avoid it declare your collection as a set instead of a bag and use compatible types if your use case supports it there can t be two trackpoints with the same data

2776126
min	max
group by - and then one of the max min etc

2776134
strcpy	strncpy
just use strcpy or strncpy

2776134

jar	war
the service war will need to be packaged to include the client api jar together with javadocs so that each version of the service is distributed with a bundled client jar and web documentation

2776247
jar	war
you ll need to create a source jar of the client project and to include this source jar in the configuration of the javadoc plugin in the war module

2776247
jar	war
the web interface war will need the ui jar and all the dependencies webstart applet deployment

2776247

2776368
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox this will work as expected

2776370
post	get
misunderstood your question thought you meant multiple submit buttons in one form on one page but now i think you meant one form going to another confirmation form...in your didrecievedata delegate method you will need to store all the html you get and in your didfinishloading delegate method you will need to pull out any hidden field names values and then create a new request with them as your post data and the url being the action url of the form

2776385
post	get
update to clarify i am using a get because this is a cross site include and a post will not be accepted into the variable scope of the http included file

2776394
children	parent
you could always loop through the children of the parent view

2776431
post	get
but really if you are exceeding the get size you should probably just switch to post

2776434
innodb	myisam
solutions vary from passing that particular table you are querying to myisam so you can create fulltext indexes which innodb does not support to denormalizing the row into searchable indexes not recommended doctrine orm provides an easy example of how to archieve this

post	get
i know this seems stupid but that s the only i managed to get timeout for post requests.

2776793
innodb	myisam

2777173
keydown	keyup
this is a known issue better to use a different event in this case like keydown or keyup you can see the jquery documentation for .keypress for a quick blurb about this

2777173
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

2777173
keydown	keyup
for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

2777189

i ve used apache cxf for jax-ws and jersey for jax-rs so i can t comment about cxf and rest

2777225
addition	multiplication
real computer systems as opposed to theoretical computer systems have a finite number of bits so multiplication takes a constant multiple of time compared to addition and shifting

2777225
addition	multiplication
if i recall correctly modern processors if pipelined properly can do multiplication just about as fast as addition by messing with the utilization of the alus arithmetic units in the processor

first i wrote a tcpclient tcplistener test

2777384
width	height
additionally i m also doing fit to height and would need to get the height of the horizontal scrollbar when it would be visible i m assuming that the answer to getting the width of the vertical scrollbar would make getting the height of the horizontal scrollbar obvious

2777395
distance	polygons
since you want to find the distance to the border you can query for the distance to the exterior ring of the polygons which is defined as a linestring

2777412
int	boolean
for objects that you don t control you cannot change this but there should be no need to boolean are int because of the liskov substitution principle

2777424
ready	each
when a swf became visible and would call the js to say im ready i would simply catch that call then find the js object it was referring to i managed to do this by passing the dom id for each swf as one of its flashvars

2777447
jstl	taglib
they should be all replaced by taglib struts2 jstl etc and el

2777512
openrowset	openquery
your app calls a stored procedure that uses a openrowset openquery to pull data from a local sql server

right now we are putting normal ruby scripts into a folder db bootstrapdata and running these scripts with arild shirazi s required gem to load and thus run the scripts in this directory

2778077
width	height
if you want to see the whole background image you will need to adjust the width and height styles so that the element extends to the size of the button image

2778077
width	height	width	text-align	text-align	height
i usually set width to the size of the button image add a bit of padding-top to push the text down a little height should be the height of the image minus the padding-top and then text-align center

2778082
lisp	scheme
some host languages lisp and scheme being the main ones have powerful macros so building a dsl out of macros is more common in those languages

2778173

fontfamily	font-size
this related question changing body font-size based on fontfamily with jquery cites using this javascript font detection library in combination with jquery javascript library to achieve what you re looking for

2778395
ctime	strftime
or still with strftime you can emulate ctime s format but with b for current-locale month abbreviation a for current-locale weekday abbreviation and so on

2778405
accessor	ivar
to clarify the possible bug is this when inheriting from a base class a child can not access the parent s ivar if that child also happens to implement an unrelated accessor using synthesize before the ivar is accessed

2778467
sorting	grouping
by sorting strictly by the grouping id i get a result set as follows

2778507
snmp	mib
however such customization is not standardized and you cannot make snmp queries using standard mib browsers or so on

recursive-descent	lalr
which means a language grammar ll 1 lalr recursive-descent the dragon book and generally a splitting migraine

2778538
superclass	subclassing
however i think it s generally a rather bad idea to access an instance variable of the superclass when you implement the methods the superclass you cannot assume anything about the instance variable because it might be tweaked in a worst manner possible by the subclassing

2778542
mockups	prototyping
the powerpoint prototyping toolkit provides a collection of shapes such as textboxes and dropdowns that assist in creating form mockups

2778563
fadein	fadeout

put	get
you can use the routelink helper to put a url on a link just to get it and see what it should look like - then compare that to your actual url in the ajax request

2779034
min	max
first of all do notice that your definition within 5 minutes of each other does not define a single solution and that your min +max 2 is not average but simply middle of min and max

2779034
min	max
and finally your decision to stick with min +max 2 will lead to instances where you might have a single row which is far toward max and min which could make the query miss any of the results and can happen usually all the locations with similar names are next to each other but it is not uncommon to have another location starting with the same name which is an isolated place far from the conglomerate of locations

2779195
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
now for tostring gethashcode equals and gettype there s no way to avoid having them in the first place - but usually if there are methods you want to remove from a base type that suggests you shouldn t be inheriting from it in the first place

2779204
firefox	safari
firefox already has them as does safari 4 and maybe others . the second is that the timer happens at a set interval but if your handler is still running when that interval expires the second interval is completely skipped

2779204
setinterval	settimeout
whether that pulse timer uses setinterval or settimeout is a judgment call based on what you re seeing with your actual code

2779210
linefeed	delimiter	spaces	delimiter	spaces	linefeed

i want to compress a folder which contains images text files as well as few sub folders in zip rar tar format then give it for download to user

2779949
min	max
whats the mathematical formulae to calculate the min and max value of an integral type using your calculator

2779958
udp	tcp
second there are limits imposed by the architecture of udp and tcp

2779958
udp	tcp
basically udp and tcp are both limited to 2 16 listening sockets per machine ip address since a listening socket is defined by a fixed 32 bit ip address and a 16 bit port number

2779961
post	get
a simple datawithcontentsofurl appears sufficient to get what i need i don t even need to do a post

2779968
put	get
when running via a console application it works fine but once i put in a windows service i get the below exception

2779972
integer	unsigned	min	max
in case of a unsigned integer the max is simply 2 32-1 and the min 0

2779979
min	max
the min max value of an integer variable is derived from the amount of bits used usually to the power of 2 ie 2bits 4bits 8bits

2780016
width	height
but i don t know how else i can bind to the width and height of the page

2780020
serializable	deserialization
mainly the soap message part - the serializable and deserialization of soap message. my web service is in java but i need to invoke it using c++

2780060
folder	directory
images directory resides in the views folder

2780065
int	double
for the first call int is implicitly convertable to double so the input to the method is a double and it does an equality check between the two double s

2780065
int	double
however for the second call the int is not being cast to a double it s only being boxed

2780065
int	double
so it s returning false as the input is a boxed int not a boxed double

2780090
google-chrome	firefox
this works for firefox but not for google-chrome

2780104
width	height
whenever my application starts it reads a file and parse it containing some information that will fit some forms and i create them dynamically without specificating any height or width

2780139
lxml	elementtree
post is lxml elementtree object isn t it

2780144
post	get
another thing to keep an eye out for is missing get post variables you might have forgotten something or it maybe modified with javascript

2780144
google-chrome	firefox
another option is to use wireshark to capture the http reqeusts generated by google-chrome ie firefox

2780145
hash	md5
i use md5 hash for identifying files with unknown origin

2780145
hash	md5
is the same true for md5 - can i take say first 4 bytes of md5 and assume that i only get collision probability higher due to the reduced number of bytes compared to the original hash

2780156
hash	md5
what is the probability that the first 4 bytes of md5 hash computed from file contents will collide

2780177
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
essentially you want the web reference tools svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe respectively to identify that the result of the webservice is actually a well-known object type - much as it does for many of the core framework objects

2780193
cos	sin
likewise cos and sin may need to be swapped

2780205
google-chrome	firefox
just to make sure the problem is not something very basic you do understand that the session is tied to the browser and changing to google-chrome will mean you don t have the session data you stored in firefox right

2780220
google-chrome	firefox
under ie and firefox i can detect it through the mimetypes but the mime type doesn t seem registered in google-chrome

2780223
google-chrome	firefox
depending on the doctype you use this might be invalid html no at the end and google-chrome and firefox handle tag soups differently

2780234
hide	show
i have a main window and many user controls that i want to show hide depending on the user choice

2780273
width	height
the webview is set to wrap_content for the height and width and the zoomcontrols are enabled

2780277
ivar	subclassing
you need to subclassing uitableviewcell and add something like an nsarray of uiimage ivar to display in each cell or 4 uiimage ivars if this number is fixed

2780381
superclass	subclassing
if i call m.getclass i obtain mypackage.message1 so the subclassing and not the superclass

2780445
width	height
this works okay and displays the swf on the stage 500x375 for some reason - not sure why testskin.swf is a flex app with no defined width and height

2780445
width	height
i have seen examples online where people say these work for them but whenever i set width or height in any of these ways the loaded swf is simply not displayed at all

2780469
hash	md5
while you cannot unhash the md5 hash you can look it up in a rainbow table

2780469
hash	salt
a salt is often employed with hash passwords to make this attack more difficult often infeasible

2780511
wordpress	phpbb
i m a little afraid of using wordpress because of his connotation all made plus my website is 100 hand coded actually i use the phpbb but it s not what i want cause visitors have to go out of the website to go to the forum to see the news

2780514
versioning	upgrade
3 so essentially i want to know if its possible with a device manufacturers permission to add to a rom some small additional parts and then give this new rom versioning as a firmware upgrade to the device so that a user only has to upgrade and not go through the process of rooting and flashing there device

2780518
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this does not work in firefox 3.6 ie 7 safari 5.1.7 or google-chrome 4.1

2780518
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
setting the page margin does have effect in ie 8 opera 10 google-chrome 21 and firefox 19

2780536
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
1 should i remember the initial angle and transform when touchesbegan is called and then every time touchesmoved is called apply a new transform to the view based on the current position of the finger something like

2780552
submit	submission
i ve got it set up to capture all the different submission that can happen as there are about 10 different submit buttons on the form and there are also 2 image buttons

2780567
versioning	upgrade
i ve had this before when i ve applied a service pack to the database engine but not selected to upgrade ssis and then it complains about mismatched versioning

2780608
ssl	https
yes gzip compression and keep-alive can be used with https ssl

2780608
ssl	https
this blog post has more information about tuning a web site for https ssl

2780651
client-side	server-side
you can t do that because php is server-side language and any loading is performing on client-side because server don t loads anything then loading script you must have in client-side language

2780669
folder	directory
2 manually create a en.lproj directory in the projects folder

2780677
hide	show
hide as a button to hide and show the like this

2780716
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to get it working and have successfully done so in safari and google-chrome

2780716
opera	firefox
but the exact same code will not work in firefox or opera

2780812
opera	firefox
and this works perfectly in firefox but opera tells f is undefined

2780920
min	max
if you are looking for the centre actually the centroid based on the interpretation applied by physicist rather than geometrists of the set of coordinate pairs then you should not be using min and max although you might consider bounding the search based on the min and max

2781031
post	get
since your request is a post but you use a get example of the problem this suggests you just need to add a is this a post request

2781031
post	get
note that this won t be enough protection in itself a malicious user can make arbitrary post requests almost as easily as arbitrary get requests

2781050
children	parent
this custom user control contains the parent so to speak other custom win form controls children controls

2781054
firefox	safari
indeed this work in firefox and safari but not in ie

2781054
firefox	safari
it works using firefox on windows and safari on mac

2781081
submit	submission
so you have to call modal with option persist true and on clicking the submit button close the modal and trigger form submission

2781086
int	double
in java we can assign a int to a double or a float

2781125
int	double
in java a double uses a 52 bit mantissa so will be able to represent a 32bit int without lost of data

2781126
int	double
there are two reasons that assigning an int to a double or a float might lose precision

2781129
getter	setter
using c# in vs2005 is there special way to create properties in the ide or can you just type out the getter and setter

2781157
getter	setter
this will automatically generate the code for a property with a getter a setter and let you tab between a couple of points to declare property name and type

2781161
int	double
basically you cannot lose precision when assigning an int to a double because double has 52 bits of precision which is enough to hold all int values

2781170
opera	firefox
etc... but then firefox arrived opera gained attention and now we

2781170
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
have firefox google-chrome opera and safarai as fully worthy alternatives

2781189
pascal	delphi
c++ pascal delphi and java all have static classes and those are what c# is based on

2781199
stretchblt	bitblt
try using createcompatiblebitmap rather than createbitmap - the two bitmaps need to be the same for bitblt stretchblt to work

2781206
width	height
i know the width height and center point of that rectangle

2781206
width	height
i don t know how to do that i only have the rectangle height width and center point and of course the angle i wish to find the point at

2781225
public	protected
i almost typed public protected private there but obviously protected doesn t make sense because there is no method inheritance of static classes

2781247
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie7 8 firefox google-chrome but not safari

2781271
int	double
int to long float or double

2781271
int	double
conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision -- that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

2781271
floating-point	integer
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value using ieee 754 round-to-nearest mode

2781282
goto	break
return is a control flow keyword just like goto break continue if else .

2781331
versioning	upgrade
the msi is allowed to have four parts specified for its versioning although it will only compare the first three which can cause confusion when trying a minor upgrade with updates only in the fourth part

2781355
portrait	landscape
if you check out that app in portrait mode there s a normal calculator and if you rotate to landscape mode there are additional buttons that appear to the left

2781355
portrait	landscape
the problem is the normal calculator view is 320px wide in portrait mode but actually shrinks to around 240px in landscape mode to fit the additional controls

2781355
portrait	landscape
i ve seen examples like the alternateviews sample app that have two different view controllers one for portrait and one for landscape but they don t seem to animate the transitions between the views nicely like the calc app does

2781373
put	get
i keep this example around to get me started just put the proper stuff in the proper files and edit it to match what you are doing

2781493
post	get
i ve tried using both post and get

2781507
post	get
i do not get a clickonce elevation prompt as described in scottgu s post on wpf 4

2781515
width	height
you can use the canonical form in polar coordinates for your problem where the width and height of a rectangle is w and h respectively

2781573
subclass	abstract-class
i have an abstract-class with a static method that returns either one concrete subclass

2781578
google-chrome	firefox
now in firefox and google-chrome the following code works fine

2781585
public	protected
however since all variables default to protected and you cannot really access a variable without defining an accessor what exactly does public do

2781594
decoder	encoder
or base64coder - an open-source base64 encoder decoder in java

2781628
put	get
when i search by google maps on the gps coordinates 51.501563 -0.12534 then i get canon row in london but when i put this coordinates in the emulator geo fix -0.12534 51.501563 the the emulator shows in google maps on the emulator a different location a301 bridge

2781645
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
and usually a better choice than bare-bones web stuff is using a web framework like django turbogears pylons or one of the many others listed on for example the web frameworks page on wiki.python.org

2781677
ivar	subclassing
protected means the ivar is accessible to instances of the class and subclassing

2781686
google-chrome	safari
however i have also read that string concatention is only a problem for internet explorer and that browsers such as safari google-chrome which use webkit actually perform faster is using string concatention than array.join

2781700
dictionary	map
i loaded about 15 000 pages letters a b of a dictionary and submitted to google a text site map

2781786
ant	maven
i ve used ant in the past with great success but know others who swear by capistrano maven and others

2781795
antivirus	mcafee
if you re gonna use the mail services of redmine and you have an antivirus like mcafee make sure you told the antivirus to allow ruby send emails or you won t get the mail service working

2781816
int	chars
int chars and bool usually have different sizes

2781816
int	chars
where int chars bool i suppose

2781827
folder	directory
in order to be able to upload the image through the application other one of either servers and then display it on both servers i need a virtual directory on both servers that point to a third file server this is the acctdata directory shown below with a sub folder images

2781836
jsf	seam
i know that in seam we could write an xml file if my jsf page is named index.jsf - index.page.xml that we could add there

2781889
int	double
if you allocate an int a short and a double the compiler will generate the appropriate machine code

2781890
hide	show
you can try to use states like selected pressed or just set a boolean to your item check it in getview and show hide progress based on that

2781960
ubuntu	linux
if you have used winmerge for windows then you will find this as a great alternative to winmerge for ubuntu linux

2781963
put	get
i must say i ve tried this in a dev environment and i didn t find any problems but i don t want to put it on production until i get some feedback.

2781971
put	get
i made a text rtf using ms word but there s too much junk rtf codes in it for me to figure it out where to put the clvmgf and clvmrg to get this to work

2782056
next	except
everything works great except when i click on the next page my button click event doesn t fire

2782063
integer	unsigned
to convert a 32-bit string using the same technique you have to use an intermediate type that can represent a full 32-bit unsigned integer in a signed type for performing the subtraction

2782111
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great on firefox and google-chrome but not on ie or safari pc .

2782159
post	get
however i could not get the expected behaviour of this property of the msbuild task to work as expected and recommend jeff winn s workaround and his post should be marked as the answer

2782233
libxml2	libxslt
yes nchecking for libxslt xslt.h in opt local include opt local include libxml2 opt local include opt local include opt local include libxml2 usr local include usr local include libxml2 library frameworks macruby.framework versions 0.6 usr include library frameworks macruby.framework versions 0.6 usr include libxml2 usr include usr include libxml2.

jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
xom is very easy to use if you are thinking of using something like dom jdom or dom4j i think you should check out xom

2782359
linefeed	delimiter
if you saved your file as western iso latin 1 most likely it has linefeed as a delimiter

2782380
gmail	hotmail
typically these are temp part-time or contract employees and so have private email addresses eg hotmail gmail yahoo

2782441
min	max
my question is in regards to the intial run settings population size number of generations min max depth of trees min max depth of initial trees percentages to use for different reproduction operations etc.

2782454
nsurl	nsstring
doesn t it know that param is an nsstring not a nsurl

2782457
nunit	mstest	nunit	mspec	mspec	mstest
vs2010 menu - resharper - options - tools - unit testing also shows the mspec unit testing provider but it doesn t show any details when i click on it as does mstest and nunit

2782463
versioning	upgrade
just because one team can upgrade to a new versioning of nunit does not mean that another team chooses not to as it is weeks of work

2782492
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
later the best recommendations are to use lxml html5lib or beautifulsoup 3.0.8

2782519
google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox and google-chrome all correctly set the cookie

2782532
firefox	safari
this includes a browser control that embeds ie safari or firefox depending on the current platform and generally behaves well on os x

2782545
post	get
first - every request has to be validated regardless of it coming in the form of a http get with an id or a post or a web service call

2782557
perforce	svn
my previous employer was using perforce linux servers mac windows clients my new employer is transitioning to svn

2782573
width	height
some images have 1 5 height width ratios

2782573
width	height
some have 5 1 height width ratios

2782573
width	height
so that i want to do is set that a minimum height width size for the image but also don t want the image size to be larger than a particular size

2782596
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
of course recent versions of firefox safari opera and google-chrome support border-radius which allows you to create rounded corners without using images

2782653
children	parent
it s easy to query trees but hard to query immediate children or parent and hard to insert or delete nodes

2782653
children	parent
it s easy to query trees easy to insert and delete and easy to query immediate parent or children if you add a pathlength column

2782669
hide	show
i think the way to go is to check if the value selected is equal to other and then show hide the input based on the value

2782695
width	height
widthxheight minimum values of width and height given aspect ratio preserved

2782744
implements	extends
why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class

2782745
std	ostream
if you really need to ensure that the output has been written you need to break your dependency on std cout and use another std ostream during tests

2782789
super	extends
is there a way to access the super object when extends objects using extends

2782789
superclass	subclassing
i would like to extend an object override a method but call the overridden superclass method in the subclassing method

2782822
webkit	gecko
you could make such a service by using the relevant parts of an open source rendering engine such as webkit or gecko

2782852
implements	extends
the actual point to take away is that implements is always preferred over extends on any questionable cases

2782883
pthreads	fork
the area of contention is whether mutexes and semaphores can be used within named shared memory as we have done or if pthreads only allows them to be used when one process creates and mmaps the shared memory and then fork the second process

2782937
testng	easymock
i m attempting to write some unit tests using easymock and testng and have run into a question

2782960
free	malloc
then view a office document a few times and find the malloc objects that keep staying live even after the actual uiwebview has been free

2782989
calloc	malloc
however as a commenter points out reservation of contiguous memory is the behaviour of calls to malloc as long as the memory is not initialized such as by calloc or user code

2783060
sqldatasource	formview
i use a sqldatasource in combination with a formview

2783092
iprincipal	iidentity
in the managers you can use iidentity and iprincipal built in access control interfaces in .net to control access

2783113
width	margin
you may change the content width to what percentage you would like or auto and or set margin s

2783113
put	get
i just mixed mine up and put sender there when it should be in the order of sender receiver subject emailcontent date but you get the point im sure

2783115
hash	salt
simply hash the password with salt

2783115
hash	md5
you can use php s md5 or sha1 hash functions for this

2783140
crypt	hash
you can use a plain text file with a hash or crypt function

2783147
crypt	hash
i suggest you use the crypt function to store the password hash rather than storing plain passwords

2783177
allocator	stl
every stl container take an allocator as a parameter

2783206
stdout	stderr
all its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected to the parent process through three streams getoutputstream getinputstream geterrorstream

2783231
stdout	stderr
do you have anything reading from stdout stderr of the process

2783242
children	parent
created two new methods in local copy of catalog block navigation.php to get the current parent category and its children

2783246
getter	setter
depending on how you actually access them objective c might actually use the setter and getter functions of that class anyway

2783246
accessor	properties
you can of course choose not define any accessor for a class variable because it is internal to the class or because you declare is as public but as objective c makes it easy to prototype them with properties and synthesize there does not seem much point

2783246
getter	setter
internal class variables do not need setter getter because any class method can access them directly

2783281
postgresql	mysql
from the doc it appears you can use cur numrows if you are using mysql postgresql or oracle

2783295
getter	setter
you can make the delegate property of your nsoperation atomic by not setting the nonatomic flag and synthesizing the getter and setter

2783310
int	chars	ord	chr
the chr ord x business gets the numeric value of the unicode chars which better fit in one byte for your application and the .join call is an idiom that converts a list of int back to an ordinary string

2783352
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
however monodevelop does appear to use the same project file format as visual studio and sharpdevelop so you could make an attempt at mixing ides

2783374
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m trying to implement auto-rotation in my application that is basically uinavigationcontroller with lots of uiviewcontroller that get pushed onto it

2783374
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i ve copy-pasted this in my first uiviewcontroller that gets pushed into uinavigationcontroller

2783374
portrait	landscape
but after i click button and get into second view i remain stuck into that portrait or landscape whatever was active

2783393
children	parent
subsequent calls to relationships children or parent on one of the affected node s will automatically examine the relationshipsource to determine the children parent or all relationships

2783400
cassini	iis
in earlier versions of vs i was able to switch between iis and the internal web server cassini

2783456
pull	push
git seems like a great tool for handling forks of projects since you can pull and push from multiple repos - i m just not experienced with it enough to know the best way of doing this

2783473
stdout	stderr
basically it is a requirement to have at least 3 threads per sub-process if you want to manipulate and examine its stdin stdout and stderr

2783479
onclick	onchange
then only the onchange is fired and the onclick is ignored

2783488
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m developing a flash game using the default simplebutton object for my buttons and the hand cursor is working just fine on pc google-chrome and firefox and safari for mac but google-chrome on mac is not letting me swap the default cursor for the hand cursor

2783490
addclass	removeclass
the scrolling part works fine but seems to run asynchronously so removeclass happens after addclass but before the scrolling is finished

2783554
hash	salt
hash salt

2783554
hash	salt
they can be defeated by a using a random salt and b using a strong hashing algorithm bcrypt hash or sha2-family hash for example

2783577
width	height
id flamovie width 250 height 250

2783600
firefox	safari
i have a web page that is displays differently in firefox and safari ie testing yet to come

2783622
inherited	properties
a documenttype object has only one documentconfiguration but it is not a inherited it s only one by one and unique to separate properties

2783625
int	double
here s the thing sometimes on fixed-typed languages i restrict input on methods and functions to positive numbers by using the unsigned types like unsigned int or unsigned double etc

2783625
int	double
same goes for c c++ sqrt input is an int or a double

2783673
maven	pom.xml
maven is not able to resolve org.apache apache pom.xml 6 as it s working offline

2783696
filtering	grouping
ideally if i can just feed it a select statement and the xtragrid could render it then i could use the xtragrid very nice data minipulation features filtering grouping by etc

2783712
google-chrome	firefox
i want ie google-chrome to work like it works in firefox

2783737
post	get
but i can t succeed using restclient or other simple utilities firefox addons that get post data over an http server

2783747
hide	show
i realize you re not asking about jquery but you might consider using jquery to show hide your div for easier cross browser compatibility

2783762
google-chrome	firefox
testing it in ie6 7 and 8 firefox and google-chrome would be a good start i would say

2783782
googletest	gmock
i m using qt + googletest gmock without any issues

2783812
for-loop	arrays
i want to use each separate arrays in a for-loop

2783812
for-loop	arrays
this arrays is created by an multiple select in an for-loop

2783827
post	get
i can run get commands from windows just fine i just can t seem to post to couchdb

2783839
hide	show
i think it something to do with the show hide editor

2783839
hide	show
1. hide the editor by clicking show hide editor

2783854
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
i d ensure that i ve tested it on a webkit browser such as google-chrome a gecko browser such as firefox and opera

2783870
intersect	contains
in the pairwise result selector i compute an anonymous type contains the value intersection 1 if the ray extending leftwards from pt intersect the segment and the value on 1 if the point is on the segment

2783946
post	get
and if each user has like a thousand post in the guestbook it will get really much to fetch for the system

2783965
hide	show
next the hide show methods simply add remove the display none style from the matched item

2783987
onclick	onchange
this doesn t the only different is the onclick which isn t firing when the onchange precedes it

2783992
versioning	upgrade
that said i would stronly recommend that you upgrade to the latest versioning of java

2784123
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i put logs in viewdidload which runs as does viewwillappear and outputs the correct count for the array

2784129
mdpi	hdpi
i d suggest using either mdpi hdpi or normal large for your resources - having both is overkill

2784157
multiplying	add
or a 1 a 2 b 3 ... - 0 strip remap your string to an array of the hashed values then truncate number cases if a number is encountered and the last character was a number multiplying the last number by ten and add the current value to it

2784173
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to do an upgrade and each time the windows installer is launching the installer of the older versioning

2784173
versioning	upgrade
and when i do the upgrade it is complaining about problems with reading the older versioning s msi file because its not in the same directory anymore

2784192
onmousedown	onmouseup
you can register events for onmousedown and onmouseup and compare the mouse position differences in each of these

2784298
free	malloc
why not just use regular malloc and free or new and delete

2784318
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i find ie is displaying my website weird different from google-chrome and firefox i try putting a zoom 1 in the css class for the part that is being displayed weird

2784346
versioning	upgrade
i have a situation where a user can install an older versioning of my software for the current user and then go ahead and upgrade to a newer versioning of my software for all users

2784350
post	get
correct assumption if you use post you have get in your call

2784356
actionscript	mxml
the syntax you re looking at mx method is a way to define properties in mxml instead of in actionscript

2784370
google-chrome	firefox
this was working fine in firefox but when i tried it in google-chrome i noticed that the session id being generated when the browser is redirected back to www.example2.com is a new session id

2784370
google-chrome	firefox
this now works fine again in firefox but the infinite loop is still occuring in google-chrome and internet explorer

2784421
prepare	execute
this reset the database connection allowing the prepare statement to execute without errors

2784422
switching	screens
how can i add a switching application menu item on a screens

2784453
hash	md5
the puzzle they used was reversing a one-way hash function like md5

2784455
google-chrome	firefox
if i use firefox or google-chrome the data in the input field is not recognized.

2784460
jboss	weblogic
one more enhancment we made is that we replaced weblogic with the open source jboss server

2784473
filtering	grouping
i have a filtering on the grouping to remove lines where grouping sums are zero

2784528
ivar	subclassing
my solution has been to subclassing uiview with a - id touchdelegate ivar and those methods above

2784571
comparator	comparable
there are two options with comparing items the comparable interface and the comparator interface

2784576
comparator	comparable
since date implements comparable it has a comparator method just like string does

2784576
int	boolean
the compare method must return an int so you couldn t directly return a boolean like you were planning to anyway

2784576
comparator	comparable
this is such a common idiom that there s a built-in method to generate a comparator for a class with a comparable key

2784613
post	put	post	get	put	get
this technique will really only work for get and redirects on put post delete are not generally recommended

2784626
button	right-align
which has 2 button side by side and it is right-align

2784629
children	parent
i have a parent child relationship in which the parent has a collection of children a set to be specific

2784629
children	parent
however when i update the parent and save again all the children are re-saved

2784629
children	parent
this behavior leads me to believe that the parent is losing its reference to the collection of children and therefore when persisting all the children are re-saved

2784636
punctuation	words
that being said you might be able to get a good enough solution by using regular expressions to look for words after a sentence-ending punctuation but you would have to add quite a few special cases

2784671
int	chars
if you really insist on c-style arrays where the elements are constrained to being a single type array of int array of chars etc you could use the ctypes module

2784682
ssl	https
i don t want to force the whole site to use https by turning on require ssl in iis

2784724
ati	nvidia
any solid ati or nvidia card nowadays supports the latest and greatest directx

2784742
lisp	scheme
could one say create a set of preprocessor macros that let someone write in something significantly lisp scheme like

2784747
comparator	comparable
classes that has a natural sort order a class number as an example should implement the comparable interface whilst classes that has no natural sort order a class chair as an example should be provided with a comparator or an anonymous comparator class

2784902
pop-up	dialog
personally i have some resentment for built-in pop-up and dialog boxes maybe because they block browser completely including other tabs

2784908
cpython	ironpython
i guess p4api is cpython extension so it does not work in ironpython

2784934
getter	setter
however now that c# gave the world properties it seems silly to use getter and setter methods instead

2784946
accessor	properties
stack overflows are one good reason to avoid doing a lot of work inside a properties accessor but if your code is otherwise readable and your intent easily communicable there s no hard and fast rule that says not to

2784974
getter	setter
getter and setter methods instead

2784974
getter	setter
properties exist in the language to express attribution of other entities - if somevalue is not logically a property of the type it belongs to then you should consider using getter setter methods instead

2785029
haskell	ocaml
over the last few years f# has evolved into one of microsoft s fully supported languages employing many ideas incubated in ocaml ml and haskell

2785035
width	height
one way that seems to work is subclass sublayout width height in your screen

2785045
comparator	comparable
if you do not provide a comparator then you can rely on the natural ordering of the contained element if they are of comparable typed

2785045
sortedmap	sortedset
take a look at the sortedset or sortedmap api signature for some example

2785079
put	get
if you just put a handle to the data in the queue the application that process the queue will make unnecessary work to get the data that the sender already has

2785122
versioning	upgrade
i haven t released any new versioning of the application while i try to figure out alternatives and i don t think having customers upgrade to os 4.0 is a solution

2785179
int	boolean
what is happening is that my boolean is either nil or no and then my int var 0

2785265
comparator	comparable
this requires your object to be comparable which means you need a comparator equals and hashcode implementation

2785286
many-to-many	one-to-many
split the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many s

2785296
mp3	wav
for the part where you get the samples from wav or mp3 in .net code i use naudio at codeplex free usable in commercial apps no real documentation just sample code

2785301
width	height
so i d recommend inserting a new dom element as the image and then changing it s height and width should scale it down

2785366
firefox	safari
it s used on an internal utility so i m not sure if there is a cross-browser issue but it s great on ie 7 firefox 3.x and safari

2785434
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
i m using qtableview and qstandarditemmodel to show some data

2785455
innodb	myisam
that s probably less than ideal as the myisam table will not respect your transactions if a transaction failed on innodb your changes made to myisam in that transaction will still appear

2785489
stringstream	fstream
you can either compile your app as non-unicode in the general project settings set character set to multi-byte or use the unicode alternatives to stringstream and fstream wstringstream wfstream

2785502
cassini	iis
are you running the site on iis or cassini

2785504
stringstream	fstream
use wstringstream and wfstream instead of stringstream and fstream

2785611
put	get
of course i would also have to put locks on the get and set methods to make the variables thread safe

2785619
mouse	keyboard
it s so bad that at 10 fps if i spam the mouse and keyboard for a few seconds not much happens then after i stop the game seems to play itself for the next 5 seconds as the events trickle in

2785622
width	height
the idea of my layout template is that i don t know the exact height and width of the very inner layoutpanel s because i may set certain panels sizes of the outer docklayoutpanels differently when instantiating this template

2785622
width	height
all i would like is to add a grid component to one of the inner most layoutpanels and have it size itself height and width to fit as normal gwt widgets do works perfectly with a gwt label for instance

2785681
put	get
i ve now put all night and tried to get my iphone program to perform as intended it has also succeed me sometimes but now i have pages with a problem i simplehen can not get resolved

2785699
width	height
if you want a background image to fit the size of the browser which i m guessing at but if you have a 100 height and width on your image that seems what you re after you could do something like this

2785707
post	get
you re sending data in post body but trying to access them in regular way with using action arguments like get

2785712
switching	accessory
i ve defined the header as uitablecellview so i could attach a uiswitch as an accessory view and it worked great but now i can t detect the changes made in the switching

2785734
width	height
do i have to actually place the content on a dummy rich text control set it s width and get its height with getpositionfromcharindex textlength-1 afterwards

2785800
folder	directory
cd to the directory php ext and look for a dom folder cd into that and type phpize then make make install that will install a dynamic extension for you which you can enable via extension .so in your php.ini

2785841
decoder	encoder
it doesn t waste any energy on eval decoder encodedprogramcode schemes which a lot of php obfuscators do these are encoder s not obfuscator s because any clod can find that call and execute the eval-decode himself and get the decoder code

2785850
google-chrome	firefox
tested on firefox and google-chrome

2785870
inherited	properties
imenuitem inherited from iextension which has two properties

2785872
children	parent
the problem i m having is that when i check the parent it does not update that view of the children if they are already expanded

2785872
children	parent
the dirty solution is to have the parent from the setter method post kvo notifications on behalf of all of its children

2785872
post	get
if a farther-down descendant has the property set to no then that object s ancestors values matter after all and that object will only get the notification if every one of its ancestors post it

2785969
int	chars
this function will successfully sort an array of int but not an array of chars

2785985
hide	show
usually if i just want to show hide a single row in a table or something then i ll just put on the single that i want to control rather than using a whole

2786067
helpers	actioncontroller
actually in rails 2 the default functionality of actioncontroller base was to include all helpers

2786067
helpers	actioncontroller
added that actioncontroller base now does helpers all instead of relying on the default applicationcontroller in rails to do it dhh

2786085
implements	extends
if this was java i would have made tag an abstract class or even an interface and have the different implementations img div etc. extends in the case of an abstract class or implements in the case of an interface

2786085
implements	extends
then your specific tags can implements the tag interface and extends abstracttag

2786102
restrict	shared
i m on a shared server with restrict disk space and i ve got a gz file that super expands into a huge file more than what i ve got

2786109
width	height
i ve made it slightly better by specifying a height and width for the parent div so that at least the space is already allocated minimal shifting around when it does load

2786111
post	get
use get method link to request information and post form button to modify it

2786122
qbwc	quickbooks
poking around options for integrating an online app with quickbooks i ve made a lot of headway with qbwc but it s fairly ugly

2786205
post	get
have you checked into the possibility of sending values via get instead of post in the form s action attribute

2786224
int	chars
change the field type from int to varchar or chars if # of digits is always the same

2786241
superclass	subclassing
it is generally speaking a bad idea for a superclass to know about its subclassing a principle which extends to construction. 1 if you need to decide at runtime what kind of object to create and you do create a fourth class to have just that job

2786241
superclass	subclassing
1 explaining why this is true is a subject hefty enough for a book 2 but the short answer is that it creates a dependency cycle between the subclassing which depends on its superclass by definition and the superclass which is being made to depend on its subclassing by a poor design decision

2786289
directx	directwrite
yes you can use directx 10 11 and directwrite using the d3dimage in wpf by creating your render target surface as shared and then creating a dx9 texture based on that shared texture handle to use in wpf

2786297
goto	break
workarounds include goto s and use of boolean variables to record whether an outer breakable block should also break neither is elegant but that s life

2786335
width	height
fix the height and width of the table so as to get the wrapped up data into the table.

2786348
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
finally orientation works fine in uitabbarcontroller while adding a separate uiviewcontroller

2786349
implements	extends
i m not familiar with the framework but it likely instantiates java.lang.object s which extends the desired interface or it instantiates some sort of behind the scenes framework class which was generated with an implements interface clause in the class definition

2786373
google-chrome	firefox
it shows empty space in ie8 where google map is placed it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

2786375
client-side	server-side
is it needed for client-side or server-side

2786560
width	height
how do i control height and width of this loaded swf

2786571
ssl	https
i want to send request on https so do i need to install the ssl certificate as the steps are given for apple push notification

2786580
width	height
you can just change the width and height values but if you want to do it with code you can use jquery to make this even easier

2786646
fflush	gets
as the queue fills up with messages indexing gets fflush to disk and above a threshold you ll see a performance hit which may be significant

2786646
put	get
in this scenario the connect and the first get or put call uses fail if quiescing set and subsequent get or put operations do not

2786646
put	get
this causes the qmgr to wait for the entire set of get put calls to complete but then the next connect or get put uses fail if quiescing so the qmgr has a chance to shut down if necessary

2786806
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
works fine for firefox google-chrome opera epiphany ect but not internet explorer

2786837
powermockito	jmockit
mostly likely you would have to use some of remapper testing frameworks such as powermockito or jmockit to manipulate the classloader manipulation in jvm

2786869
width	height
you can give the table fixed width and if you add a new column you can give this one also a fixed width or height

2786943
lisp	scheme
in many scheme lisp dialects when an error occurs a recursive repl is popped up .

2786943
lisp	scheme
one can execute scheme lisp code at the frame where the error occured and go up down the stack

2786959
min	max
you really need very efficient branchless min and max implementations for this since that is effectively what this code boils down to - a sequence of min and max operations 13 of each in total

2786959
min	max
note that this implementation lends itself easily to vectorization simd - most simd isas have vector min max instructions and also to gpu implementations cuda - being branchless there are no problems with warp divergence etc

2786966
post	get
also the blog post of marekdec how to get maven archetype to generate empty directories fails for me

2786975
singleton	facade
decorator facade singleton chain of commands etc

2786991
internationalization	translation
use the django internationalization to manage translation strings throughout

2787000
single-quotes	double-quotes
the simplest fix is to avoid single-quotes and use double quotes with the double-quotes in the json document escaped

2787005
put	get
but as soon as i put it inside a function when i alert i get undefined

2787065
quicksort	heapsort
space and time complexity of algorithms for example why is a quicksort sometimes the best solution and sometimes heapsort

2787114
maven	pom.xml
as far as i m concerned it should use the same directories as the package goal which are in my case inherited from the maven super pom.xml

2787152
punctuation	words
numbers are not words and punctuation ain t either

2787199
r-tree	quadtree
i believe instead of r-tree a point quadtree would be more effective for your need

2787199
r-tree	quadtree
spatial index demos provides some demos for a list of possible data structures including r-tree and point quadtree

2787205
vb.net	vb6
richard grier s visual basic programmer s guide to serial communications is a good book that covers vb6 and vb.net it s available from his website about 40 us plus shipping

2787212
post	get
the question may sound a bit naive or stupid but i was wondering...will post and get evolve someday

2787269

2787745
gridview	datalist
but the second only on databound context like gridview datalist and repeaters

2787760
width	text-align
i d suggest deciding on the number of columns in advance 2 or 3 then using elements with their width set to 50 or 33 and text-align property to center

2787796
rdf	owl
just learn rdf owl a w3c standard and it can still get much more complex.

2787807
hash	md5
i have experimented with comparing md5 hash of files rather than going through byte for byte and i have found that identical files are often missed with this method however it is significantly faster

2787838
rss	feed
i m writing a windows service that processes a number of different rss news feed at regular intervals

2787862
post	put
you need to put the line in your post function after you add the new html to the page

2787880
put	get
if you put it in lower case then you get a cryptic error message as follows

2788106
post	get
then you d understand that the web speaks in terms of http protocol its commands get post and others

2788109
children	parent
note that the event bubbles though so in the case of the nested links the class will be toggled on both the parent and the children but often you want to highlight the parent you re under in the menu not sure that you do though you can see what i mean here

2788215
profiling	debugging
how to do that or more littley how to debugging the problem the vs2010 profiling says only the problem is the binding and i know that

2788217
post	get
there is a load method which allows you to specify custom qnetworkrequest object and request type get post etc

2788223
vim	emacs
it can be run on the command line but there are extensions for vim and emacs to automatically run git-wip each time a file is written

2788233
implements	extends
rather the hadoop contrib s filesystemdirectory which extends abstract class directory did not implements the abstract function listall

2788279
aggregate-functions	sum
the sum aggregate-functions will sum the values of the bar columns

2788301
filtering	grouping
having filtering grouping

2788302
hide	show
one easy way to do this and a first approach you can take to start testing this is to put every tab in a different fieldset and afterwards make a tabbed interface to show hide them

2788303
aggregate-functions	sum
then produce a result row for each group based on the aggregate-functions sum

2788312
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
the only thing that might slow bufferedreader is internally it uses a stringbuffer which is synchronized instead of the unsynchronized stringbuilder

2788373
identifier	ambiguous
i don t exactly why sql needs these identifier it s obvious he doesn t know where to order by when there are ambiguous columnnames

2788418
range	max	range	min	min	max

traditional unix timestamps are an unsigned integer count of seconds since 1-jan-1970 therefore can t represent any date before that

2788622
accessor	properties
so anything you could put into two methods like that is valid for the two properties accessor methods

2788624
memcmp	strcmp

2788627
getter	setter
a bean is a pojo with setter and getter that follow the bean convention

2788633
int	double
sometimes the conversion might be simple double to int etc... and sometimes it might be more complex xml to some strongly typed object

2788659
getter	setter
the java bean spec does spell out no-arg constructor getter setter and serializable but spring does not require that your beans follow the spec

2788662
inherited	properties
i m trying to inherited the gridview such that i can add a collection of filter properties which can be shown at design or altered at run time which would be like -

2788685
integer	unsigned
it appears that mysql treats timestamps as an unsigned integer meaning that times before the epoc will all resolve to 0

2788688
opera	firefox
for opera and firefox elementfrompoint gives the image even when the imagemap is still there

2788692
filtering	grouping
more in general it offers a dsl to access and manipulate your collections in many ways like filtering or grouping your contacts based on some conditions aggregate some of their property values etc

so tcp packets have the df flag set which should cause an icmp fragmentation needed packet to be returned if an intermediate router has to discard a packet because it s too large

2788890
icmp	tcp
a typical example of a misconfigured device is a router or firewall that s been configured by an inexperienced network administrator to drop all icmp not realising that fragmentation needed packets are required by tcp pmtu-d

if you want to use a synthesized getter or setter use the dot notation with self

2788932
svg	vml
if you are trying to make a game then you can try to use svg for good browsers and vml for bad ones

2788934
getter	setter
it is also occasionally beneficial to access properties through getter setter in which case you ll also need to use self as in self.propertyname or

2788965
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
in your case since nullpointerexception extends runtimeexception extends exception the first catch block that accepts these exceptions will handle the exception

2788981
gson	xstream
gson is more about json-based persistence in the vein of xstream which can do json too and sounds a bit too heavyweight for just an applet

2788994
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
so even though nullpointerexception is a runtimeexception and an exception it has already been caught before those blocks

2789001
ant	maven
you don t need to create an ant plugin use the maven antrun plugin and ant tasks to zip the installpack directory under target before the packaging

2789026
allocator	stl
the stl relies on allocator passed as a default template parameter in stl containers which have methods construct and destroy and others like uninitialized_fill but not all of them operate on ranges

2789026

2789405
icomparable	compareto
restrict the type argument to icomparable then you can implement the operations with the compareto method

2789411

serializable	deserialization
while it s not important for an answer to my question i suspect my serializable deserialization code could be useful to somebody else who finds this question in the future so it is below

2789509
min	max
you are probably including windows.h somewhere which defines macros named max and min

2789510
min	max
visual c++ defines min and max as macros somewhere in windows.h and they interfere with your use of the corresponding standard functions

2789533

2789607
width	height
source image is 1024x768 my max width and height are 720x576

2789607
width	height
my math should be correct that my new image size will be 720x540 to fit within the max width and height guidelines

2789655
post	get
so in the above code links and post are arraylists i use to get the urls i need and they are used for different searchchoices and i initially had the synclock on the links and post but someone else told me to use the synclock me instead

2789664
try-catch	exception-handling

vmware	virtualbox
i think setting up a virtual machine virtualbox or vmware or... with a proper windows will be your only local option

2789938
inherited	properties
i m almost to the point of returning my own class which inherited ienumerable and has properties for hasnext hasprevious and pagesize so that i can implement paging on the client side -- this seems like alot of code

2789962
google-chrome	safari
here s a table that shows that h264 video os only supported by google-chrome and safari

2789962
google-chrome	safari
if the browser coughs it up and doesn t want to play it remember to check it with google-chrome or safari then you can just convert the file using one of the free encoders on the net

2789977
for-loop	loops
you can think of a run loops to be an event processing for-loop associated to a thread

2790034
ienumerable	ilist
you should consider returning ilist or even ienumerable rather than list for your collection-returning methods

2790036
put	get
i ve found that you can put a search query into the box and that acts like a filter but there s no way to get it into it s own tab and it s also a pain flicking back and forth between that and the full logcat view

2790125
post	get
if you would give me a simple example to post the above parameters to i will definitely get the trick

an analogous situation would be with the java classes int double bigdecimal etc

2790156
colorbox	nyromodal
most people liked colorbox but i personally liked nyromodal

2790334
hide	show
little more debugging and found that when the browser ressizes and the carousel is already visible its reload function is called to adjust its position so to help myself in the hide show div scenario i ended up calling the carousel api s reload function after the wrapping div becomes visible

2790335
portrait	landscape
fundamentally i want to know if the user is browsing in portrait mode or landscape mode

2790363
superclass	subclassing
perhaps there s a bug in your mail server s configuration or you ve subclassing phpmailer and your superclass is doing something funky

chown	chgrp
if it is a linux server you can use the chown and chgrp commands to change the owner and group of a file

2790400

jquery	scriptaculous
i used prototype and scriptaculous for a website of mine only to find out that it s quite hard to find plugins that are readily available for jquery

2790459
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve been curious for some time if it s possible to port jquery into tapestry instead of prototype -- as in completely removing prototype and scriptaculous -- i realize it kind of defeats the purpose of the already bundled prototype but i wanted other opinions on the matter

2790518
x86	64bit
intentionally forcing x86 mode when you ve got a nice 64bit server is something you d want to avoid if you can

2790628
mako	genshi
the good ones that i can remember right now are mako genshi jinja and cheetah

2790667
createfile	deviceiocontrol
some years ago it was no ip helper dll at all and to receive the information which displays ipconfig.exe one has to use createfile and deviceiocontrol to give such informations from tcp tdi driver see constants like l device tcp and ioctl_tcp_query_information_ex in tcpioctl.h

2790671
cassini	iis
the applications will behave the same my guess is that you are talking about the difference between running in cassini and running in iis

2790694
width	margin
remove the float declaration on the content div and it will stretch to fit the parent width remove the margin on that same div because it s unnecessary and is causing the chrome issue

2790694
width	height
if you are strict about your semantics or the top div is of varying width then you could generate a javascript solution where you set the height of content to the height of top + the viewport height - top on load and when the browser is resized

2790721
hash	salt
what it does is repeatedly hash the user password along with the salt

2790721

2790796
postgresql	mysql
it seems to be mysql and postgresql

2790801
int	chars
for if there were a way to do it and your regular expression had a finite memory of k different states for some int k an expression with k opening parentheses followed by k closing parentheses though a valid regular expression would have been unable to be recognized by that machine -- a contradiction notice that in formal languages our assumption is that text processing occurs one chars at a time from left to right which is the same for applied regular expressions

2790810
children	parent
this is used to make sure that all children are examined before a parent is examined in a later stage of the algorithm

2790973
post	get
just note the hash is not collision proof but is suitable to know the difference between get and post

2790978
getter	setter
my end goal was to be able to set a delegate for property setter and getter in the called class

2790978
getter	setter
so i put setter and getter methods in that class and then i want the calling class to set the delegate argument and then invoke

2791044
nunit	moq
we are using nunit and moq framework to facilitate unit testing

2791045
screens	hdpi
the problem is that i get severe banding on hdpi devices like the nexus one and droid since the gradient goes from the top of the screens to the very bottom

2791048
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so my question is must all of my uiviewcontroller on the uinavigationcontroller stack support exactly the same orientations going forward

2791056
google-chrome	firefox

2791172
bazaar	git
furthermore it s only a matter of time before all of our new hires show up not having ever used anything other than git hg bazaar whatever

2791174

a nice touch is to let a user go on the app and record all post get requests and use them as a replay set for typical user interactions

2791184
onchange	onfocus
to get the div to disappear when you first type something instead of when the field is checked you ll also need onchange and or onfocus event handlers for the fields

2791222

how do i get the origin point a width and height of this area

2791227
int	boolean
you should use int and boolean if you re using the nullable constraint

2791387
dictionary	map
for example if you want to index your data using a string like a dictionary lookup then the map will perform better

2791388
min	max
the aggregate methods don t provide rolling max min count average etc - they provide a single value when the original stream completes

2791442
post	get
there is also a post about how to get fx cop to potentially look for the dynamic keyword although it s not perfect

2791448
goto	break
it avoids the goto abuses the while 0 break combination for that

2791457
width	height
so if you wanted to place this container as a background image i realize this isn t quite what you want to do you could place a 100 width and height canvas in the tag of the canvas

2791460
width	height
note i had problems setting the height with the width using the style key

2791470
stdout	stderr

filtering	grouping
uncheck grouping items by category in the filtering type source

2791514

it also supports keyboard manipulation although admittedly the keyboard access is not as quick as the mouse or typing.

2791548
integer	unsigned
for your case with indexes 1000 key can be 32 bit unsigned integer

2791569
int	chars
rather than read p2 or the p2_0 pin into an unsigned int 16 bits you could use a chars 8 bits or single bit to save on memory

2791584
free	malloc
you can only free dynamically-allocated memory that you allocated using new malloc etc

2791588
post	get
but it doesn t works cause it tries get the post id and not the id of the page

2791699
post	get
this post has an approach that might help you get started

2791703
viewdidload	viewdidappear

2791824
subtract	add
the thing is even minor changes to a signal can sometimes produce a big difference when you add it to or subtract it from another signal because of wave interference and such things so the results are kind of unpredictable when you don t have the exact sound to work with

2791864
nant	cruisecontrol
i really want to speed this up and my initial thought was instead of trying to copy the whole media folder can i get the list of file modifications from cruisecontrol and specifically copy those files instead saving the nant task the work of having to compare them all for changes

crossover	mutation
also associated with this is the need to generate random instances for filling the initial population and to implement crossover and mutation operators for this type of chromosome

portrait	landscape
i tried replacing views and even view controllers in willrotatetointerfaceorientation method but that either causes crashes or the portrait views end up in landscape unexpectedly and vv

2791987
radwindow	radcombobox
i ran into a scenario where i had to use lots of radcomboboxes so rather then worry about validating their contents i just added text fields with a button next to each one that would open a radwindow with a radcombobox so values could be chosen dynamically

2791987
telerik	radcombobox
i ran into a few headaches that i had to work though with having a bunch of context parameters set in javascript before calling the webservice on each key up hint with ie set the height of radcombobox at least for 2008 telerik versions...if you don t you will start having freezes

2792136
multiplying	add
the hours are calculated differently for the different services writing is calculated by multiplying a per product hour rate with the number of products and the more products are included in the project the lower the hour rate is but the total number of hours is accumulated progressively for a medium-sized project you take both the small range pricing and then add the medium range pricing up to the number of actual products

mousemove	mousedown
lostfocus is only triggered when a user taps on another control as mentioned there are no hover events as the mouse metaphor does not work here as this is a touch-based environment - the best way to deal with control behaviour is to imagine using your finger to interact with the control - this may allow to design a behaviour which works the way you want then see how this would work practically a touch on the screen starts a click so there is no mousemove without a mousedown too

the format string to read an array of four chars then a unsigned int would be 4si

2795918
int	chars
i is the chars for unsigned int

2795926
bibtex	latex
you ll probably need to do this anyway to escape some of the characters that bibtex latex can t handle

2795985
put	get
it s obvious two versions of the activity that should only get called once are being put on the activity stack

2796082
folder	directory
one of the things is a possibility to open an archive as a folder staying in the directory tree and being able to drag and drop files from the archive to folder in the tree sidebar etc

2796097
width	height
the use of a width or height declaration is required to make the effect work in explorer windows and opera

2796105
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly on safari firefox and opera on mac os and firefox and google-chrome on windows

2796108
int	chars
adding int will keep looping as long as i enter numbers i tried chars but that didnt work

2796121
post	put	post	get	put	get
soo i should use gets to get all the data to remove.php then have a confirmation submit button and when users click on it it put all the data into post and delete from the dbc

2796182
post	put
to match your example i don t like jame s post so i put an image on my site like this

2796203
put	get
i would guess that once you get that in there before long you ll find lots of other great things to put in there too

2796217
codeigniter	cakephp
i have used some php frameworks such as cakephp and codeigniter to be frank they just work on either lamp or wamp but i am not sure how they approached such a elegant solution

2796221
didselectrowatindexpath	viewwillappear
instead of viewwillappear use the tableview delegate method didselectrowatindexpath and the same deselectrowatindexpath you were using

2796222
modifiers	sealed
local modifiers â abstract â â final â â sealed â â implicit â â lazy â

2796242
int	chars
the strtol library function will convert a string representation of a number to its equivalent int value and will also set a pointer to the first chars that does not match a valid number

2796266
postgresql	mysql
returning is supported by oracle and postgresql but not by mysql

2796287
superclass	subclassing
how would i get the path to the rb file of that subclassing from the superclass

2796314
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
kohana codeigniter cakephp and zend should be enough to kick-start a google-a-thon

2796322
post	get
i ve been testing this upload script and it looks really good but i just can t get it to post values that i have extracted from inputs

2796336
google-chrome	firefox
their demo page looks great but when i integrate their sample code into mvc the script no longer works in ie and firefox but it seems to work just fine under google-chrome

2796356
superclass	subclassing
after performing the class-specific deallocation the subclassing method should incorporate superclass versions of dealloc through a message to super

2796363
width	height
edit i would like to add that for this to work correctly you have to set the width or height to 0px depending on if it s an horizontal or a vertical layout

2796383
pull	push
i would use the built in push pull methods

2796395
mouse	keyboard
whatever measures you take all an attacker needs to do is to execute your software in a virtual machine that records all access to keyboard mouse and screen

2796475
cos	sin
since we want to be able to deal with very small delta_angle and very large radius we ll expand sin and cos and use this only when angular velocity is close to zero

2796503
width	height
you also see that you can specify the width and height over there

2796509
pull	push
keep in mind that you do not push ui updates to a web browser the web browser needs to pull or request the update

2796525
mathml	mathjax
of course it would be very easy for google to implement viewing of latex and mathml math simply by using mathjax on their servers

2796531
stdout	fflush
is it guaranteed to get the last thing fflush out to the program s stdout in its entirety

2796541
fgets	atoi
depending on what you want it might make more sense to use fgets to read a line and then parse it either with sscanf or atoi since you can then more easily give sensible error messages about malformed input

2796552
hide	show
the whole thing was basically one page with javascript used to hide and show content in such a way that it looked like you were switching pages

2796567
fseek	fread
you can t use fseek but fread should work just fine

2796597
subtract	add
i also would need to have some instruction on how to add subtract plugins modules components and etc

2796601
min	max
later on i ll access these objects sequentially from max key to min key

2796653
google-chrome	firefox
iam not sure but i think my browser google-chrome firefox - ubuntu is not allowing to store an cookie inside an iframe

2796703
getter	setter
you could skip trivial getter and setter but often those methods are non-trivial a common case is the lazy load pattern

2796707
portrait	landscape
similarly in landscape mode if i scroll the table past the top of the third section and then rotate to portrait when i come back to landscape the scroll position is always set such that the first row of the third section is at the top of the list

2796728
getter	setter
the getter and setter generally do not make sense inside a private classes because you can access the instance variables anyways

2796738
public	protected
first of all i would say to treat inner public protected internal classes the same way you would treat any other outer class

2796739
folder	directory
i have had limited success with restarting the program in that the files in the db folder are added and removed but unfortunately new folder in the views directory are not shown

2796762
post	get
method post doesn t get cookies or what

2796836
post	get
using post over https is better than using get and http

2796837
rss	feed
in my flex 4 app i access an rss feed i m using as a dummy

2796837
rss	feed
it works okay when i run it from flash builder 4 but if i export the project and upload it i get the following error when it tries to load the rss feed

2796841
post	get
all the above is quite easy to implement if the printer is network connected now if the printer is usb or ppi connected you need to get your hands into the hp snmp proxy agent you can find a great post here

2796936
nscoding	nscopying
this is a simple subclass not implementing nscoding or nscopying that will hold on to all the precision you give it

2796941
maven	buildr
a build in buildr is twice as fast as maven

2796941
maven	buildr
this is due mostly to the design of buildr which is lightweight compared with that of maven

2796966
range	max	range	min	min	max
when range has a min and max variables

2796970
min	max
if so does it return an object which actually has these min and max members

2796993
min	max
if stakx s answer is not sufficient you may want to look into min and max variables

2797028
post	put
in ajax validation when the user focus out the item it directly post the data to server validates it and then you put the ui and do validation on submit too

2797040
mp3	wav
you re not actually performing any conversion from mp3 into wav in your example

2797107
postgresql	mysql
why does ruby on rails generated more queries in the background on postgresql than mysql

2797107
postgresql	mysql
do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background

2797121
hide	show
if you only want to display 15 you should look for a javascript solution to hide the others and only show the active ones

2797130
jsf	wicket
jsf 2.0 and wicket 1.4 are first class candidates they just work with jpa 2.0 and provides support for the bean validation api jsr 303 which is in my opinion a very important part of the question

2797130
jsf	wicket
i d go for jsf 2.0 or wicket

2797178
put	get
you will also find that doing formatted i o may interfere with what you are trying to do so you should be using the get put and read write member functions instead

2797182
jar	war
in the java world i d specify interfaces in an jar myapp-api.jar the implementation in a separate jar myapp-impl.jar and package these along with other resources in the application war myapp.war

2797218
postgresql	mysql
number of sql queries is relative you must remember that to bring same results mysql and postgresql has their own implementations just to give an example mysql dont implement the full ps sql

2797223
onchange	onfocus
this can be accomplished with javascript events such as onchange and onfocus

2797251
implements	extends
i haven t really released this project yet but it s a t4-based repository system that extends linq to sql and implements a bunch of batch operations delete update create csv etc.

2797315
gif	png
first i use fileinfo for 100 known matches gif jpeg png because i do want to rely on fingerprint detection for certain files

2797341
twig	dwoo
however for your communication between controller and view i would recommend using a template parser such as dwoo or twig i don t like the one that comes with ci

2797362
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently it s saying find elements with that class bind this hover function to those now it doesn t matter that you re changing the class because the function s already bound to that element s mouseenter and mouseleave jquery events...even if it s class changes which is unrelated

2797362
mouseleave	mouseenter
with .live however the event handler isn t bound to the element itself it s bound to the document waiting for the mouseenter and mouseleave events to bubble up it evaluates if the element causing the events matches the selector right now and executes if that s the case...so if you change the class it will matter make sense

2797379
width	margin
the is a trick to center relative possitionet elements in css margin 0 auto but you have to define a width

2797458
sudo	nohup
sudo nohup nice command

2797458
sudo	nohup
nohup nice sudo command

2797515
portrait	landscape
if i rotate my iphone in landscape mode it s view should be in portrait mode

2797520
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome opera and ie this doesn t happen

2797544
pop-up	dialog
if you dont like the window style check out one of the 15 plugins presented on this page 15+ jquery pop-up modal dialog plugins and tutorials

2797565
ceil	floor
just take floor or ceil of the result in order to make the number integral

2797610
firefox	safari
on safari and firefox everything looks good

2797736
jar	manifest.mf
manifest.mf file in jar file shows

2797750
x86	64bit
in one project we have a dependency on a legacy system and its .net assembly which is delivered as a x86 and they do not provide a any cpu and or 64bit one

2797750
x86	64bit
now the project itself juggles with lots of data and we hit the limitations we have with a forced x86 on the whole project due to that one assembly if we used 64bit any cpu it would raise a badimageformatexception once that x86 is loaded on a 64bit machine

2797750
x86	64bit
now is there a workaround way to use a x86 assembly in a 64bit .net host app

2797768
umbraco	dotnetnuke
perhaps you should look at dotnetnuke or umbraco or sense net those are big ones

2797774
redmine	trac
i am considering moving from svn and trac to git and redmine

2797775
rss	feed
if you need an alternate feed to test with you can use the flex show s rss

2797794
put	get
it s possible to get bar compiled by using other means to put foo into its classpath but that won t work when running the application

2797797
vb.net	vb6
vb6 enough to exploit the function form_unload but in vb.net

2797814
width	height
hi guys here i ve created d dynamic table and how can i set d properties of the table like height width and etc

2797824
serializable	deserialization
correction the xmlserializer does appear to work without these on deserialization but it always adds them on serializable so something s fishy if they re missing.

2797825
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview commiteditingstyle uitableviewcelleditingstyle editingstyle forrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2797835
migrate	upgrade
as far as the compilation errors you re getting you will need to migrate your application target to be a universal application using the upgrade current target for ipad menu option

2797869
subtraction	addition
secondly i have also made the algorithm work with an offset that uses the natural bit position values and thus removed some of the addition and subtraction operations my original used until the successful return statement

2797880
redmine	gitorious
i built a system last year which used gitorious and redmine

2797880
redmine	gitorious
you can integrate git directly with redmine no problems there but i would strongly suggest you have a look at gitorious as well as the tool to control your repositories and follow their events

2797880
redmine	gitorious
integrating gitorious and redmine is pretty simple

2797880
redmine	gitorious
they are saved in the file system hashed when you use gitorious so linking those repositories to redmine would be a bit complex otherwise

2797880
redmine	gitorious
of course you need to have the git service running on the server where you production repositories are those that you link to redmine do your automated tests etc but this is also solved with gitorious

2797880
redmine	gitorious
it s already slightly outdated since both gitorious and redmine have developed a lot but i could make it available if you want to read it

2797880
redmine	gitorious
support for gitorious is superb for redmine a bit more sporadic damn french

2797880
pull	push
when you pull changes to your master branch from some other repository it s easier to handle the merging this way - and you won t accidentally push something you didn t mean to

2797889
internationalization	localization
sure this is called localization or as apple calls it internationalization

2797896
serializable	deserialization
classes that require special handling during the serializable and deserialization process must implement special methods with these exact signatures

2797950
strtol	atoi
this is almost as simple to use as atoi but also provides roughly the same level of detail in reporting errors as strtol

2797990
googletest	gmock
gmock claims to be almost as portable as googletest and frankly i don t see why you wouldn t use it

2798010
for-loop	loops
you also need to change your for-loop to loops over the range a to z instead of over the a to z

2798012
put	get
the reason i say this is a partial answer is that i put a bunch of sqlite3 functionality in my helper class file but when i call that from another class i get out of memory errors or library routine called out of sequence errors

2798081
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine both in firefox or google-chrome

2798099
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
probably 1 is for icmp 6 is for tcp and 17 is for udp

2798116
put	get
i ve also put print statements at certain places in the japanese part of the code to see if i can get any clues but all the print statements are printing each time so i can t work out if it is looping at a certain place

2798141
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested my site in ie7 google-chrome and firefox and they work fine but ie8 is having some layout issues

2798153
ironruby	ironpython
there s multiple implementations of programming languages like ruby python c c++ haskell basic and javascript because people wanted to integrate them with java jruby jython or .net ironruby ironpython or plainly wanted to write their own compilers and interpreters for learning

2798158
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
i am using least significant bit algorithm and could do it successfully with bmp files but it does not work with jpeg png or tiff files

2798161
content-disposition	content-type
what i do is generate the report directly to the response stream after setting the content-type of the response to application pdf and setting a content-disposition header to either if i want to hint to the browser that it should offer a download or if i want to hint to the browser to show it in the brower s ui

2798175
tesseract	tessnet2
or look at the tessnet2 tesseract .net library most of the free open source ocrs use the tesseract engine

2798188
clang	icc
how can i mark a function in such way for the different compilers gcc clang icc msvc or others

2798202
public	protected
those languages use some identifiers like public private protected to try to do the jobs of header files

2798203
public	protected
if you re using php5 5.3.2 with phpunit you can test your private and protected methods by using reflection to set them to be public prior to running your tests

2798215
treeview	tabcontrol
but i cannot find any way to hide the tabcontrol buttons since i already have a treeview for selecting items

2798242
jsf	wicket	struts	wicket
spring mvc has lots of competitors struts 1 and 2 jsf wicket flex etc. so it s not always the first choice for web mvc

2798260
serializable	deserialization
i m not sure about serializable deserialization from within a jar file but

2798261
public	protected
they use some identifiers like public private protected to do the jobs of header files

2798261
public	protected
i think you re wrong there c++ for instance still has public private and protected but it s common to split the implementation from the interface with a header file although that doesn t go for function-templates

2798272
versioning	upgrade
i was using the latest released versioning and have since upgrade to 5.0.375.29 beta but the behavior is the same in both versioning

2798296
getter	setter
you will need a backing field for both the getter and setter you can t have a partially automatic property

2798298
getter	setter
you would have to do things the old fashioned way define backing field and implement the getter and setter logic yourself

2798310
width	height
i have a flash files with symbols i need to export as png images for some reason the exported images have different width and height than indicated in the flash file

2798310
width	height
after checking i found out that the new dimensions don t even keep the original ratio between height and width

2798348
touchescancelled	touchesended
the event methods touchesended and touchescancelled are only fired when the event is cancelled or the finger lifted

2798354
versioning	upgrade
so if you re still using jsf 2.0 2.1 you d best upgrade to at least that versioning

2798388
integer	unsigned
a word is a 16-bit unsigned integer which can store the values 0..65535

2798413
free	malloc
i need to answer a basic question from inside my c program compiled by gcc for linux how much of process heap is currently in use allocated by malloc and how much resides if free heap blocks

2798446
spaces	delimiter
cut only allows single-character delimiter like a single spaces and there are certainly gazillion other ways to split the line

2798448
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and safari delete the tcp connection from their list of opened connections when they see the multicast connection close

2798466
deb	dmg
it is good to integrate with platform specific deployment systems like rpm or deb on linux dmg on os x or msi under windows

2798469
implements	extends
the problem is that the base functionality is extremely complex to implements 1 000s of lines in 5 layers of base classes and therefore i do not wish for component writers to implements the interfaces themselves but rather to extends my base classes where all the boiler plate code is already written

2798512
rss	feed
you ll have to use one of the other methods or -- if you can -- get the rss feed producer to output utf-8

2798560
public	protected
an inner class doesn t respect the rules of public protected or private

2798584
cvs	svn
clients for cvs svn git and others are almost universally available for windows

2798600
width	height
in fancybox s case it ignores width and height for image elements which makes it useless

2798610
post	get
i am successfully logging in i have checked the response from my post request but then when i try to perform a get request on the my shows page i am re-directed to the login page

2798617
inline	inlining
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inline and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

2798648
stateless	stateful
i have singleton userfactory stateless could be its method createsession generating stateful usersession bean by manual lookup

2798696
subtraction	addition
one does an addition on a subtraction and the last one will instantiate the two and simply print the resulted addition and subtraction

2798700
put	get
there is definitely content in the message collection as if i remove editorfor and put in response.write on the content property of the message class i get the content field for 3 message objects on the page which is exactly as expected

2798748
firefox	safari
i see several apps in the ipad app store which utilize tabs one such example is the atomic web browser which provides a tabbed browsing experience like safari on the mac or firefox

2798803
folder	directory
whatever happens i m going ot have to store the directory reference in a file in the settings folder

2798846
children	parent
instead of putting the buttons into a toolbar you might just make them children views of a parent uiview

2798859
mouse	keyboard
the ui threads job is to take input from the users hands through a keyboard or mouse act upon it and produce output in the form of pixels in response

2798892
int	double
also long is slightly better than double for int with 63 bits compared to 53 bits of precision assuming positive numbers

2798895
multiplying	add
obviously i could multiplying the page number by the number of results per page and add the result number but i imagine there is a better way within the query

2798916
stateless	stateful
you must not inject a stateful session bean into a stateless object such as stateless

2798931
google-chrome	safari
the html5 player loads fine in safari and google-chrome but it doesn t allow me to seek and safari even says it s a live broadcast

2798949
firefox	safari
however this works in safari firefox ie8 but not ie7

2798964
children	parent
moreover there are cases where you can check the pointer value in a parent function and avoid the checking in its children

2798995
valgrind	callgrind
i am using valgrind callgrind to profile a program on gtk

2798998
pycrypto	crypto++
i m trying to encrypt http requests using crypto++ and decrypt them with pycrypto on the app engine server end

2798998
pycrypto	crypto++
crypto++ pycrypto with google app engine

2798998
pycrypto	crypto++
i have discovered that the ciphertext resulting from encrypting in c with crypto++ is not the same as the ciphertext from encrypting in python with pycrypto

2799003
mktime	strtotime
first convert it to a timestamp strtotime mktime whatever

2799106
google-chrome	firefox
oh and it works fine in firefox and google-chrome too

2799132
pypdf	reportlab
i used pdf2ps then ps2pdf on the above to strip lzw so that the reportlab and pypdf libraries would recognize it

2799135
post	get
i don t want to post all my code to stack overflow because they implicitly get licensed under creative commons if i do that

2799142
rtos	ecos	freertos	ecos
many other rtos designed for micro controllers similarly do not support an mmu such as ecos and freertos

2799142
rtos	qnx
of rtos s that do support an mmu qnx is probably amongst the most robust and mature while still maintaining high performance

2799146
ubuntu	linux
luaeclipse 1.3 beta definitely does work with eclipse 3.5 on linux at least on my ubuntu box

2799146
kate	scite	kate	gedit
note also that if you do not want an ide but merely an editor you may use kate gedit scite and many other programmer s editors available for linux

2799146
vim	emacs
not to mention vim and emacs

2799147
qmainwindow	qapplication
in runner run which is now running in it s own thread construct a qapplication and an instantiation of your qmainwindow derivative

2799183
titlebar	window
if you set the background color of a textured window a distinction that isn t really all that visible in snow leopard that color will be applied to the titlebar as well

2799183
titlebar	window
i would recommend though not having a real titlebar setting your window to have no titlebar and using and putting your own buttons in the titlebar

2799190
sequence	permutation
the idea behind my algorithm is that any permutation can be expressed as a unique sequence of swap commands

2799220
preferenceactivity	listpreference
now i want to use them in a listpreference for a preferenceactivity defined by an xml file

2799233
jboss	glassfish
there are many frameworks which i ve heard spring hibernate persistence ejb jsp servlet jsf jboss glassfish ant etc etc etc etc

2799325
ant	maven
ant maven

2799346
qapplication	qobject	qthread	qobject	qthread	qapplication
maybe you can try to store pointer to the main thread qthread object and call qobject movetothread to move your gui objects to the main thread instead of moving qapplication into another thread

2799425
r-tree	quadtree
the best practice for the geolocation domain is to use a geohash quadtree r-tree or similar data structure r-tree are the most generic but it sounds like you re querying point data so that may not matter

2799427
union	distinct
the set-like operators union distinct except etc. work using gethashcode by default afaik so it seems reasonable to assume they re using a hash-table internally making these operations o n as well in general

2799435
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
and several engines force me to work with the event style ie input comes from keyboard mouse and joystick interruptions and a timer interrupts and calls update step i dislike it but i had to learn.

2799470
rss	feed
it seems that you have two problems aggregating multiple rss feed and then displaying them in a list

2799483
opera	firefox
most have some sort of developer tool too firebug in firefox dragonfly in opera etc

2799489
cos	sin
the result is that we could just ask to weapon to be at position cos angle radius sin angle radius

2799507
google-chrome	firefox
but debugging tools like the built in one in google-chrome or firebug for firefox are good tools for debugging your javascript code and shows lists of the errors occurring

2799520
squash	branch
make small commits in a private branch then squash them in a git rebase -i

2799522
hash	md5
perform a cryptographic hash on that sha md5 etc and covert the hash to a hexadecimal representation eg ce7f181a44a4a5b7e43fe2b9a0b1f0c1

2799524
hash	md5
however in similar cases i have encountered i usually pick a larger password size which also happens to be the size of the hex representation of a popular hash function md5

2799535
google-chrome	firefox
how can i do this with firefox or google-chrome

2799543
union	distinct
distinct groupby join and i believe also the set-aggregation methods union intersect and except use hashing so they should be close to o n instead of o nâ²

2799546
ilist	icollection
i know that for some collections like collections that implement icollection or ilist there are special codepaths that are used however the actual implementation is not guaranteed to do anything special

2799629
fgets	fgetc
then you can either skip a whole line with fgets but it is unsafe because you will need to estimate the length of the line a priori otherwise use fgetc

2799727
post	get
if you want to just do basic http you can use the webclient class to get and post data

ironruby	ironpython
5 .net supports ironpython and ironruby and maybe still supports jsharp

to create an array of a non-constant size known at compile time you need to dynamically allocate space for it using malloc and correspondingly deallocate it using free when it is no longer required

2800594
alloca	malloc
if you need a run-time sized array you have to either allocate it manually with malloc or use some non-standard compiler-specific approach like alloca function

2800598
alloca	malloc
however with earlier versions of c you are stuck calling functions to dynamically allocate memory alloca 3 or malloc 3

2800651
x86	64bit
yes it is safe as long as they aren t platform-sized integers 32-bit for x86 platform and 64bit for x64-platforms in which case you d use an intptr

2801634
width	height
if you need to set the w h to the same in images with ratio different than 1 1 you ll need to use some javascript to retrieve the height or the width and give the same value to the other argument using js

2803098
jsf	stripes	freemarker	velocity
if you don t go for jsf then facelets has not much benefit for you and you could just continue with legacy jsp probably with a 3rd party templating framework on top like freemarker or velocity and or a 3rd party mvc framework like spring mvc struts2 or stripes

2803180
versioning	upgrade
the challenge is how to create the upgrade script from one versioning to the other

2803180

2803514
tinyioc	castle
depending on the container your factory may have to know the name of the parameter tinyioc and castle afaik or it may had to be last in the list of constructor dependencies ymmv depending on containers which isn t great but it saves creating a lot of child containers in quick succession and the gc thrashing that will follow and you still get di for all your other dependencies

you dont really need to hide them...what you should do is have an extra key such as a secret that one is hidden and is only present in the signature of the call which can be an md5 hash or sha or whatever without that secret key people wont be able to just make calls since the signatures created by the server and the offender wont match since they dont know the secret key used.

for instance you could use plm to do fixed effects or you could create a matrix with the appropriate dummy variables and then run that through glm

2804009
int	chars
in practice endian-ness is important in c if you perhaps via something you call reinterpret a chars as an int or vice-versa or define a protocol in which an int is represented using a sequence of chars

2804009
int	chars
if you re only dealing with arrays of chars or only dealing with arrays of int it s irrelevant because endianness is a property of int and other types bigger than chars

jquery also for a pop-up has in the ui library a dialog widget

2804198
folder	directory
the problem is the implementation used to get this name is flawed it a assumes the home directory contains the string wwwroot and b assumes the folder name is the same as the application name

2804200
gridview	sqldatasource
it uses gridview bound to sqldatasource that query filtered views

2804212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing the expected behaviour in firefox but not in safari or google-chrome

2804212
google-chrome	safari
should i expect google-chrome safari to parse the files in the specified order

2804212
google-chrome	safari
note that safari seems to give varied results in the same manner as google-chrome which makes sense

2804212
google-chrome	safari
you may have to refresh a couple of times to see google-chrome and safari fail on everything

2804254
x86	64bit
you have a mismatch in your solution where you are mixing x86 with x64 the incorrect format message refers to trying to load a 64bit dll from a 32 bit executable or vice versa

2804297
google-chrome	firefox
it should work in firefox and google-chrome

2804311
django	web2py
anything django does web2py does better

2804311
django	web2py
this is because web2py was made long after django and has learned from django s mistakes though it makes all new mistakes

2804311
django	web2py
i have found that the django documentation is applicable to web2py for the most part

2804311
django	web2py
in web2py you just do form.element no such thing in django

2804311
django	web2py
biggest drawback of web2py is its age and smaller code base...this is not unreasonable though considering django is like the first python web framework to implement rails style rad ideas and is like twice the age of web2py

2804339
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if the clientaccesspolicy.xml is either not found the web request returns a 404 status code returned with an unexpected mime-type is not valid xml or has an invalid root node then the silverlight runtime will issue a request for a for the flash policy file with a name of crossdomain.xml at the root of the requested target domain using the http protocol

2804498
accessor	properties
more advisable would be to make it a properties with a public get accessor keeping the set private

2804554
gendarme	fxcop
i routinely run gendarme and fxcop on my code and neither of those tools identify what i ve described

2804586
int	chars
indexof returns the int position of the chars you searched for

2804602

there are two types of timers in javascript settimeout and setinterval

2804798
getter	setter
that implicitly declares the getter and setter for the condition property

2804818
x86	64bit
ideally i would host a wcf service to house this dll but in a 64bit os one cannot force the service to run as x86

2804830
gridview	detailsview
i am creating a gridview detailsview page

2804870

second one problem with lonut s code is some versions of opera will call loadcallback twice once from the onload handler and a second time from the onreadystatechange handler

2804911
folder	directory
i have a folder called uploads in the same directory

2804932
maven	pom.xml
the guava-parent artifact is in the main source repo for guava under maven pom.xml

2804934
min	max
i have a input field with validation to validate the max and min length

2804942
folder	dir
i ve tried copying the entire program dir to a different folder - now both the program and ms-access read the wrong values

2804984
put	get
i d put the message into a database table along with some information about who should get it and then a cron job would actually do the sending

2804994
hide	show
one way you can do that is to add an onclickclick function to each tab head that sets the visibility style of the buttons you re trying to show hide

2805045
wcf	openrasta
is it possible to use protobuf-net in restful webservices created using wcf restful starter kit or openrasta

2805188
folder	directory
in one of this virtual directory i need to have the browse folder disable and in the other one i need to have it enable

2805188
folder	directory
i thinks this problem is related that both virtual directory points to the same folder in the os but with the iis6 i had this same configuration with out a problem

2805213
tinymce	freetextbox
there are lots of choices when it comes to wysiwyg ckeditor freetextbox tinymce but i don t hear a lot about so-like techniques

google-chrome	firefox
which looks like this in google-chrome firefox

2805326
uitableview	reloaddata
when i call reloaddata to change update the data in the uitableview the header gets reloaded too

2805393
google-chrome	safari
the problem seems to only occur on safari and google-chrome but if i refresh the page i get it to work correctly - weird

2805393
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the thumbnail holder will not display

2805393
src	attr
#captiontab attr src globalpath + images captiontabhot.jpg

2805393

2805393
src	attr
#thumbtab attr src globalpath + images thumbtab.jpg

2805410
subtract	add
in the site code you would need to keep track of what number you were currently on and then subtract one and requery to get the previous or add one and requery to get next

2805436
pascal	qbasic
c c++ 3.0 pascal 7.0 qbasic powerbasic and com debug programs were based on this architecture and could do any better than what assembler allowed

2805470
vxworks	rtos
while i think you are being far to specific in requesting patterns for rtos vxworks patterns i have used specifically with vxworks are the facade and adapter patterns

2805478
slideup	slidedown
have a function called after the slideup use a timer to wait 100ms then call the slidedown

2805500
pthreads	epoll
i m programming an application client server in c++ for linux using epoll y pthreads but i don t know how to handle the connect calls for attach a new connection in the descriptor list if a loop with epoll_wait is running edge-triggered how to can i do it

2805550
for-loop	arrays
you need to create an object arrays of the same size as parameterinfo and build it in the for-loop

2805595
voip	sip
as my project to do over this summer i would like to create a program that answers a skype call using the skype api and allows a user to connect to another voip provider through sip and make calls by dialling through the client callers skype application

2805604
pull	push
advantage of allowing you to pull or push instead of just updating from one central source

2805677
serializable	deserialization
i have a little problem implementing some serializable deserialization logic

2805677
serializable	deserialization
my current solution is that each handler gets the serializable string and is itself responsible for deserialization

2805698
int	chars
when i get a string of chars instead of an int the program loops indefinitely

2805715
udp	tcp
but a service has unrestricted access to use tcp and udp sockets

2805761
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
without using flash you are bound to a new html5 technique which is supported in firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ google-chrome 3+ and opera 10+

2805768
udp	tcp
i build a tcp and a udp listener on that port

2805768
udp	tcp
so if tcp is congestion controlling other ends may not send more data in this tcp quiet period udp channel should have not that much of traffic right

2805768
udp	tcp
i want to figure out the tcp traffic will affect udp traffic or not

2805793
getter	setter
one potential danger i see with using the entities to drive the xml could couple xml consumers to the database layout if you have getter and setter for all database columns

2805803
getter	setter
but one thing is it is not changing getter setter names which have been generated based on previous name

2805816
cos	sin
ideally your set is computed symbolically and left in terms of sin theta cos theta for non rational points which should be fine since you seem to be using mathematica

2805821
udp	tcp
yes tcp and udp traffic can affect each other since they are both ip traffic

2805821
udp	tcp
tcp may tend to reduce its transmission rate at the sender due to congestion control if packets are being dropped while udp will tend to just drop packets

2805835
getter	setter
yes in galileo the rename dialog has an option for changing the setter and getter of a field - see here

2805856
post	get
i was able to get the text from my server but not the images and i have not figured out how to post things to my server.am i in the right track here or should i start using xml

2805953
getter	setter
there is no real necessity for getter and setter to have the same name as the internal field

2805953
getter	setter
part of the point of having getter and setter is to protect the rest of the code from changes that are internal to the class like renaming

2805981
portrait	landscape
when the app is launched in portrait and rotated to landscape the app does as expected

2805981
portrait	landscape
why does this only happen for landscape left or right and not for portrait or portrait upside down

2806005
interbase	firebird
i have never accessed firebird but from what i can gather it is just like interbase

2806012
outputstream	inputstream
has an inputstream and an outputstream that a host application can obtain

2806030
emacs	textmate
of course i heard there s also emacs on os x if that s your sex-appeal or textmate

2806056
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
as i said this is what the default of implementation of uitableviewcontroller s viewwillappear does so if you are using uitableviewcontroller and not seeing this behaviour you should check that you are calling the super implementation in your class own viewdidappear

2806056
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
as ben rightly points out in the comments uitableviewcontroller actually does this in viewwillappear not viewdidappear - this is the correct timing

2806069
hide	show
i want my panel to fit the frame when i show hide fields

2806110
rss	feed
i am trying to add a rss feed of gas prices based on location to my application

2806110

i googled for rss feed for gas prices and bumped onto motortrend s gas price feed

2806113
superclass	subclassing
i have an abstract superclass and two subclassing

2806116
width	height
try setting the height and width of the element you re targeting with swfobject in css

2806118
puts	gets
if i only gets my data from the webservice once puts this in several objects.

2806177
superclass	subclassing
if it makes sense for anything to call performtransform is should be in the superclass as a virtual method and overridden in the subclassing

2806177
superclass	subclassing
so the superclass defines the flow from an abstract viewpoint and the subclassing implement them appropriately

2806177
superclass	subclassing
in your case the simplest options are to either just leave performtransform empty in the superclass or implement it as an empty method in the subclassing that doesn t require it when you mix this approach with a short comment you get a more maintainable system imo

2806180
viewdidload	viewwillappear
there s nothing in my eventstableviewcontroller about reloading the table as far as i can see--i haven t implemented viewwillappear or viewdidload or any of those

2806184
g++	gcc
use gcc and g++ while you re still learning these languages a big enough task for now

2806241
nextuntil	slidetoggle
tr.header nextuntil .header slidetoggle fast function

2806261
ant	maven
use ant which has an exec task or maven which has an exec plugin

2806274
qiodevice	qnetworkaccessmanager
i think that qnetworkaccessmanager is trying to read from the qiodevice until it gets a -1 from read at which point it assumes there is no more data and closes the request

2806274
qiodevice	qnetworkaccessmanager
this seems to be incompatible with the way that the post method of qnetworkaccessmanager expects a qiodevice to behave

2806274
qfile	qnetworkaccessmanager
is there some other way i should be using either qfile or qnetworkaccessmanager to push a file via post

2806274
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
the finished qnetworkreply signal from qnetworkaccessmanager triggers my postfinished qnetworkreply method

2806290
int	boolean
generally the main thread signals the worker thread to exit using an event object or a simply an int or boolean value

2806301
minimum	max
configuring a connection pool on the application and setting your site to consume it makes easy to the fine tune the connection pool parameters like minimum connections to keep open max idle time and so on

2806313
google-chrome	firefox
we only get the error message in google-chrome and firefox

2806365
put	get
i know each instance has a good amount of storage space and you don t have to pay for put get only the inbound transfer

2806403
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
in java 8 there is a new date and time api in the package java.time which is much more powerful and useful than the old java.util.date and java.util.calendar classes

2806446
objectdatasource	detailsview
the standard way to do it would be to have the selected item of the griview be a control parameter to the objectdatasource you have wired up to the detailsview

2806462
hide	show
i need show hide some fields of my

2806506
vbscript	autoit
vbscript isn t very good at dealing with gui functions at least it is not even remotely close to something like autoit

2806537
int	chars
that is i want a string type such that at s i will find a unsigned 32-bit int or a single byte would be enough actually containing the length of the string in bytes or in chars which is half the number of bytes followed by the unicode representation of the string

2806546
ubuntu	linux
is there anytool lik dtruss which can run on linux ubuntu

2806552
qprogressbar	qthread
i d guess i need a qthread object but i ve been looking through the qprogressbar documentation but it doesn t bring up the topic of threading

2806568
updatepanel	scriptmanager
note make sure to use scriptmanager not clientscript also for the second parameter use gettype on the updatepanel

2806579
hide	show
my question is how can i show hide them individually

2806591
qprogressbar	qthread
you can create a sub-class of qthread that emits a signal progresschanged which you connect to the qprogressbar

2806619
children	parent
setting a container to be positioned relatively makes absolutely positioned children elements position themselves relative to the parent

2806622
groupbox	panel
i have a panel that contains a groupbox some checkboxes and textboxes

2806626
textblock	itemscontrol
therefore your control is approximately an itemscontrol in terms of visual xaml it s an itemscontrol with a wrappanel style layout and very simple textblock for the item template

2806698
next	except
for the next step we ll use the getreferencetorawdata to get a pointer to the tpoint record hidden in the v tvalue you know the one we pretend we know nothing about - except the fact it s a record

2806728
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the framework doesn t expose it as an event but i ve seen other applications like google-chrome and firefox which allow you to bring up a right-click context menu for a menu item

2806734
implements	extends
this can be achieved easily by using a simple table model class which extends the defaulttablemodel and a cell renderer and editor class which implements the tablecellrenderer and tablecelleditor interfaces respectively

2806794
des	aes
mcrypt does support several algorithms like aes tripel des

2806801
unsigned	short
i can use unsigned short to store it

2806801
unsigned	short
if i decided to not use short but just 10 bits packed into an array of unsigned int

2806806
dictionary	map
i have tried a memory map representation arrays dictionary and strings to represent that structure in memory but these always crash because of the memory limit

2806856
pull	push
i have a .net 3.5 compact framework project that uses rda for moving data between its mobile device s local sqlce database and a remote mssql-2008 server it uses rda push and pull

2806885
ienumerable	ilist
but frankly your o structure sucks you should build the list of items as an ienumerable or ilist or something not

2806890
unsigned	short
i can use unsigned short to store it

2806890
unsigned	short
yes you can use unsigned short assuming sizeof unsigned short char_bits 10

2806890
unsigned	short
if sizeof unsigned int sizeof unsigned short then probably not

2806890
unsigned	short
if i decided to not use short but just 10 bits packed into an array of unsigned int

2806901
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t support transactions but innodb does

2806948
i2c	spi
a big thing to look for is glue logic does the part or family have the spi or i2c or whatever bus you want to use do you need an internal pull up or wired or input

2807114
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2807140
nsmutablestring	nsstring
not all api s retain as the original nsstring may change in some way - one api may receive an nsstring reference but it s actually an nsmutablestring for exapmle

2807190
put	get
my initial thought was to create a windows service to pull the data...but then i couldnt decide how i was going to put a virtual card together and get it to print

2807239
width	height
asp dropdownlist id ddlownerrolesupdate runat server datasource # customizedroles height 25px width 177px selectedvalue # bind owner

2807253
listview	gridview
i tried it to implement it in gridview and listview but both of them didnt work

2807301
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
i have a uinavigationcontroller as as subview of uiwindow a rootviewcontroller class and a custom myviewcontroller class

2807310
virtualenv	setuptools
development and deployment of python code is made much easier by setuptools in combination with virtualenv and pip

2807310
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
which will pull packages out of svn git hg or bazaar

2807312
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
my answer is actually embedded in my question i posted here uinavigationcontroller crash because of pushing and poping uiviewcontroller

2807340
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller crash because of pushing and poping uiviewcontroller

2807374
subobject	downcast
in this case if you try to downcast the this pointer of type for example to the type the compiler has no idea how to adjust the address because it doesn t know to which of the 2 subobject present in your newdriver object that pointer is supposed to point to

2807397
children	parent
note i don t want the children to only appear on their parent page they must be present all the time

2807474
rss	feed
for a bit of a roundabout solution a service like github offers an rss feed of commits and then you can use an rss to email service like feed my inbox

2807523
width	height
yes it s possible to dynamically resize it if width height is part of your application params that generates the embed code

2807550
submit	submission
rather than submission a change when dropdown a is changed then refreshing dropdown b s choices what you can do is submit a s value at the time when dropdown b is opened and process it in the server logic that determine s b s choices

2807601
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
also much of the functionality of qgraphicsitem like editing as you indicated depends on event handling in qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview to work

2807637
jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	geronimo
open source implementations of the ejb spec would be glassfish from sun geronimo from apache jboss from jboss.org the open source version not the red hat one or openejb running under tomcat

2807637
websphere	ibm
if you have cash to burn on licenses try weblogic from oracle bea or websphere from ibm

2807638
glassfish	geronimo
other free app servers include glassfish and geronimo

2807674
put	get
we had some content restructure recently and i d like to put in some redirect rules into web.config so bookmarks to the old pages can get routed to their new locations pages

2807695
preorder	inorder
also why would anyone want to do a preorder traversal of a btree since an inorder traversal is what will display the values in ascending order

2807717
haskell	ocaml
the program works fine and fast in haskell even when using foldl and not foldl but stack overflows in ocaml and f#

2807717
haskell	ocaml
your haskell is using lazy lists but your ocaml f# is using strict lists so your programs are incomparable

2807736
hide	show
in our case we set to disable by default so that any time we open static block it does not clean the code only if we choose by clicking show hide editor

2807740
autocomplete	multi-select
for how i m sending the band-ids with autocomplete see this related question django modelform validate custom autocomplete for m2m instead of ugly multi-select

2807745
int	double
i would advise you to stay away from double if the input might be bigger than 2 53 after which not all int can be exactly represented as double

2807752
stdout	stderr
naturally you could write a variation of this function to combine stdout and stderr and to discard the result code

2807798
unsigned	short
what i know about unsigned numerics unsigned short int and longs that it contains positive numbers only but the following simple program successfully assigned a negative number to an unsigned int

2807809
integer	unsigned
you need to use u to print an unsigned integer

2807815
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari

2807815
google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome and safari if you just do like above the forever iframe wonâ t work at all

2807817
integer	unsigned
because unsigned int value that is stored in sum is treated like signed decimal integer in printf i

2807848
kde	gnome
i know that for gnome and i believe kde hitting it pulls up the shutdown dialog and thus is captured by the window manager and not passed on

2807857
mouse	keyboard
you see all kinds of user input be it via keyboard or mouse or whatever io device is passed to your application through windows in the form of messages

2807870
int	double
the complexity of this code is one sqrt one double multiplication one cast dbl- int and one comparison

2807889
min	max
eliminate nulls by using min and max values

2807891
jsfl	fla
you can use jsfl to script the flash ide and tell it to compile an fla to a swf

2807910
superclass	subclassing
classb needs nodeb types but i can t cast from the subclassing to the superclass

2808015
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on my site 1 everything looks great in firefox google-chrome safari all the same - but ie7 it s all out of whack

2808045
mp3	wav
according to this guy you have to import the music loop as a wav and have the flash ide itself compress to mp3

2808165
shadowing	named
as greg mentions in your example you re creating a new local variable called named that is shadowing your parameter

2808202
public	protected
public void btn_click event or dropdown_selectedindexchanged event the cursor points to protected void page_load only

2808217
versioning	upgrade
extending this logic we can auto-increment the ignored fourth versioning field with every build but prevent upgrade when the first three are the same

2808244
bellman-ford	dijkstra
is there a variation of dijkstra bellman-ford or anything else that will calculate the paths shown in the third diagram above

2808275
maven	pom.xml
yes maven uses a pom.xml file to describe a project s medata and extend maven s behavior which also known as the project object model pom.xml file

2808275
ant	maven
why doesn t maven use scripts for this kind of job i don t see xml has any advantage here which is why i don t like ant

2808275
maven	buildr
now nothing forces you to use maven if you don t like it and feel free to use gradle or gant or buildr if the size of their communities is not a concern

2808275
maven	pom.xml
just in case note that maven 3 offers polyglot support see this post and this one but as i said writing a pom.xml in groovy yaml etc doesn t only have advantages validation

2808279
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

2808284
int	boolean
for instance an interface could define a function called foo which takes an int and returns a boolean

2808303
maven	pom.xml
maven uses xml for pom.xml files because xml is a good choice for describing things .

2808303
maven	pom.xml
it would make no sense to express maven pom.xml files in some kind of scripting language because they are not scripts in any recognizable sense

2808353
gdal	ogr
i ll only add that i use gdal ogr when simplicity and speed is wanted in conversions

2808353
gdal	ogr
when all you want to do is jam a bunch of shapefiles together or convert a large series of rasters to a common projection gdal ogr is faster to startup and run as it doesn t need to load the whole arcobjects com library to access one or two functions

2808359
hide	show
i m working on a website where i need to show hide table rows

2808359
hide	show
this happened when i did put a code to show hide the extra features

2808437
boost	eigen	eigen	ublas
i looked at boost numeric ublas coordinate_vector and eigen sparsevector

2808453
postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
postgresql and informix have serials mysql auto_increment and oracle offers sequence generators

2808498
qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager
you re creating compressedfile on the stack and passing a pointer to it to your qnetworkrequest and ultimately your qnetworkaccessmanager

2808522
udp	tcp
this will increase the connection overhead by 2 packets and a few bits per packet however you will still gain from udp s speed for the rest of the session when compared to tcp

2808522
udp	tcp	arp	udp	arp	tcp
however using tcp or udp as a transport layer still leaves you open to other attacks such as sniffing and man in the middle attacks using arp spoofing or dns cache poising

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
how do i use a for-loop or foreach loops to make it that whenever a user clicks on an ad it makes an arrays in the cookie

2813662
int	chars
whereas chars just means chars a or b could mean chars or bool or int or some other type

2813692
int	chars
let s say we have 2 functions which takes a chars and returns it s int representation and that adds 32 to it s argument

they populate themselves via a get to the url and store update via post to the url

2813816
post	get
i saw another post with this error but i couldn t figure out how to get it right

2813827
versioning	upgrade
yes you could use a different name or you could use the same name and do an upgrade delete and replace on the first time the user uses a new versioning

2813827
versioning	upgrade
having some code that checks versioning at app start lets you put any data upgrade stuff in one place

2813827
versioning	upgrade
if the most-recent versioning is lower than the running app versioning run your upgrade and bump the versioning

2813888
hash	salt
make sure to salt your hash

2813961
hash	md5
truth is sha-512 or md5 or some very weak hash once rainbow tables are precomputed doesn t make any difference

2813961
hash	salt
note that even if you understand fully how hash salt and rainbow tables relate and hence understand why the wikipedia article states a salt is often employed with hash passwords to make this attack more difficult often infeasible. there s a very high probability that your co-workers don t

2814051
client-side	server-side
another thing i like to do is to use the same php validation functions for both server-side and client-side validation as in sending an ajax request to a script containing the same php function to keep the amount of cross-language code duplication to a minimum

2814114
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
ilist ienumerable or iqueryable collections

2814114
ienumerable	ilist
- all the way from repositories to business model or not at all and expose only solid ilist and ienumerable from repositories and deal with more specific queries inside business model but have more finer grained methods for data retrieval within repositories

you can just present a modal view controller when you first launch using the flip transition instead of the default slide

2814243
hash	md5
if hashing is enabled x xy will be appended to the path where xy are the first two letters of the md5 hash of the filename

int	chars
this is the signature for the isdigit function it indicates that it will accept an int value or something that can be cast to int like a chars and will return an int

2814259
int	chars
actually it s int i don t know whether this is for compatibilty reasons or whatnot but the most common usage is for chars

2814283
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mousedown	mousedown	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseenter	mouseup	mousedown
if you can leverage the same backend services perhaps when a drag begins mousedown + mousemove you could send a chunk of xaml up to a service to store cache the content and when a drag ends on the other application mouseenter + mouseup over the drop target you could call that service to pull down the cached content

2814299
feof	fread
restructure your loop to use the return value of fread and check against feof only if fread fails

2814371
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
some browsers have their own implmentation like -moz-border-radius for firefox and -webkit-border-radius for safari and google-chrome

i have dependancies installed local on my machine .m2 repository blah blah blah and m2e is not recognizing them as there - i think m2e is using its own maven instance

2814555
maven	m2e
is there any way to force m2e to use the local maven installation in osx

2814568
int	boolean
this basically just says that any method anywhere that returns a boolean and takes a single parameter of type int is an instance of this delegate

2814568
int	boolean
govisitmyfriends doesn t care which method you give it as long as the method is shaped just like the definition of notifyfriendsdelegate it has to return boolean and accept one parameter of type int

2814713
getter	setter
or can anyone think of another way to genericize getter setter creation

2814718
jscrollpane	jviewport
to do this the first contained component the one that is the child to jviewport passed into the jscrollpane constructor or set as the viewportview needs to implement javax.swing.scrollable

2814779
vtk	itk
my suspicion is that there is some failed dynamic linking of a dependency which are qt vtk and itk all built with mingw

2814818
ocl	uml
for that you can easily use the javadoc description for the return value or if you want to be more precise you can use the ocl language part of uml stack to describe the postcondition

2814843
directx	gdi
the problem of doing a capture from an external application is that the 3d application loses it s vsync and creates a shaggy difficult to use 3d application 3d app is only presented on a small part of the screen the rest being gdi directx

2814843
directx	gdi
depending on the technology used opengl directx gdi it hooks the vsync and does its capture with glreadpixels ... without perturbing it

2814898
post	get
some of the web service calls need to be get rather than post but passing parameters

2814898
post	get
i m looking at the urllib2 docs and it looks like it decides by itself wether to use post or get based on if you pass params or not but maybe someone knows how to make it transform the params dictionary into a get request

2814911
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu the package is empty-expect

2814912
post	get
sometimes it may help switching off allowautoredirect and setting both login post and page get requests the same user agent

2814919
setinterval	settimeout
does the browser keep track of active setinterval and settimeout ids

2814935
crossover	mutation
talking from my limited experience if you decide to simplify the problem and use a fixed way to implement crossover selection and just play with population size and mutation rate implemented in a given way trying to come up with general results you ll soon realize that too many variables are still into play because at the end of the day the number of generations after which statistically you will get a decent result whatever way you wanna define decent still obviously depend primarily on the problem you re solving and consequently on the genome size representing the same problem in different ways will obviously lead to different results in terms of effect of given ga parameters

2814958
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout using sys.stdout.flush every time you want to write the updates

2814968
postgresql	mysql
i recently switched my database from mysql to postgresql

2814983
hide	show
the showbars is not used to show or hide the status bar but rather to show and hide the navigation bar items

2814986
profiling	benchmarking
an example of benchmarking the performance of live you can try is by profiling a fragment of code that uses live to bind a click handler to an element and also profiling another fragment of code that uses click to bind to that same element

2815012
min	max
i want to select distinct col1 with max col3 and min col2

my architecture basically comes down to this - a short 15-20 second wav mp3 other clip as the input output is plaintext

2815130
entity-relationship	diagram
never shall an entity-relationship diagram get anywhere near the preciseness accuracy and completeness of a database design formally written out in d

2815145
free	malloc
classic malloc free is pretty fast and can be made safe if you have sufficient constraints on object creation and lifetime which you may be able to enforce in your language

2815156
width	height
what makes this work even better is the height and width binding on the panel- what this says is make this panel the same size as my parent window. that means that when i resize the window the wrappanel adjusts its size accordingly resulting in a better layout for the items

2815170
udp	tcp
with somewhat insecure if the data payloads were not sensitive you could use an integrity only cipher with tcp tls udp dtls to reduce processing overhead and latency at the client and server

2815221
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i realize the users will have to uninstall the current versioning to get the upgrade but it s not clear how to get the updated versioning into the market so that the current users will find it

2815229
disk	ram
for example ya never know when malloc 10 may cause the vm to page something out now your 10 bytes of ram have an unknown disk i o component -- oops

the goal of pcap is to transparently receive a copy of every packets in the system

2815420
int	double
start at index 1 and you ll double it logarithmically many times until you get something large enough then logarithmically many more steps to find your int or rule it out

2815434
put	get
i was able to get a script that allows me to put each individual on one row

2815439
hide	show
the only way i can think to do it is to store a flag in the element s data when you call show or hide but i was wondering if there was another way

2815441
width	height
in other words no buttons just a clean div that s the same height and width no scrolling if there s only one image

2815453
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the menu works perfectly in firefox google-chrome opera and epiphany

2815458
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the above with office 11 2003 and office 12 2007 and it seems to work well in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

2815487
opera	firefox
here is what it looks like in opera and firefox in linux

2815501
getter	setter
that looks like fine setter getter to me

2815501
getter	setter
however if you pass both values into the constructor are you sure both the setter getter are needed

2815505
getter	setter
unfortunately java doesn t have a more compact way of defining getter and setter like a lot of other languages do

2815505
getter	setter
a thought-provoking if a bit extreme article on this is available here why getter and setter methods are evil

2815506
getter	setter
you could also use groovy which automatically generates the getter setter

2815507
getter	setter
getter and setter are better than public fields - but do you really need them in the first place

2815507
getter	setter
just to correct your current design assuming you do want getter and setter i would change it to

2815517
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the ads load fine every time when visiting the site via google-chrome ie or safari but sometimes don t load at all in firefox - hence it is a client side issue which leads me to believe its something up with the javascript

2815521
getter	setter
since that s the whole point of using getter setter

2815521
getter	setter
it s more important that you understand why you re using getter setter

2815526
min	max
you might one day want to enforce a min and max on codigo or make sure it is in fixed set of values you could do that in the setcodigo method without any client code knowing about it

2815531
stateless	stateful
for developing web applications flex has the convenience of being stateful whereas html is stateless

2815555
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

2815583
children	parent
parent class has no awareness of its children

2815597
distance	polygons
if you base the voronoi polygons on your key trees and cluster the neighbouring trees into those polygons that would partition your search space by proximity finding the enclosing polygons for a given non-key point is fast but ultimately you re going to get down to computing key to non-key distance by pythagoras or trig and comparing them

2815601
getter	setter
also setter is not always needed although getter is almost needed always

2815629
trie	tree
for me the only one reason to use visitor pattern is when i need to perform double dispatch on graph-like data structure like tree trie

2815635
debian	linux
i ve installed the development version of crunchbang a linux distro based off debian

2815643
int	double
also note that when measuring the size of an array it is less error-prone to divide by the size of the first element so that if the type of abc changes from int to double the results are still valid

2815723
getter	setter
like jon said you need to have a strong reason to need getter setter

2815742
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
hope is on the way however - html5 includes an improvement to this situation called cross-document messaging that is supported in firefox 3 safari 4 google-chrome 2 opera 9.2 and even ie.

2815757
width	height
ok so to add a static toolbar like object that has a width which is 100 of the page and a height of say 25px you would do this

2815776
ostringstream	std
you can use the std ostringstream class to convert the number to a string

2815791
hide	show
then jquery will be able to show and hide as desired

2815818
punctuation	words
your ways works well if the words are all separated by strings but that is rarely the case in most usage scenarios as you would normally have to deal with newlines punctuation etc

2815860
hash	salt
i ve read a number of so questions on this topic but grokking the applied practice of storing a salt hash of a password eludes me

2815860
postgresql	mysql
a database postgresql mysql sql server oracle

2815860
hash	salt
store the password hash with random salt in the db one column

2815860
hash	salt
but it is storing the password hash with a random salt in single db column that i need to understand better with practical application

2815860
hash	salt
here s where i get lost if the salt is random and the password plus salt are hash to produced a one-way value for storing how can the system ever match a plaintext password and a new random salt

2815860
hash	salt
i have theory on this and as i type i might be grokking the concept given a random salt of 128 bytes and a password of 8 bytes foobar12 it could be programmatically possible to remove the part of the hash that was the salt by hashing a random 128 byte salt and getting the substring of the original hash that is the hash password

2815864
projectile	angle
update thinking about it and trying stuff has led me to the conclusion that it has something to do with when the direction being in radians is below 0 and the current projectile angle is above 0

2815873
fadein	fadeout
but i want that if the same is present then it should not fadein fadeout

2815887
uiview	subviews
i added a uitableview as a subviews to a custom uiview class i m working on

2815898
firefox	safari
i manage a website called shareden.com and it looks the right way in mozilla firefox and it s totally completely discombobulated in safari

2815912
firefox	safari
on desktop browsers ie8 firefox safari it works just fine

2815944
ocl	uml
i mean uml and ocl are only semi-formal languages their syntax is well-defined but their semantics is only partially formalized many aspects are just described in natural language in the standard document specifications

2815944
ocl	uml
therefore if you are building a critical system and you need to prove the correctness of the system then uml ocl may fall short but for many other kinds of systems the kind of formality that uml ocl can provide is good enough

2815951
jobs	cron
look for a host with a cpanel which is a useful graphic interface for managing things like dns packages and cron jobs

2815954
distance	pdist
in matlab you can use pdist to get a list of all unique pairwise distance

2815981
google-chrome	firefox
t return data in ie but does in firefox and google-chrome

2815989
put	get
i didn t have to put a backslash in front of the parentheses to get them to group

2816002
hash	salt
the user is authenticated with a salt hash not the unsalted password or the random salt by itself

2816002
hash	salt
the salt hash and the salt but not the actual password are both stored in the database you can store them in a single column if you like but you will have to separate them again before use

2816002
hash	salt
in order to recover the salt hash from the user so that you can compare it to the stored salt hash you need the salt from the database and the password provided by the user

2816002
hash	salt
the salt hash is created like this

2816002
hash	salt
should two users accidentally choose the same password the salt hash will still be different for both user accounts

2816016
firefox	safari
i have also found this only works in ie verified not working in firefox and safari

2816028
children	parent
children always extends their parent

2816042
hash	salt
concatenate the salt with the hash password in some way before storing it

2816053
int	boolean
this method wants to taken in in addition to the jxlistofkeyvaluepairs instance a that defines which data type to convert the values to assume that only boolean int and float are possible

2816058
hash	salt
you could also store salt and hash in the same column using a separator

2816060
stdout	fflush
my guess is that on mac os x the n causes stdout to be fflush while this is not so on windows

2816064
sorting	grouping
you can switch between ksort and krsort to switch the orders but basically you are making an array that is keyed by the number in sorting that array by that number and then traversing each grouping of records that have a specific value

2816065
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout after your call to printf

2816067
hash	salt
it matches it by computing the hash of the password the user entered with the same salt which it reads from the database at the same time as the hash

2816122
division	modulo
the modulo gives you the remainder of an integer division

2816181
super	extends
if you make only a private constructor no class can extends your class because it can t call the super constructor

2816222
hash	salt
the single-column solution is just like the multi-column solution except that it combines the salt and the hash together into a single column

2816222
hash	salt
the checking code still has to know how to break that single value down into the salt and hash

2816222
hash	salt
this has been how salt passwords have typically worked - for example the unix etc shadow format stores an algorithm identifier salt and hash together in a single field

2816252
multiplying	multiplication
actually multiplying a string and an integer is a syntactic error since the multiplication of incompatible types such as a string and an integer is not defined in c

2816311
profiling	benchmarking
just write the most readable code you can and then benchmarking profiling your app - that will be a much better way to get good performance than trying to second guess this sort of thing

2816363
inherited	properties
how do i inherited a properties in c# from an interface and give that properties other name on the class

2816376
inherited	properties
if you inherited a properties you inherited it name type and all

2816376
inherited	properties
if you want you can write another properties with a different name and call the inherited properties from it you still have to implement the original properties

2816700
post	get
many had a query regarding the same and had missed the type in .ajax but even if i mention the type as post the request will be of type get

2816739
cvs	svn
weâ ve migrated from cvs on aix to svn on linux via cvs2svn

2816759
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
on .net framework 2.0 autoresetevent and manualresetevent inherit from eventwaithandle

2816759
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
on the other hand both manualresetevent and autoresetevent do not support naming and provide a single constructor that receives the initialstate

2816835
converter	multibinding
use either multibinding or converter if complex operation is there

2816843
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox ie8 google-chrome and opera i get scrollbars for the content div when i resize the page to a size where both divs can t fit in as a whole

2816871
put	get
i am able to get the number of items but i now need to separate the sections with 0 zero items in them and put them at the bottom of the list of table titles

2816872
hide	show
is there any way to hide the fields to only show the add new custom field part

2816903
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
i have written what i hope is a lightweight alternative to using the manualresetevent and autoresetevent classes in c# .net

2816926
cvs	svn
first you have to be aware of that svn is different from cvs

2816926
cvs	svn
the first things is svn is changeset based whereas cvs is file based

2816936
post	get
this would be simple if all i had to do was get the most recent post based on post created_on value however if a post contains replies i need to factor this into the equation

2816936
post	get
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

2816940
free	malloc
.net javascript are my bread and butter. obviously the need to free memory that you malloc is critical in c

2816940
free	malloc
but as programs grow and structs deepen keeping track of what s been malloc d where and what s appropriate to free gets harder and harder

2816951
getter	setter
i m using the __get and __set magic methods in order to intercept external calls to some private attributes without the need of writing a setter and a getter for each attribute

2816955
accessor	properties
who said a properties should not use only set accessor

2816959
apache	nginx
i have a chat application xmpp muc that is going to be served by apache we might change to nginx later but right now it s not easily done

2816961
getter	setter
my intention is -- since all calculations are in parent class they cannot be done per nested instance because it would make code more complicated -- make the setter only available to parent class and getter public

2816961
min	max
i suspect i ll get answer-question first -- but why you don t split the evaluation per each field -- so i answer this by example how do you calculate min and max value of a collection

2816968
getter	setter
you can use a public setter and a private getter in case you need to access the variable in its own class

2817043
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure how to explain it without a picture so here s a comparison of google-chrome opera firefox

2817043
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
so you can sorta see how in google-chrome the background image is in one non-repeating piece whereas in opera firefox the image has oddly been broken up and placed slightly differently

2817043
opera	firefox
i m confident this is due to an error on my part but i ve had no luck at all figuring out why the image is being mangled in opera and firefox

2817117
width	height
your h1 needs a width and height otherwise display block is a little pointless imho

2817187
google-chrome	firefox
just took a look in google-chrome and firefox and they re both displaying the same as your error pic

2817187
opera	firefox
take a look here html5 browser support checklist seems that firefox and opera don t support all html5 attribute yet so invariably there will be some weird problems

2817687
ant	maven
i m really not a big fan of this approach either use ant or maven but not a bastard mix but you can use an external build.xml with the maven antrun plugin

udp	tcp
if you re going to send files over the lan then udp is the way to go because tcp s overhead is a waste in that case

2817786

2817830
hash	salt
but if i were making a regular ol web app i would just go with salt hash

2818872
folder	directory
note i m not actually sure where the global vendors folder should be when you have a setup where the cake and application directory are split from each other but you definitely have to be in your application directory when running commands and not the myapp directory you re using.

2818876
debian	linux
my windows machine is running windows 7 and my linux machine is running debian

2818933

in the dropbox folder i have a projects folder this is where i would put my eclipse start up directory

2818942
folder	directory
secondly i would move your install directory for eclipse into the dropbox folder

on the servers-side on the other hand i would like to listen both for udp and tcp connections on the same port

2819274
udp	tcp
i have extended this code sample by creating new threads for each tcp udp request

2819274
udp	tcp
this works correctly if i use tcp only but it fails when i attempt to make udp bindings

udp	tcp
afaik you should be able to listen for both tcp connections and udp messages on the same port

2819568
textarea	textbox
so i ve modified it a little to make it even better can update in multiple textbox textarea at once

2819577
free	malloc
store pointers received from malloc in non-const pointer variables so that you can pass them to free

2819583

it works in safari and firefox

2819591

2819633
put	get
get some data and put it in session

2819654
int	chars
if you agree with that calling insert int int chars makes no sense since the two first arguments are supposed to be a buffer sizes

2819799
jobs	cron
i believe vbulletin fakes cron jobs

2819799
jobs	cron
if however no users visit the website none of the cron jobs will execute the method is 100 reliant on page views

2819799
jobs	cron
also to prevent delayed page rendering on users who execute the cron jobs they are executed after the page has been rendered

2819806
put	get
i want to put the mvc2 app into azure once i get this working

2819824

cgpoint	cgrect	cgpoint	cgsize	cgsize	cgrect
uikit uses the core graphics structs cgpoint cgsize and cgrect

2820093

if you don t have the exec function enabled you have to rely on manually setting at least one cron job via some interface and then managing individual jobs in your script

2820114
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3+ safari 4+ google-chrome 1+ and some newer versions of opera support this effect

2820114
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.1+ safari 4+ and google-chrome support this

2820158
int	double
if you cast the double to an int long it will chop off any decimal component effectively giving you a floor or round-down of the double

2820196
installation	upgrade
for what i have read a major upgrade removes the previous installation and replaces all the files

2820326
zoo	xts
and i am wondering if you think that zoo and xts are identical

2820326
zoo	xts
they are not -- xts extends zoo in useful ways at the prices of limiting the index types to actual time or date objects rather than arbitrary indices as for zoo

2820326
zoo	xts
now dynlm is written by achim zeileis who is one of the authors of zoo as i don t see why you can t keep your data in xts but then pass to zoo via as.zoo foo when calling the dynlm functions

2820329
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

nsinvocationoperation	nsblockoperation
usage of applescript inside a nsinvocationoperation or nsblockoperation

2820433
zoo	xts
the simple answer is that zoo and xts are not completely interchangeable although sometimes they are

2820449
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
you can do so by using the returned value of the settimeout setinterval function and passing that value to the cleartimeout clearinterval function - as described in other answers here

2820449
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
from w3.org tr 2009 wd-html5-20090212 no.html a draft but w3schools and explain it almost the same way - settimeout and setinterval return a long and cleartimeout clearinterval accept a long to find and cancel

2820483
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
these of course only work on browsers where a console object is defined such as ie 8 safari google-chrome and firefox with firebug installed

2820502
put	get
i can get the drag drop bit to work i now need to put the final positions into a serialized array

2820502
put	get
i have done this to see if i can get the col id s into an alert and i can but where do i put

2820538
getter	setter
the reason this can happen is because a val is constant and as such it can be emulated by only a getter and no setter

2820555
vsts	tfs
workitems are part of vsts there is no any concept for workitems in other source control systems the microsft tfs

2820572
google-chrome	safari
in internet explorer the html is interpreted whereas mozilla google-chrome and safari leave it uninterpreted

2820581

it is important to use the hasownproperty method to determine whether the object has the specified properties as a direct properties and not inherited from the object s prototype chain

2820602
mouseleave	mouseenter
jquery 1.4.1 makes hover map to mouseenter mouseleave so you would do

2820608
min	max
how is it possible that in both min and max return exactly the same

2820630
superclass	subclassing
why is it that in java a superclass protected members are inaccessible by an indirect subclassing in a different package

2820630
superclass	subclassing
i know that a direct subclassing in a different package can access the superclass protected members

2820630
inherited	subclassing
i thought any subclassing can access its inherited protected members

2820630
superclass	subclassing
sorry novice mistake subclassing can access an indirect superclass protected members

2820631
min	max
the above code is a blanket code for all non-specialized types and they will indeed return the same value for both min and max

2820633
temp	tmp
when you download .flv files with flash they are in your tmp folder or whatever your crazy os uses for temp data

2820633
post	get
this makes it so you can t have some easy to forge get post request to download the file you actually have to simulate a protocol interaction which most children can t do

2820633
mp3	flv
you let the flash player make the request for the token then the next request for a mp3 flv file can be intercepted and then dropped

2820647
submit	submission
the problem is that i have added a search button on the same page using a usercontrol the search submit button triggers the comment form submission validation

2820650
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing it in google-chrome and firefox if i do an alert userselection within the function or an alert findselection

2820690
put	get
you can use the stacktrace class to get the name of the current function or if you put the code in a function then step down a level and get the calling function

2820717
width	height
bitmap doprintscreen int x int y int width int height

2820740
width	height
it would be easy for a user to accidentally swap x and y or width and height

2820742
min	max
you need to define two methods min tree and max tree then span tree t is defined as max t - min t

2820742
min	max
span itself shouldn t be recursive but you can make min and max recursive if you want

2820742
min	max
note that min and max doesn t have to be their own methods

2820765
hide	show
however this doesn t really work as when a couple of the radio buttons are on the same page the correct show hide behaviour seems to be messed up

2820777
width	height
the x y associate with width height so as to define a rectangle

2820783

2820795
width	height
as soon as i try to scroll around the image jumps to 0 0 and everything works as normal except the touches are offset by half the width and height of the background image

2820797
width	height
inline elements like span label etc. are displayed so that their height and width are calculated by the browser based on their content

2820797
width	height
if you want to control height and width you have to change those elements blocks

2820799
put	get
this is something you get for free if you put your stack of components into a vbox or box with direction vertical

2820802
width	height
also if you need to grab the same screen area repeatedly it s easier to save one variable a rectangle than four x y width and height

2820814
google-chrome	firefox
it works really well in at least firefox and saf but in google-chrome it never gets past the .each

2820853
postgresql	mysql
this query works just fine using mysql as the database but we d like to move towards postgresql

2820896
width	height
some times you have separated x y width height

2820903
stdout	stderr
use to redirect stderr to stdout

2820903
stdout	stderr
backticks only capture output to stdout and will miss output to stderr

2820935
maven	m2e
if you wonder m2e uses embedded maven 3 maven embedder 3.0.0.200912160759

2820935
maven	m2e
and i think that configuring m2e to not use maven embedder but the version you use on the cli would also solve the problem and this is my suggestion

2821000
int	double
this scores are double even if many users actually sort by int for instance unix times

2821000
int	double
so my idea was to check if a double could be casted into an int without lost of data and then using the function to turn the int into a string if this is true

2821000
int	double
in my reasoning the double casting above converts the double into a long and then back into an int

2821000
solaris	bsd
that is archs where linux mac os x bsd solaris are running nowaday

2821003
button	checkbox
for example there is a checkbox but there isn t even a simple button take a look at this screenshot

2821042
post	put
not sure the post i linked weren t very clue on where to put that code

2821042
textarea	textbox
when the user changes blurs from the tinymce control we want to ensure that the textarea textbox gets updated properly

2821043
ubuntu	linux
with windows i can set that variable but i had no luck setting it in linux tried in suse and ubuntu

2821053
post	get
so it on debugging never goes into the parameter method for post although on the view i have added a form and a button that submits and the page inherits from the viewmodel.i get an error saying it expects a parameterless constructor how do i fix this

2821102
mockups	balsamiq
if you re ever going to prepare a screenshot or mockups for a proposal or design document use balsamiq

2821105
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
without making any changes whatsoever my website works perfect in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

2821106
put	get
get a good computer quad-6 core 16gb ram install a windows server there add hyper-v and then put anything but domain controller file server in hyper-v instances

2821125
mockups	balsamiq
i feel that napkee is worth it because it allows users to export their creativity from mockups balsamiq that is and work with them interactively

2821171
capitalize	capitalization
it s probably better to capitalize but capitalization alone wouldn t solve the problem because sometimes occurrence can be the first word in a sentence for example

2821182
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome and firefox but not in internet explorer

2821186
vbscript	jscript
are you stuck with coding in vbscript or can you choose jscript

2821206
int	double
if you converted your double to a fixed point value you still get decimal precision and converting to a string is as easy as with int with the addition of a single shift function

2821206
int	double
doing the conversion from double to int is natively supported by many fpu units so that should be lightning fast

2821210
google-chrome	firefox
malformed json the other reason why this might work in firefox and other browsers but not google-chrome is the jquery parse function tries to use the native window.json.parse data function over new function return + data if native json parsing is available in that browser

2821210
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

2821238
folder	directory
there is an adf folder created like so inside the ear along with the war file and standard meta-inf directory is this adf directory

2821304
post	get
use this to get your file from the http post

2821334
accessor	properties
error cs1667 attribute obsolete is not valid on properties or event accessor

2821362
haskell	ocaml
a closer approximation might be pattern matching in languages like haskell f# and ocaml but i still can t quite find a way to make it look the way you re hinting

2821365
getter	setter
there are no public properties in a mfmailcomposeviewcontroller besides the delegate and it only seems to have setter methods and no getter

2821374
maya	blender
if you want to do 3d stuff blender free open-source 3ds max pricey maya pricey

2821376
post	get
note that a later blog post from the same blogger - - expanded quite on the limitations and how you can get around them somewhat

2821409
inherited	properties
a possible fix to this is that you can add user defined macros to a properties sheet and inherited the properties sheet

2821471
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
while it s technically possible to add the uitabbarcontroller s view as a subview of something other than the uiwindow you ll find that it presents more challenges than you might expect

2821471
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
for example since uitabbarcontroller assumes that its view s parent is the full screen uiwindow it will offset its frame by 20 pixels to accommodate the status bar

2821471
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
so my recommendation to you is to come up with a design in which your uitabbarcontroller s view is a subview of the uiwindow if possible

2821485
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
a class that is inherited with the private keyword will similarly make all publicly accessible members in the superclass private in the subclassing

inherited	properties
the objective is to make every element that has class bananaclass inherited the properties of bananatrans without editing the html or using javascript

implements	extends
perhaps implements a class which extends the webservicehost with events which the windowsservice subscribes to.

2823572
ienumerator	icollection	ilist	ienumerator	ilist	icollection
i would recommend to use this as a proof of concept and implement the appropriate interfaces such as icollection ienumerator ilist or whatever will serve your needs

2823582
onclick	onchange
use onchange to trigger js when you change something in the dropdown menu instead of onclick

2823582
hide	show
with selectedindex you can determine what has been selected the option show or hide and go from there

2823607
hide	show
then based on that value you can decide which box to show hide

2823622
implements	extends
it might be an idea to implements some sort of server side caching of your rescaled images if they re likely to be repeatedly hit but i don t think this need extends as far as explicit pre-rendering

2823630
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that it works perfectly in google-chrome but absolutely none of the css is beign applied in firefox or ie

2823657
post	get
wsdl - while you can enable wsdl by turning on metadata publishing wsdl support is intended for soap-based services not pure http get post

2823684

were you to implements a custom cell renderer extends a jlabel and implements listcellrenderer you could start with a simple attempt by implements the one interface method like this

2823735
client-side	server-side
i d be happy to point out how to best integrate your server-side data with your client-side map highlighting but would need more info

i have a project where i need to convert a large number of image types to be displayable in a silverlight app - tiff gif wmf emf bmp dib etc

2823843
gif	png	tiff	png
is there some kind of standard out there like tiff should always be a jpeg and gif should always be a png

2823843
bmp	png
or if a bmp is 24 bit it should be converted to a jpeg - any lower and it can be a png

2823869
width	margin
margin is outside and isn t part of the width

2823881
primes	modulus
the first number is the primes modulus p

2823903
post	put
with post counts there is already a function that updates the description under the avatar of users based on certain post numbers you could probably put an extra function update_achievement there

2823922
maven	cargo
for deployment to your local machine and to production use the maven cargo plugin

2823977
printf	fgets	fgets	fseek	fgets	fread	fseek	fread

have you tried pyglet with pyopengl

2823980
wxpython	pyqt
i personally prefer pyopengl and you can use wxpython or pyqt to create your rendering context

2824031
int	chars
dynamic languages all have this chars even though many go further than python in type laxity confusing strings and numbers and different kinds of numbers while python distinguishes strings from int from floating-point numbers for example -- python is quite type-picky .

2824051
bash	zsh
i wanted to achieve the same as asked here saving current directory to bash history but within zsh shell

2824071
xlib	xcb
i first encountered z notation when i read that xcb a replacement for the original xlib api in x11 was proven correct with z-notation

2824073

i tested it in ie8 firefox opera safari google-chrome current versions

2824140
istream	getline
is there any way of telling istream to keep going until it hits n instead of normal white space and with out the use of getline and also keeping any format options in the stream

2824161
folder	directory
both glob and scandir simply return all the files in the folder and i m afraid that won t be a good idea for a huge directory

2824195
ant	maven
both ides can be used with ant or if you want something different and i have heard more powerful you could check out maven

2824233
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works well in google-chrome firefox safari opera but not this baby

2824339

2824428
move	drag
by drag n drop he should be able to move apples so that it appears at the top of the list

2824431

however i m now curious - is there another way of determining the signed-ness of an integer type and or using the unsigned variant of a type without having to manually define a traits class per-type

2824455
int	chars
i want to accept either all int or all chars

2824510
g++	gcc
the only real change i ve made from the original source is casting the line in question to a char which my compiler gcc g++ specifically if it s a c c++ issue but gcc also wouldn t compile with the uncast statement insisted upon but i assume this is the source of the leak

2824524
realloc	malloc
in this case i would suggest not using malloc realloc and other similar c memory management in a c++ program unless absolutely necessary and unavoidable

2824540
haskell	scheme
in most functional languages like scheme and haskell passing functions around as arguments is along with recursion the meat-and-potatoes of programming rather than something with an occasional use

2824554
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade it to versioning 2.1 can any one guide me the complete procedure

2824559
realloc	malloc
was the memory you are reallocing originally malloc d or realloc d

2824610
int	chars
this does include things java.util.date which and countless many other types but is probably the best that you can do if you also want to allow int and chars

2824610
int	chars
nonetheless do keep in mind that int chars string are all object so in fact a bunch of those mixed together is a list of one type object

2824654
accessor	properties
in python and other languages supporting a properties -like construct that s not the case -- you can always replace a data member with a properties which calls accessor methods transparently the api does not change nor does client code

2824654
accessor	properties
so in python and other languages with properties -like constructs i believe .net languages are like that at source-code level though not necessarily at bytecode level you may as well leave your data public when it s part of the api and no accessor are currently needed you can always add accessor methods to later implementation releases if need be and not break the api

2824669
jobs	cron
how can i check how much bandwidth are all the cron jobs eating

2824669
jobs	cron
another thing is that i dont want the admins to ban the cron jobs because they are using too much bandwidth and cpu more than what is allocated in my web hosting package

but it show all of the child ul s when any parent li is hovered and it hide all the child ul s when unhovered

2824773
hide	show
and b. hide the show li ul only when another one is hovered not itself

2824807
hide	show
here is the code to solve this issue this will hide show the ul which comes inside the current li

2824850
jobs	cron
i know cron jobs could do this but is there another way

2824872
google-chrome	firefox
firefox plug in and google-chrome plug in

2824952
boost	stl
for example i d like to have one database for the standard c libraries one for system libraries that might be used by either c or c++ programs sockets networking comes to mind one for the standard c++ libs stl boost and then other databases for various third party libraries such as qt or glib

2824952
boost	stl
i assume that everything related to the c++ stdlib and stl are in the usr include c++ and that boost is all in usr include boost

2824954

it s a lot less efficient but it s an alternative if you don t have access to cron jobs

2825006
vb6	vba
i accept c# vb6 vba suggestions too

2825051
versioning	upgrade
i especially do not want to be tied into user level controls that are from a third party and regularly changing dll names during upgrade - the major versioning is encoded there and i am not sure i will not replace them at all so i rather go with my own slim objects

2825107
put	get
i have no experience on lower level programming like how to get the entry point and put the entire code of the target procedure into a tmemorystream while scanning for the 5 nop s

2825162
paradox	bde	paradox	dbase	bde	dbase
by bde you mean paradox or dbase

2825162
interbase	firebird
delphi supports firebird interbase database out of the box afaik and php libraries exist for it

2825285
free	malloc
at the end of the code buffer would be pointing to null because that s what you tested for to get out the while loop and hence when you call free you re not calling it on the original pointer you malloc d you re calling it on nothing

2825325
folder	dir
from the assets folder copy them at runtime in the application dir

2825340
folder	directory
now should i put this file in include folder and name it do_ajax_validation.inc.php and bar it from direct access of the user or should i put it in the directory in which the original form resides

2825377
post	get
i want to login to a website via post then post to another page and get its contents whilst still retaining my session

2825392
post	get
you can get better answers if you make an effort to post a snippet of your relevant code xaml

2825427
int	boolean
w3schools says that exceptions can be strings int boolean or objects but the example given doesn t strike me as good practice since exception type checking is done through string comparison

2825434
put	get
the formula so i put an interval into the equation and get the same answer as i would have by iteration

2825453
subscript	superscript
what i don t know how to do is displaying special characters and mathematical symbols and other kinds of text such as subscript and superscript in the figure for example sum sign and subscript t instead of sign to indicate transposed matrix

2825460
int	chars
however when it comes to output i ve got to convert the int back into 4 ascii chars

2825464
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade to ubuntu 10.04 and boost 1.40 and that s what i tested this solution on but it should work with any boost versioning as far as i can tell

2825470
post	get
to get the post data i always use

2825484
post	get
when using foreach to iterate over an object i get the following error fatal error objects used as arrays in post pre increment decrement must return values by reference...

2825545
int	chars
chars are 16 bit so you have to encode them into eight bit values to pack them in an int

2825545
int	chars
you can use the encoding class to convert between chars and bytes and the bitconverter class to convert between bytes and int

2825593

jobs	cron
from what i know till now is that in this page you can set routers rewrites cron jobs admin html front-end html and many more

2825633
margin	height
don t forget the page height can vary even between different versions of the same browser most prominently internet explorer depending on how margin padding etc

2825656
draggable	droppable
right now your code makes #move1 and #move2 draggable but nothing droppable

2825665

when this happens the most reliable way to return focus is by sending a mouse event to click on a text field directly above the list then send a tab keyboard event to shift the focus onto the list

2825795
nunit	mstest
while technically we don t call this a unit test but an integration test as oded explained you can do this by using a unit testing framework such as mstest part of visual studio 2008 2010 professional or one of the free available unit testing frameworks such as nunit

edit its also worth noting that if the values in y are 16-bit in size then you can do 2 of these and operations per operation 4 if you have 64bit registers

2826007
put	get
put into 1 32-bit and you get 0xfffc0003

post	put
just to put this to bed im going to post what my solution was

2827140
cvs	svn
i don t know if this is possible with viewcvs but i know it s possible with websvn though that would require you to convert from cvs to svn

2827153

2827319
googletest	gmock
we have already chosen googletest so using gmock would be nice

2827324

2827771
ant	maven
is there a plugin for eclipse or maybe something like ant or maven that can handle all of these steps for me with the push of a button

in any case were the second query rewritten to return an ienumerable iqueryable with one customer object instead of a single customer object the two statements would be functionally identical

2827801
prepare	execute
i dont know much about stored procedures and i am wondering how much if any performance increase stored procedures have over parameter binding as in parameter binding we prepare the query only once and just execute it later in the program for diferent set of values of variables

2828225
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and ie but google-chrome seems to ignore the css selector

2828288

a good example would be aggregating rss feed from multiple servers and then displaying them in a webpage

2828407
webclient	httpwebrequest
is there any solution beyond normal c# solutions like webclient download or httpwebrequest httpwebresponse

2828466
hide	show
you might need to hide all but the first image for the first animation then show them and activate cycle-plugin

2828538
rss	feed
as long as the rss feed is valid xml you can use php s xml parser to do this

2828626
ant	maven
the simplest solution will be to just use libraries from the project or a maven ivy repository and ignore the libraries in your global ant folder

2828631
sorting	grouping
using a built in function and sorting it by registration within the grouping

2828694
onchange	onkeyup
you will need to use onkeyup and onchange for this

2828694
onchange	onkeyup
the onchange will prevent context-menu pasting and the onkeyup will fire for every keystroke

2828719
gridview	repeater
not sure if that would work or not that would go walk controls with oftype might be a better choice on the type but that seems like a good starting choice looking at repeater and gridview and then set those to predictable so i d get static for all my normal things outside of repeating controls but not have to deal with static inside things like gridview repeater etc

2828719
required	placeholder
i don t see any way to mark the content placeholder such that it opts out of being included in child id s - setting the id of the placeholder to empty blank doesn t work as it s a required attribute

2828763
ironruby	ironpython
it s also used when embedding dynamic languages such as ironpython ironruby to allow loading types defined in external source files and accessing them more directly in c#

2828776

2828914
opera	firefox
tested with firefox 3.6 and opera 10.10

when the application is opened it will disable the keyboard and mouse so if you hit any keys it does nothing and you can not move the mouse

2828941
junit	testng
if you don t want to set up static initializers for one time initialization and are not particular about using junit take a look at testng

2828941
junit	testng
for the testng equivalent of junit 4 s before and after you can use beforemethod and aftermethod respectively

there is also the opposite behavior the entire exercise is on one page except the hrule in endexerciseenv which is flushed to the next page

2829058
cassini	iis
are you using cassini the built in visual studio debugger or attaching to an iis process

2829141
int	double
following a number with this symbol means that it will treat the number as a double instead of trying to guess what exact variable type to use it would likely have treated the 0 as a int without this

2829166
getter	setter
it does create more code and could introduce more complexity in the dto than if you had for example contructor arguments and or setter getter

2829180
hide	show
tip try to hide or show with jquery in ready handler for example so that jquery remembers their initial display settings

2829199

i would also appreciate you review my regular expressions for youtube redtube and vimeo

2829283
cpu	affinity
as an experiment you might try setting the cpu affinity on each thread such that each is bound to an individual cpu

2829330
portrait	landscape
initially the popover is displayed in portrait and upon rotation to landscape it disappears as expected

2829330
portrait	landscape
when rotated back to portrait and the popover is caused to be presented again the tableview is shown in landscape mode inside the popover

2829337
int	double
use int long float or double or the non-namespace-qualified symbols of corresponding names as the first argument to take advantage of unboxed primitive arithmetic appropriate for your argument types

2829342
rsa	aes
i m then encrypting this random aes key with a rsa public key

2829462
client-side	server-side
first what would you recommend server-side or client-side approach

2829487
jpgraph	fusioncharts	client-side	server-side
personally i use the server-side jpgraph for most of my charting work and fusioncharts commercial for flash-based client-side charting although i m looking at openflashcharts at the moment

2829491
onchange	onblur
i thought that i would use the onchange event but this seems to be interpreted as the onblur event on ie

2829498
jqplot	flot
i ve also used jqplot but i find flot more performant with large datasets

2829535
post	get
you can use wpdb- query to run just about any sql statement on the database so you can definitely get a list of all post by multiple authors it just takes more work

2829597
firefox	safari
i m better about getting things to look good in ie8 firefox and safari but ie7 still throws curve balls at me.

2829604

client-side	server-side
as a personal project i m making an ajax chatroom application using xml as a server-side storage and json for client-side processing

2829631
firefox	safari
i tried out the code and sure enough firefox won t run the applet called by javascript without a doprivileged call but safari will at least on mac osx

2829640
firefox	safari
here s something that you can use and just replace safari with firefox

2829666
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
an effective way is to use a combination of onkeydown and onpaste which will work in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

2829666
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i have read that domattrmodified is supported by opera and safari not sure about firefox so you could use that in combination with ie s onpropertychange untested

2829682
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
further a quick test around the latest versions of firefox opera google-chrome and safari plus ie9 platform preview shows that they all do what html5 specifies

2829708
post	get
you certainly can t do stuff like the above in one line but it s a fully-fledged http library that wraps up get post requests and the rest

2829746
public	protected
i m going for something else - the issue of public protected private may not be solved specifically by this but i think it lends itself much better to maintenance then a lot of nested internal classes

2829874

for instance i suppose i have a directory that contains the following folder

2829900
google-chrome	firefox
it says invalid argument it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

2829965
union	distinct
suggested does not double count as union implies a distinct if a row exists in one half of the union ignore it in the other

queue	fifo
if your problem provides a reason to choose one node over another you might consider using a priority queue instead of a stack for depth-first or a fifo for breadth-first

2830028
spaces	delimiter
note i like spaces as a record delimiter but i d have no issue changing it for one easier to use

2830119
portrait	landscape
but i m hearing sometimes that you write the form for different form factors different screen size different orientation portrait landscape ..

2830166
hide	show
in your example setter would appear in the little-white-down-arrow s menu with a checkmark allowing you to quickly show hide all methods tagged with an category setter annotation in their javadoc comment block

2830217
width	height
window.open mywindow width 400 height 200

2830225
spaces	delimiter
this would mean that your delimiter is comma rather than spaces but it would handle all the escaping and unescaping for you

2830235
int	double
to avoid the inexactness of floating point values you can use a double int calculation which is more accurate at least on x86 x64 platforms

2830252
hide	show
hide the lowest-level items that have already been show on the first page then make subsequent items visible until they no longer fit on the page

a 64-bit os doesn t have this problem as it has much more virtual space you don t even have to upgrade to a 64-bit versioning of java to take advantage of this

2830492
button	checkbox
you also needs to create some system which makes it possible for button checkbox etc to tell the rest of your code that they were clicked

2830517
children	parent
in this situation i might need to execute some operation on the parent view and all its children

2830547
richfaces	icefaces
richfaces icefaces jmaki

2830547
glassfish	weblogic
oracle has two at the moment - glassfish and weblogic

2830561
outputstream	inputstream
another idea i ve been playing with is reading chunks of data from the inputstream and writing them to the outputstream of the datahandler

2830615
cpu	processors
similarly if you assume that the interfering job only uses 25 of one processors s time you might see one of your threads and the interferer on the same cpu

2830650
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

2830695

as an alternative i ve tried putting a uiview as the top subviews and then tried passing the touches to the now underlying scrollview

2830741
children	parent
the child entity is added to the children collection on the parent entity and linqtosql or linqtoenityframework should handle the foreign key for you

2830750

2830837
jar	war
i am trying to remove a file from a dependency jar that i am including in my war file in maven

2830837

2830899
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
due to the design of pbkdf2 it would be very difficult to guess a hash generated with one salt even if you knew the hash that was generated by the same passphrase for a different salt

2830923
width	height
you can get height width pretty easily using

2830958
hide	show
then use the onclick event of the control which will determine whether other controls are made visible to show hide controls as you wish

first jsp is just a view technology which provides a template to write html css js in and offers facilities to interact with backend java code using taglib like jstl and expression language those things

2835344
width	height
the way i do this is to give it a minheight and minwidth but no height or width properties

2835348
boost	stl
out of that comes relatively simple and small libraries compare the size of say stl or boost to foundation

2835354
post	get
you should really add some sort of data cleansing you should never take raw post get data and insert it directly into a query

2835387
put	get
if you put v vs.90 you will get the 3.5 because its using visual studio 9 look at the link below

2835426
sorting	grouping
now let s override sorting on grouping project managers let s make project manager 2 come before 1 and project manager 1 come after project manager 2

2835439
post	get
here s a bit of code that will probably get you the post titles by author

2835442
boost	stl
the c++ stl has a nice complex-class and boost also has to offer some nice options

2835476
exponent	twos-complement
if you used a twos-complement representation for the exponent a small positive number with a negative exponent would look like a very large integer because the second msb would be set

2835520
for-loop	arrays
second you re trying to use menu as a one-based arrays in the for-loop

2835544
stretchblt	bitblt
you seem to be roughly on the right track if you use stretchblt in place of the bitblt you re using now

2835587
x86	64bit
note i am using 64bit os hence the x86

2835622
post	get
hey guys i have a system where there is one form for each friend you have and i used to have an ajax post function for each form but i want to save code and was wondering if it was possible to get multiple forms to work with just one post function

2835694
webchromeclient	webviewclient
at first glance there are too many differences webviewclient webchromeclient

2835711
post	get
you should probably use an http client library to do your post and get the response

2835711
post	get
they have some examples so it shouldn t be too hard for you to use that to do your post get the result and then use documentbuilder to build up a dom and get what you want out of it

2835751
hash	md5
i have this example where i want to name a file based on it s md5 hash

2835761
integer	unsigned
you can use the suffix ull which is the standard c99 and c++0x way to specify an unsigned long long integer literal and a long long is at least 64 bits

2835775
tortoisegit	svn
at work we use svn on windows but want to migrate to git as soon as the tools have fully matured not just tortoisegit but also something akin the really nice visual studio integration provided by visualsvn

2835779
post	get
this will get the page to refresh the post values in your request.form object

2835781
fdf	xdp
2. adding a submit button to the pdf itself using livecycle with some sort of js click event to save the fdf xfdf xdp xml data either to the database or to a flat file on the server

2835875
operands	scalar
the simplest way would be just to create an operands struct that contains a double for the scalar and a vector object for the vector

2835875
operands	scalar
you can set isvector_ to true if it is a vector operands and false if it is a scalar operands

2835875
operands	scalar
other options include inheritance creating scalar and vector types derived from an operands base type or something like boost variant but for something simple like this a composition struct like the operands shown above is probably the easiest way to do it

2835911
portrait	landscape
i got the landscape mode working but on the textview is still being put to the top of the iphone to compensate for the keyboard in portrait mode

2835911
hide	show
below is the code for this methods i will just let see the code for show since the hide code will be the reverse

2835926
x86	mips
arguments i still think it s more fun writing x86 assembly than mips for example - the latter is just plain tedious

2836017
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
self navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller vartesting animated yes

2836025
folder	directory
i notice that our bin folder for 1.0.3 has a wrapper.exe in it that calls a wrapper.conf file in our 1.0.3 conf directory

2836073
intersect	contains
that way your rectangles can implement a contains lines can do intersect or graphics paths you can account for some hit padding etc

2836111
centos	linux
i ve got a windows server box running ad and a centos box running openldap in a mixed windows linux network and i want to keep the two in sync

2836140
equals	gethashcode
thanks to the code here to get me through the equals and gethashcode errors

2836154
prerequisites	uninstaller
i have thought about creating an prerequisites command line to detect the old version and uninstaller but i would like to avoid having to write something like that where it only gets run once

2836185
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in my experience extjs ria layouts work beautifully on firefox google-chrome and opera but not nearly as well on ie8

2836185
actionscript	mxml
with fb you can write mxml and or actionscript classes

2836222
vim	emacs
i ve tried using vim and emacs but since i don t manage the server frequently enough i never quite get the hang of it and end up forgetting the commands

2836305
memcached	ncache
say instead of ncache memcached etc

2836316
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
each of the columns used in a group by query needs to be specifically called out ie don t do as you need to use them in some sort of aggregate-functions min max sum avg count etc or be part of the group by clause

2836339
put	get
in code above i need to get the type of items on t variable to put into of my generic list

2836362
mouse	keyboard
when a form is displayed modally no input keyboard or mouse click can occur except to objects on the modal form

2836373
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
but it makes sense if they are not inherited a subclassing might require other attributes or contradict attributes from a superclass

2836373
inherited	properties
if you need inherited and don t want to look at super classes it might make more sense to use a class function or class properties or even a tag interface declares no methods instead

2836441
goto	break
the problem is solved when you remove continue break or goto

2836474
pop-up	dialog
i m wondering how i could make this into a pop-up dialog

2836486
mdpi	hdpi
density ldpi mdpi hdpi

2836511
pop-up	dialog	implements	extends
you could extends dialog then use gridbaglayout to implements gui like that actually jframe also works you just need to specify some setting like default close operations and stuff if you use dialog set setmodel to true to block other gui just like a pop-up window

2836542
min	max
is there a table documenting which properties each java layout ignores max size min size etc

2836555
folder	directory
you can use virtualbox s shared folder feature to enable your ubuntu virtual machine to mount a directory of your windows host

2836563
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	scheme
just for example i can write scheme quite reasonably as well but that s of little use in reading ocaml or haskell for only a couple of examples

2836563
lisp	scheme
even within a single family scheme vs. common lisp familiarity with one doesn t seem to translate nearly as well to the other

2836579
svg	vml
can one use xslt to transform an svg document to vml

2836611
mousemove	mousedown
this is actually very simple code just handle mousedown set a local variable giving the mousedown location and the side corner being dragged then on mousemove update the size

2836620
filewriter	printwriter
my question is about line edit 19 where the new printwriter is created with the constructor taking the filewriter fw as a parameter

2836620
filewriter	bufferedwriter
i don t understand the use of chaining the bufferedwriter bw to filewriter if it isn t used later on in the actual writing

2836686
filewriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	printwriter	printwriter	bufferedwriter
the bufferedwriter javadoc shows a normal example of how filewriter bufferedwriter and printwriter are typically used

2836777
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works on firefox google-chrome safari and ie8

2836785
typedef	struct
if you want to use x as a name by itself without the struct preceding it you have to use a typedef

2836785
typedef	struct
in c++ however the first without the typedef has roughly the same effect as the second both define x so you can use it by itself without struct preceding it

2836787
post	get
you would take the html and add it as a parameter to your ajax call remember to use post as the request method so you don t get size limitation problems.

2836788
lxml	beautifulsoup
if after then it doesn t matter any more that some of the html was done via javascript -- you can just use popular parsers like lxml or beautifulsoup to handle the html you have

2836817
sorting	filtering
jqgrid has features like paging sorting and two kind of searching more as filtering with where in the corresponding select of data simple and advanced

2836834
versioning	upgrade
i suggest you serve your own versioning of jquery s library to not have sudden problems if a future upgrade of jquery decommissions a function you used in the application you wrote 2 years ago

2836839
width	height
those elements would be shown in dialog with same width and height and same css and everything else would be hidden

2836955
setinterval	clearinterval
in this instance you really wouldn t need to use an open tail -f system call because the nature of the js setinterval method the python script will be called over and over again until the js clearinterval method is called

2837002
post	get
you should disable register globals so that the session post get request cookie variables do not interfere

2837031
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
use uiviewcontroller and when you need additional navigation push a uinavigationcontroller on the stack it ll solve your problem for any use case

2837071
width	height
i also tried setting the width of the button in code but i can t seem to determine the new height button.getheight returns 0

2837097
erd	diagram
can any one say some way to convert sql code to data diagram like erd

2837105
inherited	subclassing
this i can t answer but i did trace it to the fact that no examplegroups get registered which in turn is due the fact that the inherited callback in examplegroupmethods does not get called when rspec dynamically creates a new subclassing of activesupport testcase this happens in examplegroupmethods#subclass

2837162
jar	war
krusader file manager from kde - it allows to investigate jar ear or war file but unfortunatelly doesn t work well with nested jars files

2837162
jar	war
mc midnight commander - it works pretty well with ear jar or war event with nested jars

2837179
ilmerge	reflector
i m using ilmerge to target v4 with and without the targetplatform v4 and got the same result .net runtime version targeting has greater .net v4 revision as stated by reflector

2837182

i have an outlook 2007 add-in in vsto 2005 se that allows users to save e-mails into our document management system

2837305
put	get
i would like to do a loop to get each value in the first column and put it in the x value and the second column in the y value

2837305
put	get
how do i get the data and put it in x and y

2837327
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it looks like you are trying to implement a constructor method in a subclass of uiviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller

2837381
button	checkbox
i had a similar issue where my radio button and checkbox were showing borders but only in ie

2837383
ciimage	nsbitmapimagerep
i m able to get the image in rgba format using the qtkit and the didoutputvideoframe delegate call and converting the cvimagebuffer to a ciimage and then to a nsbitmapimagerep

2837461
ubuntu	linux
although if you want to really learn about linux you ll probably want to start with a plain vanilla ubuntu install and learn how to work with not only the command line but also the various package management utilities

2837468
solaris	bsd
they do not run the same in windows as they do in linux bsd solaris etc

2837483
post	put	post	get	put	get
i trying to restful server that one can upload image by use django-piston i can put get post information restfully but don t know how to upload image

2837489
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying it out in the latest versions of firefox and google-chrome with the same results

2837497
filesystems	ntfs
there is no api so to say though there are projects that deal with accessing the ntfs filesystems directly from linux though it sounds like you are developing in windows

2837497
filesystems	ntfs
wikipedia article on ntfs the filesystems windows 7 uses check the external links

2837528
ubuntu	linux
all linux clients running anything from red hat 9 to ubuntu 10.04

2837557
width	height
so you set the font size and it does the layout giving you back the required height laying out text within the given width

2837563
post	get
we have several form action methods that have separate get and post methods decorated with acceptverbs httpverbs.get or httpverbs.post respectively

2837563
post	get
when writing separate get post action methods what is the best practice for handling the head verb

2837601
min	max
whilst experimenting floats only really work well when they have a width set so i d use a parent div with a min and max width set and add width 50 to the child divs

2837624
filesystems	fat
if you need to work between the two os s create a small fat partition that way you can see your work from both os as windows can t see ext3 or ext4 filesystems that linux uses

2837669
versioning	upgrade
to utilize a diff tool you would have to have a copy of all of your db versioning and create diff scripts which would go out and get executed with new releases and upgrade

2837703
min	max
first pass compute the max min sd and mean

2837703
range	max	range	min	min	max
second pass divide the range min max into some number of buckets 100

2837707

i m looking for a way to collect the file dependencies from flex actionscript and mxml files

2837763
jobs	cron
and setup cron jobs on deployment machines using the usercrontab buildout recipe

2837785
folder	directory
i have found examples of find replace but i was hoping for a way that would traverse all folder within my c projects directory and find any files that end with the .config extension

2837787
post	get
so in edit get and post add get and post i use a viewdata to pass this list in html.listbox

2837821
min	max
the total max min and average bytes allocated and the average lifespan of allocations

2837843
javasound	audioinputstream
i am using javasound and have an audioinputstream of format

2837868
directwrite	direct2d
i m toying with a little 2d game engine in c# and decided to use direct2d and directwrite for rendering

2837868
directwrite	direct2d
i m trying to do it without managed c++ but direct2d and directwrite don t appear to use traditional com objects

2837897
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
calling free malloc calloc etc dynamic memory allocation deallocation

2837917
getter	setter
i think the best way to do it is to get the getter or setter method convert it to a delegate and work with the delegate there is no faster way

2837918
puts	gets
i have another process running on a server which gets wavs from this bucket converts to mp3 using lame and puts them into another bucket

2837918
mp3	wav
this all works fine but in converting wav mp3 about 0.1sec or so of silence is added to my sound

2837947
memset	malloc
for some people working with c++ memset malloc co

2837961
abc	subclassing
create a dependencyobject subclassing whatever containing an attached property abccontrol whose propertychangedcallback does the conversion and modifies the abc property

2837984
profiling	debugging
there seem to be some nice features there for historical debugging profiling and qa team integration test session video playback etc

2838045
jtextpane	jeditorpane
you may have more luck using a jtextpane jeditorpane

2838099
rss	feed
i ve created my own defaulthandler to parse rss feed and for most feed it s working fine however for espn it is cutting off part of the article url due to the way espn formats it s urls

2838103
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
when i accessed some navigational properties i discovered that all many-to-one relations simple references were null and all one-to-many and many-to-many relations entitycollections were empty

2838127
qcombobox	qstackedwidget
on digging further it turns out that two of the parent controls qparentwindow and qstackedwidget have style sheets that qcombobox is inheriting

2838147
directwrite	direct2d
the windowsâ api code pack for microsoftâ .net framework has managed libraries that allow access to direct2d and directwrite

2838147
directwrite	direct2d
now i m not sure if i understand correctly but are you just looking at some way of using direct2d and directwrite from c# or does it have to be com or p invoke

2838220
google-chrome	firefox
this is only occuring in firefox google-chrome and not in ie

2838229
folder	directory
under this there are 3 directory which are currently source folder i think

2838258
folder	directory
eclipse does not automatically pick up folder or files dropped into it s project directory

2838260
profiling	debugging
all appears to indicate that it is using the expected development profiling for debugging

2838274
width	height
then just place a image with the correct size or using the img attributes width height

2838281
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i find that all of the uiviewcontroller i push onto my subclass of uinavigationcontroller respond to rotation even if i implement shouldautorotate and return no

2838308
int	chars
signed chars alloc_pixels unsigned chars ptr unsigned int size

2838346
int	double
where cint converts a value to an int and cdbl converts a value to a double

2838363
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in your httpd.conf file you must enable .htaccess overriding with allowoverride for the directory where the .htaccess is or parent thereof

2838388
textview	imageview
instead of an imageadapter returning imageview from getview you would need a tyleradapter returning a linearlayout or relativelayout for each cell with the layout containing your imageview and textview caption

2838388
listview	gridview
here is a free excerpt from one of books that illustrates stuff like this albeit in the context of a listview instead of a gridview

2838403
restructuredtext	asciidoc
docbook and restructuredtext are definitely the two largest competitors but asciidoc is another similar markup language that is readable regardless of the markup

2838403
restructuredtext	asciidoc
i m more familiar with and therefore a larger proponent of restructuredtext personally but asciidoc is just another option out there

2838450
portrait	landscape
the problem is when i set animation to no the whole view shifts 20px to the right it is always in landscape mode as if there is a status bar but in portrait mode

2838453
inherited	properties
i suspect the problem is that self.view is of type uiview since it s inherited from uiviewcontroller not pdfview so the compiler doesn t recognize that there s a url properties on it

2838572
abstract-class	superclass
change the chain of superclass that your abstract-class extends or make an incompatible change in those classes or

2838573
vbscript	jscript
if you want create a com which can be accessible from vbscript jscript or from old classic asp you have to implement idispatch

2838573
vb6	vba
if you use your com in vb6 or vba with createobject progidname that you will be use late bound

2838573
vb6	vba
it is very important to understand that to make com accessible from vb6 vba ect

2838573
vb6	vba
for understanding the type library play a role of client marshaling dll so it helps a client software like vb6 vba to send correctly data as a parameters to your com

2838586
nsbutton	nsmatrix
you may find an nsmatrix of nsbuttoncells easier to work with and unlike a c array of nsbutton you can create one in ib

2838594
width	height
note that holding explicit width and height keys may not necessarily be much help performance-wise as clojure vectors keep a count of their members as do many other clojure collections

2838611
easyhook	detours
easyhook picks up where detours left off

2838621
easyhook	detours
here is a c# example of hooking idirect3ddevice9 objects via dll injection and function hooking using easyhook like detours

2838621

is it possible for me to insert the maven-ear-plugin in this webapp pom.xml generate an ear file that contains this project war

2838653
maven-ear-plugin	pom.xml
how do i create an ear file that contains the war file using maven-ear-plugin from my webapp s pom.xml

2838666
inherited	properties
for each of your table adapters that you set to inherited your baseclass you must override the required mustoverride properties

2838667
getter	setter
at first he has you create a setter and getter method in the class

2838681
put	get
here you can even put stuff in try catch and only return success if no exception occurred so that you don t get thrown to error page

2838710
post	get
you can see all requests made and the post get variables

2838719
inherited	properties
for each of your table adapters that you set to inherited your baseclass you must override the required mustoverride properties

2838725
postgresql	mysql
pdo works with mysql postgresql and mysqli among others i believe

2838781
int	boolean
c++ treats any non-0 value as true and 0 as false so you can actually use an int as a boolean value if you want to.

2838811
fancybox	colorbox
look at the demos for fancybox and colorbox

2838830
passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	thin	unicorn
thin unicorn and passenger are all actively maintained have been 1.9-compliant for a long time are faster in the typical benchmarks and have different strengths in their features and ease of deployment

2838841
getter	setter
getter setter or by direct field

2838845
getter	setter
there is nothing incorrect about standardizing your properties in getter setter

2838854
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so that means i have a single uinavigationcontroller that manages a uiviewcontroller

2838870
jruby	rubinius
i can see needing to keep the old ruby around for legacy code that isn t worth updating or having a preference for an alternative ruby jruby rubinius etc. -- but it truly baffles me why so many people are still starting new projects in the slower obsolete ruby 1.8.x line

2838876
versioning	upgrade
install a stable versioning or upgrade

2838877
children	parent
suppose i want to search an infinite binary tree of strings where all the left children are the parent string plus a and the right children are the parent plus bb

2838886
formview	linqdatasource
i ve created a new aspx page and dropped a linqdatasource and a formview control onto it

2838908
hide	show
i am successfully using the following code to hide and show elements based on if a user is logged in or not but can t seem to find out how to only show these links to the actual user who created them...not any user that is logged in

2838914
width	height
the element has to be inside a container element whose dimensions effective width and height should be same as the element container a simple javascript can do that trick and it should have position relative .make this container position itself as it s child would have been.that s it

2838920
x86	64bit
i d like to have a 32 bit wix installer that will work on both platforms but i d like it to install to program files rather than program files x86 on 64bit operating systems

2838954
width	height
but if you just mean height and width then you can also add these elements to the dynamically generate style

2838963
disk	ram
hitting the filesystem may only hit ram cache but it has the potential to hit the disk

2838963
disk	ram
any time you hit the disk you re looking at at least an order of magnitude of slowness compared to straight ram access

2838972
post	get
rather than post my code and play where s wally or waldo depending on where you re from i thought it would be more useful to get some good strategies that can be applied in this and similar situations

2838991
post	get	submit	submission
when submission a form you can only submit it as get or post request

2838999
accessor	properties
in these cases especially when building tests a dynamic type can be used which would then allow properties accessor to be called and logged accordingly by the proxy object in a dynamic fashion without having to hardcode properties within a test-only class

2839001
width	height
i m trying to create a resized image from a bitmap set a new height width and a new resolution and save it to png

2839001
width	height
both work okay schmokay but a does not allow me to set a new width height on creation but it does allow me to preserve values with and b does not allow me to preseve values

2839001
width	height
basically i m looking for a way to contruct a new bitmap with both something like and set the width height at the same time width height are read-only properties once it s created

2839001
width	height
i know the new pixel width height needed based on the resolution values i ll pass in with .setresolution xdpi ydpi to preserve physical dimensions so that s not the problem

first you should learn the format of a typical rss feed heres an example

2839137
comparator	comparable
i learned how to use the comparable but i m having difficulty with the comparator

2839150
comparator	comparable
when to use comparable vs comparator

2839165

you want to implement comparable not comparator

2839208
post	get
i am able to get a byte array of the image and send it using http post

2839213
mouseleave	mouseenter
firstly how can i combine the two with .hover rather than a separate mouseenter and mouseleave

2839223
mouseover	mouseout
the .tooltip plugin has several handlers that attach to the element namely on mouseover mouseout and click

2839229

opera	google-chrome
here is a demo of the second version that will work in google-chrome and possibly a current beta version of opera

2839398
wan	lan
i really just have a simple app that needs a database and i ll only have a 10 - 30 clients on a lan wan network that would be connecting in

2839398
wan	lan
edit so the focus of my question was regarding the communications protocol approach from the client pc to the database over the lan wan

2839452
hash	md5
you are not misunderstanding md5 hashing md5 will always produce the same hash given the same input

2839480
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you don t like to have a tab bar in your application and wish to switch between different uinavigationcontroller instances or any uiviewcontroller for that matter you can do something like this

2839480
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i didn t take into consideration that you should correctly handle the methods viewwillappear viewdidappear and so on

2839504
restrict	shared
how can i restrict the exported functions of a shared library to those i want a .def file equivalent

2839514
getter	setter
property decorates a function and replaces it with an object that has getter setter and deleter functions which are also decorators

2839525
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to render a font using the css property font-face in firefox google-chrome and opera it works fine but within internet explorer is just does not want to display correctly and reverts back to another standard font

2839553
rss	feed
i have seen a few examples of how to create rss feed using asp.net mvc either by creating an action or through an httphandler

2839553
rss	feed
i need to authenticate feed and am wondering how this is to be done and supported by rss readers rather than just browsing to the page xml through a browser and how would authentications differ between an mvc action or httphandler

2839554
restrict	shared
how can i restrict the exported functions of a shared library to those i want a .def file equivalent

2839555
free	malloc
the closest equivalent are the malloc and free functions if you ignore the constructors destructors and type safety

2839572
free	malloc
not directly an exact replica but compatible equivalents are malloc and free

2839579
dlsym	dlopen
so instead of making up some dodgy schemes you can just pass the names of the library and function from server to client and client will get function address using dlopen + dlsym

2839590
free	malloc
use malloc free functions

2839672
width	height
note that all the columns in a row will have same height and all rows in a column will have same width

2839676
vbscript	vba
with vbscript than with vba

2839735
jboss	weblogic
should i forget about the complexity and simply go with jboss weblogic etc and put up with the bloat and extra start-up time

2839736
google-chrome	firefox
it ran very well for me - both firefox and google-chrome saying that - google-chrome was smooother although you d expect it with the weight of firefox on your system

2839741
rss	feed
i want to show news on my main page using rss feed

2839754
wan	lan
i m across winforms currently but want to write an app that users will have a lan wan between them and database

2839766
jboss	glassfish
i wouldn t recommend using jboss glassfish etc for your scenario - the overhead far outweighs the only benefit - no additional setup involved

2839806
free	malloc
as all the other answers say the most common way to allocate and release dynamic memory is calling malloc and free

2839806
free	malloc
the point is the api doesn t require the client to use malloc and free

2839854
google-chrome	firefox
i m perhaps a bit optimistic in hoping google-chrome or an extension or firefox has a console command letting me alter the if-modified-since header then send the request

2839904
google-chrome	firefox
the comment inside the conditional comment was fine for firefox and ie but it made google-chrome execute the code inside the conditional comment

2839905
textview	imageview
that listview contains imageview and two textview aka first and last names

2839938
try-catch	exception-handling

i have tried to implement drupal connect with facebook functionality via fbconnect module

2839946
rss	feed
good and full implementation of rss feed in asp.net mvc

2840022
disk	ram
however in most cases it is better to pay the price of duplication in ram or disk image than the price of dependency on extra modules

2840023
width	height
use width and height attributes to set them in css

2840027
wan	lan
in .net land what would be a good approach for quick prototyping of a concept development just on my pc that could then be extended out to product users across lan wan but in a fashion that the model business logic code and data access layer code can be used as is

2840032
formpanel	gridpanel
i have extjs viewport panel that contain center panel that contain tablpanel in which i have added gridpanel in one tab on this i have put add person button in tbar of that will add a new tab of a formpanel in its reset button i am not able to access form to reset it

2840032
width	height
region center center region is required no width height specified

2840032
tabs	tabpanel
var tabpanel ext.getcmp main .findbyid tabs

2840032
width	height
height 300 width 400

2840040
width	height
getbounds simply returns the x y and width height

2840041
mouse	keyboard
it runs right after any mouse or keyboard input event after all windows notifications are processed

2840089
qstackedwidget	qmainwindow
to have them displayed in the qmainwindow you have to set the central widget of the qmainwindow to be the stacked widget and uses qstackedwidget changecurrentindex slot to pass from the first widget to the other

2840093
postgresql	mysql
basically everything you have to do is to change doctrine s propel s driver name so in config databaes.yml set postgresql instead of mysql and you re done

2840104
ant	maven
so if you want to do this in one build the easiest way would be indeed to use the maven antrun plugin and to implement the loop and the processing logic with ant tasks

2840105
post	put
no matter what i put in the body text area and post it i keep getting required back

2840108
pull	push
you could maybe find an s3 bridge to run in fuse or an s3- dav bridge that you could possibly mount as a filesystem and then tell hg to push and pull data from that virtual filesystem but otherwise you would need a dedicated ec2 instance to actually serve the data you could launch it on demand but the latency on that is pretty bad as you probably well know

2840109
post	get
to prevent users from resubmitting forms by using the back button or refreshing the page you need to follow a design pattern called post redirect get

2840131
disk	ram
a this point in my program i am reading a feature from disk processing it and writing it back because well i don t have enough ram to open all 50 million features at once

2840153
outputstream	inputstream
just write the obtained inputstream to an outputstream of any flavor fileoutputstream the usual java io way

2840166
mockups	prototyping
if one of the overall goals of prototyping is to investigate and explore different technology choices these can be done in isolation of ui mockups and in a more abstract fashion pure technology investigation rather than geared at delivering the exact needs of a prototype which can be changing massively

2840207
button	checkbox
then u user can change his selection and push the save button id btnsaveuserintersts and i am trying to save in the hidden textbox all the values of the checkbox that was choosen

2840208
stdout	stderr
if the program was written by a sane person what you probably want is the stderr not the stdout

2840246
stdout	stderr
you can use to redirect both stdout and stderr to a file

2840246
stdout	stderr
this is shorthand for where the means send stderr to the same place as stdout stdout is file descriptor 1 stderr is 2

2840276
udp	tcp
thus the definition of ipv6 includes a new definition for the tcp and udp pseudo header see rfc 2460 s8.1

2840295
opera	google-chrome
when clicking this link the following div get s gets visible and scrolls into view tested in ie6 ie8 ff3.6.3 google-chrome 4.1 and opera 10.5 all on windows

2840300
typedef	struct
this includes typedef struct extern and so on

2840324
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
for the hover case you actually would want mouseover and mouseout instead of mouseenter and mouseleave which .hover binds to in this case like this

2840362
gif	png
try gif and or png also with these you can reduce the number of colors

2840370
int	chars
i m writing a program in which i want to terminate program by pressing any key whether chars or numbers so i did a conversion from string to int using integer.parseint variable method and compare choices if it is not desired choice it should terminate the program but it show an error exception in thread main java.lang.numberformatexception for input string d

2840409
web2py	cherrypy
if you re using the popular cherrypy wsgi server that i believe comes bundled with web2py for example see in cherrypy s own docs the autoreload feature

2840412
postgresql	mysql
so far no one has mentioned postgresql as alternative to mysql on the relational side

2840413
int	chars
compare chars instead of converting them to int

2840420
vbscript	vba
almost anything you can do in vba to automate excel you can do in vbscript or any other script language that supports com

2840435
int	boolean
maybe this piece of code works fine and returns true but you treat that value as int boolean true can be displayed as 1

2840435
int	boolean
do var_dump uddated_sql your query and check whether it returns boolean true or int 1 value

2840436
post	get
also if you go the mvc way make sure you have enough time to learn it since you are going to go a little bit more low level gonna have to learn more of the little details like the actual difference between post get and all that stuff that is pretty much completely hidden in webforms

2840442
profiler	visualvm
the memory profiler of visualvm might also help if you need to go at a lower level

2840468
persistent	transient
for transient updates about what your task is doing in the middle of x x done starting y etc you could think of a specialized log-handler that for example interprets such streams of updates by taking the first word as a subtask-identifier incrementally building up and displaying somewhere the composite message about the current subtask recognizing when the subtask identifier changes that the previous subtask is finished or taking an explicit subtask finished message and only writing persistent log entries on subtask-finished events

2840477
dictionary	map
you can use map for java as above question use dictionary for c#

2840488
mouse	keyboard
it can also handle keyboard and mouse input which are normally separate -- via directinput on windows or sdl on linux

2840495
visualvm	jprofiler
sun s visualvm is free but i am a big fan of jprofiler which is a commercial app although you can get a 30 day trial

2840507
children	parent
you can have literally millions of children for each parent

2840543
post	get
also make sure to return false from your submit handler to prevent a non-xhr get post from happening

2840580
ssl	https
if you want to secure your session use https to encrypt the whole http communication via ssl and set the cookies only with the flags

2840612
put	get
get yourself a copy of gmp and put together a c program to do it

2840631
folder	directory
one possibility in the deployment step please check if you have actually created three plugins by looking at the xtext s installation directory inside of plugins folder

2840641
3des	aes
generate random session key for some symmetric algorithm aes rc4 3des you name it

2840650
web2py	cherrypy
if you are using the latest web2py it no longer comes with cherrypy

2840660
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and presumably debian the wordnet libraries and tools are conveniently available with

2840666
profiling	debugging
a good profiling compared to a bad one can easily save you a day of debugging work immediately and that pays for the license and for the people doing the great job developing these nice tools

2840693
onmouseover	onmousedown
each square in the grid is a div with an own onmouseover and onmousedown function

2840698
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
in all other browsers such as ie opera google-chrome and safari the width looks the same and is in fact 3px wide

2840703
xna	slimdx
i use slimdx for c# graphics programming and i prefer it to xna

2840704
addition	multiplication
what i would like to do is skip the multiplication with any missing values the 10th and 11th position from my above example and then after the addition divide by the number of elements that were multiplied 11 from the above example

2840726
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
if you don t want to have to write your own parser to build the abstract syntax tree you could look at using the parsers from either sharpdevelop or monodevelop both of which are open source

2840759
getter	setter
and this in turn will create a getter and a setter for the name property of the category object

2840764
xsl-fo	xslt
if you want automate this you could just write a xslt which transforms the svg to a xsl-fo document with the svg embedded

2840766
bsd	aix
generally aix uses the bsd model

2840774
rss	feed
say i want to publish rss feed and i want to generate them in advance rather than on request

2840774
post	get	rss	feed
that subscriber would get get called every time an attribute changed on anything providing iblogpost and i could use it to update all the rss feed that the blog post should appear in

2840789
jobs	cron
if your host lets you cron jobs are the best solution

2840825
put	get
no matter what i put in that width attribute i get the same size width tooltip which is about half of the width that i need

2840845
postgresql	mysql
i recommend postgresql as well especially as an alternative to mysql

2840867
integer	unsigned
x prints an unsigned integer in hexadecimal representation and

2840872
jobs	cron
in the case you can run cron jobs

2840873
gson	jackson
i am surprised these have not been mentioned but instead of using bare-bones rather manual process with json.org s little package gson and jackson are much more convenient to use

2840873
gson	jackson
and at least jackson allows binding to such things too perhaps gson as well not sure jsonnode map list if you really want these instead of real objects

2840879
min	max	min	rank	rank	max
with this structure given the rank of an element even min max you can access delete it in o log n time

2840892
postgresql	mysql
comment the mysql options out - otherwise the generated sql is a mix of postgresql and mysql - which confuses the hell out of psql

2840952
addition	multiplication
it will start the next multiplication while it s doing the addition see

2840964
gif	png
alternatively you can write your own image generating utility at server site in .net php like an http handler and pass text to it and it would return gif png by using the graphics library and rendering image on the fly for you

2840973
free	malloc
1 with c++ you do need to be careful when you use malloc free and new delete side-by-side in the same program

2840973
free	malloc
this is possible and permissible but everything that was allocated with malloc must be free with free and not with delete

2840973
free	malloc
in c++ new delete should be preferred over malloc free where possible

2840979
calloc	malloc
if that s the case perhaps he simply prefers calloc over malloc

2841009
range	minimum
a range of quantities can be used by specifing a minimum value immediately followed by a comma immediately followed by a maximum value

2841011
int	boolean	int	chars
type boolean chars int long etc.

2841022
ant	maven
then once you evolve quickly use a build manager ant maven gradle ...

2841024
superclass	subclassing
every object has an individual row in a superclass table and subclassing objects also have a row in a subclass-specific table that refers to superclass fields by a foreign-key reference

2841024
superclass	subclassing
just lump all superclass and subclassing fields in a single big table and leave them be nulls where their value is not applicable

2841033
put	get
now if you put a inside the partial you can get false but not with renderpartial

2841074
ubuntu	linux
tested on ubuntu 9.10 linux 2.6.31-17 php 5.3.2-0.dotdeb.2 cli

2841083
gif	png

2841110
rsa	dsa
and see what is better for gpg keys - rsa or dsa

2841110
rsa	dsa
also note that dsa can only be used for signing verification whereas rsa can be used for encryption decrypt as well

2841113
vim	emacs
they prefer to use vim and emacs to do their programming

2841113
vim	emacs
if i m not mistaken vim and emacs are just text editors similar to notepad but with syntax highlighting

2841144
vim	emacs
alternatively you can use stand-alone gui designers for example glade for gtk+ and qt designer for qt to design guis and use them from application written in vim or emacs or anything else

2841161
free	malloc
the c way is indeed using malloc free and if you need dynamic memory there s very little else you can do but use them or a few siblings of malloc

2841162
prepare	bindvalue
i think you should use prepare statements which pdo provides and call the bindvalue of

2841240
vertica	infobright	vertica	greenplum	infobright	greenplum
there are special db s for analytics like greenplum aster data vertica netezza infobright and others

2841292
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	stripes	tapestry	wicket	tapestry	struts	tapestry	stripes	struts	wicket	struts	stripes	wicket	stripes
struts 2 jsf tapestry and wicket spring mvc stripes are presentation frameworks

2841301
int	chars
the fact that - is a chars string and convert to array of int would alter the value even though i convert - to integer-equivalent it would change the rest of 12312312

2841304
sin	sqrt
sqrt 543 log 54 sin 5 sin 50

2841350
exponent	modulo
i have a 2048 bits public key asymmetric rsa of which i know the modulo and exponent and need to encrypt a string

2841357
put	get
you could explode the permalink to get the category id and pagination number then use the step above to put it together

2841390
division	multiplication
that s fast enough that i can almost believe a really fast new machine might at least come close to finishing in a minute and yes i checked what happened when i used shifts instead of multiplication division -- it was slower

2841398
free	malloc
it is not secure to use malloc because it s not possible to write a large scale application and ensure every malloc is free in an efficient manner

2841422
zlib	libtiff	zlib	libjpeg	zlib	libpng	libtiff	libpng	libjpeg	libpng	libjpeg	libtiff
i m trying to compile sdl_image 1.2.10 with mingw + msys gcc 4.5.0 on windows i have compiled all the requires libs zlib 1.2.5 libpng 1.4.2 libjpeg 8a libtiff 3.9.2

2841445
min	max
if your need for sorting doesn t extend beyond managing the min and max of your data another structure for you to look at might be an interval heap which has the advantage of o 1 lookup of both min and max if you need to peek at values though deletemin and deletemax are still o log n

2841467
min	max
the benefit of a min-max heap however is that the current min and max objects can be read in o 1 time a search tree requires o log n just to read the min or max object unless you have the cached pointers as i mentioned above

2841480
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if your using a javascript trick to get around ie 6 s lack of png transparency you need to register your script with the scriptmanager to run when the updatepanel refreshes

2841484
width	height
but that only works for the width not for the height

2841494
width	height
labels are inline elements by default so setting the width and height does nothing

2841522
superclass	subclassing
now i want to implement a subclassing of baseclass which is given an instance of a and constructs instances of b and c which it passes to its superclass constructor

2841567

2841636
weka	mallet
java - java folks have classifier4j weka lucene mahout and as adi92 mentioned mallet

2841711
width	height
there is the slight matter of making your width height -sized array into width height 3 to be compatible with your image-generation statements but that s pretty easy to do

2841714
int	double
if x is of type int and y is of type double then x + y will be of type double because those are the rules of the language

2841746
prepare	execute
you can use a parameter placeholder in the sql query and then when you call execute on the prepare statement you supply the dynamic value

2841747
hid	keyboard
scanner is a usb barcode scanner symbol ls2208 setup as hid keyboard emulation

2841755

it seems that the stl and boost don t provide an ordered container that has random access to make use of the ordering for comparing

2841759
width	height
consider a rectangular two-dimensional grid of height h and width w

2841786
mouseup	mousedown
i would be interested in knowing why the those mousedown and mouseup events are there in the first place

2841820
post	get
i would like to use post instead of get for the data that gets passed by this form

2841826
post	get
there is no way to reroute a get action to a post action with mod_rewrite

2841826
post	get
if you re sending a get and trying to change it into a post change your system

2841858
hash	md5
it is usually used to encrypt md5 sha1 hash or keys for other encryptions

2841891
children	parent
however when i try to load the parent and then try to access the children i know gae lazy loads i do not get the child records

2841892
next	except
everything works fine except for the fact that when the user clicks on the next button the pagination panel disappears as well when the page loads to retrieve the data through ajax

2842004
google-chrome	firefox
its not perfect though it only works in google-chrome and firefox it has this weird highlight select behavior that i don t like any takers

2842015
post	get
eventually i ll get it completed and post the updated version

2842017
nunit	mstest
is there an mstest equivalent to nunit s explicit attribute

2842024
width	margin
just remember that margin sets right and left margins therefore margin 2 uses 4 of the wrapper s width

2842060
jquery	simplemodal
simplemodal is a great jquery plugin as it offers many different options one being displaying external content

2842065
innodb	myisam

i need to install ubuntu for execute doctrine orm commands from linux console i faile to do it on windows

2842163
google-chrome	firefox
this is at least true for firefox and google-chrome

2842165
outputstream	inputstream
inside the servlet you just write the obtained inputstream to the outputstream of the response the usual java io way

2842175
int	double
it s perfectly fine for primitive types int double etc.. and immutable classes like strings and java.awt.color

2842200
swt	swing
concerning gui development i think swing has come a long way and swt is native so here java is an option too

2842206
free	malloc
if you malloc and forget to free you have a memory leak what else do you need to know to avoid them

2842210
poe	anyevent
you can try another anyevent event loop like event or poe

2842210
children	parent
the parent spawns are called children and the things the children

the compiler probably writes its error messages to stderr instead of stdout

2842259
apache	nginx
apache nginx with passenger mongrel

2842280
air	flashdevelop
i really like flashdevelop as it comes with project templates for pure as3 apps air apps etc

2842302
springsource	grails
the community is smaller than grails but the project is supported by springsource who is quite active in the community

2842331
implements	extends
update as to manually implements it you may consider to hijack the java.util package since you would like to extends which is declared package private

2842333
ienumerable	ienumerator
rx provides the mathematical dual of ienumerable ienumerator in the form of iobservable iobserver which means you can use all of the linq standard query operators in a declarative way as opposed to using the multithreading apis directly

2842342
pop-up	dialog
edit pop-up in a jquery ui model dialog and renders a new partial view

2842409

2842465
google-chrome	firefox
they display correctly in firefox and google-chrome but not in internet explorer

2842468
put	get
i also realized if i put plot g g-- instead of v i get

2842490
awt	swing
that is don t mix awt and swing components

2842491
postgresql	mysql
for those looking up this answer in the search the problem is that postgresql requires the lat lng columns to be decimal or at least non-string whereas mysql allows using both

2842548

2845233
fadein	fadeout
i have the following html div which does not work using fadein fadeout in ie

2845254
int	chars
also assuming sizeof int 4 your strings must not be greater than 4 chars as you have now and 1 of those needs to be a null termination

2845258
int	chars
you are allocating sizeof int bytes of memory for your strings which is most likely 4 your input strings read by scanf must not be longer than 3 chars

2845275
int	chars
strtol will parse the string stopping at the first chars that cannot be considered part of an int

2845275
int	chars
my reasoning is that if p is not set to the end of the string the 0 chars then there is a non-integer chars in the string s meaning s is not a correct int

2845275
strtol	strtod
see too the description of strtol s sister functions strtod strtoul etc.

2845663
irrlicht	ogre3d
there is also some rendering engines that you can use that will do a lot of nice things for you like ogre3d and irrlicht but if you cant understand the principles behind them like shadows illumination... i recomend you to try in opengl first learn it and then use some engine to get the work done for you

2845811
int	chars
while vec3i is for 3 channels int and vec3b is for 3 channels unsigned chars

2845828
mouseout	mouseleave
just switching your events to mouseleave instead of mouseout and mousenter instead of hover will fix the issue for your markup like this

2845828
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover executes on mouseenter and mouseleave the first and second function you provide respectively so it s calling the fadein already overlapping a bit already

2845828
mouseout	mouseenter
the mouseout however fires even when entering a child mouseenter which .hover uses won t

2845833
serializable	deserialization
java serializable deserialization has significant performance overheads

2845852
ilist	iqueryable
but how would i get the error messages as a ilist or iqueryable

2845954
g++	gcc
are you sure that you re using g++ rather than gcc

2845971
coalesce	isnull
if that is actually the case then fine use coalesce instead of isnull and convert nulls to zeroes

2845972
terminate	timeout
for cases in which there s a risk of deadlock safethread terminate can accept a timeout parameter

2845972
terminate	timeout
if the timeout expires it calls thread terminate thus killing intrusively the thread

nsurl	nsstring
i have a bunch of files either nsstring s or nsurl s it doesn t matter

2845997
button	checkbox
what would be the most effective way of traversing the table and check if at least one checkbox is selected to enable a delete button

post	put	post	get	put	get
and yes because design documents are really just documents with special powers you can run you get post put delete methods on them

2846049
width	margin
as if that s not enough you can also set printer margins tab size etc in where i set the displayed tab width to 4 and print margin column to 120 or more

2846108
executable	upx
you could consider using an executable packer like upx this will reduce the executable size but will have an impact on performance

2846152
automake	autotools
while the gnu autotools automake autoconf etc. have traditionally been used there are a lot of problems with these tools and they have an incredibly steep learning curve

2846184
hide	show
i may even combine the show and hide functions using settimeout in the show function to trigger the hide function since i don t expect to use a show without a hide

2846203
google-chrome	safari
my problem lies in the fact that these divs either aren t being generated or just don t show up in ie safari and google-chrome

2846203
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera they do work

2846206
n-gram	words
if i decided that i wanted to take the 5 or 6 preceding words into account when predicting the next words then i would need 5-6 tables and an exponentially increase in space per n-gram

2846218
getter	setter
if i use objc_setassociatedobject objc_getassociatedobject inside a category implementation to store a simulated instance variable in a setter method how would i access the key in the getter method since any variables declared in the setter method would be outside the scope of the getter method

2846218
getter	setter
edit to clarify if i were to use the following pattern where should i declare string_key so that i could use it in both the setter and the getter method

2846219
hash	md5
a second optimisation would be to use an md5 crc32 or similar hash of the phrase as the key

2846271
pull	push
you can use xmlreader which uses a pull method to read the xml similar to sax s push method but a little easier to code against

2846286
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using gcc on mac and vc++ 2008 on windows i managed to get it running on safari and firefox on mac os x and firefox and google-chrome on windows but not on google-chrome on mac os x

getter	setter
for example if you were to create a getter and setter function for assigning the object like

2846414
google-chrome	firefox
modern browsers are able to tell you if there is an error in your scripts and point out the line the problem occurs on firefox and google-chrome are good at this

2846418

2846501
atoi	atof
in these days i m playing with the c functions of atol atof and atoi from a blog post i find a tutorial and applied

2846501
atoi	atof
there is atof which returns the float value of the string and atoi which returns integer value

2846520
atof	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	strtod
you can use strtol and strtod which are far superior than atol and atof because they allow you to test whether the conversion succeeded

2846545
int	double
now runtime i know key1 is int and key2 is double

2846551
width	height
then from there you would want to wrap your text within and possibly have it scroll or however you want to handle it by checking the text height and width to find where to wrap the text.

2846562
g++	gcc
i m using gcc g++ so adding the -mp option when generating dependencies works great for me until i get to the link stage with my .a file.

2846570
int	double
what you can do is the use the constructors for double and int that take string arguements

2846572
int	double
you can t linguistically cast a string a reference type to an int or a double a primitive numeric type

2846572
int	double
it s possible that you may never need to convert from string to int double in the first place or at least do it before you put them into the map

2846574
atoi	atof
that s not what the atol atoi and atof functions are for - they re for converting the subset of strings that represent numbers in base 10 into the corresponding long int or float value if possible

2846574
int	chars
note that if you want to do this with strings of arbitrary length you ll need to work with a big int library like gmp or openssl s bignum - the longest type in standard c long long cannot be mapped one-to-one onto the set of c strings that include strings longer than 8 chars because its guaranteed range includes only 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 unique values

2846591
komodo	notepad++
i tried notepad++ pyscript and komodo edit but all of these requires a hotkey to invoke the code completion dialog

2846609
oursql	mysql-python
install the mysql-python module or the oursql module along with the django-oursql connector

2846691
integer	unsigned
if the dw prefix in dwindex is accurate then it sounds like a dword which is a 32-bit unsigned integer

2846691
integer	unsigned
it seems unlikely that your c++ program requires a signed integer on a 32-bit platform and an unsigned one on a 64-bit one though not impossible of course

2846697
put	get
the main thread starts all subthreads does a get on the queue to wait until one of them has done a put then emits the results and terminates which takes down any subthreads that might still be running since they re daemon threads

2846724
rss	feed
i normally view rss feed in google reader

2846726
onchange	onblur
because you are adding the test function to onkeypress so every key press onchange so every time it changes and onblur whenever you move to another field

2846737
hash	salt
the hash is the same only if you have the same salt value

2846765
inherited	properties
not sure about the event but there is a designmode bool properties on a windows form probably inherited from control that returns true if the form is open in the designer

2846789
public	protected
that way c can use b s public methods but not get access to the protected ones

2846841
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
the nsinvocationoperation class is a concrete subclass of nsoperation that implements a non-concurrent operation

2846854
public	protected
since this will make it it public within the first assembly you might want to add protected to enforce encapsulation

2846892
versioning	upgrade
but the rubygems developers don t make their bugfixes available separately the only way to get a bugfix is to upgrade to a new versioning with potentially different behavior

2846892
ubuntu	debian
either use rubygems for everything in which case it is best to install rubygems from source instead of using the debian package or use apt for everything in which case you might be interested in debgem a service by the phusion guys makers of ruby enterprise edition and phusion passenger which provides debian and ubuntu packages for pretty much all gems

2846935
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
problem login is not working in firefox and google-chrome but it does in safari

2846935
google-chrome	firefox
the strange thing is that for 3 people with three different systems firefox and google-chrome don t work

2846962
mouse	keyboard
but this works perfect on mouse click but client want that if user navigate the by keyboard arrow keys then in same should be happen

2846990
cout	cin
how do i use jquery to check cin checkin date not past cout checkout date

2846990
cout	cin
which means cout date cannot earlier then cin date

2846999
min	max
if it is the datepicker from jquery ui you can give it min and max date as arguments like this

2847032
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve created a tiny test case that exhibits the same problem a custom root uiviewcontroller which creates and displays a uitabbarcontroller programmatically which has two tabs 1 plain uiviewcontroller and 2 uinavigationcontroller created programmatically with a single plain uiviewcontroller content view

2847035
ubuntu	linux
first off i m on ubuntu linux if that matters

2847099
google-chrome	safari
i have just learned how to use the sqlite database for local storage in a webkit web browser google-chrome or apple safari using the javascript api

2847100
put	get
do notice i put the filltext loader inside the main function you should move this outside so it doesn t get repeatedly called if you use this code

2847112
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i m trying to use a qtreeview for the first time with qabstractitemmodel and instantly have a problem

google-chrome	firefox
same results in firefox ie6 and google-chrome

2847170
google-chrome	safari
but i get blank pages in google-chrome safari

any ideas why google-chrome safari don t like this

2847170
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was having issues with loading it not because of my document.write yes i know its nasty but because skype was hogging port 80 but only for safari and google-chrome because i had been using firefox ie before skype started

2847176
client-side	server-side
this is a question regarding rendering of javascript code which will be executed on the client-side from server-side code

2847176
client-side	server-side
this is prescribing the client-side onclick event on the server-side

2847176
client-side	server-side
what server-side sees as an event is not necessarily the same process on the client-side

2847176
client-side	server-side
what happens on client-side and on server-side during an event could be completely irrelevant and decoupled

2847176
client-side	server-side
separation of concern is it easier if client-side logic is separated to server-side logic

2847190
mouseover	mouseout
the javascript to handle the mouseover and mouseout events

2847270
post	get
anything that deletes or updates content should be done on a post not get request

2847271
put	get
i am not sure whether this will put the line at the place you want but the idea is to get the editpoint and then use it to insert the line

2847335
qtcore	qtgui
you need to check you include directories and add path_to_qt_headers qtcore path_to_qt_headers qtgui and directories for other modules you are using

2847392
hash	salt
you should hash and salt your passwords but that s not exactly encryption.

2847425
put	get
on the production server - when you deploy your application if your server does not have asp.net ajax 1.0 extensions installed you will need to put the systen.web.exntesions.dll in your dll which you can easily get it from

2847434
post	get
read about get and post in here and here

2847434
post	get
if you want to use javascript i suggest you to use framework like jquery and any and post or get the data using ajax way it s better

2847439
width	height
for so many time i have encountered problems with managing image having abnormally long height or width

2847439
width	height
if i fixed their width and if the height of the image is very long then also it will mess up the overall website

2847439
width	height
if i fixed their height and if the width of the image is very long then also it will mess up the overall website

2847439
width	height
let say user decides to upload image 1 height 32 width

2847456
width	height
if i fixed their width and if the height of the image is very long then also it will mess up the overall website

2847456
width	height
if i fixed their height and if the width of the image is very long then also it will mess up the overall website

2847456
width	height
calculate the x-y ratio of the image compare it to the x-y ratio of the space you want to put it in use that to make a decision about scaling it while maintaining aspect ratio to the width of the space or the height of the space

2847462
width	height
so why don t you use some image library to scale the image on either height or width and keep ratio

2847463
portrait	landscape
what you have is simply a standard table displayed in portrait orientation but your are holding the phone in landscape mode

2847466
implements	extends
clickablelistadapter extends baseadapter and implements the necessary methods

2847472
put	get
you ll want to get a build that works with the oldest version of tcl you re supporting simply compiling in stubbed mode â i think that s default anyway â against the oldest tcl version you want to support should be fine and then put that in a directory as a full install of the package that you have on your code s auto_path

2847490
int	chars
the only place where it can change the meaning of the code is when auto was used together with the implicit int rule if not type is specified - it s an int in which case the second line in my example used to have c2 of type int and now it s of type chars

2847495
folder	directory
so by altering the shadow copied directory list you can load from any folder without locking your assemblies

2847502

2847598
ftp	telnet
when the ftp is in the locked state i am still able to telnet the ftp service but login do not work

2847643
width	height
instead you should resize the width to 1000 and the height to 1000 32

2847763
textview	imageview
the rows themselves exist out of an icon and a text thus an imageview and a textview

2847763
textview	imageview
i have seen examples extending a cursoradapter but again i don t have a cursor i don t want to do calls to a db i want to re-utilize my array with data and obviously the arrayadapter itself so that the data will be represented decently on screen i.e with my imageview and textview layout

2847818
nunit	mstest
in mstest and nunit

udp	tcp
use udp not tcp

2847980
min	max
also i don t want to iterate over the image data so finding the min max and then histogram stretching to 0..255 isnt an option for me the display must be as efficient as possible

2848008
google-chrome	firefox
open a site address using either google-chrome or firefox any browser

2848059
client-side	server-side
you re trying to assign a client-side method to the ontextchanged event which is a server-side event

2848083
width	height
also set the wrapper div width height and center it also set the img dimensions

2848111
min	max
just try to use collections for min max if there is no restriction in your homework

2848111
min	max
otherwise a min max should look like this

2848113
jython	pypy
there is jython ironpython pypy and so on and unless there is an explicit statement in the python specification somewhere that repr and str is the same for integer objects i wouldn t to rely on that behaviour

2848120
qmainwindow	qdialog
it may be some dedicated handler object or an existing object like your qdialog qmainwindow

2848120
onfocus	onblur
javascript to add focus change handlers should traverse all text elements and add onfocus and onblur handlers

2848120
onfocus	onblur
unfortunately onblur ad onfocus do not bubble

2848178
post	get
better to make it so that ratings are only ever altered in response to a post rather than a get

2848239
websphere	ibm
we are dealing with ibm websphere message queue software

2848283
hide	show
parent control is a container for child control and child control s property should be updated by data binding from parent control in order to show hide some check box inside child control

2848293
keydown	keyup
this is quite anoying and doesn t happen if you click on the dropdownlist and uses keyup or keydown or if you uses another browser than ie

2848293
keydown	keyup
is it possibel to fix this so you can use keyup and keydown without causing a postback and first on the enter-key creates the postback as it does if you click on the dropdownlist and not label

2848294
mouseleave	mouseenter
the reason what you currently have doesn t work is that it binds the event handler to the elements the elements only had to match the selector you used when you found them for binding once that happens the .hover mouseenter and mouseleave event handlers are bound on that element

2848319
background-image	background-position
have you tried using more specific properties such as background-image and background-position

2848438
pascal	delphi

2848442
equals	gethashcode
note i have cleaned up the equals and gethashcode methods to remove some fields - the problem persists after this

2848446
children	parent
no - that would somewhat violate polymorphism anything the parent can do the children should be able to do

2848493

can t change visibility of methods private public protected

2848545
cvs	svn

2848742
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
then i want to run maven from within my ant script by maven ant tasks which should replace the pre-defined properties in my pom.xml with the properties of the properties-file

2848754
webkit	gecko
only thing i can think of is the difference between msie and gecko webkit is that empty or hidden divs take up space in msie i think

2848792
ant	maven
the mvn ant task page discusses using a macro to invoke the maven commandline

2848792
ant	maven
to do this in maven alone use the exec plugin to launch maven passing the command parameters in the same way as done using the ant java task

2848815
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have used ie and firefox does it not work with some of the other browsers google-chrome or safari

generally i would target and test ie 8 7 firefox and safari or google-chrome

2848853

you might want to throw in opera as well though my experience has been that if you get firefox you generally have already gotten it to work for opera

2848888
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction is roughly 3 times as slow as for normal int s

2848888
division	multiplication
multiplication and division is a lot slower over an order of magnitude

replace all those new ed stringbuffers with chars arrays that are allocated in the constructor and never again using int indices to keep track of what s in them

2849042
hide	show
and they are linked correctly in ib - but how do i show hide these windows

2849064
post	get
so to answer your question no you can t directly get the javascript to call a php server-side function but you can post to a php page which will then in turn carry out whatever function you like

2849075
post	get
is it possible to get information about post field order in asp.net

2849093
versioning	upgrade
there is a side-effect to this problem which is that there seems to be no way to upgrade the versioning of jbosscache within jboss appserver due to those same shared low-level libraries

2849131
fpdf	fpdi
yes fpdf + fpdi worked for me

2849131
fpdf	fpdi
basically you create your pdf template first then load it into the new fpdi object and use fpdf functions to draw over the template - much like photoshop layers work

2849137

2849147
children	parent
- or how can the children wait for parent signal to start doing some work

2849148
hide	show
i know how to show and hide elements using jquery and css and have figured out i can count the divs using

2849180
hide	show
use the .addclass and .removeclass - just put a class on the first page div that show and all the others that hide and swap them hiding one with current visibility by adding the hide class and removing the show class and the inverse for the new page you wish to show by adding removing css classes

2849187
serializable	deserialization
this latter method might add some overhead on the serializable side however and you will also need to convert these dicts to sets upon deserialization either by subclassing json.jsondecoder or doing it yourself in an extra step

2849211
google-chrome	firefox
i tried various browsers google-chrome firefox ie but to no avail

2849233
execvp	fork
so your code acts as if fork and execvp were declared thus

2849334
implements	extends
i do that by extends printable and implements the method public int print graphics g pageformat pf int page

2849361
int	chars
you can apply some validation such as field can t be blank or minimum chars required should be 6 or value should be valid int on client side but how do you validate username should be unique etc on client side

2849362
pop-up	dialog
it has a modal property if set to true will grey out the underlying web page and make the dialog a modal pop-up

i have some jquery code contributed by another member of the stack overflow community - it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but errors and wont work in ie 7

2849437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this happens in ie6 7 8 as well as firefox safari and google-chrome which leads me to believe the problem is peculiar to how cufon has been implemented on this site

2849468
maven	pom.xml
ok i fixed my problem by forcing maven to put the hbm.xml files into the target classes package name folder so at the end my pom.xml looks like this

2849509
put	get
you will need to override hashcode and equals on your domain classes that are put in the set as well to make sure that the behavior you want actually what you get

2849555
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox loading the page twice

2849589
serializable	deserialization
it provides serializable deserialization with corba marshalling see classes ace_inputcdr and ace_outputcdr

2849631
jquery	curvycorners
you could put jquery curvycorners to use to do it all out of the box instead

2849634
put	get
deployment of said tons of dlls can get problematic i sometimes use ilmerge to alleviate this and the above problems but let s put that aside for now

2849650
cpu	processors
if the cpu usage history is maxed out on one graph you have underutilized processors and could consider threading

2849661
cvs	svn
in other case you could download your sources on free like sourceforge www svn cvs server and used them with mac windows linux

2849671
hide	show
worth noting that a message is show for the free download version when the file manager is displayed a license key is required to hide the message however the message is not really intrusive no popups or anything

hindi	french
i have installed the french fonts and hindi fonts for ubuntu

2849827
hindi	french
i then made a sample application and added appropriate translations in hindi and french

2849866
mef	prism
the only thing you won t get by using exclusively mef is the pub sub communication technology in prism called eventaggregator but this can be easily substituted by using eventaggregator itself it is standalone.

2849866
mef	prism
there are also quite a few people using a mix of mef and prism so you might check that out as well

2849932
bazaar	git
another issue with logs in files is that they only make sense for linear working - once you re developing with multiple branches in the way that distributed source tools like git mercurial bazaar encourage having the log in the source file itself only serves to create merge conflicts almost all of the time

2849936
int	chars
you can consider using chars instead of int

2850030
submit	submission
when you click the submit button the form will be sent to that url so in the case of an order submission you would post the page back to orderpage.aspx

i just took another look at tablelayout for an entirely different purpose and stumbled upon setcolumnshrinkable int columnindex boolean isshrinkable which should have helped me out on my former issue

2850111
versioning	upgrade
the free versioning is sufficient for most needs and if you re willing to upgrade to the paid versioning 35 for a single install 97 for infinite you get reporting and a number of additional fields

2850147
pull	push
if you only want to push pull from the local storage use the adb pull and push commands to get the files from the phone onto your computer and then mess with them locally

2850149
apache	nginx
installing passenger either with apache or with nginx is by far less work than finding the answer to this issue

2850154
width	height
if you don t have exif data and your images are scanned faxed documents then i think you re only solution is to check the height and width of the image and rotate based on that

2850154
width	height
documents are most likely to be in portrait format taller than they are wide so if the height is greater than the width then do don t have to do anything

2850154
width	height
if the height is less than the width then rotate through 90 degrees

2850172
ant	maven
there is always the possibility to run ant inside maven

2850172
ant	maven
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

2850172
ant	maven
so if you need the power of ant inside maven use the maven antrun plugin

2850291
ant	maven
i would go with either an integrated ant solution using maven-antrun-plugin or a custom java class using the maven exec plugin here

fast-forward	merge
the --no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward

2850413
fast-forward	merge
when set to only only such fast-forward merge are allowed equivalent to giving the --ff-only option from the command line

2850475
hide	show
if you can integrate some ajax-request to load the second page and parse it but if that s not an option i d say you ll have to load all pages that you want to extract information from at the same time hide the bits you don t want to show in hidden divs

i can t upgrade syncfusion right now so i need to tell asp.net to use versioning 1.0.61025.0 of the assembly

2850538
boost	stl
it s unfortunate that you don t have boost however if your stl implementation has the extensions then you can compose mem_fun_ref and select2nd to create a single functor suitable for use with for_each

2850541
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
tutorial for iphone app with uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

2850569
int	double
for example converting a double to an int will lose some precision so it is an explicit cast

2850590
hide	show
animations show hide for example require less code in jquery than yui

2850610
multiplying	multiplication
my problem that i encountered is that when i stored 2 or more midfielders as the key even the cout data shows different but when i do a multiplication on the 2nd - second value it adds up the first - second value and multiplying with it

2850628
folder	directory
if the resources are not setup in the child directory as an application in iis it should appear as a normal folder

2850628
folder	directory
if you setup 2 websites on iis and map the physical folder to your images on both as virtual directory you should have access to them as normal folder when you open either in visual studio

2850671
filesystems	ntfs
everything i read said it was designed for ms office but that it should work with any file as long as the filesystems is ntfs at least that s my understanding

2850682
postgresql	mysql
i have used oracle postgresql and mysql with asp.net in addition to sql server

2850700
submit	submission
i know that i can do this by submission forms and reloading the page every time they press one of these buttons but i would rather use javascript and not have to submit a form but i am having troubles getting it to work

2850706
uiview	subviews
using a uiscrollview and then adding uiview subviews

2850717
put	get
then from your other classes activities you can instantiate this db access class to get data or put data

2850731
wxruby	fxruby	wxruby	shoes	shoes	fxruby
i ve explored the options of monkeybars wxruby fxruby shoes etc

2850733
uiview	subviews
to achieve smooth switching i am using two movieplayerviewcontrollers each a subviews of uiview object in appcontroller

2850733
uiview	subviews
following is the movieplayerviewcontroller init code -- basically it allocs and inits two movieplayerviewcontroller objects and adds them as subviews to the default and alternate uiview objects from appcontroller

2850734
subclass	abstract-class
when stuff like that happens all the sudden the caller is tightly coupled to the concrete subclass and not just the interface where interface can mean a java interface abstract-class or even some other non-final class

2850768
post	put	post	get	put	get
all of the standard http methods post get put delete are supported by the idea of rest

2850781
rss	feed
the data for the xml file is gathered from several different rss feed

2850822
zlib	libpng
however i m also linking statically against several libs libpng zlib jpeglib vorbisfile libogg

2850822
zlib	libpng
so my question is there a convenient way to build libpng zlib jpeglib vorbisfile libogg etc

2850825
mxmlc	compc
all of the mxmlc and compc commands in the makefile now have -link-report generating an appropriately-named .xml file in the .deps directory

2850852
getter	setter
you can also define getter and setter methods that get called whenever you try to modify an object s property

2850901
firefox3.6	google-chrome
the following code works as expected in ie8 and safari4 but not in firefox3.6 and google-chrome

2850901
google-chrome	firefox
seems that firefox and google-chrome do not support cross-domain ajax by default right

2850901
google-chrome	firefox
is there any easy way to turn on cross-domain ajax in firefox and google-chrome

2850928
google-chrome	firefox
i have an html test client on that server which works fine using ie firefox google-chrome

2850928
google-chrome	firefox
if i copy the same html to my workstation or deploy to my webserver it works with firefox google-chrome but in ie i m getting two javascript errors

2850953
post	get
rob ashton s post on selecting master pages at runtime should get you started

2850960
factors	matrix
if you are dealing with jpeg image compression image blocks + dct + quantization + huffman coding the compressor has freedom to use its own quatization matrix - or rather a family of matrix one for each quality factors

2850960
factors	matrix
i believe the standard suggests some typical matrix eg including a scaling factors for different qualities

2850969
post	get
register globals basically allows a user to create a global variable simply by passing in a parameter to a get or post

2850988
fflush	gets
i have to fflush the session before my doc object gets an id

2851041
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox google-chrome opera

2851056
jar	war
that usually implies that it s packed inside your jar or war if it is a web-app

2851060
post	get
i get no javascript errors and no serverside errors other then no post information at all

2851071
spaces	delimiter
it looks like the text returned is just a spaces delimiter hash which is the java version of dictionary

2851111
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie8 firefox google-chrome

2851135
width	height
how about making height width and hw signed ints

2851154
width	height
depending on the height and width of your textboxes your mileage may vary

2851191
integer	unsigned
when you mix a signed and an unsigned integer in a sub- expression the unsigned arithmetic wins the calculations are performed in unsigned domain

2851191
integer	unsigned
in fact in practice most or at least half of integer variables in c c++ the program should have unsigned types

2851216
client-side	server-side
ssl in asynchronous mode etc for both client-side and server-side

2851226
min	max
now cos ang-omega is a very nicely behaved function in terms of monotonicity and you only need to consider it in the interval min ang1 ang2 max ang1 ang2

2851238
stateless	stateful
generally speaking stateless web applications will have less overhead per thread than stateful ones

2851248
uilabel	uitextview
now i had to go to uitextview because uilabel is not aligning text vertically to the top

2851273
ssms	sqlcmd
another solution is to use sqlcmd variables which ssms recognizes when properly configured

2851333
folder	directory
i was using the template name as declared in the xml file instead of using the directory in the template folder templates directoryname

2851365
rss	feed
i m trying to parse a rss feed that looks like this for the attribute date

2851367
stdout	stderr
the 2 1 part will redirect stderr to stdout output which would normally be dropped

2851386
codeigniter	cakephp
and since mvc such as cakephp and codeigniter is all classes that can t be good

2851449
implements	extends
i cannot extends thread nor can i implements runnable since testcase already has a method void run

2851449
implements	extends
i am extends seleniumtestcase and trying to make it implements runnable

2851455
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are ides--integrated development environments which means they assemble a variety of programs related to writing programs into one place

2851494
ubuntu	linux
ideally it d be like the ubuntu server installer or the arch linux installer - a ncurses

2851498
ironruby	ironpython
out of the box visual studio doesn t contain ironpython or ironruby

2851498
cpython	ironpython
finally you can use the ironpython tools mentioned above to edit your code and use cpython to run it - you don t get debugger support but most everything else should work just fine

2851529
implements	extends
what i m wondering is can you create an abstract class because getruleviolations needs to be implements separately and extends a partial class

2851542
subtract	add
iterate through each character in your string until you hit the end and based off of what the character is and which range it s in 0 to 9 a to f a to f you ll need to subtract the value of the bottom character in it s range and add any appropriate amount

2851542
subtract	add
if you see an a you ll need to subtract off a and add 0x0a

2851597
subtraction	add
normally subtraction is implemented as a negate then add

2851602
rss	feed
2 subscribe rss feed for this article

2851647
post	get
i read the other post here on outlineviews and dnd but i can t get my program to work

2851680
rss	feed
i saw this article pop-up in my msdn rss feed and after reading through it and the sourced article here i began to wonder about the solution

2851682
stdout	stderr
that will cause the shell to spit out a command not found error on stderr and no output on stdout which you redirect to a file and ends up with 0 length

2851695
vb.net	vb6
i ve created a mapi wrapper in vb6 and compiled it as an activex.exe so i can use it in my vb.net project

2851696
width	height
the rectangle class has the attributes height width and x y

2851696
width	height
the x and y values are encapsulated in a point object and the height and width are encapsulated in a dimension object the rectangle being a composite of a point its top-left location and a dimension width and height

2851696
width	height
i though it would be pretty simple on the basis of having the rectangles x y width and height values to define the css rect attribute in terms of top right bottom left but i ve become hopelessly confused- i ve been googling for a while and i can t seem to find any documentation as to what the trbl values actually are or what they represent

2851696
width	height
for example should i be thinking in terms of co-ordinates in which case surely i can describe the rectangle as a css rect using the rectangles x position for top x position + width for right the rectangles height + y for bottom and its y position for left.

2851696
width	height
i define a rectangle using x y width and height

2851696
width	height
iii change x y width or height and recalculate in terms of trbl and goto ii

2851702
setinterval	settimeout
it s not a solution but if you really want to just add-on to the existing function you ll most likely use setinterval or settimeout to call a modified version of your existing function every x seconds

2851723
versioning	upgrade
now that the full versioning is out we ve upgrade to flash builder 4 premium and i no longer see this problem

2851725
spaces	delimiter
i used this one and applied the first commenter s edit to allow for the spaces character as a delimiter

2851759
pop-up	dialog
i am using both jquery ui dialog and jquery ui autocomplete both have the same erroneous behavior when they pop-up the position is always 0 0

2851782
put	get
here they go get the data and put it in a global variable and then use whileprintingrecords to either display the data or in your case use it in the suppress formula

2851809
ubuntu	linux
ok i m creating an app in monodevelop for ubuntu linux but the compiled file is always a windows exe i ve set it to compile as a linux binary but i m confused can anyone shed any light on how to get a proper linux way of opening the program

2851812
rss	feed
you could find many examples of self-made python blogs on google appengine that generate rss 2.0 feed using pyrss2gen

2851860
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i can usee firebug in google-chrome i can use the css console

2851935
ant	maven
as an alternative you can use ant or maven script to copy jars where you want

2851937
portrait	landscape
every subsequent launch behaves as i would expect - that is there are calls to shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation made both with landscape and portrait arguments

2851964
bash	zsh
integrating the output into the prompt is still shell specific escape or quote the for both bash and zsh and set prompt_subst for zsh

2851966
stdout	stderr
use the -u command line switch to force python 2 to treat stdin stdout and stderr as binary unbuffered streams

2851976
antivirus	norton
this was discovered when a user reported to me that they were getting a notice from their norton antivirus saying http suspicious executable image download. this warning was referencing the user s avatar image

2851976
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
i use php to upload the image files and i check if the file being uploaded is a png jpg bmp or gif

2851980
int	double
if at all possible i d advise changing the double you re using as a key to some int type instead

2852100
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
it seems like maybe the answer is to use svcutil.exe instead of wsdl.exe

2852113
mspec	mstest	mstest	typemock	typemock	mspec
not any one framework we ve hit on mspec nuint mstest rhinomocks typemock etc -- we re just talking generally

2852141
width	height
it should autocrop to the current width height of the graphic symbol if you have the symbol selected

2852143
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow can have uiview they can have uiview by themselves

2852151
pop-up	dialog
because jquery dialog copies your pop-up -div inside its own containing div the checkboxes loose the function you bound to the click-event

2852204
postgresql	mysql
the information_schema database is part of the ansi 2003 specification so you could use that across any db vendor that supports it mysql postgresql sqlite mssql 2k5+

2852207
equals	gethashcode
second you probably shouldn t use vals.gethashcode in your gethashcode override on the comparer as this will lead you to getting different hash codes for objects that would evaluate to true for your equals override

2852237
hide	show
or try to use setonscrolllistener to check scroll status and hide show the bars

2852248
ant	maven
now when i do my ant build it appears that it is getting its list of jars to include in the final build from maven

2852277
bottle	flask
you should probably check out flask or bottle two nice python microframeworks

2852290
post	get
turns out they way i was calling .load was causing it to do a post instead of a get which meant it bypassed the cache

2852302
public	protected
i would say it does not matter what type of a method it is public private protected you take proper precautions whenever that is needed without looking at the visibility keyword

2852314
vim	emacs
i m currently trying emacs coming from vim

2852327
junit	testng
on top of that i believe many .net unit test frameworks implement the same or similar features to their java counterparts junit and testng which support parametrized tests

2852332
children	parent
as an example i want this parent item page to redirect to it s children page

2852336
setinterval	settimeout
if so just use setinterval instead of settimeout

2852362
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this avoids problems when going from case-sensitive to case-insensitive filesystems and vice versa

2852389
terminate	timeout
it s likely hanging on which blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join method is called terminate â either normally or through an unhandled exception â or until the optional timeout occurs

2852405
udp	tcp
you should be able to send tcp or udp traffic out with your data to each of your clients particularly if bandwidth needs are small

2852457
mouseup	mousedown
you ll probably want to add an addition check that the time between the mousedown and mouseup is less than 500 milliseconds say and that the mouse hasn t moved more than a pixel or two between the events

2852468
width	height
then the data would start with a couple of well-defined structures namely this and this specifying the colour depth number of bits per pixel more or less the number of colours the width the height and the compression of the bitmap

2852472
macbook	bootcamp
i ve tested this on other hardware upgraded my gma x3100 drivers using a macbook with bootcamp to the latest ones but i can t reproduce it on any other machine and i m at a loss about what s wrong here

2852480
put	get
one thing nice about the pics is that many of them come in dip packages so you can put them on a plastic breadboard and get started with them right away

2852480
i2c	spi
for example digikey sells the pic24fj16ga002 16k flash 4k ram i2c spi uart and parallel port in a 28-pin dip package for 3.64

2852481
icefaces	openfaces
ajax support many 3rd-party libraries myfaces icefaces openfaces anotherprefixfaces... have strong ajax support and it works pretty well

2852496
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
of course as would be expected everything looks fine in firefox safari opera and chrome.

2852513
children	parent
for parent the parentid is null and for children the parentid is the objectid of the parent

2852514
ssl	https
follow the ssl configuration how-to on how to setup https

2852551
width	height
2 implement two sliders one horizontal for partâ s width and one vertical for partâ s height

2852554
mouseleave	mouseenter
one when you mouseenter the other when you mouseleave

2852567
ssl	https
if you ll set up the ssl on tomcat and send your data over https then the encryption will be done for you

2852601
post	get
if i post the data as such i get errors such as

2852614
profiler	yourkit
i used a java profiler yourkit and i can see my running serversocket listen thread and it never sleeps and it s always running

2852660
implements	extends
or the example shows you how to easily extends rowtablemodel by implements a couple of methods

2852664
jsf	wicket
i would advise you to try wicket it is very easy to learn much easier than jsf and it let s you re-use many existing components as well

2852680
setinterval	clearinterval
finally add buttons that call setinterval and clearinterval as needed as in toggleslideshow

2852697
min	max
the basis of levels is that you adjust the max min and midpoints of the brightness levels

2852699
width	height
slide creates a placeholder the size of your object and then slides into the frame of view while blind adjusts the height or width of your element until it expands to the correct size while overflow is set to hidden

2852770
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox 3.6.3 ie7 google-chrome 4.1.249.1064 all on windows and it seems ok but i see now when i was just about to hit post your answer this relies on the browser s native support for queryselectorall - see this jquery forum post focus selector filter

2852791
hide	show
the first is a simple js function to hide show divs and change the active state of a tab

2852791
hide	show
this is the js that show hide divs and changes the active state on some tabs

2852840
fseek	fread	fseek	ftell	ftell	fread
ftell fseek and fread all operate on bytes not on characters

2852926
rss	feed
for #2 you will have to create an rss feed thru a generic handler .ashx file and link the icon to it

2852926
rss	feed
or you can use a free service such as addthis.com which allows your users to post your article to twitter facebook google rss feed and other mediums

2852951
quicksort	heapsort
i think the fastest solution can be a heapsort or quicksort and after go through the array and find the duplicates

2853038
prepare	execute
so instead of using a deadly execute i can use a safer prepare statement to insert an id into my queue table which the background script will catch in the next 30 seconds

2853057
width	height
if the width height all is well

2853057
width	height
however if height width then the 3d mesh is sized too small

2853057
width	height
the only thing that fixed this was if height width change the updirection on the perspective camera from 0 1 0 to 1 0 0 and apply a 90 rotate transform

2853085
pop-up	dialog
essentially if you want to pop-up a dialog you can do it with a javascript function on the client side the aspx pages code behind is behind executed on the server which means visually you can t reall do much at all unless you want your host to see it and noone else

2853158
min	max
is there a simpler way retrieve the max and min value of a array

2853160
button	checkbox
this works great for selects radio button and checkbox

2853169
width	height
note that you don t need to set width auto or height auto this is implied

2853299
rss	feed
if the blog you are interested in has an rss feed you can connect to this and use xslt to transform this to html and use css to style that

2853305
width	height
in your case multiplying the ratio by height width without changing the fov should suffice

2853363
client-side	server-side
i d rather do the validation client-side as there s quite a bit of server-side validation that happens to deal with writing form values to a database

2853389
inherited	subclassing
inherited can change the behavior of a method in a subclassing

2853428
hide	show
hide details don t show this message again check for solutions online run program cancel

2853431
cout	cin
overloading cin cout

2853432
google-chrome	safari
in ie google-chrome safari etc. the with of the flash element is a consistent 412px

2853432
width	height
setting a width in the css for the .sifr-flash element causes it to remain the proper 412px wide but the text doesn t wrap at all--it just cuts off at the right edge and the height of the flash element remains one line high

2853487
getter	setter
i think it should be possible to create an annotation processor to synthesize a builder for an immutable class much like project lombok does with setter and getter

2853488
folder	directory
my web application requires functionality where end users can upload content that can be later downloaded or viewed by others the problem with current scheme is if i create such folder as part of your web project under webapps every time i do deploy your web application .war the content of that directory will be lost or overridden

2853504
getter	setter
because you used the automatic getter setter a hidden backing field is used for the property ic

2853568
uiview	calayer
i know this is possible with uiview which makes flipping views easy but is it possible for calayer

2853584
int	double
one bit of trickiness there is the data binding engine is actually internally converting between double and int for you as slider.value is a double

2853602
hide	show
this works fine in windowsxp my window is underneath all windows and when i press the show desktop option the window show and all other normal windows are hide

2853663
post	put
simply put i wouldn t manage this in the fashion demonstrated by your original post

2853688
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
since cross-platform differences in browsers using the same engine google-chrome safari should be neglible you could get away with virtualizing 3 ie6 ie7 ie8 and adding safari google-chrome firefox and opera versions to one of those virtal machines

2853724
client-side	server-side
ideally i d like to do this server-side php but recognize that actual character width stuff is far more likely to be feasible client-side js jquery

2853739
dictionary	map
passing keyword arguments into dictionary though it works beautifully in a lot of scenarios can only initialize a map if the keys are valid python identifiers

2853743
google-chrome	firefox
try using something like the firebug plugin for firefox or the developer tools in google-chrome to look at the request being sent out

2853766
put	get
because the call was a get and in my routes i had a update_xxxxxx put

2853766
put	get
i just had to put the update_xxxx get and the problem was solved

2853783
versioning	upgrade
consider the common need to upgrade the libraries jar1-v1.0.jar and jar2-v1.0.jar to their versioning v1.1

2853810
post	put
if s required on the server and it s on a form that post you could put the time into a hidden field then on post you could extract the value and calculate the difference

2853859
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
support for git bazaar subversion cvs and darcs is planned

2853901
serializable	deserialization
this handles the deserialization case but in the serializable case the cached value is killed and must be recomputed

2853922
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
note this approach worked for some webcontrols dropdownlistfor but not all of them checkbox

2853934
folder	directory
the directory and files lists are all always relative to root - they are the basename of the files folder they don t have a in them or on windows

2853944
profiler	yourkit
i used a java profiler yourkit and i can see my running serversocket listen thread and it never sleeps and it s always running

2853966
ssl	https
the most important is that you use public key of the bank to send a piece of information to the bank because in every ssl https connection server send to client it s public key packed as a certificate

2853986
superclass	subclassing
however when i save it afterwards rails will run only the superclass validators not the ones i defined in the subclassing

2853990
inherited	properties
perhaps you could inherited base your own implemented openfiledialog using the system.io namespace objects such as directoryinfo for instance which will allow you to get the browsed folder files with the getfiles method then filter yourself through linq to display the files with no extension only with the fileinfo.extension properties

2853990
implements	sealed
since the openfiledialog is sealed you may use it as a nested type and implements your own methods using this nested type

2853995
x86	64bit
if even more performance is needed a just in time compiler from vm byte code to native instructions exists for 32-bit x86 and is in beta release for 64bit

2854027
opera	safari
i ll throw out there that mobile safari and opera mobile have support

2854028
google-chrome	firefox
in windows everything looks great regardless of whether it s firefox google-chrome or ie

2854029
width	height
or use and width height attributes

2854041
subclass	abstract-class
i know that the typical case is to subclass one of the servlet abstract-class rather than implement this interface directly but it should still be possible to do this

2854109
getter	setter
note that this example has the appropriate instance variables name cost etc and a getter setter pair for the name variable

2854109
getter	setter
you d want to add more getter setter pairs for the other instance variables

2854109
getter	setter
once you have all your getter setter you can instantiate a unit by doing this

2854120
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket	tapestry	struts	struts	wicket
there are a plethora of java web frameworks that you can put on top of that eg struts 2 wicket tapestry jsf

2854145
put	get
so city needs the id for the state name so i would get the state name put it into the state type then call this function to get the id for that state so my city insert will also include the id for the foreign key

2854150
getter	setter
i would suggest you take a look at glazedlists which will work for any domain model object that follows java beans conventions getter setter

2854161
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the windows browsers and mac safari too in my testing just throw out the ascent value as incorrect whereas firefox and opera on the mac accept it

2854176
post	get
i want to send using post method the selected categories category via mootools ajax so that if i dump the _post variable in the server i will get something like

2854186
japplet	jdialog
since all swing top-level containers namely jframe jdialog and japplet implement the rootpanecontainer interface this means that you can gain access to their root pane in a general way no need to check if this is a jframe or jdialog ....

2854235
createelement	domdocument
basically domdocument obj- createelement obj- appendchild

listview	gridview
now those post were usually about listview gridview in combination with scrollview but still to me it seems that the best solution redesign the screen to avoid that

post	get
the hidden field does get added to my form as i can see with firebug but it s just not being sent with the post data

2854950
mvp	presenter
unlike the presenter in mvp a

2854961
min	max
this program to calculate sum min and max of the sum of array elements

2855005
min	max
the problem is that you are initialising min and max to min_max 0 0 before assigning any values to min_max so their content is actually undefined

2855027
folder	directory
if it s not find it inside your app s resources folder then copy it into the documents directory using

2855028
min	max
will print the only value of i not min or max

2855121

jsf	seam
dan allen has a great 2 part post that covers how you can speed up your seam apps if you are using jsf

2855259
daemons	systemd
i am not a mainframe expert but i assume you connect not to mvs but to the uss unix systemd services which run either ftp or ssh daemons

2855282
daemons	systemd
if your systemd is configured to hand mail to a local daemons the daemons may be dead or misconfigured

2855282
daemons	systemd
the local mail daemons shouldn t ever die or at least it should be resurrected immediately by the systemd

2855311
jquery	scriptaculous
cakephp 1.3 does have some helpers that work with prototype scriptaculous mootools mootools-more and jquery jquery ui but i don t think that alone they are enough of a reason for choosing a javascript framework

2855314
post	get
here and here â s are some good post why you get the dialog even when you register the unhandledexceptionevent

2855318
accessor	properties
use the array style properties accessor

2855332
xslt	xquery
not just xslt but xquery java sax+dom whatever.

2855344
jboss	weblogic
our application runs succesfully on tomcat websphere and weblogic and as part of it uses jboss cache version 3.1.0.g

2855380
inherited	subclassing
the static part of a class can not be inherited or overridden by subclassing

2855394
versioning	upgrade
i have recently tried to upgrade to versioning 10 of the reporting libraries microsoft.reportviewer.webforms and microsoft.reportviewer.common and for some reason this does not work anymore

2855420
subtraction	addition
some instructions may use the carry flag with as some additional implicit operand or result without having a connection with addition subtraction

2855420
subtraction	addition
after a subtraction processors vary in which condition the carry flag is set i.e some do it in the same way as after the addition of an inversed second operand the other set it to the negation of that

2855426
hide	show
my plan was to create forms on demand cache them and use a simple hide show strategy

2855432
pdfbox	jpedal	pdfbox	apache-poi	apache-poi	jpedal
developing in anything that runs on the jvm you would probably do best using apache-poi for ms office document parsing and pdfbox jpedal or pdf clown for parsing .pdfs

2855443
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i also tried this in ie8 safari google-chrome and opera with no problems

2855467
post	get
but dint find the difference between post and get and i also want to know what is the use of type contenttype and datatype

2855476
post	get
as a rule of thumb use get to retrieve data and post to update it

2855476
post	get
also see a great answer to the same question here get vs post in ajax

2855507
folder	directory
this allows me to keep my includes in a subdirectory of the main site directory which is good for organisation and it can be used on the projects where i do not have access to folder outside the web root

2855610
post	get
one additional word of warning when choosing between get and post is to realise that get will be cached by browsers like ie rather than being called every time whereas post when data is included will not be cached

2855613
uploadify	swfupload
i would use swfupload or uploadify

2855649
ant	cruisecontrol
i have a problem with cruisecontrol where an ant scripts executes a bat file that doesn t give me the prompt back

2855717
int	double
it will return double and you can cast it to int

2855720
int	double
this is a double but you can cast it to an int if you want

2855735
ocaml	sml
i seem to remember being able to do this in sml and ocaml and furthermore isn t this a pretty standard thing to do when creating an abstract datatype

2855769
firefox	safari
the usual recommendations for a web development and debugging web browser are firefox firebug or safari web inspector

2855783
sorting	grouping
may definitely need some improvements in light of the large number of grouping sorting going on

2855805
fadein	hide	hide	show
i ve got a polaroid gallery in the header with only 5 100x100 images in it test preloading has no effect on performance and my gallery will show or hide them fadein fade-out after a period of time

2855805
google-chrome	firefox
almost forgot to mention it firefox and google-chrome perform pretty good

2855818
free	malloc
for basic leak detection you just need to hook into low level memory allocation routines by patching malloc free

2855823
free	malloc
for instance they replace every call to malloc and free with their own functions which allows them to follow every allocation

2855841
width	height
place it in an html file with an img tag then resize it to width 160 but do not set the height setting and are on firefox you will see an ugly black line under the image

2855841
ubuntu	linux
note i m using ff 3.6.3 on ubuntu linux 8.04 lts if that matters.

2855841
width	height
note i don t want to set height because then the image would look funny when all i want to do is change the width so that fits nicely in a column of amazon products

2855850
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2855858
opera	google-chrome
i do it because only opera and google-chrome smooth resize large images to tiny sizes

2855911
post	put
should we really try to avoid post requests and replace them by put

2855955
try-catch	exception-handling
each exception-handling is caught only when inside a try-catch block

2855994
post	put	post	get	put	get
of course due to web browser support only get and post requests have really been adopted because post does all that put does it s just not designed for idempotent requests

2855998
onresize	onload
in order to do that during the onload event i attach some js function to the onresize window event

2856000
uiview	subviews
create a custom uiview subclass containing say three uilabel elements as subviews

2856009
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox not ok

2856055
maven	pom.xml
now we have resource processing with maven and there are some additional maven tasks defined in our pom.xml when building the webapp

asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
how to call javascript function in html.actionlink in asp.net asp.net-mvc

2856082

to read in a maven pom.xml and get the model

2856142
jar	war
is there an option in netbeans to exclude the jar file while building the war file

2856147
multiplying	add
if you want to accelerate the movement of the image depending on the measurement of the accelerometer multiplying some pixel constant for the axis measurement and add it to the x and y of the frame of the image

2856156
int	chars
second taking chars int arguments initialized by initialization list

2856160
superclass	subclassing
no the superclass has no way of telling the name type of a subclassing

2856170
inherited	properties
add 3 navigational properties to object all linking to one of the inherited entities options accessories and standaard_equipment

2856175
range	minimum
the range denoted by max-min should be the minimum possible value

2856225
boost	stl
you will have access to mfc owl stl boost whatever

2856225
getter	setter
in your example your getter should be declared const and your setter should have their arguments passed in as const and const -reference for the arrays

2856252
processors	hyperthreading
on a single processors with hyperthreading two virtual processors then the answer becomes maybe

2856319
children	parent
i d propose to rewrite the trienode struct and accessing methods to use indices instead of pointers for the parent and children fields

2856319
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization would then just mean to save load the nsdata object endianess issues aside

2856356
jobs	cron
i want to make such system which will be storing one telnet connection per switch and every script web interface cron jobs etc. will have access to it

2856356
jobs	cron
but this option is interesting because interface is using only by couple of operators and cron jobs

2856409
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
i have a red black tree and the basic operations insert delete traversing inorder postorder and preorder etc

2856465
children	parent
for instance if the cookie was specified in a subdirectory you may not be able to delete it from either the parent or children directories or both

2856501
folder	directory
for raw files you should consider creating a raw folder inside res directory and then call getresources .openrawresource resourcename from your activity

2856502
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and ie but not on firefox

2856561
ubuntu	linux
for instance on my system ubuntu linux with sun jvm 1.6.0_20 as packaged by ubuntu the default policy file is in etc java-6-sun security java.security and contains among others the following lines

2856573
onfocus	onblur
i m trying to write unobtrusive default placeholder text in input actually relatively placed label over input which hides on onfocus and stays hidden if input isn t empty on onblur but i don t want to use jquery because this is the only javascript used on page - therefore using jquery seems a bit over the top

2856591
onfocus	onblur
you will need to manually attach the onfocus and onblur events having got a handle on the input with getelementbyid

2856593
octree	quadtree
both things achievable if you use some kind of space partition such as octree or quadtree

2856593
octree	quadtree
quadtree is better for big open spaces and octree is better for in-door spaces with many levels

2856614
versioning	upgrade
we made such upgrade from vs2008 to vs2010 without the tfs migration so it s still in 2008 versioning

2856618
setinterval	settimeout
there is no substitute for setinterval settimeout - these are the only ways of timing events in browser based ecmascript

2856618
setinterval	settimeout
by the way do not use a literal as the first argument to settimeout setinterval use a function reference

2856628
rsa	aes
in practice when encrypting some data which may be larger than the maximum rsa input size hybrid encryption is used what is rsa-encrypted is a random symmetric key a bunch of 16 uniformly random bytes and that key is used to symmetrically encrypt with aes the actual data

2856649
free	malloc
don t forget to release everything and free malloc d memory when you re done

2856713
vsto	add-in
i am using vsto to create an excel add-in

2856822
width	height
i have a set width and height image lets say height 160px

2856846
min	max
this value refers to the minimal max - min distance which can be achived using the elements that are predecessors successors of current element in the sequence

2856846
min	max
and we want those elements to be the best in terms of max - min distance

2856850
post	get
upd if you want to post the form then get the response as a json object and do another ajax call

2856850
post	get
you will be able to post your form using an ajax call then get the response and run some js when it will return

2856876
serializable	deserialization
accessing a database directly always means composing query strings often sending them to a db server sometimes even over the network db lookup serializable of the results sending back deserialization and traversing the fetched results

2856880
outputstream	inputstream
if you re using implementations of inputstream and outputstream they work on a byte-by-byte level so you should end up with a binary-equal output

2856901
hide	show
by using media print rules in the css you can tell the browser to hide the page that the user is seeing in the browser by including it in a big div and adding a display none to the print rule and show the hidden div

2856901
hide	show
the nice thing of this solution is that you can play with both divs via javascript for example you could add buttons to show hide the print div etc

2856907
crypt	salt
it also means that pre-crypted dictionaries for attacks have to be much larger since they have to crypt every possible password with every possible salt

2856972
cassini	iis
we ve been running vs2008 configured on our local pcs to use iis instead of the default server cassini

2856996
pull	push
i push my working copy and pull this data on a production machine

2857004
implements	extends
may be you create your own testcase which extends from dbtestcase and implements getdataset method

2857009
folder	directory
i am studying a websites code and have the entire directory structure in my local root folder

2857062
move	drag
i m trying to let users visually move around component placeholders inside a tinymce editor however i can only seem to get drag and drop working with divs in internet explorer

2857062
google-chrome	firefox
even dragging simple text around seems buggy in firefox and google-chrome

2857075
button	checkbox
that is because there s a default action associated with elements like links checkbox radio button etc

2857083
maven	pom.xml
i m not familiar enough with the maven libraries themselves to know how to generate an effective pom.xml natively without starting maven in another process although i can t imagine that not being possible

2857087
boost	stl
those libraries like stl and boost are complex also because they need to solve every need and work on any plateform

2857088
cassini	iis
then change the debugging options of your real project back to using cassini rather than iis

2857097
ienumerable	iqueryable
have you tried using linq to nhibernate to return an ienumerable or iqueryable

2857119
folder	directory
created virtual directory child folder of root - named devbunk with these settings anonymous access directory browsing

2857157
stdout	stderr
i working on a c++ string library that have main 4 classes that deals with ascii utf8 utf16 utf32 strings every class has print function that format an input string and print the result to stdout or stderr

2857157
stdout	stderr
so my question is what is the default encoding for stdout and stderr and can i change that encoding later and if so what would happens to data stored there

2857166
post	get
i ve tried post and get but i think i may have been doing something wrong with both

2857168
integer	unsigned
65536 is significant as its 1 more than the maximum value that can be stored in a 16bit unsigned integer

2857170
nsurl	nsstring
i m looking for a did finish or finish thing in nsurl - nsstring initwithcontentsofurl

2857173
glassfish	weblogic
tomcat is not an ejb container therefore you should use full blown javaee 6 server for that such as glassfish websphere weblogic etc.

2857191
put	get
ejb is only a story apart since you can t just add some jars to get that to work but in fact yes you can put an ejb container on top of tomcat too if you modify the server core

2857229
listview	gridview
instead of the datagrid you can use the listview with listview.view set to a gridview

2857232
superclass	subclassing
subclassing it call through to the superclass methods to do their usual work but multiply all the return values by speed as appropriate

2857268
jdom	dom4j
if your html happens to be xhtml then one thing you can try is to put it into an xml parser such as jdom or dom4j which usually has some pretty-print option

2857276
portrait	landscape
for example i often use separate views for each portrait and landscape view

2857282
pull	push
so we push an xml to a initatorqueue and then had a service pull them from the queue extract some necessary attributes via xpath and insert them into a persistence table in our database

2857283
cpu	hyperthreading
however one for cpu resources is a bad move - your cpu may have up to six cores plus hyperthreading in a retail cpu and most cpus will have two or more

2857323
post	put	post	get	put	get
we can manipulate that object using its uri and http actions post get put and delete

2857372
post	get
thanks to luvieere in this post for showing me how to get the keyboard

2857406
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview with several subviews one uiimageview and a couple of uiview

2857480
getter	setter
however if you want to maintain a uniform syntax making all the constants accessible in the same way then you could use a class with properties attributes which call getter and setter functions

2857496
portrait	landscape
you ve probably already found the answer but for posterity see preserve html font-size when iphone orientation changes from portrait to landscape

2857517
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
if you are using a datasource control sqldatasource linqdatasource etc this would be done automatically retrieving only the current page of data

2857545
multiplying	add
multiplying that value by your speed-up factor and add it to a separate game-time counter

2857552
ienumerable	ilist
however the problem i describe above makes me think i should be performing all my filtering within the repositories and returning ienumerable ilist or single classes

2857564
stateless	stateful
sorry if i had not explained more quartz is good for stateless jobs and also for some stateful jobs but the key for me is very stateful persisted job instances not just jobs or tasks

2857692
firefox	safari
on ie7 firefox 3.6 safari 4.0.4

2857713
width	height
is there a convention for the order of height width in function arguments or when displaying dimensions

2857721
width	height
i d say width height is overwhelmingly more common

2857724
width	height
i donâ t know if there is a convention elsewhere but personally i always use the convention used by graphics usually even outside of computing in photography width before height

2857726
width	height
i don t know a huge number of languages but what i have used go with width height

2857731
width	height
the width height seems to be more common all around

2857765
width	text-align
i seem to recall seeing somewhere that it can also be accomplished by wrapping your email table design in an outer table set to width 100 and using some inline style for text-align center on the tbody or something like this to do it

2857809
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr use c locale

2857844
children	parent
the sliding of cells should be visible and if the user taps - button of the already expanded row the children cells should slide back into the parent

2857853
ready	each
the ear references both other projects and pom files are ready and working in each project

2857853
maven	pom.xml
the ejb uses an external jar jbpm the dependency is correctly specified in pom.xml and it appears in the maven dependencies user lib definition and i have no compilation errors

2857928
vsto	add-in
power users who create macros and add-in with vba seem not to be the the target audience for vsto

2857928
vsto	add-in
if you are interested in add-in for excel the native .xll add-in have some specific advantages over vsto in particular they support creating high-performance user-defined functions

2857928
vsto	add-in
contrary to what omegaman says these .xll-based add-in do not work through the automation add-in interfaces support excel versions from 97 to excel 2010 and allow advanced features that vsto does not support like registration-free ribbon and rtd support

2857998
mouseout	mouseenter
when they hover over mouseenter it i use jquery to fade it in and slidedown the content and the reverse on mouseout

2858009
setinterval	settimeout
you will have to resort to braking up your function into bits and schedule these using settimeout or setinterval

2858013
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should also probably use hover instead of mouseenter mouseleave

2858020
nsbutton	nsbox
i have an nscollectionview and the view is an nsbox with a label and an nsbutton

2858058
width	height
so lets assume we have an element e and it has a height of 200 and a width of 300

2858058
width	height
to its x and y properties or grow and shrink the rectangle by modifying its width and height properties

2858058
google-chrome	safari
if you want to implement your own rectangle class note that at least with safari and google-chrome if you implement tostring to return the results of the tocssrect method you can just assign the rectangle to the clip property of an elements style object- for sake of illustration consider the object literal below

2858095
inherited	properties
edit another way to work around the issue is to inherited from stringwriter and override the encoding properties to return the encoding you like utf8 in your case

2858096
put	get
pickling lets you put and get back several items one after the other so obviously it must be a self-terminating serialization format

2858100
put	get
uniform interface use standard methods like get put

2858104
vim	emacs
mostly for ide s but also for vim and emacs

2858122
integer	radix
you could use integer s tostring int i int radix method for that

2858124
awt	swing
as synic points out the android os does not provide swing awt for instance

2858153
filewriter	bufferedwriter
every time you got the line containing your text you are creating bufferedwriter new filewriter out true

2858188
width	height
this returns a copy of the image scaled according to the width and height you require it to be

2858193
put	get
i won t get a warning on the method name getresult only if i put it in a string

2858210
google-chrome	firefox
it is still working nearly fine for ie 7 ie 8 firefox and google-chrome

2858241
int	chars
if you re looking for the ascii chars code you can just cast the chars to an int as long as they are ascii chars only

2858263
ubuntu	linux
i have the pid for the process and the name i want to bring it to the front on linux ubuntu

2858278
getter	setter
after numerous attempts at setting up custom getter and setter in maplocation.h and .m i boiled it down to where i can t even copy the obligatory getter title rename it to title2 and try to get its return value

2858282
openssl	m2crypto
currently i m using openssl binary to generate response but this seems ugly to me that s why i m trying to figure out how to make response token with m2crypto

2858329
google-chrome	firefox
warning in ie6 7 at least and possibly ie8 but not firefox google-chrome etc onbeforeunload and onunload are triggered when anchors javascript links are clicked on

2858329
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
msdn is as good a source as any considering it s non-standard and that firefox google-chrome safari seems to largely have copied the implementation from ie.

2858341
width	height
moreover you don t know the exact width and height of the content div nor do you know them as a percentage of the viewport

2858341
put	get
when i solved this i put ie into quirks mode to get the border-box box model see also w3c spec

2858341
width	height
this way you can let the jscript engine calculate the correct values of width and height added between conditional comments

2858365
width	height
edit this will also animate the height and width in addition to the opacity

2858375
int	chars
if your int value uses more than one chars and includes the sign as you mention then it is more complex

2858404
width	height
i just inspected some of the code generated by gwt from my uibinders in firebug and g htmlpanel isn t adding any width or height styling

2858421
post	get
it is bad practise to perform a delete operation via get request so i have implemented a delete post as asp.net mvc does only support post + get requests as far as i know

2858462
explode	implode
php explode string string implode string array

2858478
post	put	post	get	put	get
asp.net mvc supports all the verbs get post put delete - the problem comes from most browsers that only support get and post

2858483
int	double
however at a certain point in my algorithm i need to divide a standard double value by an int value and than do a to a log-based value

2858483
division	subtraction
my question whether it would be faster to first convert the denominator to a log-based value which would replace the floating-point division with floating-point subtraction yielding the following chain of operations twice log floating-point subtraction floating-point summation

2858486
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
it sounds like you may be looking for a dictionary version of observablecollection see msdn which implements both inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged out of the box

2858490
ant	maven
have a look at ant maven gradle

2858606
google-chrome	firefox
again...fine for firefox and google-chrome

2858624

consider the following attempt of a generic method that takes a comparable and return a comparator for it that puts null as the minimum element

2858699
put	get
appreciate a determined hacker will get what they want -- i want to at least put up some resistance if i can

2858725
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
as we all know in inherited superclass objects are created initialized prior to subclassing objects

2858725
superclass	subclassing
so if we create an object of subclassing it will contain all the superclass information

2858725
superclass	subclassing
do the superclass and the subclassing methods are present on separate call-stack

2858735
post	get
i can t get too specific without any info on your js framework post get etc

2858741
post	put	post	get	put	get
the current rails restful architecture relies on the four http verbs get post put delete

2858741

if not any opinions about the best strategy to support the options method since it has to support the routes for all the post put delete methods

2858753

boost	stl
also if you combine boost bind with stl sequence algorithms you can make all kinds of fun stuff see here

2858778

if you move the mouse outside of the #dropdown div and then back in again quickly it constantly fires the mouseenter and mouseleave events causing a never ending cycle of flickering

2858792
getter	setter
for example is this something that i should just avoid passing as parameters altogether using a different approach getter setter maybe

2858799
comparator	comparable
note this is a spin-off from comparable and comparator contract with regards to null

2858827
post	get
it is very good for crud pages and has built in http methods to post get edits updates

2858840
eurekalog	madexcept
a better course of action is to use an exception-logging tool like madexcept eurekalog or jcldebug that records information about the exception and gives your customers the option of sending the reports back to you so you can reproduce the conditions of the error and fix it

2858873
hash	md5
i set a cookie in the headers with an md5 hash keyword

2858895
accessor	properties
you can change the properties to return a bool but you need to then write the accessor methods by hand and they are a bit different than what dave has in his response

2858895
accessor	properties
then in your implementation file instead of declaring a dynamic properties create the accessor directly

2858925
onclick	onfocus
and then onclick or onfocus or whatever the text dissappears and you can type into the textbox

2858971
onfocus	onblur
that s not blurred text it s called a watermark. you can create the same effect by using inline onfocus and onblur statements on your input

2859023
profiling	debugging
so in summary i believe that my original problem not being able to debugging after renewing my dev profiling and the problem that resulted from all my efforts to fix the first were caused by

2859173
google-chrome	safari
when webkit safari google-chrome encounters an inline-block where.

2859173
opera	firefox
firefox 3.6 opera 10.53 and ie7+ treat these inline-blocks like inline elements and vertical align works as expected

2859194
int	chars
for example the very first column is defined as a chars field with a length of 2 bytes but the field contains a 16-bit int

2859213
int	chars
but it just for adding 0 chars before int

2859222
notepad++	textpad
i m not a regex guy but lots of programs allow you to search text based on regex notepad++ textpad plenty of others i bet maybe you could do something like this

2859250
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the code above only selects the 2nd instance of divmaptab but in ie it selects them both

2859306
children	parent
your children will need to register with their parent object somehow

2859306
children	parent
note that this does not take into account the possibility that children will be destroyed by any means other than destroying their parent

2859311
children	parent
deleting a parent will in turn delete all children

2859330
onreadystatechange	onload
when i have to dynamically insert a jquery script tag to meet the requirments of the bookmarklet i want to wait for the onload or onreadystatechange event on the script tag before executing any function that requires jquery

or is that super instead of extends .

2859737
icefaces	openfaces

2859744
inherited	properties
to specify the unitycontainer in xaml and get automatic configuration just create an inherited attached properties unityhelper.container whose propertychangedcallback simply calls buildup on the specified container and passes in the object s type and the object

2859760
matplotlib	scipy
for those of you just starting scipy matplotlib i found this helpful in finding info about my installation as i m currently using it.

2859771
google-chrome	safari
when printing the page below in safari google-chrome the content everything on the page basically is squished into the left side of the page at about 60 of the page s width

2859771

create and hookup the button to its relevant iboutlet submitbutton and ibaction submitaction in ib

2859848
disk	ram
ram disk

2859859
onreadystatechange	onload
you could always cheat and put your onload onreadystatechange logic into a settimeout specifying a duration of 1 ms

2859870
lifting	unfold
unfortunately at this point we re kind of stuck because to my knowledge there s no monadic unfold and lifting it is like takewhile not trivial

2859891
public	protected
with respect to normal data non-static members are required to be arranged in ascending order as long as there isn t an intervening access specificer public protected or private

2859924
google-chrome	firefox
its working in good on firefox but in google-chrome it working in one page but not in the home page i don t know why.

2859938
width	height
then to have a label to have a variable multiline height but a fixed width just

2859941
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately internet explorer supports the tag which firefox google-chrome safari etc support the tag

2859960
put	get
just get the identifier of the static block then put this code in your template

2859970
cos	sqrt
cos theta 56 + 0 + 0 + 1 sqrt 64 + 49 sqrt 1 +1

2860011

if you want to run multiple go web applications on the same server you could use apache or lighttpd as the gateway and use a protocol like fastcgi or scgi to serve requests

2860036
hex	binary
an int is neither binary hex or decimal it s just a place to store a number

2860036
hex	binary
variables themselves don t have a specific hex dec binary representation until you print them

2860068
int	double
1 network.lib myclass.obj error lnk2001 unresolved external symbol int __cdecl network method1 double

2860068

all the pages works on firefox and ie but when i enter on the site with google-chrome it loads only the index page and the others don t work at all - i receive a 404 error

2860082
post	get
this is just a few lines of really simple understandable reliable code that you could have written and rewritten 3 times in the amount of time it takes you to post and get a response to the re version

2860090
int	boolean	int	double
say that class a is string and class b is int or double boolean et c

2860096
typedef	typename
by the way typename is necessary in the typedef because value_type is a so-called dependent type it depends on the nature of a template argument and the c++ compiler cannot figure out on its own that it refers to a type name rather than say a static method or variable in this context

2860103
subshell	ifs
put a subshell around it if you don t want to set ifs permanently

2860109
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover just saves you from having to do both a mouseenter and a mouseleave by doing both in one function

2860133
mouseleave	mouseenter
they re the same except hover handles both mouseenter and mouseleave

2860139
mouseleave	mouseenter
well .hover binds two handlers for the events mouseenter and mouseleave so it is a more convenient way and also easier to understand the purpose

2860139
mouseover	mouseenter
mouseenter differs from mouseover so far as mouseenter is not fired if the cursor is over enters a child element of the element the handler is bound to

2860139
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
furthermore mouseover and mouseout are real javascript events whereas mouseenter and mouseleave are events provided by jquery afaik

2860171
keydown	keyup
in this case maybe sendmessage with keydown keypress keyup three calls might work better

2860191
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so i take it out and it works on safari google-chrome but not firefox 3.5.x but validates fine

2860230

getwidth and getheight returns the width and height of the component

2860230
width	height
i ve never heard of any difference between actual width height and screen width height

2860246
children	parent
another gotcha is that you must make sure that an instance cannot be a child of more than one parent or else destroying a parent could also destroy children belonging to another parent

2860299
put	get
if you put xml data into a core data store and hook up your table view to an nsfetchedresultscontroller and its delegate methods you can get your table to update itself continuously with very little code

2860314
postgresql	mysql
knowing sql and the use of a db such as mysql postgresql was great till the advent of nosql and non-relational databases

2860365
16-bit	64bit
for example compilation of some code for 32 or 64bit processors might entail greater overhead than one would see for an old 8-bit or 16-bit architecture

2860386
stdout	stderr
stdout stdin stderr

2860426
mouseover	mouseout
about all you can do would be to listen for mouseover mouseout on a block containing the flash and if the current window loses focus in between the mouse entering and leaving make a guess that the user clicked the banner and popped up a new window

2860483
versioning	upgrade

then when a user wanted to log in i could take their submitted password add the random salt from their account information hash it and see if it equates to the stored hash password with their account information

2860972
scrypt	pbkdf2
you should use another algorithm like bcrypt pbkdf2 and scrypt to store you passwords

2860978
hash	md5
here you have two links for md5 hashing and other hash methods

2860995
width	height
the width and height have nothing to do with the size of the 3ds file

2861011
put	get
since each of the operations get delete and put happen over http which is stateless inherently the server cannot enforce atomicity

2861020
mouse	keyboard
it perfect and that only covers mouse use not keyboard changes

2861021
width	height
at the moment if i set width 100 and height 100 it fits the parent of course and not the window

2861045

2861311
quicksort	mergesort
also in practice with both algorithms modified to sort short sublists with a special-purpose sort mergesort can be a close competitor to the modified quicksort used in the c c++ standard libraries

2861311
quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place
edit unlike in-place sorts like quicksort and insertion sort mergesort requires auxiliary memory and is simplest to implement by copying rather than swapping

2861320

i have a uiview that has a uipangesturerecognizer attached to it the gesture is working fine except that the starting point is not where the pan first started it is usually off by 5 to 15 pixels in both the x and y coordinates.unfortunately the variance is not consistent and seems to be related to the speed at which the panning motion takes place

2861467
simplexmlrpcserver	xmlrpclib
if the criteria is not reinventing the wheel there is the simplexmlrpcserver and xmlrpclib modules available in the standard library

directly note that this might require changing the access modifier of the combo box from protected to public or

2861802
width	height
looking at the jquery 1.4.2 and 1.3.2 source code it actually performs this automatically when you call width or height on a hidden element

2861802
width	height
then it gets the width height and restores the old values of the attributes

the profiling will not show you data for binaries that you don t instrumentation

2862094
profiling	instrumentation
have you tried instrumentation profiling

the reason i need to find out is that on an ipad a uipickerview has the same height in landscape orientation as it does in portrait

2862142
super	self
4 i think the other way to do it is to create the sessions in a delegate class and have the delegate set to mainmenu rather than self appdelegate although i ve never used anything other then self so not sure if this will work or if i will be able to close the thread through calling super maybe

2862174
put	get
in thinking of this then there may be one case where you may get a concurrent modification in such a map that you would not get in another kind of map - if you put a key that already exists or call a getter method

2862176
udp	tcp
the answers to these questions vary depending on whether you are using a stream socket sock_stream or a datagram socket sock_dgram - within tcp ip the former corresponds to tcp and the latter to udp

2862176

put the first line somewhere it ll only get run once so you aren t constantly creating new char arrays

2862254
post	get
the page seems to call a post method on a link but sniffing the packets what i saw was a get apparently using a session generated using the info i send

2862269
udp	tcp
i am assuming you are communicating in udp because incoming buffer size does not bring problem to tcp communication

i ve launched a delayed thread using performselector but the user still has the ability to hit the back button on the current view causing dealloc to be called

2862308

that means after you get all friends from that graph api you can put all of them into a sorted data structure and then display all of them

2862310
converter	multibinding
you could use a multibinding with a converter

2862347
post	put
a client can just make post and put calls with the resource information and create or update resources as needed

i have created a uiview as a subviews and to that subviews i have added a uiimageview as a subviews

2862423
mouse	keyboard
leave the grid in selection mode so mouse and keyboard interaction selects cells

2862423
mouse	keyboard
that should let you change between selecting and editing at the appropriate times with both the keyboard and the mouse

2862424
for-loop	loops
i would use a for-loop iterating over the contents of a file that lists the class names to be created and in the body of loops echo the template to the newly created file using the value from the file to both name the .java as well as to fill in the classname in the template

2862478
post	get
this would be ideal as a result as the system puts the latest selected blog post on the homepage so if we can get rid of the sidebar div and have the text appear where it was that would be ideal

2862598
hash	salt
the fact that passwords are sent as text is not important as they are secured by the ssl connection however if you are unhappy with that you can hash the password with salt and then pass that to the server and match the stored hash you have in the database thats pretty much as secure as you can get i d reccommend a sha-2 based hash

2862658
int	double
the reason you re getting the ambiguous overload error is that you have operator+ variants that can add two complex or a complex and a double but you re trying to add a complex and an int

2862658
int	double
the compiler can t decide if its better to convert the int to complex to use the first or to double and use the second

2863369
hash	salt
you need to use the same salt for hashing or you will get different hash

2863369
hash	salt
that is to say you need store the salt into the database along with the password and reuse it to hash when the user tries to login later

2863369
hash	salt
you generate a new random salt and use it to hash the plain text

2863369

you store the salt and the hash into the database

2863369

you fetch the hash and the salt from database

presumably you d access that homebase resource mainly through get and post if there s anything there to update which i wouldn t expect on a home-base or dashboard since it s an aggregate resource

if you re running on a 64bit machine make sure the build is set to any cpu rather than x86

2864275
x86	64bit
the default for new projects changed in vs2010 from any cpu to x86 - i believe this was to make edit and continue work by default on 64bit machines as it only supports x86

2864275
x86	64bit
running an x86 process on a 64bit machine is obviously somewhat suboptimal

2864339
hide	show
in normal circumstances the div containing the mega menu options would sit inside the li item that fires the show hide but this is currently not possible as the ul list of navigation links is rendered using a 3rd party piece of software which does not provide an equivalent of an onitemdatabound event for me to be able to inject the div into the item

the second issue after you are able to store and retrieve data without loss of information are expected rounding errors due to division or multiplication by non integer

2864399

if you want a job functional programming then learn haskell as there are far more posts advertised for haskell programmers than f# or ocaml

2864466

probably 2 or 3 years ago ocaml led the field in practical functional languages but since then haskell has overtaken it with more libraries more features better performance and wider commercial use

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
say i had a class superclass and two subclassing subclassa and subclassb that inherited from superclass

2864595
superclass	subclassing
that way it is convenient because i can get somelist.size in superclass and have typesafety in the subclassing

2864600
superclass	subclassing
for one thing any method of superclass sees the superclass list not that of the subclassing

2864600
superclass	subclassing
what you actually get is the size of the list in superclass not that of the subclassing

2864600
superclass	subclassing
the superclass list may be empty while the subclassing list contains elements or vice versa

2864614
dictionary	map
of course you simply use a dictionary to map the id to the item

2864619
superclass	subclassing
you re declaring a second variable - so code in the superclass will use one variable and code in the subclassing will use another

2864652
inherited	properties
the properties is inherited from uiscrollview and it specifies where the content of the scrollview as tableview is a scrollview should stay related to scroll s bounds

maven	pom.xml
this in turn guarantees that the aaa projects pom.xml is available in the local maven repository and the bbb-aaa-specific bamboo build may then use it as a dependency

2864693
dictionary	map
you could always map the enum to strings in a and then implement your method by looking up the correct string in the dictionary based on the enum key

2864727
dictionary	map
so if you want to map an enum to string you could use as just mentioned a dictionary

sorting	filtering
its very view-oriented so it has powerful sorting filtering or searching features but creates some overhead and is not optimized for performance

2865017
width	height
here i have to validate the height and width of the image in client side

2865056
children	parent
if you load parent and you have set lazy false on its child set property then all of its children will be loaded from db which can affect the performance

2865060
uiview	subviews
i have also created a uiview which is a subviews and placed with a background image and two uibuttons on them

2865063
width	height
you can do this on browsers that support the new file api from the w3c using the readasdataurl function on the filereader interface and assigning the data url to the src of an img after which you can read the height and width of the image

2865063
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently firefox 3.6 supports the file api and i think google-chrome and safari either already do or are about to

2865082
getter	setter
i think the most important question is does the compiler know the method you call is a getter or setter

2865092
getter	setter
then i use the getter setter to make clear its not a member of the extending class

2865098
disk	ram
given that the data would most likely be too large to all sit in ram on the print server it makes sense to use sftp to transfer the pdfs so they can be grabbed from disk as they are printed

2865099
width	height
just multiply each of your pre-warped corner values in homogeneous format 0 0 0 1 width 0 0 1 0 height 0 1 width height 0 1 by the perspective matrix to get the transformed coordinates

2865100
getter	setter
in most cases they will be optimized to the same code but the point of using setter getter is to avoid changin api in case of change of implementation

2865100
getter	setter
edit of course outside class it shoudl be protected by getter setter as you may change internal representation and you can provide backward-compatibility by reimplementing them in terms of new state representation

2865162
getter	setter
there will only be a difference if the getter setter does something extra

2865166
hide	show
show the table and hide the loading div

2865188
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian distros have the start-stop-daemon tool which is for the same purpose you describe

2865193
getter	setter
i generally prefer to still go through the setter getter even when accessing the class internally

2865193
getter	setter
if it is way too inconvenient to use the setter getter num ++ vs setnumber getnumber + 1 as someone else pointed out

2865269

problem once it get hide then the show is not working

2865289
post	get
well you see what i do is transferring the get params into post params

2865309
put	get
put your cursor at the top of the file hold down alt and alternate between page down to get to the next style issue and enter to bring up the smart tag to make the change

2865350
getter	setter
getter setter are nice in that they often may do slightly more than act as the interface to a private field

2865350
getter	setter
this is of course silly from the context of a getter setter but is something to avoid doing

2865350
getter	setter
i ve also heard of code that performs most of what it s meant to do in getter setter having no real methods

2865364
svg	vml
if extjs charts are not enough for you you can try highcharts which uses canvas svg or vml for rendering

2865407
next	except
everything works well except that i cannot find a way to mimic the f3 - find next behaviour as in notepad

2865410

you can use get instead if the destination accepts either post or get

2865557
post	get
receive get arguments and post them with curl or any decent http client to second site then transfer result to browser

2865557
post	get
application logic should need little adjustement on this part if domain 2 app expects to get post data in the same request as visitor is coming it won t do it

2865569
super	extends
but you can define a generic super interface and let your actual service interface extends it with parameters

2865597
folder	directory
try adding the src test resources directory as a source folder in your eclipse project

2865638
inherited	properties
you could inherited from this user control in order to add fields to it but as the child controls will share properties and behaviour they should inherited from a common parent

2865894

do you want to redefine it in later classes and if so is the redefined setter getter correct or is the field access correct

2868647
versioning	upgrade
i haven t tried porting a setup from vs2008 to 2010 but having the same upgrade code for different build versioning will cause problems

xna	slimdx
i realise there are numerous questions on here asking about choosing between xna and slimdx but these all relate to game programming

2868900
xna	slimdx
so bearing that in mind would you choose xna or slimdx

2868914
mouseover	mouseout
ppk has some excellent documentation on what is actually happening and why mouseout isn t doing what you think it should at that point technically you are mousing out of the layer when you mouseover its children which is a little odd conceptually

2868940
for-loop	loops
you should instead initialize plot objects outside of your for-loop and use the set command to update them within loops instead of just replotting them

2868949
xna	slimdx
i haven t used slimdx but based on my experience with xna and reading about slimdx s objective

2868949
xna	slimdx
also xna likes to pre-build it s resources into directx files .x if you re working with dynamic files i think slimdx is the best choice for you

2868967
glassfish	weblogic
i m working on a flex implementation currently using sdk 3.5 on weblogic 10.3 11g. we originally used glassfish v2.1.1 with zero issues there was an active directory group lookup bug but it did not hinder our progress. since transitioning to weblogic we have an issue where the flexsession is invalidated after logging in using j_security_check

2868981
strcpy	strncpy
finally please get in the habit of using strncpy over strcpy its much safer

2869008
for-loop	arrays
as codeholic alludes to you should never modify an arrays while iterating over it with a for-loop

2869088
ftp	telnet
the other options would be things like a proprietary socket solution hosting an ftp server on the device using the abhorrent imo ms-provided http server with isapi telnet or something along those lines

2869124
superclass	subclassing
either way this is pretty flexible for future reuse just subclassing another controller or divergence remove the superclass relationship and implement your situation-specific toolbar on the controller that has changed

2869127

getter	setter
with the id annotation there is a difference if it is on the getter hibernate tries to get set all class members via their regular getter setter while if it is on the member variable hibernate will access all the member variables directly

2869174

very generally speaking if the entity has the standard getter setter which match the field names then there isn t much of a difference

2869223
switching	screens
the messages are intended for fast user switching but the lock screens is implemented in windows as a system session

2869230
getter	setter
i prefer injecting via fields since i find it cumbersome to have to expose all properties via getter setter methods 7 lines vs 1 line when in 99.9 of the times they re going to work as simple variables and in any case i can switch the annotation style if when i need to write custom setter functionality anyway

2869231
getter	setter
it s not very common to have private getter setter so it s useful to be able to put annotation on the field

2869232
converter	multibinding
multibinding is not supported in sl and the converterparameter option is not bindable otherwise you could do something like source binding itemid converter ... converterparameter binding price - but as i said that s not possible

2869341
google-chrome	firefox	fadein	fadeout
i would say that it s because firefox and google-chrome probably correctly don t modify display css property while fadein fadeout

2869344
super	abstract
nobody agrees about the use of interfaces over super abstract classes

2869344
super	abstract
the main reason to use interfaces and super abstract classes is to enable polymorphism

in that case i imagine it would go through oncreate onstart onresume and then finally onactivityresult

an abstract-class will be a superclass for your zombies

2870099
post	put
but do i need to put the post string in a special format

2870133
awt	swing
there are both awt and swing implementations

2870133
awt	swing
the awt doesn t support horizontal scrolling so i ll be using swing

2870156
awt	swing
you can get a graphics graphics2d instance from any awt swing component via the paint method

2870263
getter	setter
it ran fine for me however i needed to make some adjustments to the code you ve provided - i noticed that from your bubbles class you are trying to access ball s properties that are set as private radius color so either set them public or create the proper getter setter methods for that matter

2870263
getter	setter
or if you want to use getter setter functions

2870265
addclass	removeclass
instead of using the s why not manipulate the using addclass and removeclass

2870268
rss	feed
i have a desktop gadget that pulls rss feed from a website

2870270
nunit	mstest
your build server is ignoring your tests because mstest uses a different set of attributes to specify tests to what nunit uses

2870270
nunit	mstest
for example mstest uses and to specify a test fixtures and tests while nunit uses and

2870270
nunit	mstest
bear in mind that if your tests absolutely have to run on mstest and nunit you can decorate the tests with attributes for both frameworks and it will work to a certain degree anyway

2870302
min	max
as for b trees the min max heights depend on the branching factor chosen for the implementation

2870337
children	parent
my question is how do i set up my code so that when i scale my parent view by 1 4 or w e to make a thumbprint of the view the children subviews that the parent view owns will scale accordingly and allow the 1 4 sized thumbprint to look just like the full sized view just smaller

2870385
put	get
if i try and use ____ looks naff and so does 00 00 0000 and of course if you put in 0 like 03 11 2009 you get 3 11 29 because the 0 s are deleted as part of the mask

2870418
folder	directory
you could also easily do a virtual directory instead and not roll out the symlinked folder in each website

2870449
super	extends
class enum extends super const export import

2870462
bash	zsh
if you re using bash or zsh use this

2870472
google-chrome	firefox
try running your experiment in multiple browsers instead of stopping the browser and resubmitting fire both requests in separate browsers firefox and google-chrome which will use separate session and therefore will not block

2870522
put	get
not sure how things work on osx but in linux if i install gems as a regular user they get put in my home directory and if i install them using sudo they go into a system directory

2870529
g++	gcc
is there any option in gcc g++ to achieve this

2870552
ienumerable	icollection	public	protected
essentially you want to make the icollection type protected and use this as the backing collection for the public ienumerable

2870552
public	protected
for lazy loading to work the type must implement icollection and the access must be public or protected

2870569
coldfusion	railo
in cfml coldfusion railo openbd the onmissingmethod event handler defined within a component will receive undefined method calls on that component

2870569
getter	setter
this is the mechanism that facilitated the creation of implicit setter getter schemes before they began to be built into the various cfml engines

2870582
serializable	deserialization
you ll have to define some kind wire protocol or serializable deserialization format so that your reader knows how to interpret the data that it s reading from the fifo

2870602
portrait	landscape
mostly it s used when the view autorotates from landscape to portrait and vice-versa

2870607
x86	64bit
if you re running the batch file using systemroot syswow64 cmd.exe on 64bit windows perhaps because you re starting it from a 32-bit app then processor_architecture will be equal to x86 not amd64

2870613
cruisecontrol	teamcity
for the build server you can try cruisecontrol or teamcity free but not open source

2870614
abstract-class	superclass
my opinion is you better use abstract-class called creature as a superclass for all type of well creatures and extends it to zombie for all type of zombies

2870620
inherited	subclassing
the type parameter should be declared with the type and the subclassing will declare the specific type in its inherited declaration

2870626
innodb	myisam
i have tried this particular query remotely and locally with the myisam and innodb engines with different types of joins and with and without an index on phone1

2870634
int	boolean
the idea is an int called access-mode holds a boolean in the lowest bit and a count in

2870634
subtract	add
i add and subtract by 2 to leave the low-bit alone

2870699
mouseleave	mouseenter
i don t know exactly what your selector should be but this will grab the src of the image when you mouseenter and change it from _bw.jpg to _color.jpg and back when you mouseleave

2870716
inherited	properties
then using css inherited principles you can create more specific rules for links inside the #header element and override any of the properties you like

2870722
hide	show
i am not sure is hide show the correct status to be used in such cases

2870786
outputstream	inputstream
here s an example of copying an inputstream to an outputstream from org.apache.commons.io.ioutils

2870803
post	get
i read the other post here on outlineviews and dnd but i can t get my program to work

2870856
uitableview	uisearchbar
i see a lot of info on putting a uisearchbar in the top row of a uitableview -- but i am putting the uisearchbar into the toolbar at the top of my screen on the ipad

2870884
apache	lighttpd
if you don t need that it also has a fastcgi interface so that you can serve scheme scripts from a web servers like apache lighttpd etc

2870908
pull	push
you actually can use this file as an origin repo from which you can pull push data like a regular git repo

2870923
openssl	m2crypto
lucky for you the openssl function you need is available in m2crypto 0.16 it is just the python method that is not providing the extra argument you need

2870928
folder	dir
the example below will do a dir of your appdata folder and redirect the stdout to the debug

2870951
ubuntu	debian
it s available at that link and in the repositories of at least debian fedora and ubuntu

2870960
postgresql	mysql
product supports the various of rdbms such as oracle mysql sql server h2 hsql apache derby postgresql â vietspider crawler supports session login query by form input multi-downloading javascript handling proxy and multi-proxy by auto scan the proxies from website â

2870970
width	height
apparently the width and height were getting a value of 5 for some reason

2870970
width	height
i fixed the redraw function to adjust the width and height correctly

2871039
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
in case you are working in an application server environment such as glassfish weblogic or jboss connection pooling is provided by the application server itself

2871079
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

2871100
post	get
get post for those categories

2871100
post	get
then you will not get any categories without post

2871233
stdout	stderr
the following command will run three commands and will write all output stdout and stderr into a single logfile

2871233
stdout	stderr
stderr and stdout for all commands goes to a logfile in case i need it later--- i usually won t look in here unless there are problems

2871233
stdout	stderr
a 2 1 will convert stderr into stdout and therefore i cannot view errors if i do 2 error.log

2871258
post	get
i am trying to build a webservice that manipulates http requests post and get

2871272
stdout	stderr
additionally you can direct stdout and stderr to different places

2871272
stdout	stderr
so some combination of the above should work for you -- you could save stdout to a file and stderr to both a file and piping to another program with tee

2871273
pull	push
when i try to clone pull from or push to the windows repo via ssh it gives me an error fatal protocol error bad line length character it doesn t matter what i set the remote to in my client mac osx machine - i can point it to a folder that doesn t exist and it still gives me that error

2871273
pull	push
better yet is there anybody out there that has managed to do what i want to do push to and pull from a windows repository via ssh

2871289
post	get
i check the request_method upon every invocation of the script to see if it was called by get method or post

2871309
stdout	fflush
you may want to do fflush stdout after every print or autoflush stdout once

2871359
stdout	stderr
the stderr will then get converted to stdout which is piped to tee which appends it to the log if you are have bash 4 you can replace with and sends it to stdout which will either appear on the tty or can be piped to another command

2871359
stdout	stderr
that said it may be possible that stderr stdout is interleaved in an unexpected way

2871435
put	get
if the problem persists you can add an event handler for the textchanged event and put a breakpoint in it to se when the textbox get cleared

2871444
int	double
the built-in point structure uses int and pointf uses float but you can make your own that uses double

2871448
int	double
otherwise if you really want to use double s and pass them to int drawing functions you will need to create your own structure

2871451
stdout	stderr
executes the commands with standard error directed to standard out standard out directed to fd 5 and pipes stdout which now contains only stderr to tee which duplicates the output to fd 5 which is the log file

2871458
protected-mode	real-mode
if you want to play with hw write some programs for 16-bit real-mode or even with your own transition to protected-mode

2871499
post	put
i can redirect all those post to another sub domain points in another folder not sub folder if i put all those post in a sub folder it will recursive the subfolder name anyway it works for me by using the code below

2871512
int	chars
so if you have a long text of such chars you would need to loop through the string chars by chars using getcharat int or getchars and process each chars with string.format 04x int c.charvalue

2871530
put	get
with this script i get data from jsonresult getdevicestable and put them to table id orderdevices

2871631
web.py	cherrypy
however seeking doesn t work when running a dev server web.py cherrypy or if i return the bytes via a defined action url instead of as a static file

2871669
int	boolean	int	double
i have been able to use the method above to store both int and double as string and to the cast in the query but i have not succeeded using the same method for datedime and boolean

2871718
put	get
but if i put the name already in function i can get the correct data example

2871739
getter	setter
i used getter setter here since you usually set the fields to private and access them through accessor methods but that s your call

2871779
width	height
instead of cloning the source image as the dest you are going to have to create an image big enough to take the final rotated image which will be a square with sides 1.5 times the biggest of the source width or height

2871787
profiling	debugging
alternatively you can simulate cheap profiling debugging your application and break into it periodically to see what s executing on the call stack

2871842
put	get
but if i put the name already in function i can get the correct data example

2871888
put	get
the dispose just never get s called even if i put a wait loop after the test

2871894
next	except
all works fine except that if left inactive for a length of time the next time a request is made to the server it takes a long time for it to service it

2871908
public	protected
controls in the page are often declared as protected so you might have to change their access level to public in order to access them from the outside

2871911
postgresql	mysql
i m trying to migrate my app from mysql to postgresql using rails3-pre and the latest datamapper

2871921
jboss	glassfish
stack such as jboss glassfish etc

2872000
udp	tcp
seems it mentioned support for udp ip but not tcp

2872056
bash	zsh
however bash has useful interactive features dash does not zsh is still better imho

2872141
width	height
but then i break out width and height as properties of parent object so in the end use

2872163
int	double
if you only have 2 textboxes that the user can enter values into and it ll be either a string or a number do you really need to be able to distinguish between int and double can t you just store it all as a suitable numeric type depending on the db

2872188
google-chrome	firefox
looks much better on ubuntu mac as compared to windows 7 tried google-chrome firefox

2872197
mockito	easymock
my analyze is that easymock tests will break more often but mockito ones won t when you would want them to

2872205
int	double
it still converts the type - for example from int to double

2872223
rss	feed
so you have to learn xml only if you gonna parse or supply an rss feed

2872252
folder	directory
you can however write to a folder that your air app creates in the user s directory called the application storage directory

2872407
pull	push
i do not want to move my component into the gac i want to leave the custom assembly in my applicationbase to copy around to various servers without having to pull push from the gac

2872408
hash	md5
for example in case of 2checkout you would want to check md5 hash that 2checkout returns to verify the transaction and make a record of the payment maybe save the raw params received from 2checkout

2872442
hash	md5
so domain name hash maybe md5 twice this is given to the user to add to a config or you save it and the player talks to your server

2872454
ironruby	ironpython
microsoft has a project called gestalt which uses ironruby and ironpython running on top of the dlr inside silverlight to provide support for text python and text ruby and presumably any language that can run on top of the dlr scheme smalltalk php tcl.

2872461
folder	directory
the reason why i store it within this folder is since these images need to be cleared once in a while and it s so much easier just to clear the tmp directory using tmpwatch

2872510
width	height
fb.ui method fbml.dialog width 500 height 300 fbml ....

2872561
equals	gethashcode
equals on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than gethashcode comparisons

2872566
cstdio	iostream
slower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allows

2872576
std	ostream
such as std ostream and

2872583
temp	tmp
even if you built a php script that accepts the file name as a parameter and then passes through the file from the tmp directory you would be mixing public content with temp files that can contain sensitive data

2872588

xna	slimdx
xna and slimdx are very close in nature but there are some differences

2872864
xna	slimdx
xna requires a gpu with a least pixel vertex shaders 1.1 while i think slimdx does not

2872864
xna	slimdx
slimdx supports directx10 and 11 while xna only supports directx 9

2872864
xna	slimdx
xna is a cross platform between windows xbox 360 zune and windows phone 7 while slimdx is not

2872877
ubuntu	linux

filtering	grouping	hide	show
i m trying to trigger a sequence of effects simple animated show hide on a grouping of images inside of div where images are tagged with classnames that provide a filtering ability thru class selectors

2873687
hide	show
i thought i could just drop the show function into a callback on the hide function call but it ends up calling the show method repeatedly as many times as there were items hidden in the first call

2873687
hide	show
the challenge as i see it is that the show effect doesn t necessarily impact the same images that were hit with the hide effect

2873693
backgrounding	multitasking
i know that sdk 4.0 promises multitasking and backgrounding processes of the application

post	get
i tried to get more information from the jfreechar forums and found this post

instead of showing and hiding each element individually you can add a class to the li elements after the first three then use css to show and hide them by adding a class to the ul parent

2873825
serializable	deserialization
one is that it leads to an asymmetry between serializable deserialization

required	placeholder
you place an image in your document as a placeholder to get the size etc as required then docmosis will inject the given image at runtime from java

2874075

interpreted-language	compiled-language
a dynamically interpreted-language is interpreted at runtime whereas a compiled-language is compiled before execution

2874189
width	height
in some occations you might just need the width and height in other scenarios you might need the full set of ia or ib or even the implementation but that should be simplified to an interface aswell

2874235
hide	show
you wont be able to change the cell to another design from ib because that would require for it to recreate itself you prolly actually could but it wouldnt look good and it would prolly be hackerish ...however you can have many different content view defined in ib and declare them all in a cell subclass which u can tie to your ib as well then you can just hide views and show views depending on the selection state...you can do this in the selected method of uitableview cell heres a ref tableviewcell ref

2874241
bash	tcsh
i would say that examples of scripting languages are things like bash or ksh or tcsh or whatever or sqlplus

if p.value is an integer you will probably lose the fractions on this line

2874734
sequence	permutation
assuming the sequence is a permutation then given the state of the algorithm you should be able to figure out the set of n 2 remaining elements

2874734
sequence	permutation
you want to create a program p which given the final n 2 elements and the internal state of the linear-time-constant-space algorithm after it has processed n 2 elements determines if the entire sequence is a permutation of 1..n

2874734
sequence	permutation
assuming p exists we can create a program q taking only the internal state of the linear-time-constant-space algorithm which determines the necessary final n 2 elements of the sequence if it was a permutation

it s really too much to get into in a single post but i would recommend finding a better source for learning the pattern and tool

2875216
width	height
i basically want the size to have a ratio of width height and then grow according to that ratio to fit the text

2875216

lseek	posix
if you are using a posix system like linux then open lseek read and close are a good first go at this and may be required if you don t have the next system calls

2875779
folder	directory
if all of the files that you are trying to read from live in one directory folder or under one then you may find that opening the directory with opendir or open directory_name o_directory depending on if you need to read the directory entries yourself and then calling openat which takes a directory entry file descriptor as one of its arguments will speed up opening each file since the os won t have work as hard to look up the file you re trying to open each time that data will probably be in the os s file system cache but it still takes time and has lots of tests

2875809
pow	sqrt
distance prevdist + sqrt pow prevx - acceleration.x 2 + pow prevy - acceleration.y 2 + pow prevz - acceleration.z 2

2875823
int	double
math.random returns a double and when you multiply a double by an int java considers the result to be a double

2875823
int	double
by default java will not allow you to assign a double value to a variable of type int without your explicitly telling the compiler that it s ok to do so

2875823
int	double
basically you can think of casting a double to an int as telling the compiler i know this int variable can t hold the decimal part of this double value but that s ok just truncate it.

2875823
int	double
unlike double which by definition can be converted to an int by dropping the decimal part strings can t be easily or consistently converted to an int

2875828

client-side	server-side
for the asp.net validator controls i want to use both client-side validation for the user experience and server-side validation to guard against hackers

2876395
client-side	server-side
asp.net documentation leads me to believe that if enableclientscript true then there will be no server-side validation if client-side validation is possible for the user agent

2876395
client-side	server-side
to get server-side validation the documentation says use enableclientscript false which bypasses client-side validation altogether

symfony	kohana	cakephp	kohana
big frameworks like cakephp kohana symfony etc

2878641
put	get
are you expecting some devilishly complex scheme that hold locks for smaller granularity than put or get

2878659
wordpress	joomla
but for that i would still choose something like wordpress or joomla considering they have much larger user bases and in my opinion are more sophisticated

2878660
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in safari 4 google-chrome and firefox 3.5

2878720
post	put
it should be in one of the post fields if the user put it in the form

2878804
google-chrome	safari
edit safari works the same way as google-chrome so i suppose this is a webkit issue

2878820

a cms like wordpress of drupal or an mvc framework like zend cakephp or codeigniter

2878918
outputstream	inputstream
this isn t a big deal though - you can just deal with the raw inputstream and outputstream objects that the socket class provides

2878921
division	addition	division	multiplication	division	modulo	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo	bitwise-or	bitwise-and
the shifting masking implementations given in the other answers are a generalisation of this for cases where the max_e + 1 values are powers of 2 and thus the multiplication and division can be done with a shift the addition with a bitwise-or and the modulo with a bitwise-and

2878940
firefox	safari
if c# is possible and a mac with safari firefox would be able to use it i can t install plugins and i don t want to get in trouble for making myself admin again

2878943

i suppose this is a learning exercise because bisection and recursion is a very poor way to solve for sqrt

2878944
post	get
like i said i m pretty new at this so if i need to post more of the code to show whats going to get help let me know

2878968

lisp	scheme
for those familiar with lisp or scheme the model above is exactly the same as the environment model in lisp scheme

2879150
for-loop	loops
a for-loop is really just syntactic sugar for a certain form of while loops anyways

2879201

2879249
aptana	radrails
i ve already tried eclipse with aptana radrails

2879264
packets	multicast
unfortunately multicast ip doesn t have any such filtering by subnetwork feature -- so unless you want to muck with iptables on linux or equivalent firewall sw hw of your system network to try and drop on the floor every multicast packets you don t like i think you ll have to do it at application level with a test on fromaddr in your inner loop for example

2879296
spaces	delimiter
this obviously isn t perfect because it will still accept input like 2 1 2 1 2 which it would evaluate as 3 since it essentially sums up a spaces delimiter list of numbers while evaluating each as a fraction as necessary

2879317
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve got this problem with completed events not firing for wcf long running calls up to 1.5 minutes to return it works ok in ie 8 but doesn t work in firefox google-chrome or safari

onreadystatechange	onload
onreadystatechange delegation is from memory a workaround for ie which has patchy support for onload

2879540
min	max
basically like this example page but instead of having min max text fields.

2879555
cout	cin
i do not like using namespace std but i am also tired of having to type std in front of every cout cin cerr and endl

2879557
fgets	getline
you can use fgets iteratively but a simpler alternative is stdio.h s getline

2879561
cout	cin
then in your code you can use cin cout and so on without accidentally injecting all of the rest of the std namespace into your code

2879579
maven	pom.xml
you can also install parent s project pom.xml into a local maven repository so maven and eclipse will be able to find it when building or working with individual projects

2879583
width	height
i need adjust the height and width of uiwebview so that the whole text is displayed within the view and the user need not scroll to read the text

2879721
google-chrome	safari
it works in google-chrome and safari for the desktop but not the iphone

2879738
post	put
everything works perfectly if i don t put the code inside a function but once i do put them in a function it s like the arrays aren t even connecting with the post

2879762
int	boolean
otherwise i would have to repeat 100 lines of code 50 each for razmataz and razmatazasync over various t parametric values of string map boolean int etc

2879773
union	distinct
i realize that i can do union and distinct queries and whatnot to present the relationships as mutual in the ui but is there a better way

2879781
ienumerable	ienumerator
each time you enter a for each in loop with a ienumerable getenumerator is called returning a separate ienumerator with its own state

2879806
pull	push
but chances are your remote git repo is a bare repo one no working tree in order to allow pull and push

2879807
mouse	keyboard
i need to disable the mouse clicks mouse movement and keyboard inputs for a specific windows for a kiosk application

2879814
allocator	stl
the stl is not required to use malloc by default but you can pass in an allocator to specify this

2879825
bazaar	cvsnt	bazaar	perforce
according to this page bazaar codendi cvsnt monotone perforce rational team concert subversion surround scm synergy

2879829
allocator	stl
the best way to do what you want is to define your own new operator that accounts for allocated memory or use an accounting allocator for stl containers like this one

2879865
button	checkbox
i need to post the data to the controller upon any checkbox checked or unchecked i.e a click on a checkbox must post to the controller and there is no submit button

2879886
width	height
so if the width after the first resize is 100 and you wanted 75 you compute the diff 25 split it by 2 and ceil it 13 then you tell the gd function to start copying the image from 13 instead of 0 and still keep 75 height

2879913
allocator	stl
that will only work if you pass that allocator as a template parameter in every stl container declaration you have

2879916
int	boolean
can someone explain to me the usage of int boolean etc in place of their primitive types in java

2879933
int	boolean
boolean int long .

2879937
int	boolean
the rationale for int boolean and so on is to allow primitive types to be used in contexts that require a reference type

2879941
int	double
also there are things you can t do with primitive types like storing them in a map or using polymorphism double and int both are instances of number

2879986
post	get
if this servlet is detached from all the web app and gets parameters only using post get so it does not need session at all should one use session.invalidate at the end of doget dopost

2879998
put	get
if someone is willing to put classes in your package to circumvent your encapsulation they re clearly ignoring your best intentions - i say let em get on with it but don t provide support for that scenario

2880001
tostring	gethashcode
objects have certain methods such as gethashcode tostring etc. which can be really useful in some cases

2880025

hide	show
i am looking for a jquery plug-in which will show hide a div in a very smooth slide manners when i click on a link

2880203
httpcookie	jsessionid
the servlet container usually keeps track of session using either 1 a httpcookie or 2 adding an extra parameter jsessionid in each url

2880221
firefox	safari
this works great in safari and firefox of course and i haven t tried other versions of ie but here is a simple example

2880227
quicksort	mergesort
see my question here asking for a good open source multithreaded mergesort quicksort whatever

2880227
quicksort	mergesort
multithreaded quicksort or mergesort

2880227
quicksort	mergesort
i haven t implemented mergesort but quicksort and i can tell you that there s no array copying going on

2880259
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari but unfortunately in internet explorer this script totally destroys the layout of the site where it is contained

2880264
put	get
how can i get the current user id and put it in a menu tab

2880332
rpm	yum
both apt-get for deb and yum for rpm will check these dependencies and install them if needed

2880340
inherited	properties
i need to find the lowest interface in inherited tree that has the count properties

2880354
width	height
is there a way to give the object a width and height so that the text automatically wraps in the area provided

2880362
int	double
the c# ipaddress class provides network byte order reading writing methods for all primitives except double and float but as in my example you can pass through through either a 32-bit or 64-bit int respectively

2880459
firefox	safari
however using the html bridge you may be able to handle the onbeforeunload event fired by some browsers ie firefox and safari perhaps more

2880490
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari has a function where you can report bugs to help their developers fix it

2880500
post	get
you can fudge what appears in the address bar on the browser by using a front-controller architecture and using forms post for every request but this is going to get very messy very quickly

2880511
hide	show
i have two links i want to show hide them one at a time my code is

2880544
winpcap	libpcap
sniffing library i think is libpcap or winpcap

2880565
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you could write an action-filter and in the onactionexecuting event put the user inside viewdata

2880590
width	height
i have a page that has a 100 width and height div in it all surrounding elements are sized accordingly so that it does actually achieve 100 width and height

2880644
yacc	bison
to do this i would read up on lex and yacc or the gnu variants flex and bison to get a feel for how you can lexicalize input and then place it into some sort of hierarchical structure

2880653
folder	directory
i have made one applet which downloads a zip file from the server on client machine into temp folder extracts the zip file into a directory specified by client browser user and then deletes the zip file

2880671
post	get
but you will probably need to use a post for this not a get

2880692
post	put
good point this is the post that i put my presentation from here

2880708
opera	firefox
my suggestion would be - try yui calendar instead it shows well on ie firefox and even old opera

2880744
width	height
the idea is that your form contains several invisible inputs their type should probably not be set to hidden but they should be invisible to a human set width or height to 0

2880767
codeigniter	kohana
i sometimes use it with some of the other frameworks codeigniter kohana etc

2880783
int	chars
with pod values int chars etc. passing by value is not a problem but if you are looking at complex structures then the stack grows too quickly by placing entire structures on stack for function calls

2880827
int	double
i m not really expecting any votes for this - it s a mad solution to be honest it does have the advantage of being able to be applied for any enum type and even discreet values of type int float double as well as supporting any delegate type - so perhaps it s a bit of a sledgehammer

2880846
memcpy	memmove
memmove is used over memcpy in order that the source and destination may be the same location if you do not need that it may be more efficient to use memcpy

2880865
vbscript	vb6
here s the documentation with a sample for how to do it from vbscript pretty much the same from vb6

2880868
vbscript	vb6
note that example works in vbscript as well in vb6 you can get the file by

2880909
put	get
it s easy to put it into nested dictionaries but i want it in objects of my class-types to get the right behaviours as well as the data

2880970
serializable	deserialization
possible causes are invalid stream or object version change between serializable and deserialization

2881006
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
for example if you do drag and drop the mousedown event is fired then any number of mousemove and finally mouseup

2881008

and also i want to implement large page like some textarea some textbox more images etc.

2881104
int	chars
int main int argc const chars argv

besides eurekalog and madexcept the jcl jvcl libraries have usueful to obtain those informations

2881122
portrait	landscape
i am using two xml layout file layoutpotrait.xml and layoutlandscape.xml.when device emulator is in portrait mode i want to set the content view with layoutportrait.xml file and when i will change the emulator to landscape mode i want to set content view with layoutlandscape.xml file

2881159
put	get
from there you can declare a htmldocument object which is queryable its a bit of headache in places because the api design forces you to do random casting but it does get the job done and it can always be put in to a util class on it s own so you don t have to keep your oddities in your main app code classes

2881160
many-to-many	one-to-many
in hibernate tutorial chapter 25 best practices says we should use 2 one-to-many relationship instead of one many-to-many with an intermediate link class

2881200
udp	tcp
i am using a udp application and therefore do not get to view the ip_tos field at the application layer as is the case with tcp

2881227
google-chrome	firefox
if i give my image 100 height it works correctly in firefox google-chrome it stretches all allong its wrapper while in explorer it inherits the page height

2881227
google-chrome	firefox
i tried with height inherit but in firefox google-chrome image doesn t stretch at all in explorer the problem remains the same

2881244
put	get
the portlet gets deployed fine but when i put it on a page i get the following exception

2881250
awt	swing
are you mixing some awt and swing stuff

2881315
google-chrome	firefox
by the way in the firefox looks like old jquery lib loads and scripts that depends on it works but script that uses new version and in ie and google-chrome everything is exactly opposite

2881346
stdio	fflush
the recommended fix was to add sys.stdout.flush to the spot in my script where i want stdio to fflush its contents to the python-shell

2881372
django	web2py
pyamf supports many popular web frameworks twisted django appengine web2py wsgi each of these providing different interfaces for using sessions

2881387
stdout	stderr
all do more or less the same thing but give you access to the stdin stdout stderr open3 open4 and pid open4 of the subprocess

2881411
ant	maven
this is how i did it note that we re using ant in our legacy corporate project you probably should be using maven which should eliminate 50 of those steps below

2881418
width	height
i can get the width but the height i m getting seems to be wrong

2881454
int	double
it s a double pointer to a simple struct with 2 int time and tons

2881500
subclass	abstract-class
you will find that in fact the object returned by create does not belong to abstract-class xmlwriter but some other concrete subclass

2881542
int	double
simply parse the string into a double and then check whether that double represents an int value

2881628
put	get
check the second query parameter that you put into array - namely pg thats what you should get there 0 0 0 0 0...403 or other thing might be that your oin numbers are not present in num_list keys

2881640
getter	setter
you should create getter and setter anyway for matter of encapsulation

2881711
width	height
i have an image with a width of 1600 pixels and height of 1819 pixels

2881752
equals	gethashcode
you must implement gethashcode and equals

2881752
equals	gethashcode
dictionary is a hashtable below the covers so you might want to read this pitfalls of equals gethashcode â how does a hash table work

2881758
equals	gethashcode
it is always expected that you implement gethashcode when you modify equals

2881777
equals	gethashcode
so implementing would be my choice if you implement it it also makes sense to override equals and gethashcode anyway

2881778
equals	gethashcode
either implement equals and gethashcode or create an appropriate which has the right form of equality matching for your map

2881817
stdout	stderr
try redirecting the stdout stderr to see what s happening

2881907
x86	64bit
i ve been asked to create an installer package that checks whether the client already has sql server express 2005 already installed his operating system 64bit vs x86 and install the required sql server instance if needed

2881988
equals	gethashcode
but if you really want to compare the whole objects equality then override the equals method not forgetting gethashcode too and do your equality checking in there

2882017
width	height
so ironically i set about building a set of panels that communicate to each other from the parent panel who ultimately needs to have knowledge of its size right down to the most inner panels so that when my grid component finally gets drawn i can fire a method called onsizeknown int width int height and do whatever sizing is required

2882018
easymock	jmock
or you could use aop but i think using a library like easymock or jmock is going to be the easiest way to go

2882034
nscopying	nsmutablecopying
the easiest way to create a new array containing the same elements as the old array is to use nscopying or nsmutablecopying

2882055
jgroups	jini
but you can also use far more sophisticated solutions like jini or jgroups

2882077
mouse	keyboard
this allows paints mouse movement and keyboard input to work

2882108
portrait	landscape
there can be a keyboard 308px in height in portrait 397px in landscape as well

2882130
stdout	stderr
it looks like i should create a new printstream implementation which sends its output to syslog and redirecting stderr and stdout to that class in jetty-logging.xml

2882158
inherited	subclassing
myapp.h doesn t tell the compiler that subclassing inherited from baseclass - you should probably include baseclass.h and subclass.h in your myapp.h file as long as you have getobject inlined there

2882171
post	get
now in my views.py i get a post with this istruction

2882171
post	get
at this point in my views.py what is the most efficient query with orm to get all comments of that post

2882173
folder	directory
does that mean creating a new sub directory foobar common and placing common.py in that folder

2882225
int	chars
map iterates over the single elements of the string the digits turns them into a string chars 1 becomes the string 1 and read turns them back to an int

2882300
clisp	ecl
i would also propose to switch from xlisp to something like clisp or ecl

2882305
post	get
if you had asked how to get all the comments for multiple post as efficiently as possible i d point you to my blog for a good technique but since you haven t i won t because that would just be blog-whoring

2882330
jsf	wicket
i think that the most obvious upside of gwt it is better scaleable than server side presentation layer technologies such as jsf wicket

2882339
restrict	shared
i should add that the desktop instance allows developers to do things that he dbas often restrict on shared environments

2882354
jar	war
web applications are packaged in war files which are just jar files with a specific layout

2882368
button	checkbox
it seems like there are no way of getting the toolbar background as background on the checkbox and button

2882394
lisp	scheme
for syntax metaprogramming i think scheme is a good option if you hadn t mentioned simplicity etc i d suggest common lisp

2882394
lisp	scheme
if you decide to use a language that s larger and messier than scheme try common lisp

2882451
min	max
if you do want to show the numbers rather than a check or something but only want to allow 0 or 1 you could use a numericupdown control and set min to 0 max to 1 and step to 1

2882457
postgresql	mysql
another way will also work on mysql and postgresql

2882476
versioning	upgrade
so developing on the local copy has all the benefits with no risk in a general case when you support multiple versioning of the system and maintain upgrade scripts anyway

2882515
wordpress	joomla
if you venture out of .net and want to look at php solutions then drupal joomla and wordpress are best solutions

2882517

according to our sysadmin the problem is that the ram that the kernel uses as a disk cache apparently all but 8mb is not freed when the jvm needs to allocate memory so the jvm process throws an outofmemoryerror

2882590
vmware	esx
we are currently using jdk1.6.0_20 on sles 10 sp2 linux 2.6.16.60-0.42.9-smp in vmware esx

2882674
min	max
can i create min and max values that work with dates

2882711
inherited	properties
pom inherited parent properties does not necessarily follow this and is not relevant for the purpose of this question

2882758
ubuntu	linux
some linux versions like ubuntu prefer etc event.d instead of inittab

2882761
integer	fractions
the fld st 0 frndint fsubr st 1 st piece subtracts off the integer part so we re left with only the fractions

2882810
dlsym	dlopen
there are plenty of existing c programs out there that use dlopen dlsym to implement a plugin architecture including more than one irc-related one

2882819
multiplying	add	base	fractions
as you know a fractions power is equivalent to a root and you also know that multiplying powers with the same base is equivalent to add their exponents

2882823
put	get
i m wondering how and at which lifecycle phase i get maven to grab the artifact from the other module and put it insode the appropriate folder of the webapp module

2882860
libsndfile	fftw
then convert all of the samples to ieee floating-point float or double depending on the fftw configuration-- libsndfile can do this for you

2882881
bash	zsh
i usually work with bash but i m trying to setup a cronjob from a machine and user account that is configured with zsh

2882886
integer	unsigned
if you want to try the repeated square root algorithm begin by writing an unsigned integer power function that uses repeated squaring only

2882915
post	get
its been mentioned in other answers about getting the same code running for both the def get self and the def post self for any given request

2882961
width	margin
how do i get the correct margin values given that the browser window width can vary and that all elements that are not the current item should be offscreen

2882974
hide	show
i do show a please wait animation on top of the itemscontrol with the itemscontrol dimmed down as it is working but i d rather not hide the itemscontrol entirely because it gives the user an indication that progress is being made

2882986
int	chars
for example b converts a non-negative python int into an unsigned chars

2883008
disk	ram
according to our sysadmin the problem is that the ram that the kernel uses as a disk cache apparently all but 8mb is not freed when the jvm needs to allocate memory so the jvm process throws an outofmemoryerror

2883022
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen dlsym are probably the easiest way to go

2883033
getter	setter
any ideas or will i have to create fields getter and setter in the child classes

2883052
children	parent
a parent with no children

2883052
children	parent
b parent with children

2883052
children	parent
|- b1 parent with children where no child matches the filter

2883052
children	parent
- b2 parent with children where 1 or more match the filter

2883052
children	parent
in query 1 the where clause is performed after the left join so parent with children where none of the children match the filter are excluded case b1

2883061
integer	fractions	base	fractions
fractions exponents are considerably more difficult since it means essentially calculating an nth-root of the base where and multiplying the result by the result of the integer portion power calculation

2883063
profiling	debugging
that s not debugging symbols which don t affect the code generation that s for profiling which does

2883065
passenger	webrick
the problem is that unless you re also using the webrick mongrel server in actual production doing this will not exactly duplicate your actual production configuration presumably using apache or passenger

2883070
button	checkbox
i m trying to create a set of button which have an off or on state much a checkbox without the check

2883071
children	parent
the first query will return cases where the parent has no children or where some of the children match the filter condition

2883071
children	parent
this is why you are getting more rows in query 2 - parent with children that don t match the filter condition are output with null child values where in the first query they are filtered out

2883072
accessor	properties
i d really like programming languages to introduce a super-private properties field modifier one that basically says you can only access this properties through its accessor

2883078
width	height
you re looping i from 0 to height but then you re using i as your x parameter when creating lines and using width as your y parameter

2883081
hide	show
obviously if you have more than one element and only one can be show at any given time you ll want to have some logic in there to handle the show hide of the non-selected elements

2883092
children	parent
i notice couple of differences that can make the results vary.in the first query you have and then in the second query you have and this makes the second query return all parent with children satisfying your condition where as the first condition will also return the parent wit no children

2883098
postgresql	mysql
i am using both mysql and postgresql but ideally i want the answer to be database agnostic since i try to not get tied down by any particular vendor

2883103
content-length	content-type
charset utf-8 content-length length soapaction string string string string string http 1.1 200 ok content-type text xml

2883103
content-length	content-type
charset utf-8 content-length length string string string string string http 1.1 200 ok content-type application soap+xml

2883105
children	parent
the parent that only have children with won t appear in query 1 because the where clause is evaluated after the rows are joined

2883132
objectdatasource	formview
formview and my objectdatasource

2883144
button	checkbox
you could create a checkbox that looks exactly like a button

2883169
post	get
i would suggest both theoretical and practical reasons why the approach you re using refactoring out the common code to a separate method and calling it from both post and get methods is superior to the apparently-simpler alternative of just having one of those two methods call the other

2883169
post	get
no big deal and you ll have to refactor back to the original nested way if and when you do need to apply tweaks before or after the nested call from get to _run etc or need other tweaks in debugging set a breakpoint in your debugger on post but without having the breakpoint trigger on get etc but a nice little simplification for those times where it s feasible

2883197
google-chrome	firefox
for example i couldn t debug it with firefox nor google-chrome it only worked correctly in ie

2883198
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox 3.6 safari 4 and google-chrome i keep the background-color in the body for any browsers that for some reason don t support styling the html tag

2883246
hash	md5
apply md5 hash about big file any performance problem

2883246
hash	md5
if i only check without generate md5 hash length of files original and copied

2883320
serializable	deserialization
the serializable form has enough information such that the deserialization process will produce an identical object without any additional help

2883322
hash	md5
install a md5 checker on each server and make it a local process so you don t have to use bandwidth to recheck the hash

2883362
jdk1.6	jdk1.4
i was able to do it in jdk1.6 software but not in jdk1.4

2883373
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox a shows in the middle on google-chrome ie it doesn t

2883386
cpu	processors
on an old compaq 1ghz 1 processors machine i was able to create about 10 000 counters and monitor them remotely for about 20 cpu usage

2883418
hash	md5
to send the files again just to compare them is of course not practical but sending the md5 hash of the file is

2883418
hash	md5
the md5 hash at least saves you a lot of network traffic

2883453
google-chrome	firefox
i need it to work for google-chrome ie and firefox

2883460
post	get
but now i want to get the same result in my c# code post this string 100 as post-value and request as post-key to the action uri

2883480
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if by ie you mean ie 8 then web storage is supported in ie 8 firefox 2+ officially from 3.5 safari 4 google-chrome 4 and opera 10.50

2883480
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies providing much greater storage capacity 5mb per domain in mozilla firefox google-chrome and opera 10mb per storage area in internet explorer and better programmatic interfaces

2883485
super	implements
the hollow or white as i perceive it arrow means that this method does not override a super class method but implements specified in an interface

2883494
profiling	instrumentation
is the profiling code inserting instrumentation calls in enough functions to hurt you

2883581
post	get
scott guthrie has a nice blog post on how to enable get on web methods

2883581
post	get
the is the key passing an object makes .load do a post instead of a get

2883590
free	malloc
in the second example ld_preload is used to intercept calls to malloc free

2883608
post	get
as a result each url which is used for both get and post should have specific actions that differ based on the type of request

2883608
post	get	getter	setter
i tend to think of get and post like a getter and a setter

2883608
post	get
post s change data and get s get data

2883608
post	get
as a result a simple search can use get all day long but when you save a setting back to the server a post is in order

2883608
post	get
you could then use get to get the blog post and render it to screen with a nice comment form

2883638
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to create a simple menu using li elements but it only works on ie7 in firefox and google-chrome the alignment get weird

2883666
ienumerable	ilist
make sure your collection type ienumerable ilist etc matches what type of collection you are sending in your controller along with the type of the actual object in the collection

2883684
cpu	hyperthreading
it has the i7 620m dual core hyperthreading cpu running at 2.66ghz and 8 gb of memory

2883685
squash	branch	squash	merge
i canâ t seem to get my merge intact with magit for emacs without squash them into the current branch consistently

2883691
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

2883729
post	get
for example when a user edits some data the browser will send the changes using an ajax post and then do an ajax get to get fresh content and replace an existing div on the page with that content

2883778
squash	merge
if you would like to squash the merge have git avoid creating a merge commit then use a prefix argument with the command

2883795
maven	pom.xml
you ll need to add this to your maven pom.xml file in the section

2883797
children	parent
i m trying to delete a child using the parent repository by removing it from the parent s children collection

2883798
xslt	xquery
xslt has proven itself to be both a powerful and adaptable language but now we can also choose xquery

2883798
xslt	xquery
xslt 2.0 xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0 are just the same query language dressed up in different forms

2883866
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
if you have a variable there are two ways to read and set properties which are usually a combination of an ivar and accessor methods

2883866
accessor	ivar
the way around this problem is to use accessor which are methods that control access to an ivar

2883866
getter	setter
in objective-c getter get the variable and are usually named the same thing as the variable so in the person example the getter would be - int age and setter set the variable it would be named - void setage int theage

2883866
accessor	ivar
if you use accessor you can freely change your implementation in the future even getting rid of the ivar completely if necessary without reliant classes breaking

2883866
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
in objective-c the combination of an ivar and accessor is often called a properties although there doesn t necessary have to be an ivar if the value is dynamically created

2883875
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade the .rdlc to the newest versioning and also upgrade the reportviewer control used by asp.net

2883888
hide	show
can i user jquery to show hide a specific div on another page

2883888
hide	show
i dont want the show hide box to scroll to show the rest of the page detailed content..

2883917
django	turbogears	django	web.py	turbogears	cherrypy	web.py	cherrypy	web.py	turbogears
you mention django which is the most popular although i like turbogears cherrypy and web.py

2883923
inherited	properties
the selectedvalue properties is inherited from the listcontrol control

2883940
hide	show
then you can hide show the number of panels using .slice

2883953
hide	show
possible duplicate of showing and hiding a div with jquery and or using jquery to show and hide different div s onclick event

2883953
hide	show
selecting an element by id in jquery is #idname and show hide are simply .show and hide so for your elements

2884019
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns an identifier that you need to store in order to properly cancel it with clearinterval

2884068
dictionary	map
what is the difference between a map and a dictionary

2884080
innodb	myisam
mysql won t make the row available until it s done reading it automatically acquires a table lock in the case of myisam or a row lock in the case of innodb

2884086
dictionary	map
typically the term dictionary was used before the mathematical term map took hold

2884097
integer	unsigned
x is unsigned integer which must be checked to be greater than 0 and less than y

2884097
integer	unsigned
y is unsigned integer

2884097
int	double
now later if i need to change the attribute of y to a float double would there be another way to optimize the check i.e will the suggested optimal technique for int become non-optimal solution when y is changed to float double

2884202
qobject	qwidget	qobject	qlist	qobject	qvector	qlist	qvector
as qt often requires a qlist or qvector some qobject or qwidget is there any concrete reason why auto_ptr should be avoided

2884239
int	double
with this strategy you can have any number length and only really have to hold enough digits in memory for an int divisor and double dividend

2884243
titlebar	window
the dialog is launching but there s no background and so the text below it shows through and there s no window stuff at all no titlebar no x button

2884250
put	get
i m wondering how and at which lifecycle phase i get maven to grab the artifact from the other module and put it insode the appropriate folder of the webapp module

2884252
post	get
for that i want to login within my php code after receiving username and password in post but i don t know how i can get only cookies in response

2884254
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
for dynamically allocated memory i use calloc rather than malloc and memset

2884286
memset	calloc
only use memset on dynamically-allocated buffers and then prefer calloc

2884325
put	get
as usual i query a database to get a result iterate throught he result and put the records into an assciateiave array

2884327
division	multiplication
in particular the newton-raphson method when implemented carefully can ensure that the time performance of your division is within a constant factor of your arbitrary-precision multiplication

2884409
post	get
change your type from post to get

2884519
jruby	mri
i m also moving from the ruby mri to the latest version of jruby as well

2884555
width	height
so in that example the width height of the image file is at 4x what is displayed obviously the source image need to have that quality to start with

2884566
pull	push
these are known as pull and push processing

2884591
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to windows 7 not sure if that s related and after re-installing flex 3 i get the error that i m using a non-debug versioning of flash player when trying to run debug on a project

2884654
division	subtract
the easiest division algorithm to implement for large numbers is shift and subtract

2884657
width	height
another option is to set the width and or the height to â œautoâ

2884657
width	height
this way every column row changes its size so as to match the width height of the controls in it

2884690
webclient	httpwebrequest
i have tried .net s webclient and httpwebrequest objects and it looks like neither can support redirects

2884729
getter	setter
so if you want to change the property getter setter you don t have to think do i need to duplicate the same functionality elsewhere in the places where i decided to access the private member directly

2884756
cpython	ironpython
it runs with cpython 2.5 and jython 2.5 but i never tried it with ironpython

2884798
filtering	grouping
this board can grouping and filtering by various ways so a developer can see all their own tasks but then they can change the filtering to view all the tasks on the project

2884807
getter	setter
you should always use properties even though your getter or setter just get or set your private member

2884808
put	get
alternatively it would not take much at all too cook up a custom data table which you can feed in multiple queries at once in whatever format you want to put in or get out

2884816
versioning	upgrade
i d like to apply this patch or if there is a newer versioning of the perl tk module i can upgrade to that includes this patch already that doesn t require i change the versioning of perl do that

2884816
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
1a if there is a newer tk versioning that includes the patch in the link above how do i upgrade just that module in the specific perl installation location for this app

2884820
spaces	delimiter
choose delimiter by spaces

2884874
memcpy	memmove
i have never really used memmove or memcpy very much

2884874
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strncpy	memmove	strncpy
however i am just wondering when would you decide whether to use strncpy memmove or memcpy

2884885
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
in this case i would suggest that argumentexception but not argumentnullexception may be appropriate

2884902
post	get
when sending large files 9mb+ over the form i get a very odd behaviour the post data i ve included in the form dissapears including the file information

2884902
post	get
i ve already increased all php limits i could time limit max input time post max size memory limit and upload max filesize and i still can t get the proper behaviour

2884915
memmove	strncpy
if you know the lengths of the strings memmove is a sensible choice - and nominally faster than strncpy because it does not have to check for nulls as it goes

2884915
memcpy	memmove
i pretend memcpy doesn t exist as it can fail if the source and destination areas of memory overlap whereas memmove will get it right regardless.

2884918
getter	setter
- getter and setter

2884968
slideup	slidedown
the span is the downloading button and i have it animated so that the span calls slideup then should change the text then return by slidedown .here is the code i am using that does not want to work

2884975
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
do you have a top level view something like a uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller

2884976
typedef	struct
you have to adapt a little bit split.awk wich is somewhat specific to my code and refactoring needs for example y have so struct who are not typedef

2884995
accessor	properties
these are placed in the setters of the properties accessor

2885070
jquery	nyromodal
or is it the jquery plugin nyromodal

2885102
width	margin
automatically creates columns with fixed width consistent margin

2885163

simply put get a reference to your textbox save the password to a value elsewhere in your code and set the value attribute since the controls are rendered as an html form element anyway to whatever you want

2885276
ubuntu	freebsd
the script needs to work on current installations of ubuntu and freebsd

2885277
min	max
but you can easily do it just by setting the min and max smaller larger and checking the value in the valuechanged event

2885280
std	ostream	ostream	istream
i would like to use the istream connection in a std ostream

2885298
width	height
width and height properties are overriden so that my class always remembers it s requested size not just bounding size around content and also those properties explicitly set scalex and scaley to 1 so that no scaling would ever be involved

2885325
post	get
you have your data as a get string but you are using a post request try changing your string variable to an object

i m experiencing what seems to be a caching issue with google-chrome and safari on my cart page

2885338
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be a caching problem however i ve got some no-cache code to prevent caching of that page that works great in firefox and internet explorer but seems to be failing in google-chrome and safari

2885356
client-side	server-side
it didn t work out too well as i ve burnt out from trying to fix cross browser issues aka get-it-to-work-on-ie-damn-it handling server-side client-side and building a robust communication between the two tier had lot of code not related to application logic....by the time i was burnt out only tiny bit of application logic was implemented

2885658
qgroupbox	qscrollarea
i have a qgroupbox inside a qscrollarea

2885763
ubuntu	linux
if you do want to try linux ubuntu is easy to setup and a popular one

packets	multicast
create your own rarp reverse address resolution table based on the ethernet or whatever and ip headers you see as well as actual arp packets ignoring broadcast and multicast ip and mac addresses

2885781
packets	multicast
you could also use destination ip addresses that aren t multicast in packets that came from the gateway for this but you would have to know the gateway before you could flag them as such

2885801
cassini	iis
i created a new mvc project which runs in cassini just fine but when i create a new iis application for it and point it to the mvc project i am unable to navigate to it in the browser and get a 404 error

turns out the namespace prefix was needed for firefox internet explorer and not for safari so now according to the agent.

2885905
submit	submission
once i did this my form wasn t submission i thought this was because of the event i added- if i remove that click event it submit the form successfully

2886454
javassist	cglib
of course if you re feeling brave and adventurous you could generate the implementation of your command objects and the implementation of the combiner interface using dynamic class generation with cglib javassist orther dynamic bytecode generator

2886469

sqlbuddy might look cute be fast and better than phpmyadmin but it has its limitations

2886494
hash	md5	phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
it doesn t let you convert data upon insert i mean say you want to enter data directly into the database like a user and the password field stores a sha1 hash of the password phpmyadmin lets you convert your input to sha1 md5 and more sqlbuddy doesn t

i have cruisecontrol 1.5 running in win2k8r2 and svn 1.6.9 the error happens on a successful build after nant 0.86 timeout 600 seconds

2886769
gmail	hotmail
if you follow guidelines for double-opt-in unsubscribe links on every email handling abuse reports this will improve the recipients not marking your email as spam - because if enough people within gmail yahoo hotmail mark your email as spam it will go into the spam folder by default sometimes even if other good practices are being followed

2886772
packets	multicast
you can run this script multiple times on one host and see the multicast packets distributed

2886802

fontfamily	font-size
that only the font-size is been set is probably because the yui guys would like to keep the form controls their own browser-default fontfamily which is sans-serif for input and select and is monospace for textarea

2886983
strlen	strcpy
functions like strlen and strcpy need to work on 0 terminated strings in order to know when to stop

2887211
client-side	server-side
this was what i was doing on lamp stack....but i want to switch to vaadin or some java web framework where i can just use java to do everything from server-side to client-side logic design so i can focus more on application logic

2887248
sorting	filtering
the tables had sorting filtering and paging of course on server side and with help of the db

2887248
sorting	filtering
all databases have implemented sorting filtering -where and limit the returned results

2887248
sorting	filtering
they implement pagination sorting and filtering on client side

2887248
sorting	filtering
i have not seen any good jsf data grid that has build in features for sorting filtering and lazy loading on the server side

2887248
sorting	filtering
is there any datatable jsf component than can perform lazy load pagination and filtering and sorting on server side

2887248
sorting	filtering
if i need to implement my own solution thanks to the teams that made client side sorting and filtering they are useless

2887251
postgresql	mysql
if you re used to mysql and altering tables you mentioned issues there can be a nightmare mostly its better in postgresql

2887278
hide	show
you can actually load all your data in your query and store them somewhere for examples in divs and for the first div you show 5 rows and for the rest of the divs that contains 5 rows each you hide them initially on and when more link is clicked you show them again

2887304
fast-forward	merge
whereas this would have been a fast-forward merge

2887326
onmousedown	onmouseup
but if both onmousedown and onmouseup are handled nothing would change visually

pop-up	dialog
i ve tried the following but it still pop-up the dialog box

2887354
width	height
for a width or height

2887357
put	get
as for testing you probably want to put all your validation subs into a module and use normal perl testing tools see test simple and test more to get started

2887392
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
in transformedvalue you go straight from nsdata to nsimage but in reversetransformedvalue you go from nsimage to nsbitmapimagerep to nsdata

2887392
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
the data in your model is actually nsbitmapimagerep data and not nsimage data

2887422
toolbar	docking
if all you really need is the docking floating toolbar and no other windows you can use the toolbar class in conjunction with the toolbartray class

2887517
std	ostream
if you ostream will be defined in the std namespace

2887544
ant	maven
but instead of doing that always manually i d recommend that you take a look at a build tool such as ant or maven but that s probably a bit harder to get started with which are very commonly used to automate these kind of build sequences

2887682
equals	compareto
it could use equals hashcode or compareto of the element

2887685
serializable	deserialization
my understanding is serialversionuid is applicable only to classes because we can create an object only to classes and the concept of serialversionuid is for object serializable and deserialization

2887695
equals	compareto
generally hash based collections use hashcode and tree based ones use compareto or a comparator and all of them use equals

2887698
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you use an objectoutputstream you have to use an objectinputstream to read it

2887728
int	chars
even if i changed the int into chars for the same of testing save the file and re-run the command i get the same error

2887738
libjpeg	libpng
gd library requires libpng and libjpeg to compile

2887757

sending a message to an incompletely-initialized or incompletely-deallocated object is asking for trouble particularly when subclassing are involved since they may override the accessor methods in ways the superclass doesn t expect

2887761
equals	compareto
if nullpointerexception is appropriate for compareto why isn t it for equals

2887761
comparator	comparable
comparable and comparator contract with regards to null

2887769
typeerror	traceback
traceback typeerror expected string or buffer

2887828
versioning	upgrade
if i copy the resources to my application tree i need to perform additional maintenance each time i upgrade to a newer versioning

2887832
width	height
you binding is working you border has no content so it s only consist of a border itself but you setting background property not the borderbrush so actualy you background has no area also you don t set borderthickness so actually you have border with 0 width and 0 height

2887832
width	height
so set borderthickness width or height

2887909
rss	feed
i m currently trying to write a simple script that looks in a folder and returns a list of all the file names in an rss feed

2887913
awt	swing
j2me doesn t support awt or swing but has it s on ui classes

cldc	midp
cldc with midp 2.0 has a 2d api look at google maps mobile or opera mobile and can handle most of the typical tasks appets are used for

2887960
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button would be appropriate for this for both websites and desktop applications

2887960
button	checkbox
in my case i d use the faculty names as headers and then add the according specialities below them prefixed by checkbox and radio button next to each speciality allowing the user to set the priority

2887994
put	get
i am trying to put all the projects in the combo but i get external plugin libraries as shown in the picture below

2888048
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
if so you can take each character s ascii value perform the necessary checking to make sure it s in the appropriate range subtract the value of 0 from it multiplying it by 10 to the power of its position numbered in reverse order starting from 0 and then add it to a total value

2888083
switching	screens
on my iphone simulator this screens works correctly and the switching text shows as on off

2888089
udp	tcp
here s an example of simple threaded tcp server and you may want to look at udp as well

2888092
pull	push
since it is bare you can push to it as well as pull from it if needed

2888145
jar	war
at the end of the maven build we have a few jar and war files that we need to deploy onto our development testing environment

2888149
curses	readline
one could also support input with the gnu readline support already included as a standard library in python curses support also included and one could imagine writing some html wrapper and cgi code for handling web-based input

2888193
maven	cargo
yes take a look at the cargo plugin for maven

2888219
qcodo	qcubed
i have been using qcodo qcubed for developing cms based sites

2888219
symfony	kohana
i have not tried zend symfony kohana or other frameworks of discusson on reddit

2888226
folder	directory
by using the vm s shared folder support you can use the same directory for local development using your windows ide and serving requests from the web server inside the vm

2888293
comparator	comparable
other classes use equals if the collection is guaranteed to have only one copy of the object or comparator if the elements are supposed to be comparable and the collection is sorted to find the right place to insert it at

2888307
mouseover	mouseout
however it does not remove the effects of the events as the events are still triggered on mouseover and on mouseout

2888312
maven	m2e
now m2e - maven for eclipse can download sources automatically as well

2888316
ant	maven
2 the other way is to use maven instead of ant

2888329
getter	setter
i would like to know if it is possible in struts2 to map an html form s fields to those of an action automatically without getter and setter

2888329
getter	setter
it is clear that by getter and setter or the parameteraware interface and the map fields can be set in the action but i just wanted to know if otherwise there was a way

2888336
ant	maven
there is proguard with ant and maven plugins

2888343
postgresql	mysql
note this happens while unit testing only - the actual page runs fine in both mysql postgresql

2888355
mouseover	mouseout
to get and set mouseover and mouseout events in jquery use .mouseover and .mouseout

2888466
ready	each
that said i have used files in the past to pass information between processes although typically either new filenames will be created each time or files will be used to pass large amounts of data and a smaller ipc message will be used to signal when the file is ready

2888500
sitecore	umbraco
the amaxus sitecore and umbraco content management systems all use xslt as a method of rendering content into markup

2888544
xslt	xquery
in xpath 2.x this also means xslt 2.x and xquery 1.x

2888758
hex	binary
if i hex dump the binary they are aligned closely one by one with a 0x0000 as separator

2888760
x86	64bit
after finding no patch by microsoft s visual studio team i changed the platform target from any cpu to x86 redeployed it to the 64bit os and saw program operate correctly

2888781
document.write	settimeout
if you re doing this with code executed during the page parse which is the only place you can use document.write rather than in code you trigger with an event handler after the page is parsed you can t use settimeout

2888790
screens	hdpi
they are both hdpi devices so android should use the same resources when drawing the screens

2888812
google-chrome	firefox
save png etc. work in this demo in firefox but not google-chrome

2888812
google-chrome	firefox
convert to png etc. work in firefox and google-chrome

2888833
google-chrome	firefox
this demo shows how to save locally -- though for me at least save png etc. work in firefox but not google-chrome

2888840
spaces	delimiter
also include a flag that lets you set the delimiter used between attributes for output - comma separated is a common choice but you might also just want a spaces a carrage return new line or whatever else

2888881
maven	cargo
deployment in general is not easy and often very specific and while the cargo maven plugin may help for the remote deployment of war ear if remote deployment for your app server is implemented i don t think it will cover all your needs

2888956
hash	salt
typical workflow would involve generating a salt value and using that to hash the password and then storing them both in the row

2888956
hash	salt
if you truly just want a way to quickly hash or encrypt without salt take a look at formsauthentication.hashpasswordforstoringinconfigfile

2888969
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this code should now work in firefox 1.0+ safari 3.1+ google-chrome opera 9.6+ and possibly others untested so far

2889035
memcpy	strcpy
in this file i copy the members of origine to destinazione first only using assignments and strcpy then i copy origine to memres using only memcpy

2889078
queue	fifo
the idea is to start by placing a random node into a fifo queue also here

2889078
queue	fifo
color its neighbors with a different color than the extracted element and insert enqueue each neighbour into the fifo queue

2889108
mouseleave	mouseenter
in jquery there are two more events mouseenter and mouseleave

2889108
mouseover	mouseenter
these are similar but mouseenter does not fire upon moving the mouse from a child element to the main element whereas mouseover will fire the event again

2889108
mouseout	mouseleave
the same logic applies to mouseleave vs mouseout

2889128
versioning	upgrade
i believe the server automatically upgrade the versioning of wordpress

2889168
telerik	componentart
you can also you a native asp.net treeview that supports checkboxes such as componentart s or telerik s

2889173
put	get
to get your ui to be responsive you either have to put the work on another thread generally with a backgroundworker or tell the ui to repaint itself in the ui thread

2889231
client-side	server-side
you can send a client-side variable s value from the client to the server for server-side processing

2889234
codeigniter	kohana
regarding codeigniter and it s fork kohana both are extremely fast and lightweight - they provide a small learning curve that allows developers to get things done quickly

2889255
pop-up	dialog
when the use clicks close i pop-up a message dialog asking him a question

2889258
google-chrome	firefox
currently sts is only supported by google-chrome but firefox is working on their supporting this feature

2889300
springlayout	miglayout
i ll have a look at miglayout and springlayout later

2889344
boxlayout	miglayout
flowlayout or boxlayout will work in your case but i would suggest miglayout simply because it will cover all your needs and replace all others

2889388
post	get
every activity or service that makes a get or post to this remote server calls the same method myutilityclass.getthttpclient

2889396
getter	setter
first instead of thinking in terms of with fields with getter and setter you are advised to think in terms of bean properties here

2889406
rss	feed
let s say that it s an rss feed item s url called item.link

2889415
mouse	keyboard
so basically i wanna keep looping if the user hasn t clicked the mouse or pressed a key in the keyboard yet

2889417
awt	swing
use swing not awt so use jpanel

2889455
printf	strncpy
first as andreyt noted in the comments to this question truncation methods printf strlcpy and strncpy are often not a good solution

2889473
hash	md5
it is trivial to use a secure hash function like sha-256 and continuing to use md5 for security is reckless behavior

2889473
hash	md5
according to nist md5 is not a secure hash function

2889473
hash	hmac
according to schneier a hash function vulnerable to a collision attack can still be used as an hmac

2889473
hash	hmac
what hash function vulnerabilities would undermine the security of an hmac

2889473
salt	md5
keep in mind the md4 and md5 attacks are prefixing attacks and if a salt is prepended then an attacker cannot control the prefix of the message

2889477
strcpy	strncpy
some nice libc versions provide non-standard but great replacement for strcpy 3 strncpy 3 - strlcpy 3

2889499
postgresql	mysql
comparison of full text search engine - lucene sphinx postgresql mysql

2889515
folder	directory
these are stored in a mynetwork directory stats folder on my network drive

2889520
hash	hmac
according to schneier a hash function vulnerable to a collsion attack can still be used as an hmac

2889520
hash	salt
for instance if the hash was h pass + salt we d need a preimage attack which allows us to find pass2 such that

2889542
folder	directory
i created a virtual directory in iis housing the master folder containing the master files

2889558
google-chrome	safari
i have confirmed that my control adapters are not triggering in google-chrome and safari

2889558
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve debugged and the breakpoints inside the adapters just don t get hit in google-chrome safari when they work perfectly find in firefox ie

2889558
google-chrome	safari
so for google-chrome safari iis is just ignoring the mapping

2889575
vim	emacs
engineers in large semiconductor companies are using emacs vim for code editing

2889575
jobs	cron
integrated development environment doesn t make much sense there since a project is a few thousand hdl files taken from different places on a nix network setup scripts for a dozen different tools and cron jobs to do frequent builds

2889637
folder	directory
bit longer you will have to edit the apache config at least to give it permission to access the web directory so even if you symlink your web folder to var www it will not work

2889649
integer	unsigned
have the first 4 bytes of the message represent the length of the message as an unsigned integer

2889683
margin	height
if you really mean on top of the cap height and not somehow inside the cap height margin then you can apply the css padding to either the font element or its parent container

2889722
int	chars
but i get the following error invalid conversion from chars to int

2889726
onresume	onpause
depending on the usage pattern i would probably also cache the thumbnails to the sd card so it would be cheap to free the ram they use in onstop onpause and reload them in onstart onresume

2889732
folder	directory
on a whim i ended up removing the .ruby_inline directory in my home folder and that resolved the issue

2889766
put	get
it seems to me the best way to do this is to put my filetype specific settings in after ftplugin so they don t get overwritten and filetypes.vim in after for the same reason

2889777
treemap	linkedhashmap
what is the difference between hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap in java

2889783
treemap	linkedhashmap
for details look at the javadoc of treemap hashmap linkedhashmap

2889796
put	get
it supports o 1 get put operations

2889796
put	get
its put get operations take o log n time

2889796
comparator	comparable
it requires items to have some comparison mechanism either with comparable or comparator

2889799
width	height
iframe src width 100 height 595px frameborder 0

2889864
put	get	salt	md5
then you can call user.create_user_with_digest name bob and you ll get a digest created automatically and assigned to the user you probably want to generate the api key with another library than md5 such as sha256 you should also probably put some user enterable field a continuously increasing number such as the current date-time and a salt as well

2889872
clearance	devise
but you should definitely take a look at devise authlogic or clearance gems

2889895
centos	linux
i have some old build scripts available that may or may not save you some pain if you re compiling on linux centos in particular but you could make it work pretty easily on non-redhat distros too

2889910
button	checkbox
we are not supposed to use an actionlistener for each checkbox but rather get the list when a button is clicked

2889910
button	checkbox
ideally i d like to somehow add all the checkbox to an array and loop through the array in the button s action listener to determine which ones are checked but if i have to check each one individually i will

2889917
vbscript	jscript
you can set it up by configuration changing the default langauge from vbscript to jscript or you can do it explicitly per-file

2889933
post	get
or do you feel that it would be wiser to just have them send the api key in each request using the post get vars

2889939
button	checkbox
you may then iterate through the list of checkbox in the button action-code using a for-each loop construct

2889950
hash	md5
download sites use md5 hash as a checksum to determine if the file was corrupted during download and i would say a broken hash is good enough for that purpose

2889990
affinity	processors
setting an affinity mask for a process or thread can result in threads receiving less processors time as the system is restricted from running the threads on certain processors

2889997
integer	fractions
if you want to take the modulo of a fractions type you can convert to an integer first

2889997
integer	fractions
fromintegral will convert any integer type into any number type floor ceiling and round will convert fractions types to integral types

2890032
moq	mspec
i have started to use mspec for bdd and since long ago i use moq as my mocking framework

2890072
codeigniter	kohana
go for kohana the improved alternative of codeigniter

2890081
superclass	subclassing
you could try subclassing listview and overriding layoutchildren to chain to the superclass then call setselection 0 in the case where that is needed

2890086
getter	setter
the getter and the setter have the same type

2890086
getter	setter
another potential problem is that some reflection utilities may not recognize your getter setter pair if they don t have the same type

2890107
multiplying	add
one way to get a better distribution is to multiplying a member by a prime number and add the next member repeating as needed

2890153
range	max
divide the result by the max possible value for the number of bits supplied which i think should give you a decimal evenly distributed in the range 0-1

2890174
django	turbogears
is it true in other mvc frameworks too like cakephp symfony django or turbogears

2890199
ropemacs	pymacs
i use pymacs to load ropemacs and rope with the following lines in my .emacs file as described here

2890206
post	get
i know a redirect can kill a post request as it gets converted into a get request

2890270
inherited	subclassing
in python you can change the inherited of a class at runtime but at every given time a class is not a subclassing of another one unless declared otherwise

2890279
rss	feed
so i have an rss feed with variations of each item

2890290
nsstring	nsdata
the dictionary must contain only property list objects instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary

2890299
int	boolean
basically numbers including int and uints strings boolean null and undefined have value type semantics

2890307
metaclass	subclassing
it is possible to have a metaclass or a class decorator i suppose replace some object that came from a class definition with an actual subclassing after the enclosing parent class has been created

2890324
width	height
it subdivides 2-d space in order to accomodate items identified by their bounding box x y width height on the smallest possible quad up to a minimum area

2890327
subtract	add
i am trying to find the easiest way to add subtract a scalar value with a opencv 2.0 cv mat class

2890347
lisp	scheme
i ve played around with a few functional programming languages and really enjoy the s-expr syntax used by lisp scheme in particular

2890347
lisp	scheme
are there any purely functional scheme or lisp in general

2890362
treemap	linkedhashmap
use both a linkedhashmap and a treemap and update the two in parallel

2890362
treemap	linkedhashmap
create a custom fascade class for a linkedhashmap and a treemap

2890410
firefox	safari
i think you should get decent results in all browsers but it s normal that web pages in safari or firefox look better than in internet explorer 7

2890418
maven	m2e
m2e provides the ability to create a maven module

2890430
lisp	scheme
are there any purely functional scheme or lisp in general

2890436
hide	show
show and hide as

2890437

put	get
where do the crash files get put

2890624
nginx	lighttpd
and three web servers i tested apache2 lighttpd nginx pass this string as-is to the

and raw response of apache nginx and lighttpd http_cookie cgi variable

2890673
portrait	landscape
now rotating the device shows uiwebview in a weird width in one of the orientation if u zoom in landscape the portrait width is weird vice versa

2890771
uilabel	uibutton
i have a mainuiview that is subclass from uiview it have a uibutton and a uilabel

2890775
daemons	systemd
i d suggest building a message queueing systemd into your program or if there s an option for it into your sendmail daemons to limit to 50 messages per hour per receiving host and test the water

2890790
post	get
i was having issues with my encoding between a desktop application sqlite and get post variables

2890790
post	get
it scrubs your get post request i omitted cookies but you could add them if desired on each page load before processing

2890803
metaclass	subclassing	metaclass	superclass	superclass	subclassing
you might be able to do that in smalltalk by modifying or subclassing the behavior class which is the superclass of class and defines the behavior of both classes and metaclass

2890807
firefox	safari
it works great in firefox but for some reason in safari it refreshes the page to

2890816
integer	unsigned
if you want to work with numbers bigger than the range of uint64_t 2 64 -1 64 bit integer unsigned then you should look into bignum

2890858
16-bit	64bit
given that the pdp-11 is a 16-bit processor you d be much better off running your c through a compiler that will produce 16-bit code instead of the 64bit code you ve posted

2890934
int	chars
doing so will also allow you be able to infer a column s data type such as int chars bigint etc

2890935
queue	fifo
put each message on the fifo queue and you will have all the information you need to identify who sent it

2890940
min	max
you need to perform a groupwise max or groupwise min

for that period you can use the free sub-domain provided by the free host and when you ve got it all worked out you may then either upgrade your plan to premium or migrate to a premium host and buy a domain name as well

2892506
jboss	glassfish
this would only lead to collisions in the classpath which leads to this kind of errors and it will make your webapp unportable it is tied to run on tomcat only you can t run it at another servers like glassfish jboss websphere etc

2892506
libs	buildpath
this way eclipse will automatically add the server-specific libs to the project s buildpath

now remove either width or height and it will vanish

2892787
int	chars
also why precede main with an int if you re returning a chars string

2892794
int	chars
since this is an int and not a string it returns int not chars or

2892804
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am pushing a uiviewcontroller onto a uinavigationcontroller

2892827
integer	fractions
there are two distinct cases to deal with integer exponents and fractions exponents

2892827

similarly to calculate 2 x you can multiply 2 integer part of x 2 fractions part of x

2892838
int	chars
also why precede main with an int if you re returning a chars string

2892859
folder	directory
anyway i create a core repository inside the live mesh folder and then clone from that to a working directory

2892892

ps on the other hand my another webpage mywebform2 in same website has only rss feed and works very well

2893104
apache	lighttpd
document_root may work differently between server configurations apache vs iis vs lighttpd vs nginex

2893156
int	chars
for instance while it can be represented with 4 8-bit bytes and hence fits in a php int you may wish to represent that number in base 10 in a string and then it can have 10 chars unsigned since 2 32-1 is 4294967295

2893165
jquery	scriptaculous
i d recommend just using jquery and getting rid of prototype and scriptaculous .

2893215
post	get
why not make a post get call directly

2893239

pop-up	dialog
2 you override onclose or something like that to pop-up a dialog to ask the user a question

2893267

2893271
bibtex	latex
latex users tend to be better that word users in this respect and i think that it is because of bibtex

according to w3schools it is supported in ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

2893411
switching	screens
fine but you re only told how to do that and nothing about the problems that can follow for example if i use their paradigm to switching to a uinavigationviewcontroller the navigation bar ends up too low on the screens because uinavigationviewcontroller expects to be the topmost uiviewcontroller apparently

2893513
arp	dhcp
independent of dhcp or not any connected computer that wishes to communicate with the outside world will have to make an arp request for the address of the default router

2893513
arp	dhcp
if the other computer uses dhcp it will make an arp request for it s own address as part of duplicate address detection which is also a broadcast you can snoop on

2893560
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events.

2893571

2893843
nginx	cherokee
i m not specifically asking for a comparison to nginx or cherokee

2893973
getter	setter
i have avoided using as3 s implicit getter setter partly so that i can just start typing get.. and content assist will give me a list of all my getter and likewise for my setter

2893973
getter	setter
after installing flash builder and the great new plugin sourcemate which helps to get some of the useful features that fdt is famous into fb i realized that when i use sourcemate s generate getter and setter feature it automatically sets my code up using the implicit route

2894141
aim	instant
specifically i am talking about using aim and sending instant messages to an existing aim screename

2894191
ready	each
bottom line is the worker has to wait each time it asks the producer to create work for itself so that the producer can muck with the worker s data structures before telling the worker it is ready to run in parallel again

2894219
getter	setter
keep in mind that if all you re doing is straight get set there isn t a whole lot lost by just exposing a public var and bypassing the getter setter with the holding var _variable

2894244
filtering	grouping
i have the following compiled query that i want to return a list of grouping that don t have a groupid that s contained in a filtering list

2894249
getter	setter
another advantage to getter setter is that you can always make properties simple public variables initially and refactor them into getter setter later if needed without changing external code

2894266
awt	swing
you can use component.setname to give names to swing and awt components

2894270
versioning	upgrade
the difficult problem is if you have alive anywhere instances of classes that existed in the previous versioning of the module reload per se will do absolutely nothing to upgrade those instances

2894272
cos	sqrt
the ideas of distance and angle are replaced by quadrance and spread which don t involve sqrt and cos

2894496
hash	hmac
hmac security relies on an other property that the hash function must fulfill

2894496
hash	hmac
note though that the forgery attack has cost 2 58 which is quite high no actual forgery was produced the result is still theoretical but substantially lower than the resistance level expected from hmac with a robust hash function with an n -bit output hmac should resist up to 2 n work factor

2894515
twig	smarty
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho

2894521
ant	maven
some people use eclipse some people use ant and others use maven or apache maven2

2894521
ant	maven
if you were to create a project from scratch then maven or ant is probably the ideal way to go

2894521
ant	maven
if the project already uses maven or ant loading it with other ides should be fairly simple while if the project uses a specific ide s quirks or uses some more exotic build system it may be harder

2894530
client-side	server-side
the only way to prevent against these attacks is to sanitize and validate input on the server-side instead of or in addition to client-side validation

2894556
folder	directory
is there a folder in the domain directory of weblogic where files put inside can be accessed directly from web browser

2894608
post	get
we have a considerable code base with relatively high test coverage for pages forms all via vanilla post get

2894608
post	get
now we are find ourselves moving more into the ajaxy space and it s not quite possible to test with get post complete scenarios like user registration or an item creation as they involve lots of javascript ajax calls

2894608
post	get
while things like that are the most likely candidates for testing with selenium i wonder should we adopt the selenium testing across the board leaving the old-school post get tests altogether

2894608
post	get
advantages of selenium adoption seems to be too good - ability to run pretty much same get post tests but across the range of browsers

2894608
post	get
or am i missing something in my pursuit of cool and trendy stuff and ditching the old proven post get tests

2894611

i m trying to create a thumbnail generator in php with gd that will take an image and reduce it to a fixed width height

2894732
width	height
the square it takes from the original image based on my fixed width height will come from the center of the image to give a proportionally correct thumbnail

2894732
width	height
it seems simple in theory to get the height width of the image and then calculate the offset based on my fixed width height to get the thumbnail

2894738
