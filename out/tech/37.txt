versioning	upgrade
but after upgrade to mysql 5.x versioning this php source can t send form data info to other page

3700137
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
you reset the fx.morph options every mouseover event where there are no changes although you seem to have a different duration for mouseenter and mouseleave - this is expensive

3700137
children	parent
another possible improvement here would be the use of event delegation event bubbling will cause events to fire up the dom tree to the parent mootools has an api to deal with it so you can add singular events to parent elements and not have to attach nnn events to all children - look it up

3700187
ienumerable	ilist
edit the other method with the predicate which i now see you are talking about is not as optimised and relies on the ienumerable interface to perform a foreach rather than ilist

awt	swing	swt	swing
when using the swt awt bridge to draw swing components inside an swt application can these components benefit from awt s hardware acceleration

3700233
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome iceaweasl it s working perfectly

3700247
awt	swing	swt	swing
and this is bad practice to mix awt or swt and swing controls

3700265
maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e	m2e	pom.xml
eclipse is used for development but i use the m2e plugin and a maven pom.xml with the gwt plugin to build run it

hide	show
if user is connected hide the regular fb login button and show your fake fb login button

3700329
client-side	server-side
but the these padded words should not be removed easily by using either jquery client-side htmldocument server-side coding

3700362
hide	show
so if you hide the placeholder and move it s contents out these changes will be lost and the standard menu will be show

formview	entitydatasource
can anyone reliably get the entitydatasource to save a nullable column to the databse as a null when bound to any of the controls such as formview

3700736
git-rebase	amend
finally if you really do get this set in the history this way others have pulled so you don t want to git-rebase amend you can check out the old commit and then check out the files from the newer commit

3700771
min	max
the xml file describes its object structure - each class its properties and the corresponding min max and default values for those properties as well as a text field documenting the property

3700814
width	height
modal dialog has still the same default width and height

3700817
maven	m2e
i use the m2e plugin maven and i would like to generate a project like struts 2 hibernate 3 mysql

3700826
jar	war
maybe intellij puts this additional jar in the exploded war cos i didn t see it before

3700868
cout	cin
i do know that the functions cout cin etc.

3700868
ostream	istream
and theior actual implementations inside istream and ostream .

3700876
cout	cin
cin and cout are not simple variables - with cerr they are streams registered by default for every application using iostream

rdf	owl
even though there are many commonly used abbreviations rdf owl foaf dc ... each person can make up their own and use them as they see fit

3700931
versioning	upgrade
maybe not a direct answer but if you upgrade to delphi xe you will also get license keys for some of the older versioning of delphi down to 7 and delphi 7 included clx it was dropped in borland delphi 2006

3700935
width	height
depending on the width and height of your div you ll play with the left attribute to position the btns correctly

3700958
maven	pom.xml
basically it will create the pom.xml file the structure of directories using the maven conventions and some simple files

3700966
cout	cin
edit however the definitions for cin cout etc need to be extern and defined in some sort of library

3700983
distance	polygons
i want to find the minimum distance between two polygons

3700993
uitableview	reloaddata
the uitableview has a method called reloaddata that will take care of this for you and you need to call this everytime you change the data source after the table has been created

3700993
uitableview	reloaddata
so in rootviewcontroller add a method called reload which in turn calls reloaddata on your uitableview and modify your code

3700999
cout	cin
to use cin and cout you really only have to know that they re in the std namespace and that you need to include iostream to use them

3700999
std	ostream
to give you an idea how it might be implemented the definition of class std ostream could be in the header ostream which is included by iostream

3700999
std	ostream
also in the header ostream std cout could be defined as a reference to an std ostream

3701013
post	get
the api may have changed since this post but this get your started at least

3701021
width	height
the problem here is that the height and width of each button could be different so its not like storing one image and use this as a background or

3701025
memcpy	memmove
the key difference between memcpy and memmove is that memmove will work fine when source and destination overlap

3701025
memcpy	memmove
is it a microoptimization or are there real significant examples when memcpy is faster so that we really need to use memcpy and not stick to memmove everywhere

3701045
hex	binary
so instead of doing your math in binary and then trying to do a bunch of divide by 10s to put in a human decimal ascii format you do your math in bcd from the start then it is more of a conversion to hex without the upper letters shift right 4 and with 0xf add 0x30 and with 0xf add 0x30 repeat

3701059
memcpy	memmove
having said that i have seen platforms that have exactly the same code for memcpy and memmove

3701074
onmousedown	onmouseup
i m using onmousedown and onmouseup for that

the filtering are at least 5 which includes a keyword a category and subcategory a date range filtering and a sort expression filtering for sorting

3701189
post	get
this blog post should get you going

3701195
memcpy	memmove
at best calling memcpy rather than memmove will save a pointer comparison and a conditional branch

3701196
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the most recent versions of google-chrome firefox and ie

3701215
memcpy	memmove	inline	inlining
this means that without the ability to optimize in favor of memcpy memmove is at least slower by one branch and any additional space occupied by inline instructions to handle each case if inlining is possible

3701215
memcpy	memmove
reading the eglibc-2.11.1 code for both memcpy and memmove confirms this as suspected

3701215
memcpy	memmove
in summary this means if you can guarantee the regions are not overlapped then selecting memcpy over memmove avoids a branch

3701215
memcpy	memmove
if the source and destination contain corresponding page aligned and page sized regions and don t overlap some architectures can employ hardware accelerated copies for those regions regardless of whether you called memmove or memcpy

3701263
hide	show
i have requirement to show the toolbar button border on mouse hovering and otherwise hide it

cos	sin
2 x87 offers some operations that are not covered by the sse# instruction sets namely instructions for triogonometric operations sin cos ... and logarithms

3701489
rss	feed
you need the rss reader to be in the same zone as the feed

3701489
rss	feed
so if you want a web-based rss reader that can read feed available on your company network the web-based rss reader also needs to be running within your network

3701503
kerberos	ntlm
i ve tried doing this using c# and it kind of worked yet with plsql it seems like am having problem authenticating to sharepoint since it uses kerberos ntlm

3701546
post	get
the xsrf protection on post data using tokens like you said should work on get data as well

3701546
post	get
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

3701549
keydown	keyup
iirc you ll get one event for keydown one for keytyped and one for keyup

3701672
width	height
if you scale the shell up by 10 to get 10 larger fonts you must decrease the height and width of the scale by 10 so that is still fits the same area just with scaled up content

3701689
kerberos	ntlm
that way you can use the extranet zone for applications that don t support ntlm or kerberos

3701696
config	ini
i had been using configobj to read config files ini files

3701709
width	height
if not give it a set height and width and the should fit tightly around it making it all clickable

3701747
google-chrome	safari
if you set size to say 1 on your input field it fixes the bug - testet in google-chrome and safari

3701778
tcpclient	networkstream
the first step is to call getstream on the tcpclient instance which gives you a reference to the networkstream with which you send and receive binary data

3701778
networkstream	binaryreader
you can wrap that in a binaryreader and binarywriter to send and receive .net primitives like int32s strings et cetera or use the networkstream methods directly for byte arrays

3701805
getter	setter
so if they have a worker thread that does the heavy lifting then they will have to marshal all calls to your library onto that worker thread even for simple getter and setter

3701813
versioning	upgrade
add to that all the other new features in sl4 mentioned in the other answers already and in vs 2010 as well i strongly recommend everyone upgrade to the latest versioning of both

distance	polygons
again the order of the pages is reversed an optimal algorithm for computing the minimum vertex distance between two crossing convex polygons by toussaint

3701906
hide	show
i am creating circles and binding hover event that show hide text

3701951
lxml	elementtree	lxml.html	elementtree
you could use the lxml library specifically lxml.html which gives you an elementtree object which you can then serialize as xml with amongst others the

3701951
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
if this fails on your html it is too broken you can use elementsoup an extension on beautifulsoup to build a lxml.html tree

3701959
folder	directory
on the open dialog i have set the optionsex to ofexnoplacesbar and that removes the bar that would let them select folder and directory to go to quickly but the user can use the bread crumb address tool to go up a level and type a different directory into the filename text box to change directory

3702002
for-loop	arrays
i am adding the jlabels using a for-loop which iterates through an arrays of colors

3702006
inherited	properties
the control class gives you a fontsize properties so if you set a base style your other styles could inherited from this

3702043
folder	dir
use a different open dialog make a form yourself with no folder navigation only a file list box or simply audit for a path not matching the initial dir and refuse to actually open the file

3702051
int	chars
how can i take unique 5 ascii chars string and convert into a unique and reproducable i.e needs to be the same every time 32 bit int

3702054
for-loop	loops
above the for-loop loops put

3702063
google-chrome	firefox
also i only need to support the lastest versions of firefox and google-chrome

3702073
google-chrome	safari
but interestingly both google-chrome and safari which are also webkit running on my desktop report the actual screen resolution

3702073
width	height
according to mdc these properties are not part of any specification so there s probably no strict definition of what width height should report

3702074
hide	show
just looking at the code i m not sure what to expect from calling a show or hide method on it elsewhere

3702096
int	chars
even with non-extended chars top bit not used you are still out of luck as you are trying to encode 35 bits of ascii data into 32 bits of int

3702106
mousemove	keydown
if mousemove and keydown had the same type you could skip the event.map step and just directly merge them

3702129
hash	md5
you could also use a hash function such as md5 or sha-1 and use only the first 32 bits

3702137
udp	tcp
i don t have access to a solaris 10 system at the moment but according to the oracle documentation you can use the ndd utility to query and set the configured buffer size maximums for tcp and udp

3702155
getter	setter
i once read a comment from someone about unit-testing that you don t need to write tests for code that can be easily broken for instance getter setter can be easily broken for example getter returns the value it is supposed to do and we can break it easily by not returning the value so we don t end up writing unit tests for getter and setter unless there is some logic embedded in it in which case these are not actually getter and setter

3702159
firefox	safari
i used safari s web inspector to look at the markup that is generated by the twitter widget firefox s firebug would have worked just as well for this purpose

3702171
integer	unsigned
i am making an emulator for z80 binaries but i cannot find out whether all the integer data types are signed or unsigned from the manual or from google

3702190
move	drag
perhaps scrolling was regarded in some other group of drag drop effects to copy move link and so the author wanted to place it at the other end of the word along with any other future similarly different effects

3702235
portrait	landscape
my idea is to create the app in portrait mode but rotate everything by 90 degrees the player thinks that he is playing the game in landscape mode when really i ve just rotated everything

3702239
webkit	gecko
for something more robust or at least more browser-like i guess you could try webkit or gecko

3702319
post	get
i m try to post in a hidden input a base64 encoded image 500kb and all i get is an error

3702353
mef	prism
i need to do some more research on mef but in prism you can guarantee that one module s initialize fires before the others via a moduledependency

3702353
mef	prism
i m fully-qualifying this by saying i might not know some inner working of mef that does not allow this but this is how things work generally with prism

3702361
serializable	deserialization
differential execution is a way of executing a procedure repeatedly in which it does simultaneous serializable and deserialization

3702379
websphere	ibm
i have an existing java web application running through ibm websphere i m unsure of the version but could find out if it helps that i am looking to implement two factor authentication with

3702383
integer	unsigned
so the same register may be handled by imul instruction as signed integer and by mul instruction as unsigned integer

3702391
post	get
rest is simple to implement trivially easy if you use asp.net mvc on your server accessible by any client that can handle http post get without the need for libraries and easy to test so rest would be my technology of choice

3702398
hash	salt
the user s password is stored as a salt hash so nobody can decrypt the key and the data even if he sees the hash

3702398
hash	salt
create salt hash

3702425
explode	nl2br
then use the nl2br function to create s or you can explode it for or n

3702496
post	get
so when i post filling in all the fields i get that the modelstate is invalid and the error being that p.friend.name is required

3702559
folder	directory
create a new css directory in application folder just to manage files and folder in the correct way

3702637
kde	gnome
this works on gnome desktops however it won t work across linux platforms with different desktop environments including kde

3702639
postgresql	mysql
store and read from a shared medium memcached preferably mysql postgresql db in general next flat-file next

3702656
g++	gcc
msvc uses among others masm link cl and gcc uses stuff like gcc g++ cc1 cc1plus and binutils

3702679
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
this approach relies only on addition subtraction multiplication by two and averaging

3702732
google-chrome	firefox
i m experiencing a strange css spacing issue in google-chrome but not in firefox and or ie

3702732
google-chrome	firefox
the vertical spacing in firefox between the real estate search h2 tag and the form input field for san francisco ca #city-field input tag is perfect but in google-chrome google-chrome is applying more extra vertical spacing than desired

3702732
google-chrome	firefox
the redline represent the extra spacing that google-chrome is adding that firefox ie are not

3702732
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

3702747
width	height
the form class will help you with the other stuff like the width and height properties etc

3702757
hash	salt
best practice for this use case is to store only a cryptographic hash sha1 of the password and a random salt

3702757
hash	salt
that is sufficient to verify it but giving only the hash and salt it would take a nearly infinte amount of time to figure out the plain password

3702761
children	parent
you would be defining a method that hid a method of a parent and allowed children to override

3702786
user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
you should see your tabitem with view s user-controls under the tabcontrol

3702790
rpm	yum
are for system managed files the ones managed by your distributions tools like rpm yum dselect etc.

3702836
mouse	keyboard
i know i can use low-level keyboard mouse hooks like in

3702836
mouse	keyboard
i know there are other apps that only run when user is not using keyboard mouse and or during periods of low cpu usage

3702852
postfix	dovecot
exchange postfix dovecot sendmail apple mail zimbra all support distribution lists

3702866
width	height
increase the canvas width and height to zoom out and decrease them to zoom in

3702884
vsto	add-in
i have visual studio com add-in built in vs 2008 on pure com technology not vsto see bottom of this for more on that which references 2003 primary interop assemblies but the add-in may be used on 2003 2007 or now 2010 office machines

3702884
vsto	add-in
finally i am aware that writing a manged com add-in for excel or word is now generally done with vsto instead of pure managed framework code but this is not an option presently to change the legacy app to this direction

3702889
emacs	textmate
i use textmate to debug python script as i like the feature of using command-r for running python from textmate and i learned that emacs provide similar feature

3702889
emacs	textmate
i need to know if the python is run from command line or from textmate emacs

3702889
emacs	textmate
i got an answer in the case with emacs and i happen to solve this issue with textmate

3702906
google-chrome	firefox
according to w3c line-height normal tells user agents to set the used value to a reasonable value based on the font of the element. firefox and google-chrome could be setting different reasonable values since they are built on entirely different rendering engines

3702921
post	get
i think i m going to implement this feature didn t think it was needed but now i like the idea in my app and i ll post some code if i get it working let me know if you get yours working as well

3702922
error-handling	exception-handling
2 use non-local control flow to separate error-handling code from the usual path exception-handling

3702945
emacs	textmate
i don t know about textmate but when i tell emacs to eval buffer its value is

3702945
emacs	textmate
you might want to set up your python-mode in emacs and whatever the equivalent in textmate is to put something special like -t in the command line

3702948
portrait	landscape
whenever i rotate my screen between landscape and portrait this method returns false

3702952
oncreate	setcontentview
which i guess is on the oncreate method and previous to those lines you should have another setcontentview r.layout.anotherstuff

3703033
execvp	execl
the execl execle execlp execvp and execvp functions may fail and set errno for any of the errors specified for the library functions execve 2 and malloc 3

3703033
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
if successful calloc malloc realloc reallocf and valloc functions return a pointer to allocated memory

3703063
versioning	upgrade
i would only maintain separate upgrade scripts for versioning 1 to versioning 2

3703063
versioning	upgrade
i wouldn t maintain upgrade script for versioning 1 to 3 or so directly usually it s not required

3703069
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie7 google-chrome firefox

3703091
draggable	droppable
upon clicking the close button the item disappears from the droppable area and re-activates as a draggable

3703092
memcpy	memmove
it s certainly possible that memcpy is merely a call to memmove in which case there d be no benefit to using memcpy

3703092
memcpy	memmove
on the other extreme it s possible that an implementor assumed memmove would rarely be used and implemented it with the simplest possible byte-at-a-time loops in c in which case it could be ten times slower than an optimized memcpy

3703092
memcpy	memmove
as others have said the likeliest case is that memmove uses memcpy when it detects that a forward copy is possible but some implementations may simply compare the source and destination addresses without looking for overlap

3703111
nsstring	nsdata
for converting nsdata to a nsstring try initwithdata encoding

3703119
sorting	grouping
tempdb - used as a temporary work space for temporary tables and lots of other stuff like sorting and grouping

3703140
int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown	onkeyup	onkeydown
you could overwrite the public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event and public boolean onkeyup int keycode keyevent event functions in your activity class and test if keycode is equal to keyevent.keycode_power

3703211
put	get
i usually don t put anything in main i let the no-arg app.run get called and call everything i need in the onstartup method but this wouldn t change the behaviour you re seeing

3703232
tolower	toupper
i mean if i would create a new instance of the string class it would create an object with dozens of methods toupper tolower etc.

3703331
return-value-optimization	nrvo
that is if the compiler isn t able to do nrvo named return-value-optimization

3703341
freemarker	velocity
checkout freemarker or apache velocity

3703341
freemarker	velocity
freemarker is more advanced but a little complex as compared to apache velocity

3703346
button	checkbox
- when the okay button is clicked and the checkbox is marked open an additional dialog notifying the user that the okay button will no longer be displayed but that they can clear that setting in the preferences menu

3703404
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction negation sign testing and everything else are all done by the hardware using bitwise operations so you can definitely do it in your c program

3703427
getter	setter
i have a managed bean but i don t know how to put the getter and setter for the dynamic fields that i want to save in a database

3703491
pull	push
like users can select their language of choice system will pull in all untranslated text for that language user can enter their translations wait for 3-4 other people to verify it then push it live

3703496
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you want to prevent apache from exposing the source code if something is wrong with php add this in your httpd.conf .htaccess

3703501
facebook	fbconnect
the facebook fbconnect api supports fql which is similar to sql queries

3703568
hid	keyboard
i would find even if i hid the iframe flash player was never getting keyboard focus back

3703568
mouse	keyboard
now there is no really good way to determine if you need to instruct the browser to give keyboard focus back i end up executing this javascript on every mouse down rather inefficient but it was the only way to gaurentee whenever my user clicked on flash player content that the browser gave keyboard focus back

3703634
execl	fork
but as pekka mentioned this is a really bad idea because you must set up first a lighttpd web server on iphone not really comfortable or if you re planing to implement a cli php script you should first launch it using some c functions like pipe dup2 fork execl and then parse its output inside your -not-so-objective-c- iphone app

3703688
post	get
i haven t done this as i m not a python programmer yet but there are many ways to expose access cake - url param param post get rss whatever

3703688
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
i don t know whether you re a python or a cakephp programmer but if you re the former the book does tend to cover most things and is fairly logically laid out whatever codeigniter symphony kohana fans might say

uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
uinavigationbar s shouldn t be used on their own outside of a uinavigationcontroller

3708443
onchange	onfocus
try using a different event such as onchange or onfocus to see if that solves it

3708462
subtraction	addition
also we have got date_sub and date_add functions for addition subtraction operations

3708463
listview	gridview
you are telling the listview that you wish to present your data in the gridview format

3708463
listview	gridview
basically you ll just need to create the gridview dynamically and then assign it to the view property of the listview

3708482
range	max
the class ui-slider-range-max is given to the range part of a slider with a fixed max point

3708525

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works perfect in opera in firefox the button size is about 10x10px and in safari and google-chrome it has some kind of strange border like iframes have and i have no idea how to get rid of that

3708769
accessor	properties
if you have a custom getter method for the managedobjectcontext properties in the app delegate that creates the context if it is nil you might have messed it up causing the accessor to generate a new context each time

3708806
put	get
string.trim - the xml had to get put into a string before passing into the soap method calling .trim removed the byte order mark

one of the major cons of a broker is that it is very difficult to versioning and upgrade

3709008
put	get
for a car maybe the methods implementation involves get the keys place them in the ignition put in park press brake pedal turn ignition... however for a lawnmower the same methods implementation is put gass in the mower prime the carborateor pull the clutch pull the cord...

fadein	fadeout
you can crossfade between two images by positioning them in the same place using css then calling fadein and fadeout using jquery

3709164
post	get
there are also inputs to filter the results and they are also part of the postback mechanism so i can t simulate a regular post to get the results

3709175
google-chrome	safari
at the same time my plugin work properly both in safari and google-chrome

3709182
width	height
to do that you ll have to develop layout code that sizes and positions your children so that they do not extend past the height and width of your available content space

3709190
ienumerator	idisposable
so i wrote because the type of e does not necessarily have to be an implementation of or even ienumerator -- which also means it doesn t necessarily have to implement idisposable hence the part

3709190
ienumerable	ienumerator
the ienumerable interface exposes an ienumerator which in turn provides access to a current property of type object

3709215
subtract	add
i wrote a type extender to allow me to add or subtract weekdays to a given date

3709218
implements	extends
it may be possible to extends richtextfield to support multiple colors but with the amount of work necessary it would very likely be easier to implements your own field from scratch

3709259
hide	show
i m working with jstree and i would like to know how to hide show nodes if possible

3709315
google-chrome	safari
everything works fine on safari or google-chrome but after the deployment with phonegap webview it does t work anymore.

3709329
jboss	glassfish
but i still not sure if i need glassfish or jboss also installed on machine

3709334
hide	show
this will hide the button and show the spinner once the button is clicked

3709334
hide	show
you can then show the button and hide the spinner in your javascript response the .js.erb file that you render from the action called by the ajax request

3709335
subtract	add
for each of quarter dime nickel penny if changeremaining is the value of the coin add a coin and subtract the value

jar	war
is there some sort of junit library to check an ear war for the presence of that jar and fail the test if its there

3709387
scheme	racket
racket only works for the racket dialect of scheme and its derivatives however so if you want to work with another implementation you should probably look at

3709387
scheme	racket
it is powerfully customizable has modes for almost any file type and handles scheme well especially with quack installed quack is an extension for scheme named in parody of racket --- get it quack

3709406

allow those that depend on the shared libraries to upgrade and adopt new versioning as their particular timeline and bandwidth allows

3709577
int	double
you will be doing int division so your coin values should not be double but int

3709633
hide	show
i ve been trying to hide and show the imgareaselect selection box depending on whether a checkbox is checked or not

3709644
prng	random
actually what you need in practice is what freebsd s dev urandom provides it will read an initial seed of sufficient length from dev random then use a prng

3709644
freebsd	linux
to sum up under both linux and freebsd you should use dev urandom not dev random

3709650
ireport	subreports
if you are using ireport in your subreports properties look for the parameters property and click the button on the right of the text box

3709666
put	get
then you might simply take next element from the queue and roll the dice in such a way that it will determine the bucket with given distribution using example with a b c- 3 5 2 distribution roll the dice with 10 sides and if you get 1 2 or 3 put the element in a if it is 4 5 6 7 8 put it in b and if it is 9 or 10 put it in c

3709698
switching	screens
option 2 switching from using screens to using pyserial

3709700
hide	show
i never used imgareaselect myself but in the docs there is no option show present but one named hide

3709701
hide	show
although in truth i m not sure if you should be using hide true or show false

3709853
children	parent
we also split requests that have multiple changes into a parent with multiple children to allow us to spread the assignments out better

3709888

i have a gridview and detailsview under an updatepanel after the first partialpostback the tooltip will only work with the inputs within that updatepanel and after the next partialpostbacks none will work whatsoever

3709900
freebsd	linux
when my desktop system was an alpha machine running freebsd the boehm-weiser implementation could not run on it although it supported linux on the same processor

3709939
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
i just recently came across the kahan or compensated summation algorithm for minimizing roundoff and i d like to know if there are equivalent algorithms for division and or multiplication as well as subtraction if there happens to be one i know about associativity

3709942
google-chrome	firefox
it s fine in google-chrome and firefox

3709945
migrate	upgrade
you also get the benefit that scalaj-time can be easily upgrade to use jsr 310 when it s available so it ll be much less painful to migrate your code at that time

3710002
portrait	landscape
you can supply two layout files for landscape and portrait specifying the number of columns in the gridview in each case to achieve the 2x3 vs 3x2

3710034
webrat	cucumber
i need to test with cucumber webrat the presence of this button

3710083
free	memcpy
any application that schedules work to run on the gpu a memcpy or a kernel launch can schedule the work asynchronously so that the application is free to go ahead and do some other work on the cpu and it can schedule any number of tasks to run on the gpu

3710114
hide	show
at the moment these are just hidden and will show hide on click

3710115
postgresql	mysql
i ve myself written three different dal s orms with support for sql server mysql postgresql and sqlite

3710304
java.util.date	zoneddatetime
instant zoneddatetime offsetdatetime java.util.date compatibility

3710312
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	setcontentview
look at the onstart method in the activity class i think you are wanting to override that instead of oncreate or in addition to typically you call setcontentview only in oncreate

3710337
children	parent
your best bet is to have a parent bean and have those multiple beans as children

3710379
typedef	struct
when programming for ios should i prefer using struct and typedef where the object has no behavior methods basically

3710379
nsstring	nsobject
i ve read that using a struct to hold two nsstring instances or any nsobject subclass is a bad idea

3710452
mouseleave	mouseenter
it really shouldn t matter see source code but typically hover takes in two functions as parameter -- the first is executed when the mouseenter the element and the second is executed when the mouseleave the element

3710473
free	malloc
then the objective c memory overhead is 0 and you can encapsulate all the nasty malloc and free stuff into the innards of one .m file

3710482
cgpoint	cgrect	cgpoint	cgsize	cgsize	cgrect
i only see quite few structs in cocoa framework like cgsize cgrect and cgpoint

3710493
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven you can add to your pom.xml

3710516
put	get
the weird part is that even if i put if-else or try-catch blocks within the read and write methods i still get the error

3710517
children	parent
when you say comments which are in parent node do you mean comments that are children of the root node outside of all elements

3710528
int	double	int	chars
i believe is a good idea to use structs specially if you are dealing with c-based frameworks lets says opengl coregraphics coretext specially stuff that will require a couple triple of int double chars etc

3710528
cgpoint	cgrect
if they are already not implemented in some of apple frameworks cgrect cgpoint ctrect nsrange etc... c stuff plays and looks better with other c stuff

3710551
int	double
struct s with two int or four double s are borderline cases

3710558
cgpoint	cgrect	cgpoint	cgsize	cgsize	cgrect	cgsize	nsrange
there are already several examples of this in the cocoa frameworks cgrect cgsize cgpoint nsrange for example

3710759
width	height
set a condition which triggers the mouse up event handler when the x or y is equal to the stage width or height respectively

3710771
post	get
my idea was to have maybe 25 book listings per page and rather than use hyperlinks that submit the form data as a get request of url parameters the page number hyperlinks would simply resubmit the form passing the requested page number as an additional form post parameter

3710793
atomic	compare-and-swap
the condition variables cannot be implemented using only the atomic primitives like compare-and-swap

3710805
width	height
my attempt was going to be injecting some javascript to add width and height attributes to all images in the dom that don t have any

3710807
lambda	first-class-functions
the jvm doesn t support first-class-functions or lambda out of the box

3710808
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox google-chrome safari and ie8 there s a border around this button.

3710837
toggleclass	each
what you have works you could slim it down with a dual class toggleclass call on each but there is one problem area

3710861
post	get
imo the request being a get or post shouldn t make much difference so i d say do whatever floats your boat shielding head from restful rebuttals

3710908
getter	setter
custom actions can be invoced in the property s getter or setter if needed

3710960
serializable	deserialization
deserialization process needs to know what type have to be deserialized - such information is not part of serializable data

3711015
post	get
however if i do a post test i get the following html doc as a result

3711018
nsstring	nsdata
you shouldn t need to convert the image to an nsstring to post it to a web service just to an nsdata

3711051
google-chrome	firefox
the second command stops the slideshow from happening and firefox it works great but google-chrome the slideshow keeps going

3711062
hide	show
i changed your jquery a bit so items hide or show based on the click of the button

3711102
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this can be added to the httpd.conf file or even in an .htaccess

3711115
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so i am styling the wordpress more link on the blog index page and i ve used some custom styles and markup that are displaying inconsistently between webkit based browsers safari and google-chrome and firefox

3711163
width	height
now with font size of 15 and font arial these should be giving me a desired size of around 8 width and 10 height

3711215
mvp	presenter
there are a lot of variants on presenter don t get too caught up in the specific details just start off with the simple mvp if you have never used it

3711254
post	get
another common source of these sorts of errors is trying to parse a get request on the server for arguments or whatever while you re getting a post request

3711267
int	chars
usr lib gcc i686-pc-cygwin 4.3.4 include c++ bits basic_string.h 1458 instantiated from static _chart std basic_string _chart _traits _alloc _s_construct_aux _initerator _initerator const _alloc std __false_type with _initerator std istream_iterator std allocator chars std char_traits int _chart chars _traits std char_traits _alloc std allocator

3711285
udp	tcp
in applications like that where you often have limited bandwidth you can really tell the difference in terms of how long it takes to get the data from the remote host to the server between udp and momentary tcp connections like http

3711285
udp	tcp
a udp packet will get to its destination in what seems like an instant and the setup for the tcp connection is very conspicuous often taking several seconds to complete

3711331
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
gzipinputstream can wrap a fileinputstream for gzip keeping in mind that gzip only works on single files

3711331
outputstream	inputstream
both types of inputstream also have their respective outputstream

3711334
post	get
2 i have managed successfully post and get messages from queue using java on my machine using following url

3711336
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works well in firefox opera google-chrome safari but not ie7

3711390
fadein	fadeout
i m using the following function called from document.ready to set a fadein fadeout effect on the top navigation of this page

3711390
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works well enough on firefox 3.6.9 google-chrome safari and opera

3711451
button	checkbox
perhaps you could disable the button so that it greyed out until all the checkbox have been set or whatever.

3711453
ant	maven
both ant and maven support a very easy mechanism for using tokens and filter files to filter certain resources

3711508
rss	feed
look at your newsfeed in a rss reader and see what s already included in the feed

3711510
equals	gethashcode
you need to make your thing type override equals and gethashcode to indicate its equality semantics

3711525
post	get
so first we should get number of post in category for example from memcache and then check if cached version valid by this number

3711583
ubuntu	linux
on my linux ubuntu i was able to install multiple versions of eclipse for various purposes

3711589
boost	stl
also i must use only stl don t need boost

3711598
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
the truezip api provides drop-in replacements for the well-known classes file fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

3711697
width	height
this is great because thumbnails such as small_square large_thumbnail etc are pre-generated along with meta data such as size width height views etc

3711705
implements	extends
you can t add extension methods use generic or whatever else to extends implements service

3711714
firefox	safari
since firefox and safari users typically upgrade their browsers

3711716
onmouseover	onmousedown	onmouseover	onclick	onmouseover	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup
all the typical mouse events are supported onclick onmouseover onmouseout onmousedown onmouseup etc.

3711720
svg	vml
for more interaction you ll have to look at javascript and for even more possibilities i heartily recommend raphael as a cross-browser vml for i.e svg for the rest tool capable of more complex images events on parts of that image

3711722
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
so i thought that using the nsdictionary as an intermediate step i can get around having to do a category on my nsmanagedobject that sets each property manually from the value on my object subclassing nsobject

3711728
free	malloc
malloc - error for object object pointer being free was not allocated

3711743
lwjgl	jogl
edit again after my answer one of the related questions links on the side seemed relevant java game programming jogl vs lwjgl

3711774
post	get
you may make form use get instead of post if you accept google-like search requests search

3711839
devise	cancan
currently i m using devise cancan which allows me to create

3711847
min	max
you can group by the domain_name and index_path and include one min or max value of collection_name per group

3711864
google-chrome	firefox
this will though require your users have a browser that supports canvas firefox google-chrome or for ie to use something like explorercanvas

3711874
google-chrome	firefox
but i keep getting a problem to display it correctly in ie8 while i have no problems with firefox or google-chrome please take a look at the links to see it

3711885
keydown	keyup
add keydown and keyup methods to toggle the booleans accordingly

3711937
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that both firefox and google-chrome have the same issue

3711941
firefox	safari
the code works in firefox ie8 safari etc

3711956
ssl	https
one other note..the package you ve referenced does not appear to include ssl support - so you will not be able to deal with https urls using that library

3711956
ssl	https
grab one of the ssl packages if you need to support https

3711980
put	get
check wether typeof iactivity .isassignable type if so i want to get string typedescription type.attribute.value or similar what i want is to put a attribute on a class or on the above classes depends what suggestions you make or what solutions are possible like

3711992
arraylist	linkedhashmap
before you had an arraylist containing three linkedhashmap objects

3711993
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i d stick with whatever rendered cleaner and more consistently -- ie firefox google-chrome safari etc

3711999
width	height
technical differences yes most notably you can set the width height of an img tag and it will stretch the image which can be useful in some situations

3712014
post	get
but that s not what happens...somewhere from when i submit the form and get my results and theme it all up i get redirected some how and lose all my post data

3712055
punctuation	words
i think your best bet is going to be a regex match for the last words excluding punctuation marks being in a list jr sr iii etc

3712061
union	distinct
the default behavior of union is to eliminate duplicate rows and since we re asking only for articleids with the intention of joining something to this list of ids the query below would result in the set of distinct article ids that meet the criteria

3712090
uilabel	uitextview
let the uilabel or uitextview or uiwebview do that for you

3712152
subscript	superscript
offset 4 points to the colour index if you want to change font colour while offset 8 identifies superscript subscript and offset 10 identifies underline type

3712158
charindex	substr
set lastname substr lastname 0 charindex lastname iii

3712213
width	height
the subpart should start at x y on the tbitmap and have a width and height equal to clientwidth and clientheight of the form respectively

3712213
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
you can also respond to the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events to scroll using the mouse

3712213
mouseup	mousedown
alternatively you can set a fmousedown flag to true in mousedown and reset it to false in mouseup

3712226
post	get
you may need to post some code to get a better answer

3712226
hide	show
instead of adding and removing views you could hide or show them if they should only be initialized once

3712275
getter	setter
but it seems like setting the class variable without going through the setter could be equally bad if the setter does something special or if the property is changed to something besides retain and the getter isn t checked

3712300
put	get
i generally don t put anything in the resource dictionary that doesn t get created in xaml

3712312
button	checkbox
i m using microsoft.office.interop.excel to read the values of cells of a worksheet but i m unable to find information that shows how to read dropdowns checkbox and option button

3712340
int	chars
i m storing the chars as an int so i can check for the eof signal but things aren t going so well

3712357
getter	setter
the best solution is to not do lazy initialization as a part of your getter setter

3712366
wsimport	wsdl2java
we re using java 1.5 axis2 and client classes generated with either wsimport or wsdl2java

3712388
getter	setter
the class is a getter setter for a couple config files and now i need to place thread locks on the access to the config files

3712436
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp zend codeigniter and symfony are the industry leaders

3712464
ggplot2	lattice
and i thought people only asked ggplot2 questions here nice to see some lattice for a change

3712467
installation	upgrade
i have recently upgrade my blogengine.net installation to 1.6 and .net 4.0 however i did not build blogengine.core when i performed the upgrade

3712479
folder	directory
when checking out a solution from source control do most people create a working folder here in this directory and work from there

3712494
superclass	subclassing
you create a superclass that declares dosomething and then you create subclassing each of which implements it differently

3712531
jruby	mri
i just recently installed jruby and the thrift gem after using it in mri

3712531
jruby	mri
edit after digging around on my mac i found that the mri gem and jruby gem are different even though the gems are the same version 0.2.0.4

3712531
jruby	mri
now this seems like a terrible idea but if you copy the .rb files from the mri gem into the jruby gem and add require thrift struct_union to thrift.rb you will no longer get any errors related to the thrift gem except that it can t find thirft_native and will use pure ruby libraries

3712557
backgrounding	multitasking
is there any possiblity for reacting to the event that a user kills your app via the multitasking bar if it has moved to the backgrounding

3712589
serializable	deserialization
my guess when spring beans are serializable for example as part of the http session on restoring spring tries not to restore their original values since they might be meaningless after the deserialization but instead tries to fetch them by their id

3712627
uiview	subviews
this is because uiview objects retain their subviews

3712649
onkeydown	onfocus
as an alternative you could use the onkeydown event instead of onfocus

3712706
kde	gnome
how do i get correct colors associated with my kde or gnome profile on linux

3712726
comparator	comparable
implement comparable or write a comparator based on the logic described above

3712726
arraylist	treeset
fill the contents of the arraylist into a treeset

3712767
pdcurses	ncurses
pdcurses for windows most nixes come with a native version or ncurses

3712773
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
you can bind the bulletedlist control to a data source control like the sqldatasource or linqdatasource controls or you can populate its value programmatically through the datasource property

3712777
profiling	instrumentation
check the documentation for your profiling if you can run with sampling instead of instrumentation

3712787
for-loop	arrays
edit in the javascript for-loop shown above i had it tap each of the buttons in the main.buttons arrays and only 1 of the 12 identical buttons on the view gets the tap

3712801
moq	moles
my company is trying to decide if we are going to standardize on moq rhino mocks or ms moles and stubs

3712946
vbscript	jscript
but i guess qtp cannot run two scripts in parallel so you ll probably need an external shell script written in vbscript jscript powershell etc

accessor	properties	getter	setter
by providing accessor setter getter methods or by using properties in languages that support them like c# the developer can define a more-stable contract between the class and its users

3713175
getter	setter
note that performance is not a concern because modern jit compilers are able to optimize calls to trivial getter setter in a way that the actual call is eliminated and the code is equivalent to direct access to the underlying memory location

3713175
getter	setter	public	protected
also setter and getter may usually have different visibility public protected private providing the added benefit of more-granular control to read write operations over a specified value

3713175
getter	setter
hence the best practice is to avoid public fields wherever possible and use setter getter methods or properties instead

3713183

you can find various free ram disk drivers on the net

3713370
disk	ram
you won t find any physical drive including ssds that are faster than a ram disk

3713370
disk	ram
in my case a project that took 5 minutes to build on a 6-core i7 on a 7200 rpm sata drive with incredibuild was reduced by only about 15 seconds by using a ram disk

3713370
disk	ram
considering the need to recopy to permanent storage and the potential for lost work 15 seconds is not enough incentive to use a ram disk and probably not much incentive to spend several hundreds of dollars on a high-rpm or ssd drive

3714489

3717471
jar	war
that s why you can put your annotated managed beans within the war file and not in a jar file

3717489
int	chars
your chars 4 was implicitly casted to an int

3717489
int	chars
this is legal in c c++ since these are both int numbers with int being at least as wide as chars the other way round needs an explicit cast as possible precision loss can result

3717502
int	chars
4 is a chars which is freely convertible to int

3717508
int	chars
in your case there is a conversion from chars to int before calling the explicit constructor which is as designed

3717620
facebook	fbconnect
i use the last fbconnect for facebook connexion

3717624
inherited	properties
the second issue i found was that we were setting the url and timeout properties of the webserice explicitly but these are not included in the interface instead they are inherited from system.web.services.protocols.webclientprotocol via soaphttpclientprotocol

3717633
inherited	properties
it sounds like you should should inherited from system.io.ioexception and expose a files properties on it

post	put
then its being put into the post like so

passing a simple chars like test produces a different int with my udf than a normal call to hashbytes would produce

3718007
put	get
now to debug i ve put a print statement before and after the require_once statement and the second print statement doesn t get fired off

3718032

use the int function to covert the boolean to their int values and then store those

i have microsoft .net framework 3.5 sp1 installed on my pc but when i run the app a message box advises me that i need to upgrade to this versioning of the .net framework

3718157
int	boolean
a quick workaround is just to create it as an int array and then convert it to a boolean array

3718157
versioning	upgrade
obviously both of these are suboptimal but if you can t upgrade to a more recent versioning of numpy they will work

3718162
int	double	int	chars
this memory block stores contiguous data records of different types int chars double etc. and gives the number of bytes of each field in each record.i essentially look up the type of the record and get the value of the record

3718184
serializable	deserialization
come up with a serializable and deserialization function

3718201
jar	manifest.mf
i managed to do that manually via editing the nb generated jar file of the project that is its manifest.mf file + copying the resources manually but there should be a way to tell netbeans as well to mind the resources no

3718201
folder	directory
adding the art folder to the netbeans project libraries properties - libraries - add jar folder seemed not to work because then i ended up with an error ... project art is a directory or can t be read

one sensible alternative would be file indexes the kind used by your c i o routines like fseek and ftell

3718376
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
we tested the same pages with ie8 ie7 via compatibility mode ie6 with ietester ie7 with ietester latest google-chrome latest opera and latest safari but all would behave normally

3718376
google-chrome	firefox
firefox runs very well almost as well as google-chrome and much better than all versions of ie

3718390

you are better of just using no-editor or if you are using jce switch to text by pressing show hide just above the editor in the left corner

3718419
dlsym	dlopen
for windows dlopen becomes loadlibrary and dlsym becomes getprocaddress etc.

3718438
x86	64bit
also on x86 some memory string operations have mmx versions that use the floating point register space as temporary storage so they can do 64bit read write operations so depending on processor kernel configuration you might be in for some nasty surprises

3718497
min	max
i would like to get the mean sd + min max for each of my continuous variable but didn t succeed

3718499
dictionary	map
a map dictionary should be pretty good all the time and the code is pretty simple

3718499
dictionary	map
as it s a learning exercise and you want to try out different possibilities for the text - morse you could use an array rather than a map dictionary

3718506
post	get
a get request will pass the parameters in the url whereas a post does not

3718560
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it took me hours searching the internet but finally i found a solution that works on the lastest versions of ie firefox google-chrome and safari

3718560
google-chrome	safari
edited on 5 may 2012 well unfortunately it seems that the tabindex workaround no longer works for all combinations of browser google-chrome safari and operating system

3718592
free	malloc
it is best to malloc something as late as possible and free it as soon as possible

3718592
free	malloc
if your program does a lot of other things you should do them before malloc or after free

3718633
google-chrome	safari
it seems google-chrome and safari do not allow the flash object to be focused because by default it has no value defined for the tabindex property and as such takes no part in the tab chain

3718641
maven	pom.xml
what maven do i need to add to my pom.xml to allow felix to run in embedded mode

3718665
cassini	iis
cassini doesn t support authentication like iis does

3718673
pop-up	dialog
this script will pop-up a dialog box when you start the application and then every 3 600 seconds after pressing the button

3718701
hide	show
you could probably trap clicks or focus events to move things around on the client side see for event options and then show hide an empty div or something like that but in general i d avoid features like this

3718802
jsf	seam
as nathan hughes mentioned if you want to use jsf then seam is probably the best choice out there and if you don t need to use jsf then grails is by far the best option that i have found

3718814
maya	blender
before you invest several thousand dollars in a program like maya or 3ds max check out blender

3718861
autodesk	3ds
maya and 3ds max are both expensive 3d modelling tools from autodesk

3718867

i m using a linux debian lenny box with g++ 4.3.2

3719019
pull	push
i default hg qinit with -c since i want to mark work-in-progress patches and push pull them but it does take a conceptual leap to realize that you can branch in mq repo too

3719026

this code works perfectly if you cannot get this to work in your website then we cannot help you until you post the source code

3719096
hide	show
the control string that is passed in to hide show reports is correct also

3719136

3719175
width	margin
floating left will most certainly fix your issue though keep in mind whenever you add padding or margin to your floated element that you will have to adjust your width as well

3719194
versioning	upgrade
the opposite will work fine upgrade sdk and use earlier versioning of device

3719231
fadein	fadeout
but the problem is that when the user stay on hover it continue to loop fadein fadeout fadein fadeout..

3719283
fadein	fadeout
the problem is that the fadeout function sets the display property of your element to none so the dom thinks that your mouse is no longer interacting with the element and calls the fadein function

3719291
firefox	safari
and what is a plugin for safari and firefox written in

3719330
hide	show
if it s others then show the textbox else hide it

3719372
multiplying	add
the fuzziness will be that you give each of these properties an accuracy score add or multiplying or otherwise combine the total accuracy level and accept the password if it passes some threshold

3719393
width	height
what you should be doing is changing the width and height attributes of the tag

3719394
int	double
at a guess your other code is missing the cast to double on one of the arguments and int int always returns int in java

3719410
apache	nginx
i know this is for apache mod_python but my guess would be it s the same root issue of file system encoding not being utf-8 and there is a similar fix when using nginx

3719448
versioning	upgrade
the problem turned out to be a memory leak of some kind in mysql - after persuading them to upgrade to a more 21st-century versioning the problem vanished

jsf	seam
also please don t forget if there are other frameworks that can be use with jsf other than seam

3719612
google-chrome	safari
as far as i know for plugins in safari google-chrome and other non-ie they just use html javascript css

post	get
ordinarily i d get this resolved by commenting sam on the answer i ve done some editing on the original post to clean it up a bit without altering the behavior.

3719619
dictionary	map
p.s. as a workaround i created a dummycontrolcontainer class that inherits usercontrol and keeps a dictionary map filled at controladded event code follows

3719626
hide	show
think of expressing the various filter-able properties as classes and adding the user-selected filters to their parent then using css to show or hide relevant results

3719633

versioning	upgrade
it looks like that hibernate started using long data type in versioning 3.5.5 we upgrade from 3.2.7 instead of clob for the property of

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
when testing the file locally it works on firefox and safari but not in ie and opera

3720165
post	get
it happens because the get and post are disabled by default when acessing a webservice not from local

3720213
inline	inlining
or the developer might assume that force-inlining a method call essentially by stripping out the call itself and replacing with copied pasted code will be worthwhile when in reality keeping the method call as-is would result in its getting inline by the compiler only when it makes sense when the benefit of inlining outweighs the growth in code size

3720220
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
if it doesn t change it s probably good you might need to browse around a bit if you ve just changed something including box model-issues or width height padding margin in general

3720222
nunit	mstest
in other parts of the project i am using both the nunit and mstest framework but qualify that when i call assert i want to use the nunit version by

3720226
postgresql	mysql
some good ones are mysql and postgresql

3720227
facebook	fbconnect
i m not familar with the facebook api but the fbconnect success looks more like an objective-c selector instead of a url

3720228
rtp	rtsp
i can work with it using rtsp rtp over http tunneling because only port 80 is opened for me

3720228
rtp	rtsp
does it support rtsp rtp over http tunneling

3720230
portrait	landscape
if a view is added to the window orientation is set as portrait even if the device is in landscape

3720257
hide	show
if you hide a lot of complexity in the function then the complexity also tends to be hidden from the query plan so if you have problems and need to tune the query later you ll generally be fixing things that show up as high cost but are in reality trivial cost compared to the udf

3720291
actualheight	actualwidth
you can bind to the path s actualwidth and actualheight like below

3720308
accessor	properties
you have a custom accessor somewhere such a c s delegate properties that sends a release to b when accessed

3720316
width	height
putting an explicit width and height on the img element does indeed make the image the right size but it s scaled up and therefore has jaggies

3720355
filtering	grouping

in response to the comment get and post make no difference to params

3720427
shadowing	named
i don t know offhand of any library way to re-parse the output of sprintf a on a union - keep in mind that the compiler and fsi have a much different task knowing scopes and dealing with namespaces and qualified named and shadowing and whatnot and even ignoring that parsing the data carried by the unions ints strings arbitrary objects etc. is potentially a whole task in itself

3720517
cvs	svn
we re a small software company that has been using cvs and svn for version control and eclipse for writing code for about 10 years

3720517
cvs	svn
cvs and svn are tightly integrated with eclipse via plugins like subclipse so any new version control system that we switch to will need to have its own plugins that live up to that standard

3720561

i ve tried all combinations of margin auto and text-align center to no success

i did this by creating two dependencies for the same artifact one of the type war and one the type jar jar dependence tricks m2eclipse into doing what i want

3720768
jar	war
however the maven-assembly-plugin for the launcher fails when it cannot find the jar for the war project

3720768
maven	m2e	jar	war
after moving to maven this approach was outsmarted since m2e knows not to include the libraries that the jar depends on since they are war scoped

3721970
cpu	processors
it might be easier to think linearly like a processors does computation not today - there is a lot of internal parallelisation for processing optimization- but the general idea of a cpu is that is apply your instructions in the order you give it

3721971
int	chars
the c standard says that the chars constants such as ã are int constants

3721971
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

3721971
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant

3721971
int	chars
numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int

3721971
int	chars
if the chars type is signed on your machine it is on linux then when comando contains ã and is promoted to int it becomes a negative int whereas ã is a positive int

3722034

3722195
ant	maven
it is easy to integrate into an ant or maven build

3722243
post	get
on a regular page it is get but on a webservice call it is a post

3722269
post	get
also to get your code formatted nicely edit your post select the code section and click the button with the ones and zeros icon just above the text area

3722290

3722444
width	height
i haven t had a need to do this myself so i m not sure if it s sufficient to just set the autoresizingmask to have flexible width and height

we have an existing tfs 2008 system and according to that the build server requires vsts 2008 to be installed in order to compile code and run automated tests

3723148
vsts	tfs
i would assume the same for tfs 2010 where vs 2010 ultimate should be installed in the build server but we are not sure whether vsts 2008 is required as well in this use case

3723211
post	get
rest where there are just four verbs post get update delete and they re the method portion of the http request

3723218

3724929
sorting	grouping
basically i m sorting words into grouping

3724945
maven	m2e
with m2e and the maven integration for wtp that you install from the extras you could use the wtp and start your app in debug mode

what i want to say is that if you cannot obtain image as it should be you need to search problems in serializable deserialization

3725108

you can use extends instead of implements in above code

3725269
ienumerable	ienumerator
yet all the linq extension methods sit on ienumerable rather than ienumerator

3725269
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerator	idisposable
in short i have an already opened stream of results which i can convert into an appropriately idisposable ienumerator - but unfortunately all of the downstream code requires an ienumerable rather than an ienumerator even though it s only going to do one pass

3725269
ienumerable	ienumerator
i can then return an ienumerator whose dispose method closes the resource - but all of the linq operations require an ienumerable

3725269
ienumerable	ienumerator
the best workaround i know of is to implement an ienumerable whose getenumerator method returns the one-and-only ienumerator and throws an error if something tries to do a getenumerator call twice

3725322
firefox	safari
i have a list and in firefox it looks like this but in safari it looks like this

3725332

3725581
public	protected
valid reasons not to use keywords public private protected in php

3725587
opera	firefox
opera ie and firefox are right to throw an error because this code is really not valid since you re not able to return unless you are in a function

3725587
google-chrome	safari
if it works in safari and google-chrome it must be because the javascript engine they use is ready to handle buggy code

if you re wrapping a networkstream in an sslstream use the networkstream.read write methods before calling authenticateasclient server and the sslstream.read write methods after

3725838
networkstream	sslstream
don t call the socket or networkstream methods then this will break the sslstream

3725838

it s possible to ignore these rules under certain circumstances but then you need to be really careful and precisely know what socket networkstream and sslstream do under the hood

3725928
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also firefox doesnt seem to work but safari google-chrome does any idea

3725978
mouseup	mousedown
if there is common functionality for both the grids mousedown and mouseup events and the button then i d suggest methodising it and calling it from their own respective handlers

button	checkbox
i am using uitableview and adding custom type button to the table as checkbox

don t use get to send data to the server use post instead

3726463

3726590
nginx	lighttpd
for what it s worth i did eventually end up jumping ship to nginx and everything seems to work fine so my suspicion that it was lighttpd s fault rather than a buggy fcgi impl in django seems to have been well-founded

3726590
nginx	lighttpd
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here

one with a get and the other with post

3728341

xcopy is typically fine for your needs until you deal with sync between ntfs and fat32 filesystems - the later only has a 2 second resolution and problems with daily savings time so you occasionally run into issues a on time change day you might not get a backup of a changed file - depends on change-regularity of course or you might get a backup of all files even though none have changed b because of time resolution some files may backup even though they haven t changed

after that to set up the list view in a listactivity you can call setlistadapter and pass in a simplecursoradapter

3728762
post	get
your post get me going on

3728784
min	max
simply manipulate the min max and numberticks options to create an x-axis that is better formatted for your purposes

3728821
uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller
you would need to make your uisegmentedcontrol a peer of the uitabbarcontroller view

3728821
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller
the key here is that your uisegmentedcontrol needs to not be a subview of the uitabbarcontroller view so i would create a separate uiviewcontroller subclass that owns and lays out the uisegmentedcontrol and uitabbarcontroller views

3728867
children	parent
or you would have to pass the children to the parent object as collections but then it might be just at easy to have the collections on the model to begin width so nh could fill them for you

3728894
drawrect	layoutsubviews
instead of drawing each image in drawrect just move the uiimageview to the correct position in layoutsubviews

3728914
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.3 khtml like gecko google-chrome 6.0.472.59 safari 534.3

chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

3728914
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.3 khtml like gecko google-chrome 6.0.472.59 safari 534.3

3728951
int	boolean
i need to design my schema in informix such that querying a boolean with an int type will work

3728951
int	boolean
works if i provide either a boolean false or an int 0

3728960
versioning	upgrade
i think we ll either have to upgrade to the latest versioning of dreamweaver and stick with it forever or we ll have to find some sort of ftp collaborative editor or we ll have to implement versioning control

3728970
vbscript	jscript
does jscript s object destruction model differ to vbscript s

3728974
x86	64bit
in x86 architecture an int is 32 bits but in x64 an int is 64bit

3729041
webclient	webrequest
short of writing your own http client you re pretty much stuck with webrequest or webclient which leverages webrequest for its work

3729046
auto-generate	edmx
i have a property auto-generate from database in my edmx description

3729063
kde	gnome
both kde and gnome have one for instance

3729099
width	height
i can t get paper size working with a custom width and height in cm

3729127
disk	ram
if there will be hundreds of millions of instances in memory the savings are going to get pretty big but if that is the case you may just not have enough ram to deal with it and you may have to store this structure on disk and work with parts of it at a time

3729183
subclass	abstract-class
i have an nsarray of objects that all subclass with their different types from a more abstract-class

3729206
int	double
there s a nice example of how to use sortedarrayusingfunction to sort with int values in the answer to this question sorting an array of double or cllocationdistance values on the iphone

3729220
pascal	delphi
and finding reliable implementation in pascal delphi might be difficult too

3729301
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
if you re not a systemd daemons with elevated privileges your only consistent choice is a dot directory in the launchd user s home directory

3729326
integer	unsigned
you will therefore have to convert your output image inv back to an unsigned 8-bit integer using the function uint8 to recover the original image

3729331
ubuntu	linux
my question is how hard would it be to install ubuntu linux on these machines set it all up in a network and install things like python cython on it

3729344
width	margin
the usual cross-browser compatible way is the div wrapper with a margin then setting the width of the div to 100 inside that

3729344
width	height
this is necessary for ie6 too which doesn t support absolute edge positioning setting left and right but not width or top and bottom but not height on any element

3729345
post	get
see this blog post for the difference between load and get

3729346
kerberos	ntlm
i m pretty sure this has to do with the ntlm kerberos issues descibed in the article but i m not sure how to get around it

3729349
int	chars
the standard requires that the int value of all chars required by the standard a-z a-z 0-9 basic punctuation etc. be positive so any system using an encoding where these chars values are outside the range of signed chars must have plain chars be unsigned

3729401
uiview	subviews
i have a root uiview with two subviews

3729428
x86	64bit
as far as i am aware if the unmanaged dll is 32-bit my wrapper dll will have to be 32-bit and that will force my c# project to use the x86 platform even if i have both 32- and 64bit versions of the unmanaged dll available

3729464
serializable	deserialization
also be prepared that the actual bottleneck will be in serializable deserialization of objects passed between client and server of course if they re complicated

3729483
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox and google-chrome and in fact the correct headers are passed in firefox and google-chrome

3729483
post	get
note the new page is on a different site but i don t know why that would cause a problem with a post and not a get

3729483
post	get
my current work around is to use a get instead of a post but that s ugly and it limits us in the size of data we can pass but for now at least it works

3729526
versioning	upgrade
keeping jar separate is better as it is easy to upgrade only the specific jars to its new versioning without touching any other configuration

3729532
stdout	stderr
capture stderr from python subprocess.popen command stderr subprocess.pipe stdout subprocess.pipe

3729571
folder	directory
the problem is that the class library assembly only gets installed in the application folder directory but i also need it in the sub directory otherwise one of the windows form applications will not run

3729604
express	node.js
express is a framework much like sinatra based off of node.js

3729645
integer	unsigned
which is i believe why some languages have opted to not have unsigned integer types

3729645
width	height
so in this scenario even though width and height cannot be conceptually be negative there is no real gain in making them unsigned except for requiring some casts to get rid of warnings regarding mixing signed and unsigned types

3729655
many-to-many	one-to-many
as far as actually determining the relationship between these it s generally many-to-many with the unifying context for a useable one-to-many relationship being a class or section of a course or subject

3729676
division	modulo
the way it works is to use integer division and the modulo to extract the hh mm and ss parts of each timestamp and convert each part into seconds

3729678
hide	show
i think you could clean it up by using a little more html and then just using the js to hide show the desired bits

3729696
pop-up	dialog
i m using the jquery dialog feature to provide pop-up windows with fullcalendar

3729708
integer	unsigned
regardless of how inelegant the above unsigned cycles might look to you there s no way to avoid them entirely even if you never use unsigned integer types

3729714
google-chrome	firefox
update your js to this and it will work in ie google-chrome and firefox

3729770
children	parent
without going through and assign all of the data to its parent nodes through opject children type of scenario.

3729787
hide	show
should i hide the entire page s content put a message about needing js enabled and then hide the message and show the content with js

3729790
suppressfinalize	finalizer
if idisposable is implemented properly with a finalizer that calls dispose and no suppressfinalize the garbage collector will get to it eventually

3729793
put	get
you have the href int he anchor so all you have to do is use the jquery load function to get the linked to html and put it on your page

3729810
ubuntu	linux
i could compile using code blocks and run the code on linux ubuntu but when i ported it over to the mac and installed the boost library i can compile it using code blocks and specifying the location of the regex libraries but it won t run

3729878
width	height
you could also of course set the height and width of the containing div as well

3729894
pull	push
instead of having the worker thread push the updates to the ui thread via events consider having the ui thread pull or poll them periodically

3729934
bazaar	git
what you can do is use a distributed version control software git mercurial bazaar fossil.

3729934
pull	push
until you pull from or push to other repositories

3729934
pull	push
those are transactions push pull of changes between repositories your s a clone of your s with some special modifications a friend s repo a teammate repo a dev team repo a public repo what you want

3729934
put	get
as the organisation is free in your specific case you certainly want to have a private team repo somewhere where your teammates will get and put changes in and another public repo maybe on bitbucket.org or github.org if your choose git that will not move until you decide to push your team repo changes in the public repo

3729944
bash	zsh
no idea about zsh but bash doesnâ t know about regular expressions in paths only wildcards

3730014
folder	directory
for scripts that go in the home directory you d typically use home bin folder instead which is usually on the path

3730034
google-chrome	firefox
please for the sake of peace and everything else i already know i can make firefox or google-chrome addons

3730036
pseudo-class	visited
and that is not by far the worst problem with putting a secret token in the url it remains in the browser history it can be seen in the referer when the user leaves your site and any website the user visits can launch a brute-force or dictionary attack via the visited css pseudo-class

3730040
base	fractions
even in base 10 this notation cannot accurately represent most simple fractions

3730040
int	double
the problem with floats and double is that the vast majority of money-like numbers don t have an exact representation as a int times a power of two

3730040
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
in fact the only fractions of a hundred between 0 100 and 100 100 which are significant when dealing with money because they re integer cents that can be represented exactly as an ieee-754 binary floating-point number are 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 and 1

3730167
hide	show
i have used css to hide and show the drop down menu

3730167
hide	show
i have used css to hide and show the drop down menu

3730205
min	max
all other columns or expressions used in the query other than those defined in the group by must be an expression based on an aggregation function like count sum avg min max etc... that produce a value based on a calculation which will be applied to all the rows in the pre-aggregated result set

3730205
min	max
once this is done there will be only one row per the other columns in the select statement need to have a min max would work just as well only in order to satisfy the syntacical requirement mentioned in bold italics above

3730205
min	max
in your case there will only be one non-null row in the set so taking the min or the max is necessary only because of the syntax requirement.

3730280
apache	lighttpd
i m trying to run lighttpd on ubuntu in parallel with apache but it won t startup on the ip address and server that i have specified

3730318
int	chars
digits â gives you a zero-padded chars string of your int

3730325
width	height
i need to setup vertices for a rectangle - i have a square example how would i modify it to get a rectangle 5 times the width and half the height

3730369
bash	zsh
this would work in bash and probably zsh as well

3730371
getter	setter
so you must have a getter for the company which must not return null or the next operation will fail and a setter for the address on the company object

3730371
getter	setter
the setter getter must be public

3730396
hash	salt
for our own framework pulse we decided to sign each url by generating a custom hash code on the uri which is then salt with session stored secret a long which serializable out of the box before being digested with sha-256

3730465
gridview	rowdatabound
implement the gridview s rowdatabound event and make the change in there if the user s security role is inadequate

3730599
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
however if you are going to need to vary the size of the storage you re better off using a with malloc realloc and free

3730604
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy if at all possible or strcpy for your assignment

3730641
jstl	taglib
then i found out that i have to replace all my c taglib declarations with the new uri of java.sun.com jsp jstl core instead of java.sun.com jstl core

3730722
collabnet	svn
i have both tortoisesvn gui and the collabnet svn cli installed

3730737
jobs	cron
provided this is not a server application i would recommend breaking up the script into cron jobs

3730765
packets	multicast
udp multicast message - you can use the system.net.sockets namespace to send udp packets and build a client to listen for them which can be run of n number of remote server

3730778
feedback	review
the coder takes that feedback and does a destructive rebase on that topic branch re-pushes it rewriting the history on his github repo then the review cycle repeats until it s acceptable to merge

3730785
int	boolean
if you want to use int or long int to represent as arrays of boolean or as sets of int take a look at

3730834
post	get	post	put	put	get
there s nothing preventing you from having routes like resource id with http methods get put post delete in asp.net mvc

3730847
int	boolean
i have not formally demonstrated that it still works when the int or boolean literals are replaced by

3730883
pop-up	dialog
you click on an icon which pop-up with the modal dialog box to allow you to add the car brand

3730897
hash	salt
salt hash

3730905
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfectly in google-chrome but the keyboard shortcuts do not work in firefox

3730905
keydown	keyup
in fact in firefox it does not seem to register the events for keyup keydown at all

3730937
put	get
what do i put in my view to get the query results of my model

3730974
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my site in progress is working great so far in all browsers i ve tested to-date firefox safari google-chrome and ie8 but not in ie7 i dont know about ie6 or other browsers ..

3731028
post	put
as mark b suggests in his comment on his own post you can put this in a function and call it in the reset handler for your form

3731187
division	modulo
you want to do you want int division not modulo

3731212
int	chars
i have unsigned chars signedchars unsigned int signed int utf-8 chars and blobs that i want to populate in a single column

3731240
int	chars
the above link as well as the below link claim that for fixed length columns chars 10 or int a value of null occupies the length of the column plus 1 byte to flag whether it s null or not

3731278
hex	binary
i have a hex value that i m grabbing from a text file then i m passing it to a2b_hex to convert it to the proper binary representation

3731292
boost	stl
the easiest straightforward way is to use an stl list or maybe boost offers something appropriate

3731340
public	protected
that way you can expose the protected methods on the abstract class you want to test through public methods on the extending class that simply call through to the method on the abstract class

3731360
boost	stl
same code can be used for an stl vector which if you predict the size of your input in advance well enough will give you a performance boost

3731367
google-chrome	firefox
i only tested this in google-chrome firefox ie7

3731391
ant	maven
i use ant and maven and configure both of them to run with tests and without tests to speed up my build process

3731393
ciimage	nsimage
i am trying to convert an nsimage to a ciimage

3731400
put	get
the easiest way to do this is to put your click binding code in a separate function call it in document.ready to set up the binds and then also call it in the ajax get callback to set new binds on the new elements that have been returned

3731420
post	get
when i use jquery 1.4.2 to send a post request to my server to which the server responds by sending json data i occasionally get xhr 408 errors meaning that the server timed out while waiting for the client to finish its request and less frequently xhr 12152 errors i don t know what these signify

3731420
opera	safari
safari and opera seem fine

3731438
subtraction	addition
using bitwise operators and i suppose addition and subtraction how can i check if a signed integer is positive specifically not negative and not zero

3731455
awt	swing
my application uses the awt so not swing

3731477
ssl	https
please note i m trying to use ssl and https

3731477
put	get
i also have used httpcfg and set the cert thumbprint to port 9307 however when i put 9307 on the service address i get connection actively refused

3731534
ciimage	nsimage
your best bet is probably to get a cgimage from the nsimage and create the ciimage from that

3731546
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb will perform very differently for example not least because myisam is non-transactional and can therefore skip a lot of consistency logic

3731608
min	max
points with the min and max x coordinate form an even closer pair than the linear

3731632
initializer	class-method
of course meta is a class but i say it is not seen as a class because it is not used as a class you don t initializer it you don t put class-method only class attributes.

3731639
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
the main problem with this solution is that it need to be allowed by the web server and either isn t installed by default apache isn t active by default lighttpd or need a specific configuration nginx

3731650
free	malloc
c resort to c functions like malloc free and cast the pointers.

3731693
zsh	tcsh
see the keychain man page for csh tcsh zsh or whatever

3731765
accessor	properties
if you re using c# and the properties is just a simple field accessor then you can use auto-implemented properties and the naming problem just disappears

3731770
rdf	owl
one option is a so-called lifting tool that converts a xml schema xsd to a rdf schema such as rdfs or owl

3731894
put	get
without this line and changing the sql the code works fine but when i put this line back i get this error

3731898
sproutcore	cappuccino
if you use either sproutcore or cappuccino for your frontend doesn t it mean that everyone could see your javascript and copy it

3731902
ubuntu	linux
also to note i mainly develop c# on linux with ubuntu mono and monodevelop and i haven t had any problems with it working under the mono 2.6.7 runtime

3731908
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout setinterval are the best ways to implement wait pause function in javascript

3731924
children	parent
alternatively if the relationship between children and parent isn t defined by a foreign key you can use a few simple linq queries or a helper class but the actions behind will still be to walk the collection adding the children to the parent

3731998
range	min
min mean range a3 a20

3732014
mouseover	mouseout
problem is now that the mouseout seems abrupt whereas the mouseover seems fine what am i doing wrong

3732060
google-chrome	safari
loading css rules dynamically in webkit safari google-chrome

post	get
alternatively if i get around to changing it i ll post here also

3732105
punctuation	words
i would like to create a regular expression to match every words whitespace punctuation and special characters in a string except for specific keywords or phrases

3732109
post	get
is there a way to create a very basic http server supporting only get post in java using just the java se api without writing code to manually parse http requests and manually format http responses

3732155
post	get
with this code i managed to get a custom post type appearing in the admin section just fine

3732183
post	get
since flex 3 only offers post and get i have to use the

3732187
put	get
we can now put those two snippets together and get the hue

3732227
post	get
i ve already spent almost an entire day checking out post related to stencils in mdx but just couldn t get it to work

3732232
mouseout	mouseleave
the normal state will work as the mouseout or mouseleave

3732241
r5rs	r6rs
there is no standard multi-line comment in the scheme reports up to r5rs but r6rs has added a syntax that was widely used anyway #|...|#

3732252
spaces	delimiter
note s string of characters delimiter by white spaces or newline ie

3732261
mouse	keyboard
you may be thinking that you don t want to restrict yourself to mouse clicks don t worry there s a mouseclick event for that click includes keyboard changes as well.

3732329
google-chrome	firefox
so far this code only works correctly on firefox 3 and google-chrome

3732347
backtracking	greedy
by contrast the greedy repetition causes as much damage as possible but the backtracking fails to leave things as they were to the a stack

3732347
backtracking	greedy
because what it basically looks like to me is that backtracking a balancing group in a greedy repetition may cause imbalance and thus this could potentially be categorized as a bug or at the very least a somewhat astonishing behavior that is inadequately documented

3732375
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the browsers i tried google-chrome firefox safari and opera appear to ignore values set using scientific notation in css

3732403
16-bit	64bit
i ve got code to get set up into 64bit mode as well as well as an assembly language editor that i specifically designed for os development search for inventor ide in that it has built-in assembling and linking of 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit code at defined addresses and file offsets

3732404
min	max
the original array itself will contain around 70 to 80 sets and the min and max values can get as high as 9999999999 so iterating through a number line in a n n+1 n+2 manner is not feasible

3732423
put	get
hey i am new to programming in c++ and i get the hang of it but i got stuck on this one simple problem i am suppose to create a shift cipher using the letters a-z and shifting them 3 places i get everything but when i do my output i get extra letters that are unneeded like i know i have to put a terminator and i did but doesn t seem to work

3732444
jquery	scriptaculous
the webapp was built using prototype scriptaculous and we typically use jquery when building our web apps

3732509
mouseleave	mouseenter
one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave

3732509
keydown	mouseenter	keydown	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
bind a keydown on mouseenter and simply .unbind it on mouseleave

3732523
punctuation	words
i am reading in the words one letter at a time stopping on appropriate punctuation or spaces

3732546
bytearrayoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
one option is to use a bytearrayoutputstream to buffer the data bytes that you ve read from the bufferedinputstream .

3732551
post	get
it is important to realize that you will have to encode the data whether you send the data through post or get

3732566
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
i have a lengthy operation o that is called through a nsinvocationoperation itself scheduled by adding it to a nsoperationqueue so that it runs asynchronously

3732571
prepare	bindparam	prepare	execute
digging through the zf code i see things like bindparam and execute and prepare

3732580
int	double
my double linked lists have a type int and a type string to hold a number and a word

3732594
direct3d	directdraw
that depends on the game and whether they are using directdraw or direct3d

3732594
direct3d	directdraw
directdraw only uses 2d surfaces thus everything is an image direct3d however is built around everything 3d thus to even draw an image you would draw a shape using vertices then apply a texture to it the texture would be the image

3732594
direct3d	directdraw
it should be noted that directdraw is old having stopped in dx7 and microsoft recommends using direct3d with textured quads to do 2d blitting

3732618
subtraction	add
but one day they forgot the leading c and the compiler choked trying to add dozens of variables between what it thought was subtraction operators

3732654
union-find	tree
i was building a metadata migration tool and i had to use topological sort for dependency resolution various forms of graph traversals for queries on metadata and a modified variation of tarjan s union-find datastructure to partition forest-like structured metadata to tree

3732656
getter	setter
you usually place these kinds of constants in a configuration object which has getter and setter in the servlet context and access them with

3732678
children	parent
you re not gonna be able to have the count of the parent comments and the children comments on the same query

3732683
union	distinct
one more thing to mention your union select s should be union all select because without the all the engine has to remove duplicates just as if you d indicated select distinct

3732701
put	get
i put the function calls on separate lines to get gdb to step over them one at a time

3732735
maven	pom.xml
from what i understand the problem here is the pom.xml file created from the 2.1-snapshot requires maven 2.2.1 but eclipse-iam does not use that version yet

3732745
textarea	textbox
we are able to provide a connection to a textbox using ado.net to the database...but if we are willing to specify a particular region for our text then we are unable to use textarea in this case as far as sql connection through sql server is concerned.we are bound to use multiline textbox for this situation.why textarea doesn t support connectin with the database

3732761
textarea	textbox
examine the source to find your multi-tline textbox and you ll discover that it already is a textarea

3732812
uiview	subviews
using the example posted by brock i modified it so that it is a category of uiview instead uiviewcontroller and made it recursive so that any subviews can hopefully find the parent uiviewcontroller

3732850
try-catch	exception-handling
these will catch unhandled exception-handling as for exception-handling you are handling yourself with a try-catch block you could write a helper class to manage your exception-handling and do what you need with them

3732874
lxml	elementtree
i think the python standard library includes support for a subset of xpath in elementtree too so you might be able to implement that there somehow if you do not wish to install lxml which isn t included in stdlib .

3732886
free	malloc
consider doing a deep copy and handling the memory manually with malloc and free

3732903
post	get
i ve left a comment on this blog post indicating how to get zeromq ruby installed on ubuntu 10.04

3732912
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is how it displays for me in google-chrome safari firefox on 10.6.4

3732923
realloc	malloc
this will even work for the first allocation since realloc works like malloc if you pass it a null

3732971
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
word-wrap is supported in ie 5.5+ firefox 3.5+ and webkit browsers such as google-chrome and safari

3732975
textarea	textbox

for example if i m adding an onsubmit handler to the this is much easier more straightforward when the natural submit behavior from a button is happening it s also easier with any js library tying in your functions in the right order when not set server-side when it renders is much easier when there is no client-side onclick interfering

pop-up	dialog
because i d like this dialog to pop-up without user interaction i m using the ready event in my jquery code

3736495

equals	compareto
if the result of compareto is 0 the method assumes the elements equals

3737403
floating-point	fixed-point
ada natively supports fixed-point math as well as floating-point

3737403
floating-point	fixed-point
fixed-point can be much more exact than floating-point as long as the number s exponents remain in range

3737432
cos	sin
say you are working with a sin cos lookup table that is 256 entries long

3737432
cos	sin
it s very convienent and common at least in embedded land to use a u8 value to access the table so that the index is wrapped naturally to the table size while preseving the circular nature of sin cos

3737515
integer	unsigned
if you re just working with signed or unsigned integer types it s pretty simple

3737515
floating-point	integer
in mixed floating-point and integer calculations it will convert the integer to the floating-point type perhaps losing some precision

3737518
hash	md5
this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5

3737546
cout	cin
here s a basic tutorial on cin and cout see-in out

3737547
post	get
in this situation the code above does not work because if it is placed inside a service method it sends a post request instead of a get request which of course results in a method not allowed error

3737555
cout	cin
these are exposed most simply in c++ by std cin and std cout

3737567
int	double
please note this is not the best version of this program eg. what if the user doesn t pass an argument or doesn t pass a number as an argument or passes a number larger than an int or passes a number that is a float or double instead of an int

3737573
hide	show
i need a button that is overlayed on my page that i can show hide and dynamically position just about anywhere on my page

3737574
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me in google-chrome and firefox

3737576
cout	cin
to accomplish this you could use cout cin and string

3737646
cos	sin	cos	exp
you can imagine some sort of expression tree with predefined constants arithmetical operations and perhaps algebraic roots of polynomials and transcendantal exp sin cos log etc functions

3737670
int	chars	unsigned	short
int 32bits uint16_t unsigned short int8_t signed chars

3737670
int	chars
int 16bits uint16_t unsigned int int8_t signed chars

3737690
versioning	upgrade
the technical details such as library names visual studio c# and .net versioning are all different and the problem being solved library upgrade vs new project setup is different

3737701
gif	png
just for graphics photoshop elements will do - photoshop is overkill as is the gimp - unless you re using flash for complex interactive stuff you only need to generate jpg gif animated or not and png files

3737728
vsto	add-in
without getting into a large debate as to the merits of doing so can some one provide direction as to using a vsto application level add-in word 2007 to oepn a ms word document from either a database or a web service

3737741
width	height
draggable.helperproportions height 10 width 10

3737935
ienumerable	icollection
these can also be iterated as an icollection is an ienumerable meaning you can use linq to check for the existence of a key

3737988
portrait	landscape
an issue to watch out for is that while you can supply different layouts for portrait and landscape onupdate won t be called on a screen rotation

3738014
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in the following using firefox opera and google-chrome

3738024
int	chars
bytes can represent some chars for the same reason an int can represent a long

3738033
vbscript	jscript
does jscript s object destruction model differ to vbscript s

3738075
innodb	myisam
checksum table - this would be almost perfect for my needs except that it only works for myisam tables we use innodb

3738101
getter	setter
your getter and setter looks good.

3738103
versioning	upgrade
even though they fix things very fast it s always a pain having to wait and then upgrade to a new versioning only to find other regressions

3738134
unsigned	short
unsigned signed is just short specification for unsigned int signed int source so no you don t have variable with no data type

3738153
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
some webserver options apache nginx lighttpd

3738153

3738164
division	modulo
using modulo and division to extract the bits into a voting matrix cf m in lieu of bitwise ops only added to r recently i believe

3738167
hash	md5
what i d like to for example do is have thread procs in the class somehow so that ex i could create an md5 checksum class and have an array of these objects each on their own thread checking its hash while the ui thread is not impaired by this and another class could simply keep track of the handles and wait for multiple objects before saying complete or something

3738173
ubuntu	linux	libusb	pyusb
i have been toying around with pyusb lately and found that it works beautifully on linux ubuntu has libusb 0.1 and 1.0 as well as openusb .

3738188
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but instead of trying to detect any number of mobile browsers i d just like to see if the user is using ie firefox safari google-chrome or opera

3738220
put	get
put together some repeatable performance tests the closer you can get these to real life scenarios the better

3738222
rss	feed
my application is taking in various streams of data from social media rss and combining it into one feed on the service that i will offer to businesses

3738233
stringstream	fstream
currently i have a program that loads binary data into a stringstream and then pases the data to a fstream like so

3738243
range	minimum
the rate can vary from .5f to 2.0f though the extremes typically don t sound great so you may want to set an acceptable range .4f and a minimum rate .85f

3738244
touchesbegan	touchesended
i know how i detect this gesture touchesbegan and touchesended for example is x coordinates are distanced more than 100 pixels or something else but i really donâ t now how to animate my needs

3738244
uiview	subviews
in fact my uiview will contain subviews which are 9 uibuttons

3738387
post	get
if you manage to get any of the latter options to work please go ahead and post them as an alternative answer - i will upvote and mark them as the favored one

3738397
put	get
i found that when you get the required watir not found message in regular ruby you need to put before require watir the text require rubygems

3738424
margin	height
basically i want to take the height of ul#bar then add 80px to that number and make that #foobar s top margin

3738433
multiplying	add
find the index of the ordinal in the array add 1 and multiplying by 1024 that many times to get to bits per second

3738469
folder	directory
deleting the bin folder in the project directory doesn t help as then vc just complains that it can t find the .exe instead of recompiling

3738500
namenode	hdfs
namenode hdfs

3738561
disk	ram
the os could decide not to flush changes to that file to disk because it may think that doing so won t matter unless it needs to free up some ram

3738598
realloc	malloc
if i can t pin down a reasonable maximum i tend to use malloc and realloc to grow the array as needed

3738660
mouseover	mouseout
we want to make each of the states react to mouseover mouseout click

3738672
post	get
in the standard rest scheme the index action and the create action both have the same url recipes and only differ in that index is accessed using get and create is accessed using post

3738687
rss	feed
if i m dealing with data from an external source - for example a user has many messages - and the external source simply provides the latest few entities like an rss feed how can check for duplicates unless it either is aware of the mapper or it searches through the collection seems like an inefficient thing to do

3738694
tabs	tabpanel
if you set the width of the tabpanel to something larger it will be assuming this is not a tabpanel that allows the user to continue to add other tabs in it

3738726
put	get
since you have a lot of string literals which are constant they should get put in a read only section of your executable

3738730
hash	salt
use the returned string as a salt when building the user hash again i would use the userid or username as an input for the hash builder because they wont change like the users password or email

3738780
post	get
when accessing post with the get method the default routing send the request to the show action with the id param set to sort

3738792
int	chars
what you should do to get int values of digit chars is substract 0 instead of simple casting

3738797
width	margin
a way you can automate the width guessing is having a span that has no margin or padding add in each character for each font and size then measure the width of the span and use that

3738850
equals	tostring
where this most noticeably falls down is tostring and equals because neither of them behaves in a reasonable fashion on arrays but we cannot intercept those calls with implicit conversions because they are defined on java.lang.object

3738895
tostring	getter
your foo class has a tostring method which prints like and the val probably called the wrong getter

3738903
ddms	adt
it means you have two copies of ddms or the eclipse adt plugin running simultaneously and they re stepping on each other

3738934
children	parent
now i need to load a parent instance remove some or all children and save the changes

3738966
cells	tablecell
hi i was wondering if it was possible to merge cells using table tablecell for powerpoint like colspan in html similar to this example for excel

3739023
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly in firefox google-chrome safari ie8 and ie7

3739037
gridview	rowdatabound
you probably want to use the rowdatabound event of the gridview something like this

3739047
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar java.util.date

3739085
profiler	visualvm
is there a way to remote start a cpu profiler and specify package exclusions like you can with the visualvm tool through i assume jmx

3739085
profiler	visualvm
it appears that visualvm uses some netbeans library to do the parsing of the cpu profiler

3739165
width	height
then i get reported to the console that the width is -2080177216 and the height 0

3739165
width	height
although i know that the width is actually 50 and the height 50

3739221
width	height
sets the width and height of the image

3739232
cvs	svn
i m wondering if it s possible in eclipse to continue to use both cvs for importing and updating some contributed code and at the same time use another eclipse svn module to version control my code

3739240
width	height
the size method returns an nssize a struct whose width and height members are of type float

3739260
cvs	svn
there is absolutely no problem using both the built-in cvs support and one of the two major svn plugins for different projects in the same workspace

3739260
cvs	svn
i haven t tried using svn and cvs for the same project but i believe that it should in fact be possible as long as each vcs is configured to ignore the other s metadata directories

3739300
post	get
if it was sent over post get did you escape it properly before inserting it into that query

3739316
lxml	elementtree
try elementtree or lxml

3739329
onmouseover	onmousedown
edit i did some experimentation and found that you might want to use the onmousedown event instead of the onmouseover event

3739332
png	ico
end with .js css ico giv jpg png redirect it to index.php

3739335
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know why this happens and why it works in google-chrome and firefox

3739339
gif	png
it s a rewriterule redirecting every request except requests for those file types js css icons gif jpg png graphics to index.php

3739369
getter	setter
from my point of view there is no difference between making data members public or having public properties which have getter and setter where you pass your private data members through

3739370
min	max
it selects min max interval just fine

3739372
put	get
besides he s got the basics and he s not a beginner so the best you both can do is get good guides cookbooks and programm put some goals and write code

3739374
jar	manifest.mf
instead the class-path entry in jar s meta-inf manifest.mf file will be used

3739375
width	height
if yes you can t get the width height of any component before showing the form you should use getpreferredwidth instead

3739384
getter	setter
the benefit of properties is that later on you could decide to add validation etc to the setter method or make the getter method do some calculation or caching and none of the code that already calls your property would need to change - since the class interface remained stable

3739401
cdr	cons
for example in a lisp where cons cells are used to implement singly-linked lists the car operation returns the first element of the list while cdr returns the rest of the list

3739410
getter	setter
instead of simply making the property public thus allowing public access without any verification you can use property getter and setter in c#

3739416
getter	setter
the unfortunate truth of oop is that a lot of your methods are getter and setter and properties are just a way to make this easier to write

3739422
integer	fractions
the result is an integer so the fractions part is truncated

3739426
public	protected
normally singleton classes have protected constructor and this will cause a problem because the ams needs the midlet class constructor to be public not protected nor private

3739444
phpstorm	webstorm
i recommend you to give webstorm or phpstorm from jetbrains a try

3739444
cvs	svn
it even brings ftp and svn cvs git support

3739444
phpstorm	aptana
i completely abandoned aptana in favor for phpstorm

3739452
post	put
if you want to pass a complex type then it cannot be anywhere in the uri but rather in the body of a post put request

3739522
unicorn	webrick
different servers mongrel webrick apache using various mechanisms unicorn all have different memory characteristics

3739534
apache	nginx
your apache or nginx in front of the passenger will queue requests until a passenger worker becomes available

3739577
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions as avg sum group by degrade performance

3739579
spweb	spsite
it s not an answer to your question you already found the solution yourself but you may want to put your spsite and spweb objects in a using block

3739586
put	get
if you are going to have to put a special check in there anyway with different logic when you get nan you might as well just check for 0 in the denominator up front

3739590
hash	md5
the c# key is encoded in utf8 before being hash with md5

3739602
google-chrome	firefox
aparently you can fake tables like here but i am not sure if this works in all browsers edit it works on winxp ie8 google-chrome 7 firefox

3739645
min	max
until such a time as browsers implement the calc min and max functions this isn t possible outside of scripting either server- or client- side or using a table

3739645
opera	firefox
currently and surprisingly perhaps only to me neither firefox webkit or opera support calc function not even with the various flavours of vendor prefix

3739647
pop-up	dialog
click rate - that should pop-up a normal boxy dialog but styles aren t working

3739680
centos	linux
on centos 5.3 linux i started selenium server 1.0.3 java -jar selenium-server.jar

3739710
width	height
so you might have a function called littlehouse that takes x y for the centre and w and h for width and height then you would do something like

3739737
easymock	powermockito
i found this example where they used powermockito and easymock to stub mock the menu and menuitem classes for android

3739793
restrict	shared
i assume you re running off a shared web host in which case you should watch out lots of hosts use a custom php.ini file that restrict what exec does such as preventing it from being used at all or there might be some system in-place that prevents processes spawned from exec from taking more than a couple of seconds to run which it why it might work fine from the shell but not within php s context

3739808
int	chars
internal exception org.postgresql.util.psqlexception error operator does not exist int chars varying

3739808
int	chars
caused by org.postgresql.util.psqlexception error operator does not exist int chars varying

3739900
int	chars
i want to validate the data contained by value objects before inserting into the database check that php string is smaller than 255 chars before inserting into a column of type varchar 255 or that a string is not inserted in an int 11 table column php date has the correct format etc.

3739974
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

3739974
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

3739974
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

3739974
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

3739974
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

3739984
hide	show
first of all define the view you are going to show hide it will contain the big green arrow .

3739987
put	get
note that it s a bad idea to use gets it provides no way to put a limit on how many characters get read into the buffer so if you type in more characters than will fit in the buffer you ll end up overflowing the buffer resulting in data corruption an application crash a huge security vulnerability and or any number of other unpredictable results

3739993
gentoo	ubuntu
what s interesting is that i have python 2.6.4 on karmic koala ubuntu and python 2.6.5 on gentoo

3739993
gentoo	ubuntu
on ubuntu the unicode_escape-decode result is udbb8 udc03 and on gentoo it s u u000fe003 both correctly of length 2

3740009
perforce	svn
but i agree with the earlier comments - i ve gone the other direction moving projects from svn to perforce because svn could not cut it when it came to merging

3740024
client-side	server-side
new now has xcode client-side libraries header files and objective c objects that let your apps do multi-threaded odbc using server-side drivers

3740031
free	malloc
there is a compile-time option in memcached to enable malloc free mechanism

3740031
free	malloc
why not use malloc free

3740039
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome and firefox

3740039
google-chrome	firefox
i love google-chrome and firefox

3740043
free	malloc
in many cases a malloc fill free will leave the memory mapped in unless your allocator uses mmap instead of sbrk

3740069
rubygems	bundler
usr lib rubygems 1.8 gems bundler-1.0.0 lib bundler shared_helpers.rb

3740074
client-side	server-side
new has xcode client-side odbc libraries header files and multi-threaded objective c objects that let your apps send sql to server-side odbc drivers and get back binary results

3740078
width	height
my imade doesnt display when the image height is less than 981pz width is less than 477pz

3740094
width	height
but if you are looking for a way in php to find the height and width of an image you can use the getimagesize function

3740105
min	max
there are settings for min max heap size settings

3740111
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the documentation doesn t show uiviewcontroller as inheriting from uinavigationcontroller

3740114
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller has a property called navigationcontroller which is an instance of a uinavigationcontroller

3740137
width	margin
for example in a fixed width center aligned layout its typical to use margin 0px auto

3740137
google-chrome	safari
on my osx machine safari and google-chrome don t exhibit this behavior with flash objects

3740155
free	malloc
you need to use malloc and free or other dynamic allocation

3740162
width	height
also you can reduce both load and processing times by optimizing the images width and height beforehand for their target use

3740174
put	get
maybe you can put your images in the war file and use getresourceasstream to get the file

3740187
ubuntu	linux
previous question just to understand what i m doing how to set chmod for a folder and all of its subfolders and files in linux ubuntu terminal

3740202
config	ini
what you re describing in your edit is how an ini config file works

3740241
sproutcore	javascriptmvc	sproutcore	qooxdoo
i have recently been browsing frameworks such as javascriptmvc qooxdoo sproutcore and others alike which are using javascript to create desktop-like apps in the browser with minimal or none css html depending on the framework

3740244
quicksort	median-of-medians
is there a practical disadvantage to implementing median-of-medians quicksort in place of introsort

3740245
move	drag
attempting to drag does not move the handle

3740254
clang	llvm
there are additional improvements that can be made by using the clang parser with the llvm compiler

3740254
clang	llvm
my recommendation is to use clang + llvm llvm compiler 1.5 if you can for faster build times more performant applications and much better compiler errors

3740254
clang	llvm
if you use c++ code or something else that the clang parser cannot handle right now use llvm gcc to still get the performance benefits in your compiled application

3740274
min	median	min	max	median	max
utilize the technique of doing several runs of the same scenario get rid of outliers your lowest and highest and evaluate your avg max min median values

3740300
consistency	acid
acid atomicity consistency isolation durability is a set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably

3740308
hash	md5
you can test if the pdf is fully generated by creating an md5 hash for the pdf at the time the file is first sent and then again while the email is sending and finally after it has been sent

3740308
hash	md5
here s an example on how to use md5 hash

3740308
hash	md5
you will notice that the md5 hash changes on each iteration of the function because the file is still being written

3740311
post	get
you really need to post the compilation errors to get more detailed answers

3740315
try-catch	exception-handling
i managed to overcome this by putting the loop in a try-catch block and discarding the exception-handling and everything works fine but it seems kind of dirty if i may say so

3740333
rss	feed
i want to display an rss feed user control

3740341
post	get
there is just one server where i get this error during a post back from an update panel it is supposed to populate and open a popup panel

3740348
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
that is uinavigationcontroller use pushviewcontroller to manage their stack of uiviewcontroller instances because that s how apple decided uinavigationcontroller should work

3740359
children	parent
i think i ve tried every combination of prev parent children next etc. and i m completely out of patience

3740363
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
finaly i solved the problem with a category of uinavigationcontroller just rewrite - uiviewcontroller popviewcontrolleranimated bool animated

3740366
width	height
one exception maybe i should allow width height in a predefined range for images.

3740372
rss	feed
to include your rss feed

3740384
calloc	malloc
malloc isn t guaranteed to initialize the memory it allocates - if you want the memory to be filled with 0 s then use calloc

3740416
htmlcleaner	jsoup
it s unclear what programming language you re using or are preferring but in java there s jsoup which is a pretty slick html parser api which contains among others a htmlcleaner based on a customizable whitelist of html tags and attributes unfortunately no css rules since that s completely out the scope of a html parser

3740416
htmlcleaner	jsoup
use the jsoup htmlcleaner with a configuration specified by a whitelist

3740439
outputstream	inputstream
if it s binary data use inputstream outputstream

3740482
hash	salt
as far as how long it would take someone to crack a password stored in the varying hash it s difficult to say without knowing the processing power of the attacker how long the passwords are if they employ rainbow tables how random the salt are etc

3740482
hash	md5
however if there is something wrong with the algorithm it could possibly lead to a much easier way to find the hash value or a different value that equates to the same hash called a collision as is the case of md5

3740502
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the root view controller call it crashingviewcontroller in the uinavigationcontroller configured for tab 4 is derived from uiviewcontroller and conforms to the uitableviewdatasource and uitableviewdelegate protocols to support a uitableview subview which is just a 4-row table each cell of which allowing the user to navigate to another view

3740625
int	boolean
it can t be a boolean anymore it needs to be an int according to this source code

3740646
versioning	upgrade
it might behave one way now but differently with a new compiler versioning an os upgrade on another platform at a customer s site when your boss watches on sundays or depending on the moon phase

3740647
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can use the .htaccess or put in directly in the httpd.conf file

3740670
free	malloc
also you should always free memory explicitly after calling malloc otherwise you will get memory leaks

3740672
object-pascal	delphi
no for the moment but soon check this link for more info about how develop android applications using the object-pascal language the delphi-prism programming language wich is based on the delphi language with monodroid

3740698
yslow	pagespeed
the disadvantage one that i can think of is that some website performance measuring tools such as pagespeed and yslow will warn you about the number of css and javascript files referenced by a page

3740739
put	get
you could put all of the objects in the same entity group but you might get some contention if too many users are trying to modify objects in an entity group at the same time

3740767
switching	screens
a common cause for crashes when something repetitive happens eg switching between tabs screens etc is memory problems

3740774
width	height
ditch the table combine the two anchors into one remove the width and height on the img tag remove the em tag then use vertical-align to center the image

3740774
width	height
removing width and height makes images display better because browsers suck at image interpolation

3740808
for-loop	arrays
if thats the case how can i copy the arrays back without an extremely wasteful for-loop

3740823
post	get
to handle get and post request

children	parent
when i save the parent object i expect the children to be added as well however an insert is generated only for the parent object

3741649
wgs84	utm
having said all that if what you want to do is just project a gps provided lat lon gs84 datum onto a local map covering an area 6â of latitude then you could do worse than projecting the wgs84 lat lon to a wgs84 utm projection then scaling and possibly rotating the map to fit at 2 known coordinates

subnet	packets	packets	multicast
broadcasting is similar to multicast but delivers the packets to everyone on the same subnet

3741870
packets	multicast
the wifi interface on android phones will drop multicast packets automatically to save power

3741870
packets	multicast
thus if you want to be able to receive multicast packets you need to grab the multicast lock which has the effect of telling the wifi driver to not drop multicast packets

3741870
multicastsocket	sockets
only use it if you are actually joining a multicast group using multicastsocket instead of datagramsocket or sockets in java android

while learning about creating ms sql reporting and deploying reports to sql reporting server i found that there is no need to worry about creating a query that involves sorting grouping and so on

3742385
sorting	grouping
all i need to do is fetch the columns and data i need from various tables and then once the data loads in dataset i can use the gui tools to do the grouping aggregate functions sorting etc which will rid of duplicate categories name

3742441

my setter and getter for the bool dosync is defined as

post	get
to give an example of when it could be useful to use this technique rather than having two separate tables if you want to query for a user s ten most recent post regardless of whether they are wall post or shared links then it is useful to have a single table where you can get the ids for these post with a single simple query

one reason to not return references is because you are using getter and setter to allow you to change the implementation of those members if you changed a private member to another type or removed it completely because it can be computed then you no longer have the ability to return a reference since there s nothing to reference

3745830
inherited	properties
jquery supports an extend method which mimics multiple inherited by allowing you to extend an object with the properties of as many objects as you want

3745830
inherited	properties
this only mimics multiple inherited because it essentially uses a for-loop to iterate over the properties of the other objects and attaches them to the targeted one -- if it actually provided multiple inherited you would be able to add remove modify attributes from one of the super objects and have the changes inherited by the sub object but that isn t the case

3745833
next	except
you can also click step over to execute the next line then stop or step into which will execute the next line except it will step into any functions that you used

3745867
qtreewidget	qtreeview
it might be better to use qtreeview instead of qtreewidget

web-inf	context-param
i usually place mine in web-inf classes applicationcontext.xml and set this as a value of the context-param

3746019
put	get
so if you want to get some informations from your methods either you wrap them into a big object here a list or you give to the method the means to put informations in your parameters

3746062
xml-rpc	json-rpc
there are so many things like soappy xml-rpc json-rpc restful web service

3746100
accessor	properties
since this is a kvc-compliant accessor kvo will wrap it when the tree controller starts observing the properties which means that sending the accessor message should be enough to trip the right notifications and cause the right side effectsâ namely updating the controller and the view

3746103
profiling	benchmarking
do it the conventional way first then profiling and benchmarking later to see where you need to optimize

3746118
getter	setter
c# properties are like getter and setter functions in java

3746136
getter	setter
is equivalent to following getter and setter in java

3746136
getter	setter
this is known as automatic property where compiler generates a backing private field and getter setter for this property

3746300
width	height
set the width and height properties to 16 and the stretch property to uniform

3746312
pull	push
if dom tree parsing or even traversal is the issue you should seriously consider switching to one of libxml2 s more efficient xml parsing tools xmltextreader the xml pull api or sax the xml push api

3746359
children	parent
i want to save just the parent to the database without having to load the children from the database

3746359

3746448
x86	64bit
finally if youâ re using 3rd party assemblies that were compiled to target x86 specifically this will mostly be assemblies that wrap other c c++ assemblies like system.data.sqlite you either need to grab the 64bit versions of them as vs2010 by default compiles to x64 when using any cpu as the target or change your target to x86

3746498
ubuntu	linux	g++	gcc
i work with linux ubuntu and gcc g++

3746503

3746514
glut	glew
opengl library is imported glew library and glut and

3746541
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
if you are look at using fileinputstream and fileoutputstream with inputstreamreader and outputstreamwriter wrappers respectively

3746541
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
the fileinputstream and fileoutputstream classes work with bytes and then the stream reader writers work with converting bytes to characters according to the encoding you choose

3746571
post	get
but since codeigniter only supports post and not get method it can be enabled but i m looking for way around i need to pass that variable via post to uri

3746593
slideup	slidedown
you are calling the slidedown without waiting for slideup to finish

3746609
children	parent
this is weird a cascade all-delete-orphan should cascade the delete operation from the parent to the children

3746618
post	get
so i read your post dear fred and get some ideas about binding like this

3746696
for-loop	arrays
foreach creates a copy of the arrays and therefore is not as efficient as a for-loop

3746708
post	put
just put your file inside of request.data and setup method to post

3746736
cos	sin
then you may do the following trick first calculate sin a and cos a

3746736
cos	sin
sin n+1 a sin n a cos a + cos n a sin a

3746736
cos	sin
cos n+1 a cos n a cos a - sin n a sin a

3746749
vmware	virtualbox
you need macos to run the sdk and macos generally runs only on apple computers - unless you want to run it inside vmware or virtualbox hardware virtualization must be supported by your cpu

3746779
free	malloc
also because malloc and free have their prototype there

3746795
stdout	stderr
on linux stdout in line buffered and stderr unbuffered

3746795
stdout	fflush
so the remark that you add fflush stdout

3746810
getter	setter

3746838
button	checkbox
in the above code onclick of the button all the selected values of the check box should appear in the selectedhome td with a undo link next to to it and be invisible from the first td.onselect the undo button the checkbox should go back to the initial position.how to achieve this using jquery

3746839
post	put
the best decision that i see is to set image in maindiv with background option and just put infpanel inside maindiv but because of some technical requirements it is better to post image through just tag

3746843
int	chars
this takes care of the simple atomic case simply replace type with chars or int as appropriate

3746843
ceil	floor
in particular if we are rotating up k places then we are moving bits from k n words away in the array and the n bits can span floor k n and ceil k n locations away in the array

3746843
ceil	floor
for each word in the array the new upper n- k mod n bits will be the lower bits of floor k n words away and the new lower k mod n bits will be the upper bits of ceil k n words away

3746853
min	max
use instead returns a number between min inclusive and max non-inclusive

3746872
getter	setter
i know that you use synthesize to create setter and getter methods which makes things easier because then you don t have to write your own

3746872
getter	setter
there are certain places where you have to use self.property instead of just property in order to make use of the setter and getter methods such as in dealloc and initwithcoder

3746872
getter	setter
this tells me that these setter and getter methods are doing something else that s important besides making it easier for you to set and get a variable

3746878
punctuation	words
this still allows words to contain punctuation but it disallows both numerals and whitespace

3746878
punctuation	words
there is a problem with your usage of words boundaries - if a words can consist of punctuation then words beginning or ending on punctuation won t have a words boundary so your regular expression will miss them

3746900
accessor	properties
these lines generate an accessor that correctly calls release and retain when you want to change the mystring properties of an object

3746922
int	double
i m creating a generic class csvreader so that i can handle data of different types int double string

3746932
udp	tcp
data will normally be sent over dial-up hence udp instead of tcp but also needs to support fast ethernet

3746932
udp	tcp
it s ok to occasionally drop frames hence udp instead of tcp

3746950
getter	setter
just property in order to make use of the setter and getter methods such as

3746950
getter	setter
this tells me that these setter and getter methods are doing something

3746950
getter	setter
the difference here is that using self.propertyname specifically invokes the getter setter when used within that class where directly using propertyname doesn t - it accesses the instance variables directly

3746950
getter	setter
per carl good practice is that you use the getter setter sequence everywhere you absolutely can as that keeps you pretty safe from missing a corner case of memory management

3746973
min	max
the error is because you can t use an aggregate function count min max avg etc in the where clause without it being inside a subquery

3746983
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
then these accessor might access other properties of your class or a subclass

3746984
uitableview	reloaddata
what puzzles me is how the uitableview deals with headers does it call viewforheadersinsection only once on reloaddata instantiation or does it call it all the time does it instantiate the view repeatedly when scrolling if i place this code in the viewcontroller

3747002
rubygems	bundler
usr ruby1.8.7 lib rubygems 1.8 gems bundler-1.0.0 lib bundler runtime.rb 64 in

3747029
hash	salt
my initial idea is to store a hash of the password and the salt

3747029
hash	salt
if so should the hash and salt be stored in plain text or is there a way to ensure that even they are encrypted

3747030
maven	pom.xml
however what i don t know or understand is whether maven when publishing w does it modify the pom.xml to fill in the explicit snapshot that was used or does it just say that w depends on x-1.0.0-snapshot

3747065
postgresql	mysql
in distributed environment at least the client-server centralized type database must be used e.g mysql postgresql oracle

3747112
subtract	add
it is a single place for managing the desired type and it s flexible so you can add subtract values or edit as needed

3747162
int	chars
you must also understand that you are dealing with chars which are actually int

3747185
innodb	myisam
i managed to fix this problem by changing the database engine back to myisam rather than innodb

3747203
perl	tcl
in the abstract all the common scripting languages--lua awk sh tcl ruby perl python ...--are about the same

3747207
getter	setter
letter is basically left the same as above i only made the fields private renamed thenextnode to next and added getter setter as needed

3747207
equals	tostring
the constructor tostring and equals are not relevant for computing the hashcode so they are omitted for the sake of simplicity

3747211
width	height
for an animation i d need it s width and height

3747211
width	height
actualwidth is always the max width of the window width and height properties say nan

3747245
put	get
the hashcode is not very discriminating all letter permutations get the same hash code but it should do the trick unless you usually put many permutations into the hashset

3747246
perl	tcl
many many automations can be done with what perl python tcl .

3747265
actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth actualheight will give you the actual sizes of the window - given by the layout system which is based on the actual rendering of the window

3747265
width	height
width height are requested sizes and if not set explicitly they will hold their default values which is double.nan

3747301
public	protected
the callback methods can have public private protected or package level access but must not be static or final

3747313
pascal	delphi
in pascal delphi

3747321
maven	pom.xml
the deliver task will resolve all dynamic dependencies and create an ivy file that can be used to generate a maven pom.xml

3747325
subscript	superscript
i ve noticed that when trying to use superscript or subscript in the following way.

3747325
subscript	superscript
would anyone know how to have all text in a line regardless of line-height subscript superscript etc printed on the bottom of that line

3747325
google-chrome	firefox
ps - i ve viewed this on google-chrome 6 and firefox 3.6.9 and it happens in both so i m assuming this is a universal problem not a browser problem

3747336
width	height
i ve fooled around with setting the height width properties of my view and even grabbing ahold of my view s parent which is the region in this case -- a contentcontrol and setting it s height width properties to no avail

3747368
subscript	superscript
would anyone know how to have all text in a line regardless of line-height subscript superscript etc printed on the bottom of that line

3747386
pop-up	dialog
the dialog will pop-up but by the time the user selects the application will already have gone through the if statement so yup never has a chance to equal yes

3747408
folder	directory
i m attempting to write a program in linux using c++ that counts the number of files and folder in a user specified directory but the more i read the more confused i get

3747414
wtl	atl
i m embedding an iwebbrowser2 control and i am not using mfc atl or wtl

3747420
uiview	subviews
i am drawing on a uiview several other subviews

3747482
google-chrome	firefox
all three using the delay would be blocked firefox and google-chrome whereas all three directly would open

3747518
unix	bsd
on unix linux mac os x free bsd etc. there are a number of ways to do this

3747556
post	get
facebok wont let you do a post to post_id likes you can only do a get request to retrieve their likes

3747570
int	chars
printf returns an int the total number of chars written so if let s say printf writes out the 25 chars then it returns 25 and your if statement is doing something like this.

3747600
accessor	properties
you need to use the properties method accessor -

3747604
textarea	textbox
you need to continue return true if he key pressed within a textarea a textbox or a password box

3747611
getter	setter
if you synthesize a custom class do getter and setter get created for it

3747611
getter	setter
so does it have getter and setter

3747614
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
in the .net framework version 2.0 the array class implements the system.collections.generic ilist system.collections.generic icollection and system.collections.generic ienumerable generic interfaces

3747629
getter	setter
will getter and setter be created

3747629
getter	setter
now what kind of code goes into the getter and setter depends on what property attributes you define nonatomic atomic assign retain copy

3747629
getter	setter
edit to op s revised question yes a getter setter will be created for the myobject instance variable of the detailviewcontroller class

3747635
int	boolean
add_column table_name column_name type options adds a new column to the table called table_name named column_name specified to be one of the following types string text int float decimal datetime timestamp time date binary boolean

3747667
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari this works as expected but on webkit not only does it not respond to the readystate but instead it appears to fire off a repeat request to the server

3747685
portrait	landscape
i have a view controller for portrait and a view controller for landscape

3747685
portrait	landscape
the portrait view controller works fine with the scrollviewdidenddecelerating function but i did the same exact thing on the landscape view controller and it does not respond

3747717
public	protected
a common solution that can be found in the .net framework is to split a method in a public method xxx and a protected virtual method onxxx that is called by the public method

3747735
inherited	properties
i want to implement a control with a specifiable datasource properties and it would be great if i could inherited and the type of the datasource implements some sort of hierarchical interface with properties and methods ensured

3747750
int	chars
you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table it also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars

3747776
google-chrome	firefox
i was experiencing some weird behaviour in some of my javascript code but only in firefox and google-chrome

3747795
google-chrome	safari
i assume that safari and google-chrome have a similar object structure since they are both based on the webkit engine

3747795

qobject	qmetaobject
i m look for data models for editing and displaying a collection of qobject qmetaobject properties

3748415
qobject	qmetaobject
i can kind of understand why this isn t included in the qt library as it would not be possible to expose all of qmetaobject in a clean way but i m hoping i don t have to write a bunch of data models and proxy models to display the hierarchies and properties of qobject

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i am trying to create a superclass whose __init__ takes an optional named parameter and subclassing of it which also inherited from built-in types

3748635
superclass	subclassing
it s still a little hacky by changining __new__ s signature partway through construction but it will work as long as the superclass appears in the subclassing mros before the built-in type and defining __new__ this way allows me to make subclassing which work with different built-in types without adding a separate __new__ to each one

3748648
width	height
also i found that most elements don t actually have a width or height when queried in an activities constructor so trying to transform based on those is going to give you a lot of 0- 0 movement ie none if you are animating based on element dimensions you may want to do some logging toasting to make sure you actually have a width height at the point that you create the animation

3748959
subtraction	addition
there is no difference between addition or subtraction subtraction is addition with the negated operand

3748959
subtract	add
you are correct in order to add or subtract you have to shift the number with the smaller exponent off into the bit bucket in order to perform the operation resulting in fewer significant bits for that operand

3748959
subtraction	addition	exponent	addition
if the exponent are more different than the size of the mantissa then addition or subtraction you get the number with the larger exponent as the result all the bits of the smaller number have shifted off into the bit bucket n + 0 n - 0

i need not only to bind the line start and end points to the dots left and right but the addition of left + width 2 and top + height 2 centers

an alternative is to put the validator on the other component the one that appears the last in the tree instead of the current component then you can get the value by uiinput#getvalue

3751564
tabcontrol	tabitem
the tabcontrol also stretched correctly if i removed the border rectangle from the tabitem

tinyint	boolean
personally i would suggest use tinyint as a preference because boolean doesn t do what you think it does from the name so it makes for potentially misleading code

as said by you the standard specifies that the memcpy and memmove should handle this case without problem

3751945
intrinsics	inlining
if the compiler supports intrinsics inlining for such functions the additional check may even make the code a micro-little-bit slower since the check is already done at the while

it used to take care of height instead of width but i simply can t get it it work

3751976
rss	feed
i m a lucene newbie and am thinking of using it to index the words in the title and description elements of rss feed so that i can record counts of the most popular words in the feed

3751976
rss	feed
to take a single rss feed is it wise to have lucene create a temporary index in memory and pass the words and hit counts out so other programs can write them to database

3751984

getter	setter
to do that i d suggest to declare a property for your array - compiler will automatically generate setter and getter methods for you that will handle most of memory management for you

3752292
put	get
i m trying to build an extension to firefox to get a page from a web server and put it in the browser s cache so that when the user asks for that link it ll be retrieved directly from the cache instead of asking to the original web server

mkmapview	mapkit
use mapkit mkmapview object instead of a webview pointed to a google map image and use google map api to retrieve coordinates of the address

3752343
post	get
of course if you do either of the above and your form uses post rather than get as most forms do then whether you get the parameter value from the same source on the server will depend on what server-side mechanism you re using

3752343
post	get
for instance java s servletrequest#getparameter method doesn t care it looks in both the get and post data whereas with some other technologies more of a distinction is drawn

3752356
children	parent
if you expand a menu item then all its children are displayed in the block otherwise only when you click on the parent item do the children get displayed

3752619
free	malloc
one should also note there is no legal way to redefine malloc free

3752695
int	chars
since printf is a variadic function the value of is promoted from type chars to type int

3752695
int	chars
note that this whole example assumes that int and chars pointers have the same size and layout

3752695
int	chars
that s not guaranteed to be true everywhere see the online c standard n1256 draft section 6.2.5 paragraph 27 so you can t rely on this working everywhere the way you expect assuming i m correct in thinking that int and chars are not compatible types as defined by the standard but i could be wrong on that

3752736
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
the malloc free realloc that come with your compiler are almost certainly better than some functions you re going to plug in

3752771
tinyint	boolean
using boolean may do the same thing as using tinyint however it has the advantage of semantically conveying what your intention is and that s worth something

3752818
min	max
if your items vary in size shape that is basically collision testing with the sides and cap the min max left top values

3752836
capistrano	rvm	capistrano	bundler	rvm	bundler
the problem was capistrano trying to use a different path for bundler and other gems than the rvm paths

3752836
rvm	bundler
you ll probably see your standard usr local bin and usr bin but that s not where rvm has bundler et al. stored

3752836
capistrano	bundler
that finally got capistrano to see bundler and start loading gems appropriately

3752849
google-chrome	firefox
the best way to prevent this flicker which can also happen in google-chrome firefox when the server connection is slow is by hiding the cãºfon text until it has been rendered

hide	show
what this does is hide the content until all your scripts have loaded and cãºfon has run then show the content

3752856
factories	presenter
if you just don t want the dependency in your presenter inject a factories interface the real implementation could do new commentforoverridegetter or whatever

3752861
put	get
next and here i get a bit puzzled by your use of mpi_scatter why not simply write a loop which sends columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 to processes 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 oh having previously arranged that the receiving processes have a 2d array to put the columns into as they arrive

3752883
free	malloc
echoing advice to measure first and only specialize if performance sucks - should be easy to abstract your malloc free reallocs such that replacement is straightforward

despite what that warning in the manual says though versions of php after 5.1 still are affected by the 2038 bug when using mktime and strtotime

3753243
castle	common.logging
given that context support is not available yet in common.logging take a look at the context implementation in the castle project log4net implementation is here

or can i use some function to convert the chars into an int

3753339
vb.net	vb6
many of the principals and procedures were simply just grandfathered to vb.net for a comfort level and to attract vb6 and earlier programmers

3753339
vb.net	vb6
so why it is the way in vb.net 2008 and before is probably because it was that way in vb6 and earlier

width	height
anyway the article has some code sample showing you how to read width and height of files

3753376

udp	tcp
all you need to do is make tcp udp connection and have your c++ server in place to respond to that

3753823
translation	localization

3753847
hide	show
the rest you should know use an scriptmanager to execute javascript code to hide show proper divs depending of what you read from querystring

3753872
put	get
at this moment looks like i need to grab pieces out of wcf extention and put it in mvc extention to get both working

3753916
children	parent
that way you d sidestep the whole problem of ensuring children could only be made the favourite of the parent they belong to

3753916
children	parent
in the admin you could even have an inline for child models that exposed the is_favourite checkbox if you only have a few children per parent otherwise the admin would have to be done from the child s side

3753920
free	malloc
so when you malloc something if your app doesn t already have a place to put that in its existing address space it asks the operating system for more but when you later free it unless that happens to be at the very end of the address space for your app you can t give it back to the operating system to make that memory area cause an error when you try to read it

this solution does use css3 the nth-child odd which limits its cross-browser friendliness though works in opera google-chrome safari and firefox on ubuntu 10.04 so for ie-friendliness you d have to explicitly add a class name to whichever column s you wanted to float right

3755215

you may just not setup the image element width and height attributes and write next styles

3755507
ssl	https
it worked perfectly and my wcf service uses https via that ssl cert

3755522
linefeed	delimiter
in other words you could use delimiter such as a cr linefeed after a line of text or you could give the length of an upcoming piece of data

3755571
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this means that the loading of ga.js occurs in a non-blocking way for most modern browsers and as a benefit the async true part currently supported in firefox 4+ ie10p2+ google-chrome 12+ safari 5.1+ formalizes this asynchronization

3755627
spaces	delimiter
for a delimiter format you choose a character that you will not use as a valid part of the filename or size a pipe a spaces a tab character newline etc and insert one in between the filename and size and between size and file contents

3755635
sproutcore	cappuccino
unlike some others like gwt or cappuccino sproutcore is really about using javascript directly

3755693
width	height
note if the grid itself is not constrained the height and width expand to fit the content like auto

3755734

3755762
getter	setter
here are the annotated classes but i trimmed away getter setter and non-id columns annotations from the javax.persistence namespace

3755938
concave	convex
my first idea was to use a convex hull but my polygons are most of the time concave

3755957
getter	setter
the difference is that ivar is just a variable pointing to a location in memory whereas self.ivar calls the setter in the case of and getter for methods

3755957
getter	setter
the synthesize keyword automatically generates these getter and setter methods for you to cut down on boilerplate code

3756111
int	double
the fields may have different types some double some int some strings etc

3756119

post	put
i put a blog post together on this very subject

3756138
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following page works fine in ie8 and firefox but elements of the css don t seem to be being respected in google-chrome and safari

i have a base class that is inherited by about ten subclassing

3756164
accessor	properties
synthesize is just one of three ways of telling the compiler how the properties s accessor are implemented

3756164
accessor	superclass
my superclass will dynamically supply the accessor at run time

3756164
accessor	properties
failing to do one or more of those things for a properties will get you a warning from the compiler and probably some run-time exceptions because you never actually stated an implementation for the accessor that by declaring a properties you declared the instances would have

3756233
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
the pointer you pass to free needs to be exactly the same pointer you received from malloc or calloc or realloc not just a pointer into the region of memory that malloc returned

3756233
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
your first and third are fine because the pointer you pass to free matches the one you received from malloc via strdup

3756234
free	malloc
since trim modifies the pointer variables main passes a pointer to free that was not returned by malloc

3756255
awt	swing
i ve also used swing and awt to build graphical applications and other than the learning curve for the layout system it works really well for building applications

3756286
hex	binary
what i would be looking for is what they have in wireshark where they represent a char aray or binary data in a hex format like

3756311
children	parent
you d have to add the logic to the __autoload function or an spl_autoload_register which by string comparison decides what file to load if it possibly is one of the children of your parent

3756357
hash	md5
there really is no length that will guarantee unique- if you want to make sure a string of a given length is unique you need to take a hash of the string and compare it md5 and sha1 are common algoritms people use

3756373
mongodb	bson
you might check the mongodb drivers for those languages since mongodb uses bson

3756406
short	base
as zack mentions the 4-byte values are because it is interpreting all values over 128 as negative the base type is signed char then that negative value is extended as the value is expanded to a signed short

perl	tcl
wikipedia reports that there are javascript perl python ruby and tcl tools that can generate apple events with the javascript osa component being best integrated and a better macruby interface coming

3756451
free	malloc
some heap allocation libraries are implemented so that when malloc allocates data the size of that data chunk is stored in the bytes just before the address that malloc returns and when you call free the bytes just in front of that pointer are used to determine what the size of that memory chunk actually is

3756451
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
if you pass the something that was not returned by malloc or calloc or realloc or similar then free may look in the wrong place and use whatever it finds there as the size of the chunk you are freeing -- and nothing good comes of this

convex or concave this is the correct approach

3756782

3758622
put	get
coding is often a trade off between a comprehensive solution and what can be produced quickly and therefore less expensively these questions allow the interviewer to get a feel for your understanding of quality - that is can you design something that is fit for purpose robust and yet does not take too long to put together - and also your experience of having to identify resolve common bugs

these methods will return null if the getter setter is non-public

3762490
getter	setter
note however that the getter setter may have different accessibilities

3762490
getter	setter
so you can t assume that the getter and the setter will have the same visibility

3762510

the first line suggests that a post request is expected - it can t be both post and get at the same time.

3762511

width	height
you can also specify image size new image width height but i m not sure if it can help

3762885
accessor	properties	getter	setter
recall that properties in .net are pretty much syntactic sugar for a specific getter and setter method structure and a backing field accessed as if the accessor were the field itself

3762885
inherited	properties
you should only need one of the two as they ll both have the inherited qualifiers given to the properties but make sure that your properties has a get or a set at all levels of the hierarchy or this will blow up

3762885
inherited	properties
now methodinfo exposes several properties regarding accessibility and inherited

3762885
getter	setter
whether the type has a base type other than object or an abstract type you specify and whether ishidebysig on the getter or setter is true

3762885

3762909
mouseleave	mouseenter
but hover is not it s a separate shortcut method that registers a mouseenter and a mouseleave event

3763043
width	height
elmonty please look how not only width but height is shorter in ie8

3763085

scott mitchell has a post about sorting and filtering data in the chart control here

3763295

3763599
uploadify	swfupload
consider looking at uploadify or swfupload

3763602
stateless	stateful
per a request in the comments below i ll explain why i believe there should be multiple vectors of stateless cards rather than a single vector of stateful cards

3763604
hide	show
show progress bar do work with doevents hide it

3763631
getter	setter
another thing that threw me for a loop that someone might find helpful if they didn t read carefully enough about groovy to begin with like me is that groovy exposes all the properties without needing to call the getter or setter

3763648
hex	binary
it is actually the decimial representation of the number that you are testing to be a palindrome not the number itself 255 is a palendrome in hex and binary but not decimal

3763734

post	get
admittedly this technically violates the recommendations for the use of post which should only be for operations that change information rather than get which should be used when asking for information

3767201
int	double
to avoid duplication of code in the algorithm if it is a lot of code you could produce an abstract class called something like doublealgorithm with abstract methods like double getelement int i int j and handleresult double result and then write very small subclasses of this one for each primitive type

3767201
int	double
as thilo has pointed out it isn t safe to do all algorithms with just treating int longs as double but for a number it will be good enough

int	chars
in this respect there is no difference between an int and chars or unsigned chars

3767442
int	chars
my guess is that the difference lies in the strict aliasing rules between int and chars - even though the programmer doesn t actually do anything wrong the compiler is forced to do a logical type cast for the array which it shouldn t do

3767442
int	chars
as jens gustedt said it looks more like a way to enable strict bounds checks not a real issue with the int or chars

note that if you use mqausx to validate a user id and password either use ssl encryption with it or use both the client-side and server-side versions of the exit

3768419
onclick	onchange
add onclick or onchange to show report dinamically

3768432
width	height
your silverlight object should occupy 100 of the browser height and width unless you are reserving space for other html elements

3768476
post	get
one of our most common error situations in a web application is that a user executes a get request where the form should have submitted a post

3768517
maven	cobertura
i m using maven cobertura plugin to report code coverage in my multimodule project

3768542
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome but not in firefox ie etc

3768549
domxpath	domdocument
using domdocument and domxpath is the most correct way to access those attributes

3768554
put	get
retrieval operations including get generally do not block so may overlap with update operations including put and remove

3768587
opera	firefox
you need to use ogv for firefox and opera

3768596
filtering	grouping
i suggest editing the filtering on the grouping of col3 - as follows

3768596
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
in the grouping and sorting properties dialog select the filtering tab

3768596
sorting	grouping
click ok on the grouping and sorting properties dialog and then click ok on the matrix properties dialog

3768635
post	get
as you said your problem is intermittent so having a problem in form method set as get instead of post can be overruled but yes you are right that if user presses enter in address bar it would be a get request and back button request always depends upon the last request made if it was a post then any good browser will prompt you about resubmission and if it was get then no prompt page will be bought back may be from cache

3768635
post	get
and also get is always supposed to retrieve information so if browser is missing something or need something it will be a get but again check in iis log for those get requests and try them in browser if they contains query string for viewstate and eventvalidation then they are really mis-formed request from post to get if form method is not explicitly set to get

3768639
bsearch	strcmp
signature lookup tables can then be easily built using bsearch and strcmp

3768704
inherited	properties
avoid using inherited just to reuse some properties inherited should be used to add polymorphic behaviour to your classes

3768716
ubuntu	debian
the timeout package from ubuntu debian can be made to compile on mac and it works

3768721
junit	testng
testng was written to overcome some perceived limitations of junit 3

3768721
junit	testng
note that some of the limitations of junit 3 were by design and testng deliberately allows you to do things that the designers of junit expressly prevented

3768721
junit	testng
the biggest advantage testng had over junit 3 was that it allowed you to use annotations to define your tests rather than forcing you to extend the junit base classes

3768721
junit	testng
the biggest remaining difference between testng and junit is that testng allows your tests to be dependent on one another and allows you to express those dependencies through the test annotations

3768721
junit	testng
there are other differences too of course â testng defaults to assertequals actual expected message whereas junit is assertequals message expected actual â but this is the biggest

3768791
superclass	subclassing
i need to have a configurable file somewhere within the source for setting price constants that are to be accessed from multiple subclassing of a superclass

3768794

the timeout command from ubuntu debian when compiled from source to work on the mac

3768844
onreadystatechange	onload
it s pretty easy internet explorer will trigger an onreadystatechange event while others will trigger a onload event for the script object

3768863
integer	fractions
the integer part gets the priority and fractions part is as close as the type size

3768885
free	malloc
anyways this part of the coreaudio api is more c-ish than objective-c-ish so you d use malloc free instead of alloc release

3768885
free	malloc
you still need to malloc the actual mdata member of the audiobuffer but at least you don t need to worry about free ing the actual audiobufferlist itself

3768893
ssl	https
how to implement a https connection with ssl and asihttprequest

3768904
cassini	iis

now what i need is to add a 4th column unit price which is calculated by multiplying area and rate per sqm

3768907
jpql	hql
this is what i want to do in hql or jpql how to get the list of objects where properties of the object were id name gradename class

3768929
superclass	subclassing
putting them as static constants in the superclass means you have to recompile every subclassing everytime you modify one of the values

3768936
mouse	keyboard
but yes flex should work on touch screens and traditional screens with a mouse and keyboard

3768950
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
does avfoundation internally speak to audiotoolbox framework

3768959
folder	directory
obviously to avoid losing data the original folder needs to be left alone but that breaks the association between the directory and the node

3768978
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie firefox and opera fire load on every src set even if the src is not changed whereas webkit google-chrome safari only ever fires it on the initial image load

3768985
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works correctly in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

3768991
typedef	struct
note how i use separate names for the typedef and struct tags to make it a bit clearer

3769048
stdout	stderr
i need a way to pass data from a shell function running in the interactive shellâ that will not mix with data created by other functions so i cannot use stdout or stderr

3769062
filesystems	ntfs
while on ntfs an many other filesystems the maximum number of files can go far beyond that

3769063
width	height
these will work in most capable browsers but not ie and would allow you to write css that only kicks in when the browser is of a certain width height and much more

3769095
inherited	properties
the inherited works fine i see the properties of the base class in my child class my problem occurs when i try to call a method from the service and pass the childtype as a parameter and not the basetype

3769123
jpql	hql
then of course you would not be using hql but jpql instead

3769127
rss	feed
i am displaying rss feed in my table view

3769148
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve try to do this with - void viewwillappear bool animated and - void viewdidload

put	get
i want to get my hand of the clock to rotate 360degrees over 10 seconds but the tricky part is that i want to make it rotate not on the origin at topleft of the clockhand imageview put at a point 20 20 of the clockhand imageview

3769254
centos	linux
we build software running on linux servers centos

3769334
postgresql	mysql
use postgresql i would recommend this to anyone using mysql anyway

3769379
children	parent
use .children to get immediate children instead of .find which looks everywhere below on the parent for example

3769380
post	put
my problem the only way to put variables into post seems to be input elements in a form

3769405
cpu	processors
basically i need to determine the cpu utilization so that if it is high i can instead divert a new process to another controller in the system rather than executing on the main processors which could be busy doing a more important process

3769449
versioning	upgrade
we had to scramble a bit when doing a major versioning upgrade last year when we found that oracle 10 returned group by results in a different order than did oracle 9

3769485
sdl	freeglut
in my configure.ac it looks like this it worked like this for sdl so i just replaced some potions and hoped it works for freeglut as well but it does not

3769503
xslt	xquery
i don t know xquery well-enough to express this xslt solution in xquery but i think just providing it may be helpful

3769505
ant	maven
with netbeans your java project will be either maven or ant based

3769505
maven	pom.xml
for maven you can add the following lines to your pom.xml to accomlish that

3769543
min	max
when using aggregate functions ie min max count the non-aggregated column should be listed in the group by clause

3769553
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
split it like you do right now then loops the resulting arrays and join them all up using a standard for-loop

3769560
post	get
if you re using jquery you could get the entire html of the page using and send that with an ajax post

3769581
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

3769592
opera	firefox
webkit based browsers firefox and opera support what you need

3769631

attempts to use chown and chmod even as root failed i don t recall the error

3769698
google-chrome	firefox
i am experiencing this issue with ie7 but not in google-chrome or firefox

3769793
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer

3769796
getter	setter
to do that annotate your annotation with one ore more annotations from scala.annotation.target getter setter or as in your case field

3769824
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy is like xcopy but with a much richer set of options

3769836
poe	anyevent
you might consider things such as parallel forkmanager poe or anyevent

3769881
iprincipal	iidentity
nerddinner implements iidentity instead of iprincipal

3769883
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome ie11 and safari work firefox works with some bugs but nightly has fixed them

3769884
activemq	rabbitmq
are they using any amqp broker like rabbitmq or activemq

3769895
rss	feed
it depends on the webservice that provides you the rss feed

3769895
rss	feed
you can also put the loading and parsing rss feed in thread this will boost your performance

3769907
serializable	deserialization
the classes that inherit from tracksection are a lot simpler and i would be happy for all their fields to be serializable automatically but i assume that since the base class is iserializable they probably need to do it manually as well i have added the deserialization constructor and call the base class s deserialization constructor in each

3769908
google-chrome	firefox
so now when i call this function it responds in google-chrome firefox and the modern browsers but not internet explorer

3769915
google-chrome	firefox
works great in google-chrome and firefox

3769981
min	max
you can set in print.summary.formula.reverse to get the mean and standard deviation but there s no way to get the min or max

3769997
google-chrome	firefox
here s a working example works better in google-chrome than firefox - if you need any other browsers supported then you ll need a javascript solution

3770009
background-color	transparency
on your set the background-color transparency

3770013
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the html5 video player jw player on this page works fine in firefox google-chrome safari opera but not ie

3770035
put	get
if you want to put an element inside a comment it s no element any more so to do that you would have to get the html code for the element put a comment tag around it and replace the element with the comment

3770084
qtableview	qitemdelegate
i m using a qtableview with a subclass of qitemdelegate to control the look and feel of the tableview s cells

3770103
google-chrome	firefox
update when i view the page in google-chrome or firefox on the published server it appears correctly

3770150
terminate	timeout
the direct url session works for 10 minutes after that the session is terminate expired timeout and then use must login again and may get the same session id but after 10 minutes use won t be able to browse with the same session

3770207
width	height
your ratio property should actually be a method if you want it to change based on changes to width and height

3770207
width	height
also you probably want to refer to this.width and this.height instead of width and height in the resize method

3770221
width	height
alternately if width and height aren t going to change just calculate it afterward

3770253
width	height
then just size it down to a single pixel width or height

3770264
jsf	spring-webflow
spring-webflow jsf intgration war example file from spring site is not working in glassfishv3 server

3770296
put	get
you still could get it via viewdata id if you put it inside viewdata in the controller but if you do this you might as well put it in the model

3770308
int	double
note that the java 8 version works for int long and double but not for byte as arrays.stream only has overloads for or a generic object

3770315
inherited	subclassing	qitemdelegate	qwidget
you could implement your own setupdatesenabled bool for your qitemdelegate subclassing since it does not inherited qwidget and does not have one by testing a flag before executing your original paint or update

3770329
width	margin
i ve tried using various css hacks for this ie s box model double margin etc but i can t figure out where the problem is except that it seems that ie tries to render the contents of the page to the width of the window overriding the widths defined judging by the way background images are cut short even though their div tags have defined min-width s

3770360
ant	maven
if you re using sane build tools maven gradle or properly-configured ant then you can put the java interface in your clojure project and the cross-language dependency will be taken care of

3770392
ssl	https
if you send the file via email be sure to use secured connexions https imap or pop3 over ssl smtp over ssl on both sending and receiving computers and have the file encrypted prior sending

3770524
hash	md5
many cryptographic hash functions such as md5 and sha-1 use the merkleâ damgã rd construction in which there is a computation to compress a block of data into a fixed size and then combine that with a fixed size value from the previous block or an initialization vector for the first block

3770536
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
i use an nsoperation for the purpose of instantiating the connection and receiving incoming data through the nsurlconnection delegates but as soon as new data comes in and gets parsed i offload the processing of the message to the dedicated nsthread

3770542
sudo	passwd
so you will need to study that create some wrapper scripts which will be able to receive parameters from php to know what to do get the username and passwd of the new user etc... elevate their privileges hint look at sudo or suid and then run your command.

3770546
decltype	auto
c++0x will change the meaning of auto and add a new keyword decltype that lets you do things like this

3770546
g++	gcc
if you re using gcc g++ you might also look into using its typeof operator which is quite similar has a subtle difference when dealing with references

3770595
folder	dir
but of course if you do dir c the table will be filled with all the files and folder from that command

3770604
multiplying	add
so getting the checksum of a zero-padded message is just a matter of multiplying the checksum polynomial of the non-padded message with some other polynomial that only depends on the number of zeros you want to add

3770607
allocator	stl
for a heavy stl application if you re doing multi-threading there is the hoard allocator or the tbb intel version

3770630
libjpeg	libpng
if possible could you also provide the names of the corresponding routines in libpng libjpeg boost gil io

3770671
int	chars
you request two chars then an int

3770671
int	chars
now you free the two chars then request a new integer- but that int can t fit in the space of the two chars

3770700
try-catch	exception-handling
i m currently wrapping the whole onpaint code in a try-catch and was able to debug the code but i found it quite tedious so i wondered if there is a way to break into debugger from a gui thread exception-handling

3770736
inherited	properties
now you d have the properties methods from both a and b but you don t really have inherited since any changes to the prototype object of b will not propagate to c

3770761
min	max
lets say we have a simple model that stores two integers the min and the max

3770761
min	max
1 how would you validate that min is indeed equal or less than max

3770774
lisp	scheme
2 others heavily favored lisp common lisp scheme and clojure

3770774
lisp	scheme
from what i gather both common lisp and scheme have excellent introductory material on lisp and the reasoned schemer sicp

3770774
scheme	prolog	lisp	prolog	lisp	agda	lisp	scheme	agda	prolog
it looks like a lisp scheme clojure prolog or a proof assistant like coq or agda are the main langauages being recommended

3770804
vim	emacs
i d like to be able to set multiple marks in emacs like vim does

3770831
wordpress	joomla
wordpress is not a true cms like drupal or joomla

3770841
jobs	cron
just when i thought i was understanding cron jobs i realize i m still not understanding

3770882
portrait	landscape
are referring to number of cells it can occupy in landscape and portrait

3770883
integer	unsigned
but really vector size_type will be some very large unsigned integer type so a conversion from id to vector size_type will always be safe but not the other way round

3770897
post	get
specifically i have a view where i set html.textbox to a value both in the get and the post

3770897
post	get
it sets fine in the get but after the user submits a value during the post i have the class change one of the values internally based on the other value submitted

3770906
uiview	subviews
do i have to create a uiview in cellforrowatindexpath with the height of the tablecellbg.png and then add the custom uitableviewcell as subviews to the created uiview with a less higher height

3770917
subtract	add
add or subtract some parameterized random value say -2 to 2

3770917
min	max
clamp the values at min and max overall values say -5 and 20

3770917
min	max
you can play with how much the height changes per node and the min max overall values to get more or less land - ocean s and continents vs archipelago s etc

3770919
scheme	prolog	lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme
as other posters have suggested prolog and lisp scheme are nice even though both are dynamically typed

3770937
lambda	first-class-functions
it has lambda first-class-functions and many functionally-inspired compositions on iterators maps folds zips...

3770949
spaces	delimiter
i have a string of spaces delimiter numbers like

3770950
haskell	agda
another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing it is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me

3770970
ant	maven
actually maven allows to run ant targets using maven-ant plugin but i d like to perform such profiling without ant

3771011
ssl	https
to do ssl with asihttprequest you just need to pass a https url instead of a http one

3771032
serializable	deserialization
xmldictionarywriter is an abstract class used for serializable and deserialization of objects to and from xml

3771045
google-chrome	firefox
how do you achieve the help check for updates system that google-chrome firefox dozens of other applications use to make staying current less painful

3771062
allocator	stl
memory allocator like in libc actually handle the problem of a lot of small allocator which is typical for std string for instance in my server application there are lots of stl strings but as i see from running info heap they are not causing any problems

3771103
serializable	deserialization
however the serializable deserialization totally sidesteps the httpsession listener events so i do not have the opportunity to gracefully put the deserialized reference to the sessiondata back in my managed set of objects after the restart

3771142
maven	pom.xml
this modification can be done by simply modifying the pom.xml versions or it can be managed by the maven release plugin or also with the maven version plugin

3771145
disk	ram
your data patterns of the other keys shows that you have lots of disk ram space tied up in non-pk keys

3771145
innodb	myisam
side note innodb myisam engines does not automatically update table cardinality for non-unique columns the dba needs to manually run analyze table periodically to ensure its accuracy

3771146
put	get
perhaps somewhat off-topic and so i m making it a cw but when things get long like this can i just put in my bid for good old-fashioned if else statements

3771186
put	get
if i comment all repositories and put a funny value 2.7.9 for the scala version in the sbt.boot.properties i do get like the op did

3771246
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
if the work could be encapsulated in an nsinvocation you can use an nsinvocationoperation and avoid an nsoperation subclass

3771256
hash	md5
the issue is if you enforce fips validated cryptography in the windows security policy settings an exception will be thrown because radius protocol uses the md5 algorithm to hash the request authenticator

3771272
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.6+ and google-chrome at least version 6 possibly older versions support the file api which lets you read local files from a file input

3771289
extjs	sproutcore
1 there are a bunch of libraries available for developing these applications sproutcore extjs etc

3771305
put	get
if you really want to put it in the resources like that you can get it out of the resources in the code behind loaded method or in the constructor after the initializecomponent call

3771307
udp	tcp
data are sent between two linux computers using udp and tcp protocols

3771314
google-chrome	firefox
the banner runs fine in google-chrome firefox ie7 and 8

3771408
udp	tcp
this actually happens more commonly with tcp connections but i see no reason udp can t have this problem as well

3771477
haskell	agda
coq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell itself

3771522
memcpy	strncpy
the reason that memcpy works and strncpy doesn t is because you actually passed a sensible length parameter to memcpy but totally forgot to make this parameter make any sense to strncpy

3771523
memcpy	strncpy
it s pure fluke that you ve passed the right length when using memcpy and the wrong length when using strncpy

3771523
memcpy	strncpy
memcpy would also not work if passed sizeof temp as the length and strncpy would work if passed the right length

3771527
oncreate	onstart
android start video recording upon starting an activity without using buttons ie when the activity starts video recording also should start without using any other component its working with buttons i tried putting video calling functions in oncreate onstart etc

3771543
inherited	subclassing
subclassing of dynamicobject would fail to inherited the somemethod function

3771553
keydown	keyup
you ll likely want to use keypress instead of keyup or keydown as those won t be called for subsequent characters if someone holds a key down

3771556
sorting	filtering
i suppose this problem also applies to sorting as well as filtering in the sense that if a collectionviewsource is based on sorting then when a property of an item that is used in the sort changes the sort order of the collection should reflect this as well

3771558
button	checkbox
i would have to say that because the checkbox list renders individual html checkbox that are not groupable like radio button the selected property needs to be evaluated on a item by item basis

3771645
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in firefox safari google-chrome and opera but ie8 still aligns the main div to the left

3771653
public	protected
make alpha abstract and do what you like with the constructor so long as it s visible to beta public or protected is fine

3771657
width	margin
futhermore get rid of the width 100 on the first div and body must have padding 0 and margin 0

3771683
perl	tcl
we make use of test more for testing perl modules and have made a little use of selenium for web pages but we have never had any kind of automatic test rig for our tcl tk scripts

3771717
background-color	transparency
here is the problem i want to create reactive zones on a image using transparency div but the following code doesn t work on ie tested on chrome the background-color of the div hover_zone doesn t change at all

3771717
background-color	transparency
the problem is due to the background-color set to transparency

3771732
implements	extends
if you intend to draw this dynamically you would have to extends view and override ondraw you can implements ontouchlisteners etc to detect when and where people are touching it

3771760
width	height
the src attribute on the is _layouts images icjpg.gif and the width and height attributes are 0

3771800
twitter	bit.ly
i am thinking of making it run under 4.0 but i use many 3rd-party dll s for compressing bit.ly twitter xml etc

3771816
int	boolean
public overridable function openpdffrommem byval lppdfdata as int byval npdfdatalen as int byval lpszuserpwd as string byval lpszownerpwd as string as boolean

3771840
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in ie it would work as expected but firefox safari and google-chrome would return an empty response

3771848
hash	salt
writing your own of course means implementing a session mechanism for retaining state across the user session and storing the passwords in a hash and salt state for verification

3771856
ubuntu	linux
since my laptop runs linux i m using mono 2.6.7 on ubuntu

3771910
scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
i would suggest you learn a lisp â common lisp scheme racket or clojure

3771917
pentaho	olap
pentaho is a full-fledged bi suite meaning it can handle everything from reports olap dashboards etc

3771917
pentaho	saiku
some recent examples of this are saiku previously called pentaho analysis tool

3771952
ibatis	mybatis
if you don t want to do the full heavyweight orm way then look at something like mybatis used to be ibatis which has sqlmaps

3771971
children	parent
ideally all the children will have a couple of unique settings name interval config settings and a getdata method while the parent manages starting stopping logging and anything else

3772016
portrait	landscape
one comment if i open the modal view in portrait and then rotate the device it rotates fine into landscape mode

3772103
hide	show
you can use conditionals inside the binding to decide which thumbnail to show or use the new property to hide show a 2nd image

3772245
int	chars
y or whatever is a chars and you can cast it into an int and therefore convert it into a l

3772250
unsigned	short
l ã is of type wchar_t which can be implicitly converted into an unsigned short

3772256
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the trick is border and margin are not included in height width calculation

3772256
width	margin
so if you have element with width 100px border 2px and left margin 10px the 114px of horizontal space will be taken up

3772264
hide	show
the qdockwidget class already handles the dock undock hide show options so all you have to do is do your own widget

3772292
width	height
don t forget to factor in those margins to show up light grey areas and that you can t use height 100 for the same reasons you can t use width 50 as described by others here

3772321
inherited	properties
how can i prevent inherited of some methods or properties in derived classes

3772328
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade my rails versioning to rails 3.0

3772383
filesystems	ntfs
or does it not get stored anywhere rather an operating system tests the system memory device against a known set of filesystems like ext3 ntfs etc

3772402

haskell	scheme	scheme	prolog	lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme
especially lisp cl not as much as scheme and prolog and haskell embrace recursion

3772610
free	malloc
ie all 5 occasions malloc is called are met with a corresponding free

3772615
int	chars
assigning a wide chars string i.e the address of the first address of a wide chars array to an int pointer is only possible if you guess the int type to which wchar_t corresponds correctly

3772619
fadein	fadeout
jquery might have better methods than fadeout fadein for this job

3772652
organization	naming
note path names above have been abbreviated to hide organization specific naming

3772727
typedef	struct
the typedef statement already defines the symbol actor as an alias for struct _actor before you attempt to declare a class with the same name

3772727
typedef	struct
the second message pointing to the typedef struct _actor line in the program is a little clearer and refers to the multiple declarations for actor

3772730
versioning	upgrade
i believe that an upgrade of jruby to a versioning matching the patch level of ruby that we were running solved our issue we had to install jruby from source to get the right one

3772732
prng	random
here you typically have three functions init_prng seed which returns some opaque representation of the prng state get_prng state which returns a random number and changes the state variable and destroy_peng state which just cleans up allocated memory and so on

3772732
prng	random
finally it s often the case that prngs can be made to perform better if you ask for a whole sequence of random numbers in one go the compiler can vectorize the prng internals

3772734
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i ve tried margin top width height and border so far nothing seems to work

3772783
google-chrome	firefox
i get this error when i m in ie only but firefox google-chrome just show nothing no error and no app

3772786
ilist	iqueryable
if you really want to keep the interface as an ilist instead of an iqueryable just add an additional expression to the expression tree before you compile

3772829
typedef	struct
next we create a typedef for struct _actor called _actor

3772829
typedef	struct
the third line creates a second typedef for struct _actor called actor

3772829
typedef	struct
therefore in your c++ code you should probably eliminate the typedef entirely and just rename the struct

3772835
ubuntu	linux
i have g++ 4.4.3 on linux with ubuntu lucid lynx and i am getting a

3772862

3773025
typedef	struct
in the first version foo is a typedef for the named struct mystruct

3773025
typedef	struct
in the second version foo is a typedef for an unnamed struct

3773025
typedef	struct
in particular the second version doesn t allow the use of a forward declaration to declare foo and the struct it is a typedef for whereas the first would

3773047
decltype	auto
i think i have a good grasp on how the parameter packs are being deduced inferred and how auto decltype and the trailing return type are doing their thing but if i m mistaken please let me know how

3773081
lisp	prolog
all three lisp dialects offer meta-linguistic abstraction capabilities that few languages offer in such an elegant way prolog would be another interesting language that has similar capabilities

3773122
hex	binary
which would return you a list string containing the hex digits of the binary

post	get
i m developing an android video uploading app and uploading large amounts of video is a problem i get different type of exception sometimes host not resolved pipe broken i do a multipart post but i have a feeling if i upload chunk of bytes one at at time that ll increase upload speed as well as solve connection timeout and these type of problems

3773250
subtract	add
remember that many but not all languages use arrays that are zero-based so when converting from a natural number to an index subtract one and then add one to go from index to natural number

3773251
globalization	localization
it is certainly possible - it is one of the common issues with globalization localization

3773310
mouseup	mousedown
but i can definitely see a problem with doing the other way around raising mousedown when you get a mouseup - the mousedown handler could potentially i have no idea if it does this query the input device for the actual status of that mouse and they wouldn t match

3773343
put	get
you could put the png into an image view and then use this method to get the pixel value from a graphics context that you would draw the the image into

3773354

using installshield 2011 we re creating a major upgrade and having problems upgrading software with this product versioning format - 2009.727.1365

3773622
innodb	myisam
then when you want to do a fulltext search you do a join between the proper innodb table and the search-bait myisam table with a match condition against the myisam table

3773622
innodb	myisam
this also allows you to store different search-bait text in the myisam table to the â realâ text in the innodb table which allows you implement features like stemming or special apostrophe hyphen handling that mysql s fulltext engine can t manage

3773622
innodb	myisam
the problem here of course is keeping the myisam data consistent with the innodb data

3773646

apache commons daemons is a c program that launchd a java app and doesn t let you put the sanity checks in the java code afaik and thus breaks what i would consider important daemons facilities

3773704
daemons	launchd
thus if you are looking to implement a daemons launchd that behaves similar to sshd apache etc

3773806
submit	submission
put an alert x as the first statements in your jquery document .ready and jquery .appnitro submit functions and see if both are displayed first one upon document load second one upon form submission

3773818

i would want all of those folder named some_folder to read from a master directory

3774124
fink	macports
macports fink or source

3774124

i know its a not a new concept that my site is perfect on firefox safari and google-chrome but jacked up on ie8

3774137

3774467
lisp	smalltalk
pretty much every lisp implementation uses them many smalltalk vms many ruby interpreters and so on

3774467
mri	rubinius
for example in the mri yarv and rubinius ruby interpreters integers are encoded the way i described above false is encoded as address 0 which just so happens also to be the representation of false in c true as address 2 which just so happens to be the c representation of true shifted by one bit and nil as 4

3774469
inherited	properties
if you use it on arrays or array like objects it can give you several problems first inherited properties are also enumerated meaning that if someone augments the array.prototype object those properties will be also enumerated in your loop

3774495
glassfish	weblogic
a web application refers to a specific kind of module that can be deployed onto an ee container like tomcat weblogic or glassfish

3774557
unix	sunos
gnu coreutils date what you get on linux and which may also be hiding somewhere on your sunos system i doubt you actually mean sunos sun microsystems hasn t called its unix variant that for about fifteen years but even so the stuff in usr bin is still incredibly obsolete junk -- look in usr local and all subdirectories of opt -- can also do this but you have to preprocess the input

3774590
margin	height
based on the source order the only way you ll be able to do this is by specifying a negative margin for the top of the 6th div - if all your height are measured and it should fit exactly you ll probably just specify the height for the negative margin

3774592
webclient	networkcredentials
i m trying to do this using webclient passing networkcredentials posting the request to the asp.net mvc application from my wpf client

3774596

hide	show
if the user clicks the panel grid on the same cell again i want panel line grid to scroll rows as such visible rows hide and bottom rows show up

3774615
int	chars
this coerces the chars to an int

3774621
portrait	landscape
for now i am focusing on a portrait layout...i ll deal with landscape mode later

3774656
getter	setter
this allows me to pass up one of more values based upon how many changed without having to hard-code setter and getter with a call to a common server-api method over and over again

3774669
getter	setter
for this reason it would be next to useless to allow something to be stored in this variable which is essentially what that automatic setter does with no way of accessing this value at any point in the future after all the getter here is not an automatic getter it would return something entirely different

3774669
getter	setter
so to summerise without a getter there would which is the only way to retrieve the value from this backing variable there would be no point in having a private setter

3774703
google-chrome	firefox
but in ie request.urlreferrer is null firefox is ok not test google-chrome yet my question is how to get opening window url in ie

3774820
hide	show
if the number and names of the dynamically created fields are limited create them all in the form and hide them using css then show them using javascript

3774846
apache	nginx
maybe use a server optimised for static content nginx etc rather than a full blown apache instance you might be using for dynamic content on the same domain

3774859
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller uisplitviewcontroller all go against this advice

by this time in 2011 enough people should have upgrade to some compatible versioning of their chosen browser that you ll have a good sized user base

3774951
children	parent
if we had defined the foreign key on table1 with the cascade option we would have been able to delete the parent and all the children would get deleted automatically

3774951
children	parent
if we were to repeat the previously failed delete the children rows in table1 will be deleted as well as the parent row in table2

3774985
installshield	dtf

put	get
i m using the google maps javascript api so that i can have someone put a marker on a map and then get the latitude and longitude from that to submit as part of a form

3775296
forth	turing
as you correctly state this should be interpreted reading from left to right as if the machine is in state 1 and the current square contains a 0 print a 1 move right and change to state 2. however your use of the word step seems to suggest that that step 2 must be followed by step 3 etc. when in reality a turing machine can go back and forth between states and of course there can only be finitely many possible states

3775299
hide	show
and the images can be cycled-through with a function that show and hide them in turn

3775313
hide	show
just show the loading image bind to the imagesloaded event and when it s triggered hide the loading image

3775338
ddms	adb
have a look at framebuffer.c in the adb phone side sources which appears to be what the ddms screenshot capability uses

3775351
ienumerable	iqueryable
so being that i disabled lazy loading based on earlier advice should i then re-enable it return ienumerable iqueryable from my repository and convert the collection to a list in my view models if needed

3775362
ienumerable	iqueryable
return iqueryable or ienumerable via asenumerable in your repository if

3775376
post	get
especially since you seem to be wanting to do a post rather than a get from your question text

3775377
gif	png
with the command i can only exclude xml file type even though there are files in the folder image type png gif jpg txt php etc

3775384
ienumerable	ilist
the con is that changing your return type from ilist to ienumerable would be breaking

3775405
post	get
the query-string part of the url is normally used only for get requests not post requests

3775419
rss	feed
try the rss feed

3775421
google-chrome	firefox
since it works in google-chrome and functions in firefox i would really love to be able to use it with ie also

3775435
filtering	grouping
but then when i wanted to investigate pairwise comparisions between the individual grouping i had to make some inelegant filtering so that only two grouping entered the analysis at a time

3775444
post	get
i want to get the most recent post images in that post if present and the updated date of that post

3775462
rss	feed
however i think that you could just get an rss feed from the blogs and parse the necessary data from that

3775486
width	height
i ve tried to check the width and height and all those things

3775492
stdout	stderr
i think this is happening because errors are being sent to stderr instead of stdout

3775492
stdout	stderr
one way you can get around this is to redirect output to stderr to stdout and capture that

3775516
versioning	upgrade
so maybe you could upgrade to a new qt versioning

3775533
submit	submission
email will not be automatically sent by merely clicking on the submit button thereby submission the form

3775569
kerberos	ntlm
the problem is that ntlm authentication works however kerberos authentication does not

3775707
clang	llvm
there is also the ch c interpreter a commercial c interpreter and the open source ccons c interpreter which is based on clang llvm

3775711
prepare	pdostatement
to prevent sql injection simply use prepare statements pdostatement or mysqli_stmt

3775746
children	parent
you re storing all sub- files and folder recursively in a list but with your current code you store the parent folder before you store the children

3775788
int	chars
but then you can just do a find and replace on the regex by getting the int represented by the two hex numbers and then casting it to a chars or something similar to that

3775791
memcached	apc
edit 1 i agree it is very annoying to setup apc memcached on mamp

3775835

3775912
interpolation	splines
scale h via splines interpolation to be of size b + 2p t h_scaled

3775926
int	chars
from what i understand the documentation is saying it won t store a literal - chars which means it s probably now doing what the other signed int fields have always done and it s storing a sign bit to denote negative numbers instead

3775928
hash	md5
if you really wanted to you could javascript md5 hash the password in the browser but that is sort of giving you a false sense of security especially if you still send the password via http

3775982
jobs	cron
my problem is this google app engine allows cron jobs to be active for only 30 seconds before an deadlineexceededexception is thrown

3775982

3776193
google-chrome	firefox
if you use a debugger google-chrome s dev tools firebug for firefox script debugger for ie ... it should tell you that

3776206
put	get
i get this sometimes when i forget to adequately put the right namespaces in place

3776208
post	put
the only way i can concieve is to generate an upload url and then post to that url using the url fetch service but if i have to go to that amount of trouble i d rather just put the thumbnails in the datastore

3776232
folder	directory
the public folder is an important key feature of the zend framework because it confines apache to only read files in that directory and if used properly would keep all your other code outside public visibility

3776232
folder	directory
say for instance you have a public_html folder in your directory and that is the visible folder for your domain

3776253
crypt	hash
it s because it s used for unix password hash check crypt unix

the rest of the application i can do myself such as parsing the rss feed using the touchxml library

3776430

3776616
button	checkbox
if i create an mfc dialog based application a checkbox will be present for minimize button asking whether minimize is required for the dialog being created

3776632
put	get
maybe i could just put the text in a uilabel and then get it s content bitmap somehow

3776649
vim	gedit
change the font in vim to the default font in gedit or whatever editor you were using in screenshot #2

3776706
hide	show
it also allows the user to filter the list via some checkboxes in a menu so the user can choose to show or hide each type of files

3776706
filtering	grouping
however the listview still renders a 1px grey line between each view even if they are viewstubs meaning i see a thick grey line whenever a grouping of consecutive items are filtering away

3776716
portrait	landscape
the 0 0 coordinates are top left in portrait mode but my chart needs to be viewed in landscape mode and converting everything isn t that easy afaik so i was wondering if i can change the coordinate system

3776814
width	height
you also should have no need to set explicit width and height on the labels especially if you don t have any form of border or background

3776851
free	malloc
the details of how malloc and free work are implementation-specific

3776851
free	malloc
this means that if your implementation of malloc enlarges the data segment the corresponding implementation of free can t shrink it unless it determines that there s space at the end that s not being used

3776851
free	malloc
in practice a humongous chunk of memory you allocated with malloc rarely winds up at the very end of the data segment when you free it which is why processes tend to grow monotonically

3776872
free	malloc
i would suggest you pass null instead of a malloc d pointer and you will be free of worrying about its memory

3776884
swt	swing
if you have any experience with swing or swt i suggest you stick to it

3776886
profiling	debugging
btw my sampling profiling reads delphi debugging symbols .map .jdbg etc because there is still no good delphi to pdb debugging symbol converter so you can view the stack of a delphi program in windows debugger or process explorer visual studio etc

3776914
postgresql	mysql
does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql

3776945
button	checkbox
you can just use a checkbox and set its appearance to button

3776952
pascal	delphi
delphi is pascal

3776965
maven	pom.xml
this uses the maven properties http.url and http.attachmentfile that you can specify on the command line using the -d syntax or in a pom.xml file in a block

3776967
vim	gedit
vim in gnome-terminal seems to be correct as it uses the same routines for rendering as gedit does default ubuntu 10.04

3776997
waitpid	execl
you must call wait or waitpid in the parent process and it will give you the exit status of the program executed by execl

3777108
int	double
i ve replaced double by int because i don t see why you d use double to store int

3777140
cvs	svn
so for now it s just excel and doc file lugged into the project doc folder and check into cvs svn doomed to be outdated and be forgotten p

3777164
rss	feed
i have a script which caches a number of rss feed however i have noticed that i ve started getting strange characters appearing in the page where i output the cached contents stored in db

3777164
rss	feed
for instance the rss feed contains the characters

3777187
stdout	stderr
to also capture stderr in addition to stdout use the following syntax

3777200
for-loop	arrays
is there a way to do it other than running on the arrays elements in for-loop

3777234
rss	feed
the fact that there are 3 bad characters in the output suggests that the rss feed is being interpreted so that the html character reference is converted to utf-8

3777234
rss	feed
have you got a call to html_entity_decode in the code that retrieves the rss feed

3777242
rss	feed
you need to make sure that the encoding of the rss feed is the same as in your db

3777260
ubuntu-server	centos
the server will be either ubuntu-server or centos based

3777360
rss	feed
since your application seems to decode the htmlentities of that cached rss feed before writing them to the db you may also output them like you got them in the first place

3777426
tolower	toupper
arguments to isdigit isblank ... and toupper and tolower

3777427
gridview	repeater
you also can query these attributes if the control is webcontrol many controls such as textbox label button etc are webcontrols but some databound controls like repeater gridview are not

3777443
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however applying text-transform uppercase to ä i the browsers checked ie firefox google-chrome and safari results in i i which is not correct and may change the meaning of the words so much so that they become insults

if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django

3777454

it s for fetching and displaying data not for making decisions what to show hide

3777583
ggplot2	lattice
once the data are in this stacked form it only requires a simple ggplot call to produce the plot you wanted with all the extras one reason why higher-level plotting packages like lattice and ggplot2 are so useful

3777592
melt	reshape
the general approach is to convert the data to long format using melt from package reshape or reshape2 or gather from the tidyr package

3777671
folder	directory
if you want to make sure that the file is created in a particular folder you have to provide a working directory to exec which only works in the three argument version

3777752
pull	push
i have a central repository and 3 users with local repositories that pull and push code to the central one

3777752
chown	chgrp
every time a user pushes code some directories and files get their owner and group changed from hg and hgusers to username and usergroup respectively which makes impossible to the others to push code.so i have to do chown and chgrp to go back to the initial situation again

3777775
typedef	struct
your typedef using a private struct any code outside the debugger class trying to use it will not compile

3777799
octal	decimal
the substr calls work around a tricky issue is the interpretation of the numbers 08 and 09 in some awk implementations are they the decimal numbers 8 and 9 or invalid octal numbers

3777813
google-chrome	firefox
what s not working however is the quirk that causes a submit input in the form to be virtually clicked firefox and google-chrome include the submit input s name in the parameters posted while ie does not

3777813
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do still work but ie once worked and now doesn t. i can probably figure out what i changed to break it but as bobince seemed to understand something about this quirk i figured i d ask to see if there are known possibly even documented ways to control it

3777819
rss	feed
for the rss i use rome which reads an rss feed and contains the body of the article in a string

3777838
onkeyup	onkeydown
you need to implement the onkeydown and onkeyup method in your activity and return true for each of your required buttons

puts	gets
i have also noticed a few other issues through my use of this library - like a lack of a getfileinfo method or recursive gets and puts

3778092
int	double
nstimeinterval is defined as double so if you want to convert it to int you can make simple type cast

3778117
mdpi	hdpi
the mdpi and hdpi shows the resources from the right folder but when choosing my device with ldpi it shows the resources from mdpi - which is wrong

3778157

3778427
jflex	cup
after this if you really want to do it the hard way you could build your own template processor using lexers and parsers such as jflex and cup

3778464
hide	show
however you can minimize the main window or hide it or whatever before you show the dialog

3778469
post	get
i believe that an answer to the question what are reasons for a browser executing get rather than post does not help to solve the problem of receiving a get on a form where you expect the a get

3778469
post	get
but to answer that question i would simply say that you receive an get because the browser sends an get and you can send a get on any page where you can send a post

3778469
post	get
thus your server has to be prepared to handle the get and it should handle the get in the same manner as a post with invalid parameters

3778485
hash	salt
passwords should be stored via a salt hash

3778497
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in ie but it does not in firefox and google-chrome

3778625
qtableview	qtablewidget
i know your question was about qtableview but it might be easier if it is the only thing you want to display i don t know your objectives to use a qtablewidget with a qdoublespinbox since it has a method that allows you to set a suffix to the value that is displayed

width	height
is there any way of finding the height of the rows from 1 to 50 and the width of the columns from a to z in an excel sheet without manually clicking and writing down the answer

3778962
ssl	https
the reason this message exists is that any https connection is served via ssl so the browser knows that the data coming in on it is indeed the exact data sent from the server

3778962
ssl	https
this is not the case for any components that have been deliverd via http - these can change components that have been delivered via ssl so the guarantee that the https data is correct cannot be maintained

3779003
width	margin
i ve now got the feeling that a possible cause would be incorrect usage of margin padding or width

3779131
disk	ram
as part of the performance tuning you re going to uncover not only how the queries need to be restructured but also exactly what parts of the machine might need to be replaced ie disk more ram cpu etc based on the lock and wait types

3779134
client-side	server-side
how can i get spring to generate a proxy on the server-side to the client-side listener so that the callback invoked by the server is executed remotely on the client-side

3779147

both postgresql as well as mysql can easily handle 500 million rows

3779164
ubuntu	linux
but these were in linux -- which i love -- but i really want to use nsight to benchmark and tune my code so i need windows -- so i decided to purchase a development box which i dual boot ubuntu x64 for production runs and win 7 with vs 2010 a battle which i m presently fighting and nsight 1.5 for development

add javascript to the textbox onchange or onkeyup event there do your check and enable the button

3779514
for-loop	arrays
apparently this is a for-loop that cycles through the arrays of object and checks whether such book exist

3779524
width	height
this would resize the view and everything that is inside dividing the view width and height by 2

3779558
pop-up	dialog
the problem is instead of going to this screen and leaving my main window i want my target screen to pop-up into a modal dialog

3779604
int	double
i ve tried double and int

3779610
google-chrome	firefox
the fact is all my forms are working nicely in firefox and google-chrome

3779771
width	height
can you make a video stretch to the width height of the video element

3779888

another way is to set a div with a background image of your image and then a link inside there make the link display block and make it the entire width and height of the div and the whole thing will be clickable

3779889
symfony	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
i would suggest that you adopt a php framework like symfony kohana codeigniter cakephp etc

3779889
symfony	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
play around with any one of these i find symfony is pretty powerful and kohana codeigniter are easy to set up haven t used cakephp and once you get comfortable with one of these have a look at some of the cmses that were done using these frameworks

3779893
range	min	range	percentile
first is to compute the range by finding the highest and lowest values project each element to a percentile x - min range and throw out any that evaluate to lower than .05 or higher than .95

3779893
subtract	add
then subtract 2 sigmas from the mean and add 2 sigmas to the mean and you ve got your outlier limits

3779911
button	checkbox
currently pressing the tab button on they keyboard results in the checkbox gaining focus i would like to override this so that tab key would bring the password field into focus

3779915
folder	directory
my question is why does it also create a project-egg.info folder in my project root directory

3779916
unsigned	short
short answer the division first promotes x to unsigned

3779923
unsigned	short
x is converted to unsigned int divided by 3 and then that result is down-converted to signed short

3779926
win64	windows
because of a com4j problem with win64 the active directory plugin uses the unix implementation on 64-bit windows

3780066
checkstyle	jdepend
run a tool like jdepend checkstyle or pmd on the source

3780134
client-side	server-side
if it does and each of its methods throw remoteexception then when it is passed to the server through the manager proxy everything is wired up automatically and method invocations on the server-side proxy to this listener are remote invocations of methods on the real client-side object

3780134
client-side	server-side
this means we can use one of these objects on the client-side as a parameter to an rmi method call on an rmi server-side object and when the deserialised stub on the server-side has methods invoked those methods will execute on the client-side

3780157
integer	unsigned
so presumably it represents a 64-bit integer which might be signed or unsigned and no it isn t zero

3780166
hide	show
how do i fix this so i don t have to hide show the title and have the fancybox on top of it

3780176
facebook	fbconnect
fbconnect should ignore your username pass in your database you need to store the facebook tokens which will be returned from a facebook connect login

3780185
hide	show
your best bet is probably turn off the real window title as you detail in your question then define a titlebar-like element of your own in your layout file...which you can then show hide at will

3780189
datediff	difference
i don t get what you are doing there but if you want to calculate the difference between 2 dates you could use the datediff function in classic asp

3780191
post	get
if they re not sufficient and you get stuck then post your code and explain what you re seeing

3780308
typedef	struct
coincidentally declares the type struct complex_z but doesn t give a name for the typedef

3780324
hide	show
alternatively if it s giving you a hard time just put two gridviews in a viewswitcher or framelayout with each set to one of the adapters you want and show hide one or the other when you need to rather than swapping out sources on one gridview

3780348
imageview	listadapter
is there a way for me to know programmatically while inside a listadapter s getview the dimensions of an imageview inside the view that is returned so my thumbnail comes perfectly scaled

3780363
gif	png
without doing any deeper research never had this particular issue i d guess using transparent png instead of gif would be a good fix

3780373
inherited	properties
i believe what you may want to do is create a project properties sheet with the vs project manager that all the projects could inherited from

3780391
jobs	cron
otherwise you can use the cron jobs or windows schedular

3780409
pop-up	dialog
you will need to add a context menu strip to the datagridview with a insert menu item and when that is clicked have your insert dialog pop-up

3780428
ironruby	ironpython
you can use vb or any of the dlr languages like ironruby or ironpython or even that weird but oddly attractive beast f#.

3780441
fadein	fadeout
at first the text should fadein then stand for 3 sec. then fadeout again then a the textlink should fadein for 3 sec

3780477
rss	feed
i have an iphone app which streams in a website blogs rss feed

3780492
portrait	landscape
if i do a reverse pinch gesture move two touch locations apart while a video is playing landscape the video switches to portrait mode broadcasts a mpmovieplayerwillenterfullscreennotification and a mpmovieplayerdidenterfullscreennotification and is then stuck

3780509
integer	fractions
so this is roughly equivalent to a+b 2 in integer math which has no remainders or fractions parts

3780537
bmp	png
i don t really understand why a 24-bit png has the problem while the 24-bit bmp doesn t

3780613
implements	extends
car is not an interface so you must extends it rather than implements it

3780616
width	height
but since the width changes and the height doesn t i end up having sort of 2 images with different proportion

3780616
portrait	landscape
i thought about having a real big image that will fit for both landscape and portrait orientation

3780663
int	double
is equivalent to just evaluate all the double float int temporaries with comma operator

3780670
x86	64bit
if you need even more speed there is a x86 32 and 64bit jit version luajit

3780686
int	double
the comma operator s return value is its right-side argument so double float int boils down to just int although it creates and discards a double and a float value along the way

3780725
put	get
i donâ t like the first because i have to put stuff in my model just to get the gui right

3780767
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that in the layoutsubviews method repositions its subviews based on the orientation of the ipad

3780779
put	get
i was also trying to make a wpf control with grid grid background and control background was set to transparent and place it on normal windows form but when i put this control on normal windows form not wpf i don t get the proper transparency

3780831
google-chrome	firefox
for the record this is done on firefox 3.6.10 on ubuntu 10.04 64-bit and google-chrome does not have this issue

3780860
coalesce	isnull
the title element below is working as an isnull or coalesce would in sql as to prevent nulls being returned

3780879
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome just happen to also implement a console object refers to webkit js console

3780882
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome when i click on the button i m redirected to pag.php

3780896
width	height
images are stretched to fit by default and because of that you see lots of images which are badly distorted online most likely due to a simple mistake in specifying the height and width

3780898
cout	cin
iostream objects cin cout cerr and clog are objects declared in the iostream header

3780912
post	get
can i send for example a string or another piece of information to another .php file without it being exposed thus not by get but by post conform to what i know without using a form

3780916
google-chrome	firefox
in addition all the buttons are are working well in mozilla firefox and google-chrome

3780918
solaris	aix
i have a c program in aix 5.3 i ve been asked to run it on a sparc solaris 10 machine but when i did it i noticed there was a buffer overflow with one of the many reckless strcat uses

3780918
solaris	aix
my goal is not to sanitize the code but to provide a concrete and well founded answer of why does this overflow happens on solaris and not on aix being the exact same bad coded program

3780918
solaris	aix
endianess diffs between aix and solaris

3780918
solaris	aix
execution of the strcat function aix copies right to left and solaris left to right but i haven t been able to find any documentation on this

3780918
solaris	aix
actually a better question would be is there any difference between aix powerpc and solaris sparc regarding alignment

3780920
capitalization	uppercase
absolutely weird capitalization irregularities you have in your schema btw -- would drive me absolutely bonkers if anybody used lowercase vs uppercase at random spots of column names that are so obviously meant to be identical

3780925
google-chrome	firefox
for a more precise description of the functionality i need please see the firefox google-chrome etc and how they do their ctrl-pgdn and ctrl-pgup keyboard shortcuts

3780930
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the below on google-chrome firefox and opera for linux as well as ie6 yes really and ie8 for windows

3780942
width	height
then you can update like this assuming the new width height

3780951
post	get
alternatively inside of the log object s logging methods you could get the calling method like the accepted answer in this post

3781031
client-side	server-side
the only solution i found to this challenge was to create a server-side proxy service that relays the responses from the google maps geocode api to my client-side script

3781073
post	put
my idea would be to transfer the file using http put post from client most of the coding on client side to the server

3781073
post	get	post	put	put	get
my aim is to send the server a form like as given below with a http post put request and get the file main.cpp uploaded to the server

3781152
solaris	aix
luck or perhaps an artefact of slightly different memory management systems with more space being allocated on aix than on solaris

3781152
solaris	aix
if they are a couple of bytes out of bounds and if aix habitually allocates say 32 byte minimum blocks where solaris allocates 16 byte minimum blocks then there is more room for error without damage on aix than on solaris

3781152
solaris	aix
even so if you get it wrong in the wrong context aix should also have the problem - you can regard yourself as unlucky not to have observed the problem on aix for as you say it surely occurs there just as much as it does on solaris if the source code you re compiling is the same

3781152
solaris	aix
for 32-bit compilations aix 5.3 allocates a multiple of 16 bytes per allocation just like solaris

3781152
solaris	aix
however if you changed between 32-bit and 64-bit builds between aix and solaris this might still be the source of your problem

3781158
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	png
works with any format supported by gdi+ bmp gif jpeg png tiff exif wmf and emf

3781161
unix	bsd
the iso language definition does not specify anything about sockets or network programming so in order to do this you need to rely on another system-specific library standard such as the bsd socket api on unix linux

3781180
google-chrome	firefox
note both firefox and google-chrome will default most plugins to click-to-play soon with google-chrome planning to phase out npapi entirely

3781192
portrait	landscape
the camera is actually landscape native so you get up or down when you take a picture in landscape and left or right when you take a picture in portrait depending on how you hold the device .

3781253
wmi	managementeventwatcher
in the view model s constructor i set up a wmi managementeventwatcher and start it

3781280
super	self
original class has the super call when its got replaced - it causes self inheritance and causes maximum recursion depth exceed exception

3781280
super	self
class orm is calling super orm self ..

3781313
range	min	range	max	min	max
as far as i am aware there is no internal difference between integer int or int xx where xx is some number they are all the same datatype with the same byte storage allocation and min max range

3781336
getter	setter
if library had only public members books and bookcount or getter setter then the client wouldn t be getting any advantages because the client would still have to do all the heavy lifting

3781344
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
the code for this can get a bit complex but essentially you will need to capture the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events on your form

3781358
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
in winforms you can handle the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events of a control

3781367
hide	show
if you just want to simulate it you could make the screen into a component screen and use visual states to hide show it

3781413
g++	gcc
and to answer your other question i compiled a simple test program with such an assignment inside main with the -pedantic and -wall flags using gcc and g++ and received no warnings in either.

3781413
g++	gcc
and as josh points out the flag -wshadow will warn about this in gcc g++ in this specialized case

3781456
rss	feed
i m trying to simply display an rss feed as part of my site

3781459
rss	feed
it appears that the link is added to the content in place of the break tag but i see no option to disable this substitution for rss feed only

3781473
firefox	safari
it looks perfect in firefox safari ie8 but in ie7 and ie8 comparability mode it adds about 4000px of width to the div.team elements nested within the list item

3781491
hide	show
in this javascript hide show example how can i close all other divs when a div is selected

3781691
int	chars
here is nearly identical code the only difference being it is using an array of chars rather than int

3781713
width	height
from a quick view i guessing that you ve set the width height to 50 and then you re adding 1px borders

3781713
width	height
the css box model uses the width height values to set the width height of the content area not the entire box

3781713
width	height
changing the width and height values should do the trick

3781736
rss	feed
if your site contains the regular google analytics implementation no the rss feed will not track views for you

3781736
rss	feed
the default installation does not insert any tracking code into the rss feed

3781736
rss	feed
you ll need to look into some sort of rss feed analytics solution to track that

3781736
rss	feed
you could also implement the iphone ios sdk for google analytics and track from within your application but that s likely not possible if you re using a cookie cutter rss feed to application tool

3781737
ssms	sqlcmd
connect to dac sqlcmd -e -a -s . express or from ssms use admin . express

3781764
octal	binary
i am having a problem in converting a binary number to its octal number can anyone help me out

3781788
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
you can use this site to test ie6-9 ff2-4 google-chrome 5-6 safari 3-5 and opera 9-10

3781789
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
after that ie slows down at exponential rate when firefox google-chrome and safari are doing much better

3781790
width	height
i m very surprised setting max width height didn t do anything

3781802
pylons	cherrypy
and would like to use one of those well known web frameworks django cherrypy pylons etc

3781803
octal	decimal	octal	binary
it is not converting it from 10011 binary to 23 octal 19 decimal as you want it to

3781806
octal	binary
in this example we convert the binary string representation to an integer and from an integer to the octal string representation

3781821
actionscript	mxml
you can give everything an initial position easily within mxml a simple xml based language for defining your ui and then program interaction with actionscript basically same as javascript

3781829
int	double
what might be happening is that one of those other values coming back is an int type and that s causing the double to get converted when you concatenate them

3781829
int	double
unlike most other programming languages when combining floating point and int types matlab will narrow the floating point double values to the int types instead of widening the int

3781829
int	double
if this is what s going on you should explicitly convert all the int values in arg.tick to double

3781831
mouse	keyboard
only keyboard events influence the processing no mouse etc.

3781838
post	put
but this problem really put me on edge and i kept this post under hourly watch for days in hope of some reply

3781840
pylons	cherrypy
if you want to keep it simple look at cherrypy pylons and other lightweight frameworks

3781854
gif	png
there is a variety of utilities for rendering latex into gif or png or similar formats

3781867
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
when i use pushviewcontroller on a navigationcontroller to push another uiviewcontroller onto the navigationcontroller the toolbar is overwritten by the navigation bar

3781868
put	get
now the part i am not getting when a thread calls yield i get the current context and save it in a threadcontrolblock and put in the queue

3781896
public	protected
is a completely valid statement provided text is declared public and not private or protected

3781896
public	protected
is the function text public or private or protected

3781901
stdout	stderr
with this you can also redirect stdin stdout and stderr

3781908
post	get
i want to learn the methods on how to get it to work and finally decided to post here

3781952
getter	setter
having getter and setter only makes sense if you have to do extra calculations or checks when assigning the value

3781955
put	get
i implemented following methods options propfind mkcol delete move put get

3781983
google-chrome	firefox
edit the following code now works in firefox and google-chrome but does not work in ie8

3781986
udp	tcp
personally i learned this stuff by writing my own udp and tcp stacks in a well known embedded environment called dos maybe you have heard of it

3781988
mouse	keyboard
pyhook seems to have done some of the work necessary as it s hooked keyboard and mouse events

3781992
ant	maven
i personally prefer maven as a packaging and building tool although others prefer ant

3782000
min	max
i think you need to compute both the max and min computable value using each subsequence

3782011
getter	setter
in python you don t have private attributes but you can implement something similar by using getter and setter to a variable which starts with underscore - python s convention for private methods and attributes

3782040
short	base
in short the problem is that while i can access the decorator defined in the base class from the inherited class by specifiying it as subsystem.updategui i ultimately get this typeerror when trying to use it

3782075
inherited	subclassing
if they can have distinct interfaces you need to decide if you want to represent the distinctness with inherited in which case you would also use classmethod and call the decorator on the subclassing of subsystem or if it is better represented as distinct instances

3782078
jboss	glassfish
i am trying to deploy my war to glassfish works fine in jboss

3782080
width	height
the order for cgrectmake is origin x origin y width height

3782087
postgresql	mysql
connect objects to databases can have postgresql or mysql as the engine so you are free to choose the fastest one i think that other frameworks use sqlalchemy s orm which is also super cool and fast

3782096
post	get
if your using asp.net mvc 2.0 then try using a post versus get on the method something like

3782122
wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	joomla	joomla	phpbb
wordpress joomla phpbb and others are made to be portable

3782125
jboss	glassfish
i would install glassfish or jboss

3782127
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome and of course not ie

3782134
debian	linux
debian is a fairly common linux distribution and will work on almost every pc

3782134
ubuntu	linux
if you do mind using linux you can use ubuntu which is more user-friendly but not really recommended as a server at least for the default version

3782137
postgresql	mysql
the database may be a mysql but for professional usage with more functionality postgresql will be the best choice

3782151
redhat	fedora
whichever you want - at work for example our linux servers run redhat enterprise linux which is loosely based on fedora so that might be a good distribution to use that might be similar to what you would experience in the real world

3782151
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are both widely-used open source database servers

3782165
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
1 as you want but i suggest you a red-hat centos for example or debian ubuntu for example based distribution

3782165
jboss	weblogic
it is much easier to install configure it than other webservers jboss websphere weblogic etc. and you won t need them in a first time ejb etc.

3782165
postgresql	mysql
3 as a database you can use mysql very easy to install or postgresql or oracle express edition not open source but free.

3782202
button	checkbox
the web developer toolbar has a great forms populate form fields command which will fill in a textbox s value with it s name attribute and automatically select checkbox and items from radio button sets

3782219
sorting	grouping
the sorting worked now i want to grouping

3782258
typedef	struct
make typedef of struct particularly incomplete struct not pointers to those struct

3782258
typedef	struct
if the definition of the underlying struct is not to be publicly available which is often laudable then that encapsulation should be supplied by the struct being incomplete rather than by inconvenient typedef

3782440
subtraction	add
add b to result representing subtraction of b -1 s

3782466
firefox	safari
here is the code all alone it works on firefox safari and chrome.

3782508
xslt	xquery
there are no rules about the order in which different expressions are executed which means that the little yellow triangle that shows the current execution point in the stylus studio xquery debugger and xslt debugger can sometimes behave in surprising ways and this means that constructs whose result would depend on order of execution like variable assignment are banned

3782519
hash	salt
here is my question for a non banking military or even commercial web app what is the right way to choose a salt for a hash function used for passwords

3782519
hash	salt
i can easily generate a pseudo random salt for each new user and append that salt to their pw before applying the hash function

3782519
hash	salt
but i still need to store the salt so presumably anyone who gets access to the hash passwords also gets the salt

3782519
hash	salt
generate the salt based on a hash of a user name or first+last name or sign up date presumably using a different hash function

3782519
hash	salt
store in the db a value which concatenates the hash pw and the salt in a non obvious manner the salt is 10 random keys and they are injected inside the hash pw between letter numbers 1 2 4 5 8 9 etc

3782519
hash	salt
as a side question how easy is it to change a salt hash algorithm when upgrading the software of the website

3782534
subtract	add
when you add or subtract content from this page the weird line remains but just in different spots of the text

3782539
octal	binary
first pad the binary string to be divisable by 3 3 bits 1 octal digit

3782543
iboutlet	ibaction
ok if you added the object in ib the object was already instantiated for you when you loaded the nib and the ibaction and iboutlet connections have already been made

3782602
hash	salt
yes the salt is just there to prevent rainbow attacks on the hash passwords

3782612
gif	png
just have a big image png or gif with a transparent mask area absolutely positioned over a bunch of lines of text

3782613
folder	directory
tried the same thing with my ubuntu setup creating the .vim after ftplugin directory in my home folder and updating the vimrc with the correct path of the pydiction dictionary but i fail every time

3782625
google-chrome	safari
i m only interested in the most common browsers in use today ie6+ ff3+ google-chrome latest safari latest

3782625
google-chrome	safari
what that question doesn t answer however is whether this rfc-compliant approach will work on existing popular browsers especially ie6 7 8 which are the usual standards-compliance culprits but also ie9 ff4+ latest google-chrome and latest safari which our application also must support

3782631
aim	instant
my aim is that i want one and only one of the alternative to be visible at any given instant of time

3782647
hash	salt
hash are salt to avoid dictionary attacks

3782647
hash	md5
before one jumps to condemn the use of md5 instead of sha1 as required by the http digest scheme hash but providing on-demand md5 hash collision for the digest scheme is still far from being actionable in the foreseeable future and the added benefit of automated access think webrequest curl etc is not to be neglected

3782653
post	get	post	put	put	get
it s also about the get put delete and post http verbs and of course the edit new etc default actions

3782682
min	max
id _txtspinner .spinner max 60 min 0

3782688
getter	setter
i have been coding in php and using codeigniter as well never got the concept of getter and setter

3782689
post	get
but it would really help me if i could submit it via get or post something which i switch on my pages due to design criteria

3782709
google-chrome	firefox
i don t see these in google-chrome or firefox

3782726
getter	setter
the getter and setter here are the methods that allow access to the protected property

3782726
getter	setter
some people criticize getter and setter as boilerplate code especially if they do not do anything than directly setting getting the property they provide access to

3782726
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
getter setter aka accessor mutators methods in wikipedia

3782726
getter	setter
is it really that wrong not using setter and getter

3782746
folder	directory
from the tutorials i read i ve developed a habit of taking my application folder and moving it up one directory to be in the same folder as my system and user guide which i ll probably delete user guide before going live of course

3782765
put	get
the way i normally get around the 3-4 concurrent requests for such situations is to put the settimeout call inside the function i want to run repeatedly

3782780
int	chars
a year column as an int or chars 4 depending upon your needs

3782792
inherited	properties
for each of these it can call getcustomattributes to look for those that inherited from validationattribute and for each of these call isvalid passing the value of the properties or field

3782826
recvfrom	datagram
if the datagram or message is larger than the buffer specified the buffer is filled with the first part of the datagram and recvfrom generates the error wsaemsgsize

3782827
superclass	subclassing
why did the python designers decide that subclassing __init__ methods don t automatically call the __init__ methods of their superclass as in some other languages

3782845
superclass	subclassing
often the subclassing has extra parameters which can t be passed to the superclass

3782864
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
it appears that for sql server i can t use those objects but rather i would need to use the objects sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader to do essentially the same things

3782877
superclass	subclassing
while constructing all superclass and no doubt doing so before you continue constructing downwards is obviously part of saying you re constructing a subclassing s instance that is clearly not the case for initializing since there are many use cases in which superclass initialization needs to be skipped altered controlled -- happening if at all in the middle of the subclassing initialization and so forth

3782901
google-chrome	safari
what would this rule s syntax look like for google-chrome safari and .

3782905
swt	swing
java using swing possibly swt + jdbc

3782907
vsto	add-in
we have a vsto 4.0 add-in for excel 2007 that seems to have issues with memory leaks but only certain documents and only on windows 7

3782907
width	height

width	height
at system.windows.forms.control.setbounds int32 x int32 y int32 width int32 height boundsspecified specified

3782907
vsto	add-in
when i save the documents as stand alone docs and do not open them using the vsto add-in it is able to open them with minimal memory

3782909
integer	unsigned
you should be able to just read the value from the binary file into an unsigned 32 bit integer

3782921
google-chrome	safari
what you re looking for is already available here css3 gradient generator - that works for mozilla and webkit-based safari google-chrome browsers

3782935
ssl	https
http can be tunneled over ssl tls to be secure https

3782944
width	height
i noticed that jquery ui is setting the width and height on that div dynamically

3782944
width	height
set the width height of the overlay to be the width height of the document then bind a function on the window resize event to adjust the overlay width height to match the new document width height

3782946
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
-moz-border-radius is for firefox -webkit-border-radius is for safari and google-chrome

maven	pom.xml
all seems fine until i run a clean followed by an install - then maven complains it cant find my top level pom.xml to install

3782974
jar	war
to add to things - there are 2 general types of components a jar component makes a single jar file and a j2ee component which produces ear war jar rar and config files

3782978
try-catch	exception-handling
inside tags or in handlers such as onclick in try-catch blocks and when an exception-handling occurs it gains control and does whatever it s supposed to do eg

post	get	post	put	put	get
i m trying to see how i could apply get put post delete to the respective crud operations on my repository find insert update remove

3783496
post	get
with html.beginform you can specify a formmethod enumeration - but it only has get and post

3783496
post	get
or is this a silly overkill design in the first place should i just stick with get and post

3783496
post	get
he indicates a html form only supports get and post because i m new to rest-style web development i did not even know this to which i am partially ashamed

3783496

so what should i do here should i stick with get post or should i create a javascript file which wraps the underlying xmlhttprequest code behind a nice function

is it correct to say if i write loops the first way then i should be accessible to the entire function but if i write it the second way then i is only accessible to the for-loop regardless of what standard i compile with

3783762
for-loop	loops
another way of asking this same question if i compile with the c89 standard will the i of both for loops be accessible to the entire function and if i compile with the c99 standard will the i of the first for-loop be accessible to the entire function while the i of the second for-loop will be accessible by only the for-loop

3784015
tax	shipping
i could check total amount against his cart by accessing the database pulling his cart items and re-totaling their prices plus shipping and tax

3784015
tax	shipping
but that is a lot of heavy lifting just to check for tampering multiple db queries plus 2 web service calls per item to get shipping and tax

3784057
children	parent
you could then write the following jquery code to check the parent checkbox when either of the children are checked

3784067
uiview	subviews

i am looking for the most performant way to arrange usage of the datacache and datacache factory for appfabric caching calls for between 400 and 700 cache gets per page load and barely any puts

3784299
puts	gets
but once you have the factory object and the cache that you want to work with you can simply reuse those objects to do puts and gets into the cache and you should see much faster performance.

3784299
put	get
so if the put get volume is very high these tcp connections might be bottlenecked

3784321
post	get
the reason that you re mostly familiar with get and post is because a regular old browser can only get or post a url especially when submitting a form

3784321
post	get
if you want to do crud without ajax then you can always post a product or use get for a delete method with the id in the url caveat to that make sure the delete method is protected behind authorization or a web crawler will gladly consume your gets and delete all your data...

3784321
post	get	post	put	put	get
if you don t want to build a rest api then don t sweat the fact that you re not using delete just use get with the id in the url or you re not using put just use post with the product entity in the post body

3784322
put	get
no backslash if you put a backslash before a character that has no special meaning you just get the same character but without the backslash

super	extends
without having done this exact thing in practice myself it seems to me that it s advantageous to denormalize in batches at the database level reason being that the search server is good at finding info super fast but the database server is better at getting the matching data assuming it extends out to related columns which are not in the search index

3784437

3787288
keydown	keyup
what you can do is to listen to keydown or keyup events on your textbox control and move the focus accordingly

3787312
actualheight	actualwidth
the problem is that i can t probably bind to the actualheight actualwidth properties cause they are not dependency ones

3787351
accessor	properties
does your tags properties have a set accessor

3787351
accessor	properties
you should not have a set accessor on this properties at all actually nor should the mediafile constructor be willing to take some external unless it s going to copy it

3787371
typedef	struct
camelcase for struct classes typedef template parameter names

3787383
folder	directory

such a struct can be instantiated for t int t double but not t void

3787414
hash	salt
for better security you could use two salt a user-specific one and a system-wide one concat them then hash the salt with the password

3787414
hash	salt
if an attacker somehow gets to read your database records he still cannot effectively crack your password hash until he knows the system-wide salt

3787414
hash	salt
a further note on the security of password hash you might also want to read why do salt make dictionary attacks impossible

3787414
pbkdf2	salt
considering the rise of multi-purpose multi-core systems graphics cards programmable micro-controllers etc. it may be worth using algorithms with high computation effort along with salt to counter brute-force cracking using multiple hashing like pbkdf2

3787443
width	height
also you do realize that you are binding the width of the rectangle to the height of the textblock right

3787443
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
if this is really the way you want to set up your control you will want to bind the rectangle s width to the textblock s actualwidth and height to actualheight

3787447

3787488
wxpython	pyqt
i came to the conclusion that pyqt is currently the best choice for a modern powerful well-maintained and portable gui mainly because of some of the shortcomings of its main contender wxpython see below

3787488
wxpython	pyqt
two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter

3787522
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt is to prevent rainbow table attacks using pre-computed hash dictionaries

3787522
hash	salt
assuming an attacker gets to know the hash passwords and salt from your database if the salt is a74kd qau and the password is 12345 will he be able to crack it using a rainbow table

3787522
hash	salt
no even if the password is weak the attacker won t have a pre-computed hash dictionary at hand for your random salt

3787544
google-chrome	firefox
it works properly inside of google-chrome and firefox but internet explorer 9 simply hangs on it

3787544
google-chrome	firefox
neither google-chrome nor firefox give me any sort of error output in their consoles and ie9 just crashes without actually giving any debug output

3787562
jsf	seam
you can have a look at seam see this article for a discussion to use seam with jsf and ajax

hide	show
if a checkbox is hidden using jquery hide how to show it again if we know the value in the following case

3788053
implements	extends
especially the paragraphs how to extends the default user profile and implements a custom user profile should answer the question you ask

3788061
getter	setter
you could add the getter setter to the interface then let the compiler tell you where your implementers are and it should be a simple copy paste to place the field getter and setter into every class after the first

3788068
folder	dir
looks first into resources if nothing found it then looks in the lproj dir folder

3788078
webclient	httpwebrequest
if so which class should i use httpwebrequest webclient or something else

if you know a thing or two about svg you ll know that ie doesn t support it but it does support vml

3788688
getter	setter
you re violating the single responsibility principle by having one function be both a getter and a setter

3788688
getter	setter
in c# it s just syntactic sugar and is converted into a getter and setter just like you should write it in php

3788688
getter	setter
and the compiler will generate a private backing field and your getter and setter functions for you

3788692
dictionary	map
if you insist on using regex this would work taking zoltan balazs dictionary map approach

3788727
jboss	glassfish
our other option is something like jboss or glassfish or is it

3788727
jboss	glassfish
while we are comfortable creating java clients we haven t delved into something like jboss glassfish in the slightest bit

uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the uinavigationcontroller will already contain a uinavigationbar so there isn t much you have to worry about

3788919
outputstream	inputstream
you can just map a local disk file system folder on the given url or register a servlet to listen on that url which in turn gets the image as inputstream from disk and writes it to outputstream of the response you can find here a basic example

3788933
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
from those you can build subtraction multiplication long division and longer shifts

3788933
128bit	64bit	multiplying	division
keep in mind that multiplying two 64bit numbers gives you a 128bit number and long division may need to be able to take a 128bit dividend

3788934
children	parent
when you refresh the parent all references to the children are lost

3788934
children	parent
children get all the resources the parent left behind.

3788934

your original version may occasionally accidently work if the realloc occurs immedaitely after the malloc so there is space to expand the memory block in place

3789039
memcpy	memmove
now to answer your actual question since we are dealing with simple data items ints you can use memmove or memcpy to copy them memmove is safe if the memory blocks overlap

3789039
memcpy	memmove
as for the efficency of memmove memcpy that s pretty much an unknown area

3789039
memcpy	memmove
memmove does a bit more range checking then memcpy so it ll be a hair slower the memcpy

3789043
put	get
you can look at the system stored procedures code in ssms and see where things get put

3789050
memcpy	memmove
you can use the memmove memcpy function which is likely to be highly optimized

3789070
width	height
if you want to make sure that the images completely cover each other up you could also set the height and width with the css or you can just make sure that the images are all the same size or that the ones on top are bigger than the ones below top and below dependent on order in the html or z-index

you should use the html 5 event oninput where available firefox 2+ google-chrome safari 4+ opera 10 and internet explorer s onpropertychange event

3789935
onkeyup	onkeydown
for browsers that don t support either event you can fall back to onkeydown with a 0ms timer for the check which is a little better than onkeyup

basically vb.net has support for the err.number property and it works pretty much the same as in vb6 however when upgrading to c# the microsoft.visualbasic.information.err .number is not populated correctly and you should not rely on it

3791180
caliburn	prism
my recomandation if the app is not too big better use mvvm light and after that deppending of your requirements prism last version nroute or caliburn

3791196
stdout	stderr
this is a little tricky if stdout or stderr is the console we need to output with writeconsole

3791196
stdout	stderr
also it really should be using _get_osfhandle to get the handle to stdout and stderr rather than assuming they re assigned to the standard handles but that api doesn t seem to have any pywin binding

3791221
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it is not supported in many browsers only firefox 4 google-chrome 4 and safari 5 currently support it but it allows the connection to the server to remain open and then the server can send a message to the client

3791353
calloc	malloc
the reason that malloc is normally used instead of calloc is because there is a run-time cost for setting the memory to all-zeros and if you re planning to immediately fill the memory with useful data as is common there s no point in zeroing it out first

3791361
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is generated with html css and jquery and works amazingly on firefox safari and google-chrome as you can guess it has major quirks on ie8

3791471
realloc	malloc
since you can pass realloc a null pointer as the previous pointer but malloc is most likely not implemented like that because it would slow down all mallocs and because realloc probably uses malloc

3791562
printf	strtod
since you asked about scanf one thing you should note is that posix requires printf and a subsequent scanf or strtod to reconstruct the original value exactly as long as sufficiently significant digits at least decimal_dig i believe were printed

3791739
google-chrome	safari
or google-chrome or safari comes with web page inspector tool

3791751
maven	pom.xml

3791922
wav	ogg
i m wondering if there s a way to transmit a sound such as a wav or ogg during a call such that the person on the other end can hear it

3791926
width	height
also the reason specifying the width and height within the attribute didn t work is because images are by default in-line elements

3791926
width	height
had you specified display block the image would ve accepted the width and height values

3791926
width	height
i m not sure why firefox doesn t respect the width height attributes but still

3792578
width	height
the zero alert will show an origin of 0 0 and an appropriate width and height 284 141 on 3 gs

3792578
width	height
all other alerts will show 0 0 for width height

3792578
width	height
if you comment out the zero alert line first then firstalert and secondalert will show the correct width and height but third and fourth alerts will show 0 0

3792578
width	height
i have a workaround right now that involves grabbing the width and height the first time i create the alert with an image and placing them in some class variables i ve retained so i can use them later but that s less than ideal assumes all text and images will be same sized and i also need to make sure i call an alert with an image first

3792578
width	height
any thoughts on why i m getting 0 0 for width height on these calls

3792583

3794813
codeigniter	cakephp
i second the idea of using cakephp or codeigniter

3794813
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp

3794834
width	height
the problem is the textblock doesn t have a height width actual height actual width or desired size since i set the height and width to double.nan so the textblock would auto size

3794834
width	height
so is there a way for me to get a height and width measurement based on the text inside the textblock

3794843
post	get
when binding they will first look at the value in the get post request to see if the value is present and after that in the model

3794850
accessor	properties
i know it s often advisable to use the properties accessor and i know it s important to use instead of but

3794995
haskell	scheme
there are a number of curry implementations for scheme -- none can be as elegant as haskell since there functions are always unary functions so everything can be curried

3794995
scheme	racket
but this can of course be implemented in a sufficiently powerful scheme like racket .

3795026
superclass	subclassing
i thought that in a situation whatever method is called on sc will be searched for in subclassing at runtime although they ll be searched in superclass at compile-time

3795026
superclass	subclassing
it turns out as i now think i understand that whatever method is called on sc will be searched for in superclass at both compile-time and run-time unless subclassing has provided a better version of the method

3795061
preferenceactivity	listpreference
i am aware of listpreference but i want to use it outside the context of a preferenceactivity and inside arbitrary views

3795066
implements	extends
all objects inherit from object.prototype and it seems that you intend to use those methods only on function objects it would be safer to extends the function.prototype object or implements the methods as functions that take two parameters

another way to handle orientation changes is instead of overriding onconfigurationchanged overriding oncreate onstart or onresume such that

3795246
portrait	landscape
and then specifying two layouts - one for portrait one for landscape

3795246

3795281
post	get
additionally restricting access methods to http get and post makes your life easier because php has and variables but not and the like

3795281
post	put
however you could send post requests with a special variable specifying the method so to emulate put delete head or options operations

3795281
post	get
when supporting other methods than get and post use to determine the method used and read the data sent along with the request from the special file php input with file_get_contents php input

use inputstream outputstream for it

3795468

3795496
getter	setter
to get values inside progressbar you can subclass it add data function getter and setter and set properties from there - this class will be item renderer

put	get
i m thinking that i have to convert the form data into a get string put that on the end of the url to open and then send that to colorbox

3795631
put	get
depending on where you put that it makes sense that you d get an error

3795667
post	get
then submit the data using get post or ajax

change get to post or ajax

3795667

3795756
spaces	delimiter
that is the application will have as input a data file spaces delimiter text file - with the items encoded as integers and a percentage given as an integer input 2 represents 2

3795776
int	chars
as already said in the comments the main trick here is to convert the ascii chars 0 and 1 to the int 0 and 1 which is done by subtracting the value of 0

3795809
treeviewitem	listboxitem
i created a style for treeviewitem that makes the treeviewitem look and behave just like listboxitem this is really not mandatory - but i preferred it like this beside the fact that the basic style has stretching issues which i had to fix with styling

interpolation	splines
i have a set of points which are interpolation with an unknown method or to be more precise the method is known but it can be one of the several - it can be polynomial interpolation splines simple linear .

3796031
width	height
note that if a rule applies height or width to the body element and thusly the gadget itself that style isn t applied when the stylesheet is switched - you have to set body width and height separately

3796081
int	chars
you can t just treat a memory buffer of int as chars - a string is made up of one byte chars typically int are 4 bytes typically

3796081
int	chars
casting a chars to an int int 0 does not intelligently convert - the int that comes out of that is a decimal 48 not a decimal 0 there is a function atoi that will do that as well as other better ones or the other suggestion to use subtraction

3796101
hash	md5
you can use md5 hash or sha1

3796105
floating-point	fractions
assuming x is a floating-point number x - floor x will get you the fractions part

3796138
pop-up	dialog
one way is to have dialog boxes that pop-up and say things like â œmagic to happen hereâ

3796171
ssl	https
it is overridden in the net https package which is probably what you should be using if you want to do any ssl stuff

3796243
width	height
your change handlers are using the width and height of the mytestcircle usercontrol which haven t been set you should either set them or access size values that have been set

3796248
gif	png
however because no similar function exists for gif files all i can do is covert the gif to either jpeg or png but then i lose the animation

3796346
oncreate	setcontentview
first off you re calling setcontentview tv so you re not actually seeing any views from the xml only the textview you initialized in oncreate

3796374
pop-up	dialog
on stackoverflow when you click stackexchange in the top left it opens a pop-up like dialog

3796405

profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation tools like valgrind and higher end thread profiling are unavailable

3796450
uiview	calayer	uiview	subviews
a faster way to display an updated bitmap may be to just assign the bitmap context to the calayer of a uiview a subviews sized and or transformed to your desired destination rect if required

3796469
width	height
i tried using a textbox inside a viewbox like below but the text-wrapping doesn t work if i don t specify the textblock width and height

3796469
width	height
if i do specify the width and height to the same size as the viewbox obviously zooming doesn t happen

3796516
inherited	properties
but i am not going to use inherited i prefer to use navigation properties instead

3796548
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve written non-plugin extensions for firefox but not safari or google-chrome

3796548
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both restrict extensions much more than firefox does and only allow extensions written in javascript

3796548
google-chrome	safari
i don t know if it s possible to have an extension in safari or google-chrome interact with a browser plugin written in npapi

3796598
yacc	bison
i have a generated scanner from flex which the output from is not consumed by yacc or bison

3796612

3796629
jobs	cron
it is possible that certain web hosts are not allowing wordpress cron jobs

3796629
jobs	cron
plus you have to specify paths not urls in cron jobs

3796630
portrait	landscape
what i m trying to do is manipulate the photo if it s in portrait as opposed to landscape

3796630
width	height
the problem i m experiencing is that when i use javascript to grab a portrait photo s properties when it s loading the height is significantly lower than what it should be and the width is bigger than it should be

3796630
portrait	landscape
so when the function runs through this image the image is considered landscape not portrait and skips over

3796650
put	get
you d have to put some logic into it such that if the filesize gets smaller you would assume it s being replaced and then wait for it to get bigger until it stops growing and stays the same size for some duration

3796708
backslash	double-quotes
in double-quotes backslash-punctuation puts a backslash into the output outside of a certain list of punctuation

3796708
single-quotes	backslash
and in single-quotes everything is literal and backslash doesn t even protect you against a closing single-quote

3796741
jettison	jax-rs
use jackson jax-rs provider instead of alternatives badgerfish jettison which does not do xml-to-json conversion

3796760
width	height
why don t you multiply the x y and width height values by a scaling factor before you draw each circle line

3796782
tiff	png
matplotlib can output png pdf ps eps tiff jpeg pgf and svg files or plot in windows using a variety of toolkits

3796856

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
all browsers i tested this code over years in ie5-ie8 firefox opera google-chrome safari ... are sending mynewvalue to the server

3796936
min	max
i d appreciate it if someone can fix my code or show me.another problem i m having is getting the loop to terminate and do max min calculation within the while loop when the input is equal to 0

3796936
min	max
i put the min max checking outside the master while loop this allowed the input of 0 to be entered in the array

3796974
min	max
you should also make a decision about calculating the min and max as you accumulate the data or in a pass through the data when done

3796987
min	max
you are asking two questions about the strategy for the min max computation and for the loop

3796987
min	max
then wrap your min max detection in the appropriate loop instruction

3796990
post	get
am i obliged to use string type in this method if i want to authorize both post and get

3797072
post	get
i know that both index and create share the same url using get and post respectively but i m not sure how to specify which to use from a url

3797116
put	get
all you need to do differently is put that text in a file and get it s contents before deleting it

3797146
chgrp	chmod
you can use chgrp to add the group and chmod g+w to give write permission

3797160
portrait	landscape
in the orientationchanged method i specified that i want the space to be 50 in portrait and 100 in landscape but when i run the application and switch to landscape mode what happens is that the cells that were already loaded in portrait mode still have a space of 50 between them while those which haven t been loaded in portrait mode and are loaded in landscape mode have a space of 100

3797193
button	checkbox
i ve got a page that has a simple one checkbox form with a submit button for users to mark that item as want to play.

3797193
button	checkbox
given the simplicity i d like to replace it with a single div and graphic of a toggle button or switch or something so that users can click it to mark but not have to bother with the silly single checkbox and submit button which is rather ugly

3797199
ubuntu	debian
if you re running lamp off of debian ubuntu you do want dotdeb in your sources in general and not just for this specific issue

3797217

3797320
maven	pom.xml
however to be run the maven command must be run in the directory where the pom.xml file is located

3797320
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml file describes your project and it is the basis of maven 2

3797320
maven	pom.xml
this plugin is the only case of maven usage without a pom.xml file

3797326
portrait	landscape
if the ipad is in landscape mode the splitviewcontroller still thinks it s in portrait mode for some reason and the frame for the root and detail view controller are wrong

3797326
portrait	landscape
during the first call the frame rect is 320 x 980 for the root controller if the ipad is rotated to portrait and then back to landscape mode the frame rect becomes 320 x 724

3797326
viewdidload	viewwillappear

3797421
rar	zip
is there a way to open rar zip 7z in as3

3797445
width	height
once you use a for width or height i think the browser tries to preserve the aspect ratio regardless of the value for the other dimension

3797453
folder	directory
it s found in your the bin folder of your jre installation directory

3797512
width	height
the percentages in height and width attributes of an image works with the container it is contained in

3797512
width	height
so to achieve the fluid effect just trying putting in a container around the img and give image height and width 100

3797512
width	height
and now you should be changing the height and width of the container in percentages

3797512
width	height
with this your image will achieve a height and width of 500 100

3797531
margin	height
|f| f.write barcode.to_png height 100 margin 25 xdim 100

3797593

3797612
udp	tcp
i suggest using tcp for transferring files it solves all the trouble you will have to solve yourself when using udp

3797624
post	get
you could change your code so that the post returned a redirect to a get for the pdf

3797637
google-chrome	firefox
the image upload works perfect in google-chrome and firefox however when it comes to ie 8

3797708
profiling	benchmarking
i do not really wish to profiling because i was wanting to do many different small benchmarking on different simple functions

3797736
client-side	server-side
since javascript is client-side it runs on the browser and c# asp.net is server-side it runs on the server inside iis it will always be triggered prior to any javascript function runs

3797747
ant	pom.xml
the ant build.xml has references to a few pom.xml files

3797749
nswindow	nsresponder
for example nswindow and nsview both inherit from nsresponder so are they siblings

3797770
switching	screens
but is it likely that the user will be in a single activity of your application for x seconds without ever switching screens or letting the device go into sleep

3797770
onresume	onpause
i imagine it would be sufficient to update the timer flag in oncreate onpause and onresume

3797784
hide	show
then there should be the other part with read less to swap links back again and to hide readmore_holder but since i cannot even get the alert to show up i m kinda lost

3797805
hide	show
that way you can just show it when you hide the text instead of recreating it

3797811

debian	linux
take a debian gnu linux minimal install

3797894
int	double
c++ doesn t have such kind of automatic casting facilities even if you could build a class that mimics such behavior by having an int and a float a double would be even better iirc it lets you get up to 170

3797900
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
as for using manualresetevent or autoresetevent instead - you could but personally i prefer using the monitor methods unless i need some of the other features of wait handles such as atomically waiting for any all of multiple handles

3797905
debian	linux
can drupal run on a debian linux vserver with 256mb

3797997
int	chars
it seems that gcc considers chars and number literals as int by default

3798043
udp	tcp
boost.asio is a very good c++ portable socket library which provides both tcp and udp sockets

3798070
super	abstract	super	implements
as implements currently abstract classes are a convenient mechanism for abstracting common attributes of classes out to super classes

3798081
int	chars
you can specify chars literals of type chars int chars in c++ with specific numbers using octal or hexadecimal notation

3798081
octal	decimal
for example 012 is octal 12 or decimal 10

3798084
mouseleave	mouseenter
the strange thing is that there are two mouseenter events on sibling elements without a mouseleave event in between

3798084
mouseleave	mouseenter
one idea is to register the mouseenter and mouseleave event instead of using hover

3798144
public	protected
by not using public protected or private the grade enum has the default access level - meaning only other classes in the same package can use it

3798147
maven	pom.xml
i am relatively new to maven i actually wanted to know how to build the renamed pom.xml

3798165

3798317
put	get
if you put in x as the scheme you ll get x www.python.org

3798343
children	parent
in theory if you know for a fact that deleting a parent object will automatically also mean deleting all its children objects then cascading delete on the link between child and parent table might make sense

3798375
superclass	subclassing
when a subclassing does not need to override anything in its superclass s implementation of a method it s totally useless for the subclassing to look like it s overriding that method.

3798375
superclass	subclassing
so to summarize a subclassing should define __init__ if and only if it needs to do something else before or after or both before and after the superclass s own initializer very rarely it may want to do something instead not delegate to the superclass initializer at all but that s hardly ever good practice

3798375
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing s __init__ body has just a call to the superclass s __init__ with exactly the same parameters in the same order expunge the subclassing s __init__ from your code just as you would do for any other similarly-redundant method

3798380
kerberos	ntlm
if your kerberos fail it will automatically default to ntlm you don t have to do anything special

3798393

direct3d	directx
it s not hard to search for directx tutorials or direct3d tutorials in google or your favourite search engine to find these contents

3798485
inherited	subclassing
i would consider moving away from either an abstract inherited pattern or the concrete base pattern if you re looking to tie distinct subclassing behaviors to the objects based on their respective child class

3798504

3798638
innodb	myisam
proviso the above is true for both commonly-used mysql storage engines myisam and innodb

3799842
inherited	subclassing
though i m still not sure if it s the right way to solve this problem i ve decided on using single-table inherited so that i can easily get a list of all the services that another model has_many of since each subclassing of service is also a service i can call model_instance.services to get them all

3799899
min	max
the sliders render on the page but on first click they go to either min or max

3799958

the api i am using for add record is filewriter for search operation it is bufferedreader and for deleting a record is bufferedreader and printwriter

3799959
graphviz	gephi
i previously recommended graphviz but thought i should add another recommendation now that i have used gephi a newer tool than a lot of the stuff here

3799969
min	max
but what i really want is not the max and min price but the price_id associated with the price

3799989
put	get
im trying to do something here but that error shows up i really have no idea how to get it done right i tried to put all the variables in the figure.h as glfloat instead of just float and the same error keeps appearing any idea

pthreads	fork
pthreads fork openmp mpi

3800000
crossover	mutation
various crossover mutation function

3800021
min	max
but which price_id do you want the one from the row with the max price or the one from the row with the min price

3800021
min	max
instead if you want the price_id of the max and min prices what you want are two rows the row such that no other row exists with the same cust_id and a higher price and the row such that no other row exists with the same cust_id and a lower price

3800028
for-loop	loops
this can be done in one line there s no need for a loops be it a for-loop or an apply

im on linux platform ubuntu so dont have any flash developer tools

3800057
udp	tcp
i can make udp connections easily learned via udpecho but i can t find as good sample as udpecho for tcp

3800061
getter	setter
the reason for this is because when new core tables are added to a framework they could be used with a generic data access object for accessing the corresponding fields getter setter via __call in the parent add insert and update delete without writing a class for each without requiring the coder to write a class and then having to inspect it or writing custom code generators for the various types of tables

3800086
int	chars
my goal is to find and replace some chinese chars across all files they are csv in a directory with int as per a csv file i have

3800160
octal	decimal	ostringstream	std
try to convert the unsigned int to std string into a decimal hexadecimal octal etc form and then concatenate you can do that using std ostringstream or boost lexical_cast or fix the bug in other ways you see fit

3800174
folder	directory
for example say you ve got iis pointed at the root of some directory but inside that directory is a folder with another app in it and you have a vdir pointed to that app - well you may indeed run in to this problem as asp.net will parse the web.config at the root first and then the web.config for the application the vdir points to

3800184
width	height
when you resize the browser window the width and height change thus your relative positions change and break your layout

3800186
for-loop	loops
another btw you can pass the collection to fields_for like so and it will automatically loops over it and you can skip the for-loop

3800190
cpu	processors
i don t know if you re i o bound or cpu bound but if your cpu utilization is very high you may want to use threading with each thread operating on a different file so with a quad core processors you d be reading writing 4 different files simultaneously

3800198
for-loop	loops
it has a for-loop that prints output each time it executes loops

3800211
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	memmove	strcpy	memmove
to copy the contents of one array to another you would have to use a library function like memcpy memmove strcpy etc

3800296
udp	tcp
list of tcp and udp port numbers

3800300
udp	tcp
bonjour is just a way to announce services â not a replacement for tcp udp

3800300
udp	tcp
the services still use tcp or udp

3800308
client-side	server-side
if for some reason option a is unacceptable then you d have do do b procedurally either server-side in a stored procedure or client-side in your client program

3800320
post	get
it is possible to get set the applicationame property at run time however according to the below msdn post it is not recommended as the property is not thread safe if multiple users are creating accounts for different applications at the same time it may not correctly allocate the applicationname per user

3800326
children	parent
so each row has a parent except for the root row and each row has children except for leaf rows

3800331
portrait	landscape
you can use 44 if you know you re in portrait not landscape in which the height of the navbar is less than 44

3800334
postgresql	mysql
you can also use recursive sql queries with other brands of database postgresql but mysql does not currently support this feature

3800394
console.readline	gets
if you press enter which is actually combination of 2 characters - carriage return and line feed on console.read it only gets carriage return character and line feed gets to your next console reading method - console.readline in getinput method

3800405
int	chars
if they are int being generated you can utilize itoa and simply append that result to a chars array of sufficient size with strcat

3800429
subtract	add
i personally try to avoid playing directly with the time value for reasons when trying to add or subtract days weeks etc

3800456
regexp-grammars	xml-twig
does someone know if david is planning to update the book or if there are similar books or web pages where the new parsing modules like xml-twig regexp-grammars etc are explained

3800494
google-chrome	safari
safari 5 google-chrome 6 webkit browsers seem to allow sizes up to but not including 1 000 000 pixels after which the text does not render at all

3800497
children	parent
one advantage in doing so is that geometry managers such as grid and pack default to managing children in their parent

3800526
setinterval	clearinterval
for repeated events you can use setinterval and you can set setinterval to a variable and use the variable to stop the interval with clearinterval

3800549
udp	tcp
yes you should plan for the likelihood that any activity over ports udp and tcp is being monitor and potentially blocked depending on settings

3800552
hash	salt
send a link to the user with a query string that contains their email or better email id if you generate them and a salt hash of their email

3800553
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
i m guessing that option 1 increases the memory by the size of a pointer so 32 64-bits and creates accessor methods assuming i declare properties synthesize and then requires releasing the ivar in dealloc and setting it to nil in viewdidunload .

3800553
uiview	subviews
what about for a custom subclass of uiview that has 5 subviews

3800568
udp	tcp

accelerometer	gyroscope
i have gyroscope + accelerometer data at each time period t

3800588
width	height
this will not change the height width of the sprite so i m not sure it will help you

3800588
width	height
but in case you control the code that does the scrolling you could calculate the size of your object considering its origin is always 0 0 by getting it bounds and adding x + width and y + height

3800604
put	get
i m trying to make a program using the bfs algorithm so i put every node in a queue and once every level is in the queue i start comparing it to another node to see if they are equal or not however the problem i m having is that elements in my queue are being modified so when i do the dequeue i never get to an answer and i m getting a stack overflow

3800617
dictionary	map
to me it looks like a list of tuples but at the same time it feels like a map dictionary

3800676
width	height
so imagine the height of the cell row is 50px and width 100px i would like the line to be width 100px and it to be at 25px height in the row cell

the yacc and bison implementations from what i hear are pretty good

3800689
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream oss

3800689
int	double	unsigned	short
you might reasonably wonder why c++ doesn t provide for x in short int long long long float double unsigned short etc

3800689
int	chars
further chars is the 8-bit int type so how could the compiler know whether to append a single chars with that ascii value a for 65 or an ascii representation of the numeric ascii value 65

3800689
int	chars
currently it doesn t handle any int so treating it as a single ascii chars isn t confusing

3800689
ostream	ostringstream
it s also good practice to minimise dependencies some small but perhaps significant percentage of translation units using string may not currently have to include and hence spend time parsing and hence ostream etc and in general cyclic dependencies are a code smell and frustrate testability string depends on ostringstream depends on string...

3800773
treeviewitem	menuitem
treeviewitem tvi sender as menuitem .parent as contextmenu .parent as popup .placementtarget as treeviewitem

3800774
i2c	spi
i2c spi etc

3800784
nunit	moles
unfortunately i am having a problem with nunit integrating with the latest version of microsoft moles and also nunit is conflicting with a third party library appears log4net related

3800784
nunit	mstest
all of the version issues and compatibility problems with nunit at least for me is steering me towards choosing mstest as the framework for the project though i may keep the dual mode option

3800784
nunit	mstest
another plus for mstest is that i can still use most of nunit asserts with

3800823
textarea	pre
the simplest tips i can give you is to set a css attribute for your textarea white-space pre so that when it gets submitted all line breaks get sent as well

3800851
width	height
your mileage with the css may vary depending on the css for the rest of the site but 100 width height should do it on a basic page

3800854
scheme	racket
i am trying to develop an editor in scheme racket passing lists into the structures

3800857
folder	directory
you are testing whether is a file but you apparently want to rename directory unless you have non-directory files named folder

3800883
nunit	mstest
i have used both mstest and nunit the first more than the latter and i can t say i noticed any big differences between the two of them regarding speed don t get me wrong the difference might be there i just haven t noticed it

3800915
unix	bsd
historically there were two possible signal delivery behaviors the bsd behavior syscalls are automatically restarted when interrupted by a signal and the unix system v behavior syscalls return -1 with errno set to eintr when interrupted by a signal

3800919
uitableview	uisearchbar
for example the uisearchbar within uitableview like of the iphone address book app scrolls with the the names

3800945

when you touch some memory that s not resident not physically in ram the os will bring the entire page of data off disk and into memory

3801076
paramiko	subprocess
instead of wrapping around a subprocess you d likely be better off using something like paramiko

3801116

3801729
udp	tcp
all you are doing is very poorly re-implementing tcp the only reason to use udp should be for 1-to-many transfers or a constantly running enterprise service bus middleware

3801729
http	spdy	udp	tcp
i would recommend investigating existing file transfer technologies such as fsp udp http tcp spdy optimised http or for integration with other communications rolling your own above an existing message-orientated-middleware system such as jboss or 0mq

i am hosing multiple projects on the same local server and was wondering if it was possible to put the rewrite rules for each project in the httpd.conf file rather than in the .htaccess for each project

what i need is if my anchor tag is near to end of the browser window and there s not enough space for the ui dialog window to appear the ie shows it down bringing the vertical bar the user has to scroll a lil bit to see the ui dialog this works fine in firefox and google-chrome as mentioned earlier

3802209
getter	setter
the reason you might want to use a getter setter is because it conceals the implementation

3802209
getter	setter
you won t have to rewrite all of your code if you are using getter setter in case the implementation does change because those members can continue to work

3802209
getter	setter
as for a class using setter and getter on itself that may depend on the particulars

3802209
getter	setter
in the cases where a class is normally instantiated the class should use the member values directly for its own members private or otherwise and its parent classes if they are protected and only use getter setter in the case that those members are private to the parent class

3802209
getter	setter
in the case of an abstract type which will usually not contain any implementation at all it should provide pure virtual getter and setter and use only those in the methods it does implement

3802215
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome it appears as a horizontal range with no styles in opera as vertical range with no styles

3802218
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to achieve a gradient + text shadow effect in google-chrome safari using css text-shadow and a combination of text-shadow and background-image -webkit-gradient see example blw

3802226
getter	setter
and it seems you do i also prefer to avoid the uglyness and weightyness of getter setter

3802226
getter	setter
as you speak about a class using its own getter setter in its own implementation functions then you should consider writing non-friend non-member functions where possible

3802257
for-loop	arrays
create for-loop and iterate trough arrays how else would you do it

3802272
put	get
i have previously asked how to put a datepicker in a grid and i did not get a response

3802297
getter	setter
willingness to use getter setter within class member implementation is the canary in the mine telling that your class is growing unreasonably

3802322
hide	show
assuming that you want to show hide certain item based upon the id

3802369
inherited	properties
jaxb will actually handle the overriden method when properties xmlaccessortype is used in parent but as a result in output xml data jaxb probably will also generate additionally in the root tag attributes such as xsi type b and xmlns xsi because we defined a new type b inherited from a

3802369
inherited	subclassing
to produce xml from derived subclassing but w o the xsi and xmlns attributes added by jaxb i used temporary trick which i am trying to exchange for something nicer i did override of method in child in parent overriden method i had to use xmlelement but i did not added inherited class type to the jaxb.newinstance call

3802376
listadapter	simpleadapter
arrayadapter does but listadapter or simpleadapter don t

3802386
int	chars
i want to put validations on int and chars textboxes

3802392
getter	setter
it seems most people didn t read your question properly the question is concerning whether or not class methods accessing its own class members should use getter and setter

3802392
getter	setter
i wouldn t bother using getter and setter for accessing a class own members

3802392
getter	setter
i only use getter and setter for accessing my own class members when i am expecting to change the implementation in the near future if i m writing a suboptimal code that can be written quickly but plans to optimize it in the future that might involve radically changing the data structure used

3802392
getter	setter
conversely i don t use getter and setter before i already have the plan

3802392
getter	setter
in particular i don t use getter and setter in expectation of changing things i m very likely never going to change anyway

3802392
public	protected
i use protected members conservatively and they are considered a public interface

3802392
getter	setter
however even for public interface i usually still avoid having direct getter and setter methods as they are often indicative of bad oo design every oo programmers in any language should read why getter and setter methods are evil

3802402
ant	pom.xml
i have to add a lazy true to a property i have add a ant task to intrument the class to enable hibernate to make it lazy in my pom.xml

3802414
getter	setter
getter and setter for protected members makes as much sense as for public.

3802414
getter	setter
getter and setter for private members is rarely a net benefit though

3802414
public	protected
in enterprise environments and for public protected member data those benefits can be substantial enough to justify get set methods a logging function may end up having millions of lines of code depedent on it and hundreds or thousands of libraries and apps for which a change to a header may trigger recompilation

i wouldn t use yield at all in lisp scheme

dotnetzip	sharpziplib
use a library like dotnetzip or sharpziplib to get to its contents these libraries can accept a stream or byte array so you should be able to pass your xap byte array straight into them to extract the files

so i get all the records from the objects table with type post and join it with postmeta to get the post metadata

3802853
post	get
then i query postobject to get all the objects attached to this post and comments to get all the comments

3802853
post	get
i would need to join these tables at least post postmeta postobject and not to mention an users table to get all post by a specific user for example

phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
what you seem to be looking for is a database frontend like phpmyadmin or sqlbuddy not a php framework

3802885
comparator	comparable
java what is the difference between implementing comparable and comparator

3802885
comparator	comparable
difference between comparable interface and comparator interface and where to use

3802904
comparator	comparable
comparator allows to implement external comparison logic which can be applied to objects that are not comparable or that require different logic from their default comparison logic

3802904
comparator	comparable
for example you have collections.sort list which can sort only lists of objects that implement comparable while there is another method - collections.sort list comparator by which you can sort any list

3802912
public	protected
depends on the visibility of the ivar public private protected

3802951
unix	bsd

this post about di in scala will be able to help you to get going with guice

3803038
comparator	comparable
in conceptual sense a comparator is the comparison operator the logic used to determine whether a comparable is greater lesser than another comparable

3803050
gif	ico	gif	png	png	ico
ya it can be gif or png too but standard is ico

3803051
post	get
typically you would handle that as a post not a get and read the xml from the request-stream or there are helpers to let you do this

google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it sends more than one requests to servlet and finally there is exception in servlet and it doesn t work

3803395
google-chrome	firefox
it displays correctly in firefox and ie but in google-chrome it displays correctly on page load and when accessing other links that have the scroller on

3803416
folder	dir
another trick to reduce the first 5 minutes of cleaning could be to move the old build dir to a temp folder on the same disk and then use another background task to delete the old build dir when the main build completes could be a nightly cleanup task

3803420
subtract	add
just subtract 1 and add 1 afterwards

3803447

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
graphics view provides single-line printing through its rendering functions qgraphicsscene render and qgraphicsview render

3803626
sortedmap	sortedset
sortedset or sortedmap provided the keys are unique

ilist	icollection
but visualcollection does only implement icollection and not ilist or any supported interface and visualcollection is selead so i can t implement ilist on my own

3803663
google-chrome	safari
as can be seen in the settings tab class abaa and class abaf i am not able to put the height 90 . it works in mozilla and internet explorer but in google-chrome and safari - both important to my project - it does not work

3803695

3803725
width	height
but the span elements do not expand to the width and height that i set

3803749
folder	directory
but i can t figure out why the actual result adds com masatosan conf directory to the destination folder so it looks like

3803761
button	checkbox
click a few checkbox and press a button and they were done without having to rekey a lot of information

3803768
onresize	onload
i would recommend using a library like prototype or jquery and handle the onload and onresize events

3803768
width	height
then by by screen width and height you can calculate how many divs you need

3803768
width	height
this will probably be something like width 60 height 60 or something..

3803771
width	height
that should make the span elements expand to your desired width height

3803814
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in the touchesbegan and touchesmoved method check for the touch and accordingly change the images of the imageviews

3803908
mouseover	mouseout
this is still a problem because mouseover and mouseout fire when entering leaving a child

3803908
mouseleave	mouseenter
however .hover uses mouseenter and mouseleave which don t suffer the same problem and will eliminate your vibration problem

3803915
hide	show
if you do not want to depend on ajax complete to show or hide your loader you can put your results on a div layer which covers the loader

3803972
multibyte	htmlspecialchars
the default charset for htmlspecialchars is iso-8859-1 as of php v5.4 the default charset was turned to utf-8 which might explain why things go haywire when it meets multibyte characters

3803978
folder	directory
try writing the file to another directory outside of the debug folder

3804012
versioning	upgrade
so if the purpose is indeed to upgrade non-well-formed xml to a well-formed versioning i d suggest to look for other tools such as perl awk or any other simple search replace solution that operates on plain text and could just add the missing namespace declaration to the document element

3804023
super	implements
it looks like the startup function which is implements in datagrid s super class _grid grid.js calls a function called render which i believe is what actually render s the contents of the grid

supposedly actioncontroller base.helpers acts like a proxy for accessing helpers outside views

3804090
jtabbedpane	jsplitpane
you could roll your own essentially with nested jsplitpane and jtabbedpane and a lot of time

3804117
kde	gnome
you don t have to install gnome or kde

3804121
width	height
make a canvas that can fit 4 images covering an area of the product of the two largest dimensions height maxy 2 and width maxx 2

3804167
textarea	pre
using the css white-space property with a value set to pre any white-space in the element should appear exactly as it does in the textarea

3804237
move	drag
i have a custom canvas control which sits inside a scrollviewer - i have implemented drag drop and move for items on the canvas and overridden measureoverride so that when i move an item around on the canvas its size reflects the changes so if i move the item beyond the visible portion of the canvas it will resize to accommodate the move item and scrollbars will show appropriately

3804268
selecteditem	selectedindex
not sure about this but it could be that the selecteditem gets updated after selectedindex

3804297
put	get
objective-c++ is to put it bluntly what you get when you add the objective-c runtime and syntax to c++

3804366
int	boolean	int	chars
you should store your values as whatever type they are int boolean chars and your times as either date or int containing the unix timestamp whatever fits your application better

3804383
folder	directory
i d like to exclude the contents of several folder from the build but keep the blank directory itself

3804443
hide	show
if i understand your question correctly that the image show until you click save it looks like you need to hide the image in your css

3804505
ubuntu	linux
i am reading it using java 1.6.0_14 on linux ubuntu 32 bit and get the following exception

3804547
udp	tcp
the tutorial presents tcp and udp variants of a simple chat program written in 4 languages

3804647
for-loop	arrays
after that all you need to do is load the unique arrays phone numbers into a for-loop and inside it load array#1 lines into a for-loop

3804656
opencv	emgucv
we are working in a project involving the use of emgucv and in particoular the svm functions of opencv and we have a problem using mono on a ubuntu platform and we don t have this problem on windows

3804674
width	height
in this case i have a div tag which needs to have 100 height but a width of only 980px

3804674
width	height
when you apply a width to it the 100 height fails when you remove the postion fixed and top + right lines the container sits in the right place but has no height at all and the app won t work if the height is fixed

3804700
super	self
basically python never injects names into a namespace eg some languages inject a magic this variable into methods while python forces you to explicitly define the equivalent â self â as the first argument of methods and since a class is just another namespace nothing like eg values in its super classes gets injected into it

3804700
inherited	properties
when you ve got a class b which inherited from another class a and you try to look up a properties on b â b.foo â it first checks to see if foo is in b s namespace and if it isn t it goes on to check a s namespace and so on

3804704
put	get
you put the new values and you get the others value by querying the table you re updating

3804729

3804854
width	height
on the site i m working on i have a fancybox that triggers when the page loads that displays the contents of a hidden but for some reason any options such as height width etc are getting ignored

3804857
hash	md5
using a md5 hash as a key you could eventually get two queries that result in the same md5 hash

3804909
ienumerable	iqueryable
the type iqueryable inherits from the non-generic ienumerable so this extension method doesn t seem to serve any purpose

3804940
gif	png
have you tried with different images and different image formats gif jpg png

3804940
gif	png
maybe gif or png is not supported by your php version

3804998
ienumerable	iqueryable
since the interface iqueryable inherits from ienumerable why not

3804998
ienumerable	iqueryable
so casting an iqueryable as an ienumerable will cause the second extension method to be called where it will be treated as an ienumerable

3805029
min	max
the variables have different min and max values

3805038
strlen	strcpy
all string support depends on functions in the c standard library such as strlen strcpy and so on

3805042
folder	directory
note i m uncertain if adding subfolders separately will maintain the folder subtree of the parent directory in the ctf archive in the same way as option #1 would

3805114
memcached	ncache
could you use one of the other distributed caching setups memcached sharedcache ncache

3805122
suppressfinalize	finalizer
when done that way the suppressfinalize call removes the object from the finalizer queue turning it into a regular managed object that can easily be garbage collected

3805130
width	height
is it when it can read the width and height

3805130
width	height
because i am defining the width and height in the css for the image to force it to be a certain size

3805158
switching	screens
you cannot switching back to another desktop like the screens saver one until you login

3805164
moq	moles
one can still use moq alongside moles

3805164
moq	moles
it s actually preferred to use a framework like moq for stubbing and mocking when the code can allow for it leaving only moles for the stuff moq can t isolate sealed classes non-virtual methods private members etc

3805167
cgpoint	cgsize
ios uses core graphics for drawing so instead of nspoint and nssize you should be using cgpoint and cgsize

3805167
cgpoint	cgsize
basically try solving your problems by using cgpoint and cgsize

3805170
client-side	server-side
take note of ck s comment that for efficiency this type of piecemeal client-side operation is not as good as doing the heavy lifting server-side

3805199
integer	unsigned
so the value of x a 4-bit unsigned integer is 8 while the values of y z and w are 0

3805201
ubuntu	linux
linux friends how do you guys get a file timestamp in the resolution of milliseconds in ubuntu

3805253
width	height
getimagesize dosent get the kb size just width and height which is not what im looking for

3805258
portrait	landscape
if i switch the figures around so that some are portrait and some are landscape all kinds of weird things happen

3805258
width	height
i ve tried every combination of figures i can think of systematically swapping width and height between paired values one at a time and none of these combinations work

3805353
lisp	scheme
by the way i only solved that problem after asking a similar question is there an equivalent to lisp s â œruntimeâ primitive in scheme

3805395
superclass	subclassing
in the database i think that the problem is solved one table per class person client provider and agent table and a foreign key from the primary key of the subclassing table to the primary key of the superclass table

3805435
post	get
the client app communicates with the server through post and get

3805480
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
you have to use a combination of the mousemove mousedown and mouseup events

this will get all the things in database as post but i don t know how to add the attachment and its post meta

3805625
google-chrome	firefox
the one built-in to google-chrome is ok but not great and firebug for firefox is excellent

3805671
disk	ram
it seems that the only limitation to how many records you can have per table is the available size on disk and probably ram if you re going to want to run certain reports on that data

3805702
post	get
whenever i get a new client i simply copy all of the code over change 3 lines in a config file and then all of their styles data is taken out of the database or from uploads they post to the server from their own admin area

3805736
hide	show
i have an image in a page and in the onmouseover event of that image i will call a javascript function to show a tooltip and in the onmouseout of the image i will call a method to hide the tooltip.now i found that when i place the cursor on the image its calling the method to show the tooltip div.and if i move the mouse within the image its calling the onmouseout event even if i am not out of the image .how can i stop this

3805746
gridex	janus
i ve been using janus gridex control in hierarchical mode and i want all rows to be expanded

would be better to load the image as hidden and then just show hide when needed

3805907
textarea	pre
there is a pre element over the textarea

3805907
textarea	pre
yourregex would be a method to match the regex and return some parsed content to the pre allowing you to customize the appearance of the textarea that is actually an element over it

3805931
mouseup	mousedown
if you want to register the event sequence only if the mouse is stationary record the position on mousedown and only do your actions on mouseup if the position changed significantly

3805950
superclass	subclassing
you can t use a superclass to call a function defined in a subclassing

3805950
superclass	subclassing
by definition a subclassing has access to all non-private methods defined in the superclass but a superclass does not have access to functions in a subclassing

3805970
sorting	filtering
i must render all data and write all possible actions such as sorting by columns filtering deletion edit etc for each of this i need

3805986
ant	cruisecontrol
since ant is failing returning a failure error code why isn t cruisecontrol picking up on it

3806004
google-chrome	safari
the timer is there for google-chrome and safari because in those browsers the native browser behaviour that selects the whole element seems to trigger after the focus event thereby overriding the effect of the selection code unless postponed until after the focus event

3806027
google-chrome	firefox
i got most things working with firefox google-chrome and ie apart from the fact that fancybox isn t validating all the ie-fixes as green but that s an issue for another time

3806079
sudo	passwd
for ordinary users to run a command as a different user without reentering a passwd even from a script use the sudo 8 command

hash	salt
otherwise you could hash the username + salt and hand it to user as a session id in a cookie and store that session id into the datastore

3806148
post	get	post	put	put	get
to put it this way you can do a subselect to get the specific day of the week but in your code you would have to check the day again to group post per day

3806170
folder	directory
the file in the resources folder is not moving to the test results out directory and is not being found by the test code

getter	setter
control the enabled disabled property by binding to getter and setter on the data you re working with

3806463
folder	directory
there is one caveat make sure you set up your web server to not allow serving of the contents of the .svn folder in each directory or the equivalent for your vcs of choice if there is one

3806491
int	boolean	int	chars
the reason std vector bool is nonconforming is that it pulls tricks under the covers in an attempt to optimize for space instead of storing a full chars or int for every bool 1 taking up at least 8 times the space on platforms with 8-bit chars it packs the boolean and stores them as individual bits inside say chars in its internal representation

3806533
serializable	deserialization
in .net you can create strongly-typed configuration sections using build-in base classes that do a lot of the mundane heavy lifting with respect to xml serializable deserialization schema validation type-casting etc.

3806633
webclient	webrequest
the answer would be to craft a custom webrequest that looks like it comes from ie 8 instead of the .net webclient

3806659
put	get
but if i put the line #import pfletsmove pfmoveapplication.h in the app delegate i get the following error pfletsmove pfmoveapplication.h file not found

additionally stderr can be stdout which indicates that the stderr data from the applications should be captured into the same file handle as for stdout

3806862
stdout	stderr
stdin stderr and stdout are named parameters for the popen method

3806872
xlib	xcb
how to get top-level window position relative to root window whole screen using plain ol xlib or brand new xcb

3806884
x86	64bit
to fix this problem either get a 64bit version of that library or what is easier set the target platform to x86 for all your executables

3806884
x86	64bit
using x86 on a 64bit platform usually should not have any noticeable performance hit

3806898

sorting	grouping
and if i can brings them grouping after sorting on other fields

3806954
folder	directory
...also if you re keeping people out of your application directory which you seem to indicate is your web root you should really re-design that if your intent is to keep people out of that folder it s a security risk

3806957
filesystems	ntfs
to improve performance of ntfs or any other filesystems you choose don t put all files into single folder but group files by first n characters of their file names or also by extension

3806977
mockito	easymock
what am i not seeing understanding that causes so many projects easymock mockito etc. to recommend refactoring

3807081
google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in firefox but not in ie or google-chrome why is this

3807115
actionscript	mxml
with flash builder you have to learn both mxml and actionscript

3807115
actionscript	mxml
mxml is for the declarative layout of the gui and actionscript is the programming language

3807163
put	get
i am trying to get the input of a user from std cin and put it to an array

3807186
octal	decimal
in java i believe that 0 is officially a decimal literal so a more accurate expression would be while in c++ 0 is technically an octal literal i think

3807255
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m developing an iphone app where i have a uitabbarcontroller that has a uinavigationcontroller for each tabbaritem

3807259
width	height
you could try leaving it at 100 x 100 but add a wrapper tag with a width of 980 and a 100 height

3807259
width	height
important after your width height it helps override other css that is interfering including inline css

3807263
int	boolean
std string compare does not return a boolean value -- it returns an int

3807263
cout	cin	istream	ostringstream	ostream	ostringstream	ostream	istream
this page is very useful for using cin cout istream ostream istringstream ostringstream

3807290

either a short-lived tcp ip connection or -- particularly if both apps are on the same host -- a simple udp packet

3807446
move	drag
on iphone map is displayed correctly but you cant move it drag and move and the navigation controller widget if you like does not appear

3807462

3807502
int	double
i know that it s said when passing a variable of any integral type like int double long double etc to a function

3807505
memcpy	malloc
does microsoft visual studio i m using 2008 sp1 offer any way to override standart c functions such as malloc memcpy

3807505
memcpy	malloc
how should i build my project so that the compiler uses my overriden versions of malloc and memcpy routines instead of those provided i assume they share the same syntax

3807518
width	height
i m basically going to be having the image tag contain an encoded string that stores the url to take a screenshot of and the width height of the image to show

3807518
width	height
really i need to fetch url width height in a single get request

3807546
inline	inlining
if however the callee cannot be inline if it s third-party api code for example then the compiler cannot perform this kind of inlining and indeed passing a pointer might be more efficient though it s unlikely you ll find library that functions that take an integer pass by reference unless it s so that the callee can modify the caller s value which introduces a whole different set of issues

3807563
getter	setter
of course the problem with this is you have to re-write all the getter and setter you want for the entity an issue that i ve had to deal with that is annoying unfortunately that is a bit of a java language issue

3807587
width	height
you can set the loader s width and height after load but you ll have to mask it if you have things hanging off the stage in the loaded swf

3807593
actualheight	actualwidth
you can data-bind some labels to actualwidth and actualheight to verify what s happening

3807618
free	malloc
though how malloc free are linked to the os in the two static libs may be problematic

3807618
realloc	calloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
i assume library.lib also redefines realloc free calloc etc

3807619
versioning	upgrade
is there a way to upgrade the versioning that teamcity uses or do i need to downgrade the versioning we are using on our workstations

3807627
memcpy	malloc
is it possible to change the build and link process so that you replace the implementation of memcpy and malloc

3807635
int	chars
c++ convert int and string to chars

3807635
int	chars
the score is stored in an int variable but the library im using for the game needs an array of chars for its text outputting for my scoreboard

3807635
int	chars
so how do i turn an int into an array of chars

3807656
int	chars	ostringstream	std
you can use an std ostringstream to convert the int to an std string then use std string c_str to pass the string as a chars array to your function

3807663
memcpy	malloc
you can build your own version of the visual c++ c runtime library crt which contains memcpy and malloc functions among others from the source code that can be usually found in program files microsoft visual studio 9.0 vc crt

3807677
post	get
i get the following error i cant post the image

3807678
serializable	deserialization
because they may point to references other than the current object reference and because the deserialized object is a new reference in what is probably a different runtime event handler references from the serializable object are useless on deserialization because the reference will no longer point to the expected object in the new runtime s heap

3807688
min	max
y axis has 3 fields - min max avg values for time frame and x axis has task type

3807707
put	get
if userdao bean is defined in xml it works fine but when i put repository annotation and remove bean declaration i get the following exception

it is as if apache is trying unsuccessfully to communicate with the cherrypy program if i put the line in httpd.conf and completely unaware of it when i put the line in .htaccess

3807812
mockito	easymock
when you have complex business logic in your finder class you may want to mock the entitymanager - using a mocking framework like easymock or mockito - in order to unit test that logic

3807884
hash	salt
i m using the following hash with a salt that says unique

3807884
hash	salt
if it s just a random string i think it s better to change that so does zend have a random string generation function that could be used to salt this sort of hash element

3807887
google-chrome	firefox
i ran across a similar issue that only shows up in more recent versions of firefox - google-chrome and ie work fine for me

3807952
uilabel	uitextview
and can i get rid of all those controls so the uiwebview works like an advanced uilabel or uitextview

3807968
superclass	subclassing
an exception is if your class subclassing or implements a protocol you need to actually #import the header file that defines the protocol or superclass

3807968
superclass	subclassing
this is because when a third class imports the subclassing s header file it needs the declaration for the superclass prototype and you don t want to have to import all the superclass prototypes header files

3807996
client-side	server-side
no it s not possible as the client-side code can never know about that kind of server-side implementation detail

3808075
accessor	properties
however this also sometimes forces me to provide accessor for properties i wouldn t need normally and i think most people on so agree that accessor are usually a sign of bad design

3808075
accessor	properties
however i had to expose the internal state of the entity namely the accessor for all of its properties so that the renderer could read it

3808075
getter	setter
even great object-oriented programmers use objects with getter setter sometimes especially for something like an entity object

3808075
getter	setter
maybe getter setter are not all evil

3808116
nofollow	noindex
i also have a noindex nofollow meta tag on all my website s pages

3808143
width	height
if they re on the same server the obvious approach would be to store the target url width and height in a database and simply pass a randomly-generated record identifier in the query string

3808156
super	abstract
for better maintainability i would like to have the shared attributes in an abstract super type or something like that

3808161
min	max
i m able to set the max min by

3808161
min	max
if i set the max min i obviously want the bars to be zoomed in the y direction but this doesn t happen

3808173
put	get
the framework already has support for this - its just that some idiot named the dll microsoft.visualbasic and it didn t get put into microsoft.applicationutils or something like that

3808179
post	get
i was able to get it to work using this after figuring out that the soapfactory method in the separate post that i mentioned needed saaj-impl.jar to work

3808199
pull	push
or at least i don t see how you could do it without conversion which changes the repo which means you can t push pull between them.

3808219
prepare	execute
build up the query string in a variable then use a prepare statement to execute it

3808243
int	boolean
for example if i was implementing a json library i d know each value can only be an object array string int boolean or nullâ the spec doesn t allow any others

3808258
filtering	grouping
how can i have multiple pivot table and charts from the same source and use separate grouping and filtering for each one

3808305
folder	directory
however even when i point the directory to the openssl directory within the xampp folder for me at c xampp apache bin the operation fails

3808348
portrait	landscape
everything looks great in landscape mode ipad but no so much when i rotate to portrait

3808360
getter	setter
this can then be made public using a property with critical sections in the getter and setter ensuring access is threadsafe

3808360
post	get
i will post some example code when i get to my computer as i m using my iphone at the moment

3808402
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way to build a plugin for google-chrome firefox but then degrade to flash for ie

3808403
stateless	stateful
because the server is stateful but the client is stateless you can rapidly exploit a poorly-designed process by emulating a different sequence

3808416
junit	powermockito	junit	mockito
i downloaded powermockito 1.4.5 with mockito and junit including dependencies and used the android.jar from the sdk 2.2

3808485

mxmlc compc are two compilers used to compile flex projects

3808532
portrait	landscape
edit brian s method seems to work when the phone in landscape but not in portrait

3808539
free	malloc
point being if you malloc d or new d your object then you need to free or delete it

3808540

note the elegant toggleclass does not work in internet explorer 6 but the below addclass removeclass method will work fine in this situation as well

3808566
post	get
when the text is sent using post and get it is encoded and decoeded

3808601
width	height
and and the height and width settings to the loadprodcomplete

3808625
int	double
in order to define a method you need a valid return type such as int or double and you need to provide the proper types for the individual arguments

3808632
many-to-many	many-to-one
many-to-many or many-to-one

3808634
int	double
while the int will get auto-converted to a double your code will be better if it is consistent with the use of types

3808670
passenger	thin
besides running mongrel thin or passenger

3808701
min	max
webkit goes farther and this definitely isn t mandated by spec by using only height in the calcation and not min max

3808804
pull	push
i d need to track a local git repository from within my vendor gems directory pull in updates from that repository regularly and do so in such a way that heroku bundler doesn t throw a fit when i try to push the entire app to production

the target file can be found in c program files msbuild expression-blend silverlight v4.0 at least on my machine

3808946
subtract	add
that way if you add subtract a font or replace one of them the fonts will get re-embedded but if there are no changes or just code changes the font.zip will be left alone

3808948
width	height
if the image is loaded you can check the width height of the loaded image against the original size of the requested image. should be 16 16 for

3808986
innodb	myisam
i have a fair understanding of innodb locking in this isolation level. there is one non-innodb myisam table used in the transaction which i insert into and update

3808986
innodb	myisam
i tried to reproduce by creating one myisam table and a couple innodb tables and doing various sequences of insert and update into myisam and select for update s in innodb

3809043
post	get
i also need to call post as opposed to get on the page that users are redirected to

3809058
integer	unsigned
if it s an unsigned integer you will have

3809087
min	max
you have to use the qt.framelesswindowhint for that and then create your own max min close buttons as widgets and add them there

3809136
uiview	calayer
every uiview is backed by a calayer

3809136
uiview	calayer
you can get at the uiview s calayer with the .layer property

children	parent
when you need to split the node you could create new nodes with each one receiving a segment of the vector of children pointers and the newly created nodes would be inserted into the node vector of the parent node

3809209
hide	show
presumably when your user clicks the hide application button you re going to want to show something - at the very least a show button so the user isn t stuck without input options

3809209

hide app calls another activity with only the ui show that you want

3809229
google-chrome	safari
the app works fine on desktop safari google-chrome iphone ios4 ...but on the ipad ios 3.2 it doesn t

3809234
width	height
also set it to have a flexible width and height via the autoresizingmask of uiview

3809558
ibatis	mybatis
we used oracle then switched to postgresql using the mybatis formerly ibatis sql mapper to shield our code from the details of the database

3809595
realloc	malloc
you could use a linked list but the more usual approach is to allocate a block of memory with malloc and dynamically resize that block with realloc if the user input exceeds the bounds of the array

3809595
realloc	malloc
if ptr is null realloc is identical to a call to malloc for size bytes

3809612
realloc	malloc
if it is impossible to precalculate how long an array should be then you can malloc a fixed amount of array read from the user then realloc if the allocated size isn t big enough

put	get
if i put each of my few external files in a separate file event though there will be multiple http requests most users don t activate a non-cache behavior on their browsers like us developers and they will cache the files resulting in a faster user experience but now with the different combination available on my css it will never be cached because each page is slightly different in the get parameters it sends the css file

from my understanding all np-complete problems are np-hard but some np-hard problems are known not to be np-complete and np-hard problems are at least as hard as np-complete problems

3809921
np-hard	np-complete
is that mean np-hard problems that are not np-complete are harder

3809959
np-hard	np-complete
there are also decision problems that are np-hard but not np-complete for example the halting problem

i use jquery to put a checkbox along with a dropdownlistfor in the box that appears when the user lets go of the mouse button this is towards the bottom of the javascript in the jsfiddle

3810130
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i do have some click checking code in the _mousestart _mousedrag and _mousestop events to stop another box from being created when you click in an existing box but i don t think this is causing the problem because the dropdownlistfor that is created can be clicked and furthermore if you remove the click checking code the checkbox remains unclickable

you can specify their class selector to hide them all in this way only one of them will be show at a time

3810240

3810387
g++	gcc
you mentioned earlier that you re familiar wtih both c and c++ so perhaps you can write a compiler that compiles down to c or c++ and then use gcc g++ or any other c c++ compiler to convert the code to a native executable

3810434
super	self
then super c self .foo refers to a.foo

3810455

3810465
super	self
if you call super c self .foo after making this change b.foo will get called

since you are not using a uinavigationcontroller the navigationcontroller property of the your uiviewcontroller will remain nil

3810649
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	put	get
if you want to get your code up running you ll need to put the root uiviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller

3810649
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
once the uiviewcontroller is shown in a uinavigationcontroller the property will be set to the uinavigationcontroller automatically

3810785
post	get
for now gamecenter does not support any get post requests

3810799
getter	setter
actually you can declare simple getter and setter methods like we did in the tiger era but declaring a property will help you to identify all aspects of the property at any time without checking the implementation

3810799
getter	setter
synthesize - simplifies the job if you need a simple property without any complex job in getter and setter

3810810

mouse	keyboard
however does onclick not work for both mouse click and keyboard enter

3810929

i believe it only repeats the keydown and not the keyup so you would need to track the state of previous keyup events yourself to determine if the key was is already pressed

3810932
linefeed	delimiter
linefeed for setting the desired row delimiter

3810960
width	height
the reason i say it doesn t work is that inside that content td there is a div set to 100 width and height and unless the td its in has a defined height it doesn t seem to be able to see what 100 is and simply adjusts the the minimum size it can be according to its content

3810977

how do i benchmarking compare two different implementations and profiling find performance bottlenecks in an implementation behavior of a web application in perl under heavy load

3811447
profiling	benchmarking
the same question is posted on serverfault how do i benchmarking and profiling io bound perl web application under heavy load

3811447
profiling	benchmarking
i think the answer here can be about benchmarking and profiling web application written in perl and perhaps also about replicating realistic load conditions or finding measure benchmarking which would predict which implementation would perform better under io bound conditions under heavy load

jnetpcap	libpcap
use libpcap and the java interface jnetpcap

3816346
accessor	properties
a far easier and more elegant method would be to have myclass contain a dictionary of the properties you want to iterate through and tie the properties accessor and the indexer to the dictionary

3816352
google-chrome	firefox
i ve extensively tested the jquery plugin roundabout and got it working nicely in internet explorer 6 through 8 google-chrome and firefox

3816360

3816446
integer	unsigned
using integer math alone i d like to safely average two unsigned ints in c++

3816451
hide	show
the best way would be store a flag in the model that s set by the controller whether to show the link or not and show hide it that way

3816475
accessor	ivar
however when i set things with direct ivar access i try to only do it via that makes it a lot simpler to find them all and change them if i ever find the need to use kvo or to make it public or to make a more complex accessor

when i did a get after my post and returned the result as json email was null but if i post my xml as

portrait	landscape
alert views appear in portrait even though the rest is in landscape

3816566
portrait	landscape
rotating the ipad from landscape to portrait does not trigger a rotation nor does it trigger any of the shouldautorotate style methods

3816566
portrait	landscape
rotating the ipad 180 degrees to other landscape does trigger rotation and after this the ipad behaves like normal rotates correctly to portrait and landscape when rotated

3816566
portrait	landscape
it only happens when loading in landscape -- loading in portrait and then rotating to landscape works just fine

3816566
portrait	landscape
if i had removed the other vc which is in landscape i would have realized that my main view controller was stuck in portrait

3816566
portrait	landscape
so i had a portrait view on top of which there was a landscape view

3816590
post	get
if you can post a representative code for your logic you will get responses which indicate how do process the same in sets

i ve been using the great emgucv c# wrapper for opencv to collect images from a home built stereo rig

3816792
int	double
note enabling the reflection warnings which is essential when optimizing for performance and the repeated type hint on y the one on the def didn t seem to help for the aset and casting everything to primitive double values the dotimes makes sure that i is a primitive int

3816912
int	double
i ve created a class to represent this data type called class fixedpoint and in it there are ways to typecast from fixedpoint to int or double or unsigned int etc

3816925
uiview	calayer
a uiview is its layer s delegate instead of -drawrect for efficiency if you use -drawrect calayer creates a second context and thus a second copy of the bitmap

folder	directory
will turn up foobar.cpp if it exists under a src folder somewhere around my current directory recursing up to find it until c work is hit and then check the scripts hierarchy

3817087
memcpy	memmove
however if memmove is additionally implemented as a macro via 7.1.4 1 that is written in terms of memcpy then you re going to be in trouble

filtering	grouping
ibuffer with its filtering and grouping is the best way for managing large numbers of buffers that i ve tried

3817222
int	double
i am pretty sure int is not going to be 3 it is going to whatever the memory chunk of the double is that the int bytes share with it

3817225
int	double
i think it uses nvs perl s equivalent of a c double instead of uvs normally an unsigned int because depending on os and compilation options some of the values in a struct statfs might be 64-bit even though perl is using 32-bit int

3817225
int	double
newsvnv works because the c compiler knows how to cast any int type to a double

3817240
uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
your best bet is to use one of the uigesturerecognizer subclasses probably uipangesturerecognizer as it includes velocity

3817266
oncreate	onnewintent
depending on the flags in your intent and the settings in your manifest your activity will be called with either oncreate or onnewintent

3817303
pycrypto	m2crypto
python 2.4 s sha module doesn t support 256 so i started using pycrypto only to find out that pycrypto doesn t support pkcs#5 needed elsewhere in my project. i switched to m2crypto as a result and now i would like to replace my pycrypto sha-256 call with an m2crypto equivalent.

inotifycollectionchanged	ilist	implements	extends
instead of extends observablecollection implements the interfaces you need probably inotifycollectionchanged and ilist and keep an observablecollection as a private field

3817469
decoder	encoder
you ll need to either use openssl s bio api to do the job or use a third-party framework or library that wraps that or a separate encoder decoder in an easy cocoa api

3817478
post	get
that is when i was trying to push back to the repo but they are get commands and no post

3817478

i think reading around there might be some sort of rewrite going on that is changing the post to a get and killing it or something

3817485
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to create nested arrays s dynamically from a string that has been parsed parameter expansion using a for-loop in bash and i am failing

3817516

readfile will incrementally pop out the data as it goes but your output buffer is catching it all until it gets to the fflush

3817656
put	get
i am trying to put a navigation div below the image but i cannot do so because the image is absolutely positioned and the scale of the image changes so i cannot just specify a padding-top value for the navigation to get it to show up under the photo

3817671
put	get
i have managed to get this working perfectly but want to put images in some of them - like a calendar icon for the events option

3817675
mouse	trackpad
an other option which would require only another physical mouse device to work with and should get you at least 95 of the way there is the multi-touch vista project which can emulate up to 256 touch points using physical devices - thus the need for an extra mouse or two since it can be awkward to simultaneously work with a mouse in one hand and trackpad with another

3817694
rss	feed
i am looking into adding rss feed to one of my django apps and i would like to be able to have them be authenticated

3817711

i think your best option is to get rid of the underline text-decoration property for the a element put the link text in a span with common class and apply text-decoration underline to that class

3817783
cruisecontrol	luntbuild
for scheduling maybe you should look at a free build management tool like cruisecontrol or luntbuild

3817833
put	get
then get nums is given the line length of the line and an empty array to put numbers in

3817835
width	height
if the change is less than both the width and height of the map the transition will be smoothly animated

3817835
width	height
therefore as long as you are zoomed out such that your viewport is 20 miles in height and width you should be guaranteed smooth panning for distances under 20 miles

3817847
rss	feed
rss feed should normally be fetched over http so this should work

3817855
for-loop	loops
i don t think you want a while loops in your for-loop

3817868
int	double	int	chars
third you re mismatching types passing an int and a double to printf but using the c chars conversion for both

3817882
rss	feed
actually one low-touch option would be to use something like feedburner to take the existing rss category feed and send emails

3817882
rss	feed
when you plug the feed into feedburner it will give you a link that users can click to subscribe to the email version of rss

3817888
swrl	owl
however if you couple your owl ontology with swrl rules for example you have a chance of capturing much of the types of rules you ve outlined

portrait	landscape
page would scale correctly when going from portrait to landscape until i used the pop up keyboard to enter a value in a field - then it would stop scaling

3818010
portrait	landscape
which would mean if i used the keyboard in landscape it would be too large when i went to portrait or vice versa

3818027

width	height
some browsers are smart enough to recognize when an image is inside of a hidden object or in an object of 0 width height and not load it since it s essentially invisible anyway

3818149
hash	salt
or it s up to you how the salt is generated as long as its being stored alongside with the password hash in the database

goodquery is better than bad query since badquery will requery the database by grouping key for each grouping and worse it is highly unlikely there is an index to help with filtering customers by c.orders.count

3818613
daemon	cron
i think i read somewhere that this can be done using a cron job and that the index does not need to be entirely rebuilt so no stopping the daemon

quite frankly you ll find better editors than emacs when speaking of tabs menus and toolbar

3819338
mouse	keyboard
emacs clearly encourages you to use your keyboard and leave your mouse asleep

3819338
mouse	keyboard
having to remove your hand from the keyboard to grasp the mouse and click on a tab and then remove your hand from the mouse and put it onto the keyboard is clearly a waste of time when a simple keystroke could be used instead

i personally recommend you not just to post here and get answer

3819590
updatepanel	formview
if you want the html content to be hidden after an ajax postback it will need to be in an updatepanel either the same one your formview is in or a separate one

3819590
updatepanel	formview
you can either do this in some code-behind calling the update method of the updatepanel or by adding an asyncpostbacktrigger to the updatepanel containing the html maybe using the databound event of the formview

the controller gets all of the data required for the request and puts it into the model

3819683
ready	each
for example if you write an application that has a plugin architecture you might create a project template for a plugin which has the code all laid out ready to be implemented so each time you write a plugin you start writing code straight away - rather than spending time laying out the structure of the plugin

3819692
put	get
in theory that should work and it works for other things that you put there but it seems that if specifying the charset in an included file tomcat doesn t get it defaults to iso-8859-1

3819700
hide	show
in your javascript function hide the link at the beginning of the function and show it again at the end

3819712
hash	md5
here s 3 example md5 hash

3820110
children	parent
it returns the parent that have 0 children

3820244

multiplying	add
so usually you multiplying your unit value by the scaling factor like 10 if you want 10 pixel per unit and add the offset of the axis from the left or lower boundary

3820453
client-side	server-side
if you really need to detect that the closest you would be able to get would be to have to have the server-side store the progress of the download by a unique id and provide an ajax interface for the client-side script to query whether the server had finished sending the file yet

3820473
inherited	base-class
inside any constructor the entire object might be only partially formed â you can know only that the base-class objects have been initialized but you cannot know which classes are inherited from you

folder	dir
generally we store it in a dir with the name of app in home folder and in that .log file

3820670
serializable	deserialization
this data structure is part of bigger objects which are serializable deserialized so you would have to browse any encapsulating object after deserialization as well

3820725
inherited	properties
the bit i am having trouble with is that _excludes.hasbia and _excludes.hasteachandtest are dynamic expressions or dynamic properties that are resolved by trygetmember of a class that inherited from dynamicobject

3820770
width	height
you need to either include the width and height of the image see or autoreinitialise the pane see

the problem is that you create a new arrays with size 1 everytime in the for-loop

3820977
crypt	salt
i m using blowfish and two salt to crypt a password and store it in the database

3820977
hash	salt
before i would store the salt and the encrypted password like a salt hash but realized its redundant because the salt is part of the encrypted password string

3820979
dictionary	map
the better idea would be to use hashtable std map for your dictionary or to sort that vector and than count distinct words runs in o logn n your solution is o n 2

3820986
google-chrome	firefox
it will work correctly in firefox and google-chrome it means that the values that you set using javascript will be the same values that you have set

3821034
hide	show
now using jquery you can hide and show the 2nd div with the remaining results as you please

3821063
hash	salt
instead of hashing every word in a dictionary the attacker would now have to hash every word with every salt

3821063
hash	salt
with a long enough salt this gives enough combinations to make it unfeasible to compute all these hash

3821063
hash	salt
so a salt is not meant to be an extra password known only to the application it is meant to change the hash function so that it is non-standard

3821076
lwuit	lcdui
there is no direct support in lcdui classes for your requirement i would suggest try exploring lwuit

3821078
mouseover	mousemove
the simplest way would be to call the mouseover subroutine from the mousemove subroutine as such

3821078
mousehover	mouseenter
hook to the mousehover event so the listening variable is turned on when the mouseenter

3821096
onmouseover	onclick
that solves the first issue then you have to make sure there are no inline onmouseover onclick etc

3821102
folder	directory
since include.bat sometimes cannot be found working directory may be wrong not the folder where include.bat is located

3821124

3821151
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am completely at my wits end here is there something i could have done some way of implementing a uiviewcontroller not using ib nesting viewcontrollers inside viewcontrollers polyviewcontroller owns uinavigationcontroller that owns vertical and horizontalviewcontroller or anything that will make the app completely ignore interfaceorientation notifications

3821157
hide	show
if you think your design with this more space is perfect and every user will acknowledge this and wants to use it after trying it make it a setting to hide or show the notification bar

3821176
typedef	struct
why is struct date typedef

3821205

i found an online example and it looks pretty straightforward the client just implements an interface that extends remote like the server does and passes it to the server which can then call back its methods

3821671
width	height
i am trying to change linear layout or any other widget width or height dynamically but throwing exception

3821672

sony released a small home-development kit including a keyboard mouse and harddrive for the old non-slim playstation 2 back in the day

3821892
division	multiplication
so you can replace any multiplication by two squaring operations and some additions and division by 4 which is just a bit shift and these can be all ignored for asymptotical complexity

3821910
range	minimum
if the 32-bit float range is larger than -1..1 then you need to find the minimum and maximum values and calculate a scale factor that gets the samples within the int16 range

3821925
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome ie and safari all displayed it correctly

3821932
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

queue	fifo
you d have to introduce some type of fifo queue processing to enforce that

3822097
queue	fifo
but i have to manually rotate them using fifo queue and rotatelogs to create a new log for each day

3822097
queue	fifo
edit the solution with fifo queue is not good enough because if the process that reads from this queue rotatelogs reads to slow it will slow down the entire jvm apparently sun oracle does gc logging synchronously

3822124
for-loop	loops
if inside the for-loop you write break loops

3822146
put	get
instead of me generating events or binding events to each cell would it be better to put a global event and then i believe when clicked or mouseover events occur it will bubble up to my global event on the entire table and then i get filter the event caller and react

note that i ve changed the type of the array from chars to int because each element should be a count not a chars

i suspect that since you re calling realloc for every element obviously not wise in production the realloc malloc call itself is the biggest bottleneck for both tests even though realloc often doesn t provide a new pointer

3830610
realloc	malloc
expect performance to change where you mix up malloc and realloc calls

3830631
scons	autotools
it derives from the concepts of other build tools such as scons autotools cmake or ant

3830639
jquery	curvycorners

i have put a calculate button on the main interface itself but i can t get the keyboard to go again once it is opened

3830737
public	protected
in your class code check the conditional define and switch between public or protected and private accordingly

3830753
realloc	malloc
others have also pointed out that the vast majority of your program s time is probably spent in malloc realloc which both implementations call once per addition

3830758
mouse	keyboard
i disagree with this entirely sure multi-threaded programs are non-deterministic but then so are single-threaded ones considering user input message pumps mouse keyboard handling and many other factors

3830770
google-chrome	firefox

3830851
public	protected
i tried also by setting the same property as private on b but php does not allow to change the access level from public to private or protected

3830859
min	max
i would recommend that you should try to specify the max and min values of your numericstepper based on elements of your data object not based on the position of the row

3830893
getter	setter
the only idea that comes to mind is making private from the start and using magic getter and setter functions to control access

3830895
setinterval	settimeout
i m not sure what the rest of your code looks like but you might be better off using setinterval instead of settimeout

3830982
setinterval	settimeout
using a string for settimeout or setinterval is bad as it then calls eval which is slow and has other issues

3830983
gitignore	hgignore
svn has the svn ignore property mercurial has the hgignore file and git has the gitignore file for example

3830992
post	get
your fields have the default value if the user isn t in the field so naturally when you post the form that s what will get posted

3831026
xts	quantmod
i m trying to read time series from csv file and save them as xts to be able to process them with quantmod

3831080
zoo	xts
the internal data structure of both zoo and xts is matrix so you cannot mix data types

3831102
width	height
the solution for my problem was to use even sizes for the width and height of my uiview

3831129
int	double
clarify - count - int price - double date - date

3831141
width	height
for example state belongs grouped with height width top left window position + state

3831233
getter	setter
i would use the individual getter setter inside of the sethouse method which is your second option

3831258
xmodem	zmodem
chuck forsberg looked at the xmodem and decided it was inefficient so he begat the ymodem but it s implementations were buggy and both x and ymodem were replaced with zmodem

3831279
macbook	bootcamp
having a macbook pro with windows installed thanks to bootcamp i have several questions

3831279
cpu	processors
under windows i see that processes only use 50 maximum of the cpu charge is that because the processors is a dual core and because the process is not multi-threaded

3831305
getter	setter
jon s answer to that question taken from another question about using getter setter which is not a duplicate to this one

3831305
getter	setter
you don t always need getter setter but if you have some there s usually a good reason why you ve implemented them and in that case use them

3831321
interpolation	splines
it is possible to display the parametric equation starting from the splines interpolation

3831395
inherited	subclassing
how to annotate inherited id with generatedvalue and field with index within subclassing

3831407
curb	libcurl
the most direct approach might be to use the ruby curb library which is the most straightforward wrapper for libcurl

3831474
getter	setter
perhaps if you are getting and setting in two different places you might consider factoring out your getter and setter to a common interface

3831484
16-bit	64bit
some types have sizes that are platform-dependent which means an int might be 64bit or 32 bits or even 16-bit

3831489

split the number into its integer part and its fractions part

3831663
free	malloc
for that next big malloc to minimize the with 4meg free why did my 1kbyte alloc fail

3831663
free	malloc
a malloc that is one chunk or less in size take any free chunk in memory use an mmu table entry to point at it and give the caller the virtual address tied to that mmu entry

3831680
post	get
how do i get the post data jsondata from httpservletrequest

3831695
google-chrome	firefox
but it works in google-chrome firefox

3831752
maven	cargo
i am trying to deploy a webapplication using maven cargo plugin into tomcat server

3831761

normaly you can get and post parameters in a servlet the same way

3831874
vaadin	wicket
wicket and vaadin are my favorites

3831901
getter	setter
we are using a custom runtimedatabuilder class that dynamically constructs a .net type in-memory using reflection.emit to create simple property getter setter for the information that we receive from a generic wcf dataservice

3831901
getter	setter
when the information is received client side we generate the type with its property setter getter to improve the performance and facilitate binding on our silverlight client

3831901
getter	setter
my concern is for the type with all its property getter setter that is now not required anymore

3831908
kde	gnome
and archlinux awesome wm without kde and gnome installed

3831942

another thing i noticed is that even though they are both set to width 400px the select is noticeably shorter in both google-chrome firefox

3831969
rss	feed
i m pulling all enclosures from a list of rss feed into the import table

3832022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
if named return-value-optimization nrvo is available the compiler may elide the copy

3832022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
returning an unnamed temporary variable here means compilers without named return-value-optimization nrvo will have a better chance to elide the copy of the local object - instead working directly on the callers stack

3832103
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome or firefox just right click on something click on inspect element

3832113

they would then post or get back at a later time making this an asynchronous operation to a pre-arranged url on your site or one that you pass along to them allowing you to do whatever you want with their output

3832114
folder	dir
script3 calls an import from scripts that are in one or more of the dir or subdir folder

3832160

well it appears that drawrectangle four parameters are x y width and height

3832160
width	height
however x and y are integers while width and height are singles

3832183
google-chrome	firefox
tested besides google-chrome which problem this solves in firefox and ie8 for the following simple json result for other browsers and more complex responses no guarantees.

3832189

i have been storing settings into a file into the directory where the bho file is currently programfiles common files folder it was like this when i received the code but i can change it

3832374
ienumerable	iqueryable
it s based upon extension methods for ienumerable and iqueryable and their generic counterparts which allow deferred execution in linq to objects and remote processing via iqueryable as well as many other features

3832391
jasmine	qunit
update jspec is now discontinued as per their github repository so this leaves jasmine and qunit

3832397
ienumerable	iqueryable
they re probably looking for you to know that linq is the new dsl for querying iqueryable and ienumerable objects

3832437

folder	directory
try to start extract_section.py in its directory instead of from the parent folder

3832498

in ie8+ it improved defaulting to 6 which is inline with firefox google-chrome but still if you have a lot of images and you are not using sprites you will experience heavy latency

3832518
hash	md5
im sorry if this is a stupid question but i was curious i have this code that translates into my name im wondering what hash function its using i thought it was md5

3832536
jcolorchooser	jfilechooser
jcolorchooser and jfilechooser are not regular jcomponent s

3832536

concave	convex
i have a simple polygon convex or concave but no holes that i need to slice into parts with a line segment

3832601
concave	convex
basic convex cases the always results in 2 sub-polygons are easy but how would i deal with a complicated concave shape

3832604
min	max
somehow the min max values need to be included in the markup

3832612
tiff	png
i am trying to draw an image jpg tiff png on the background of my user control

3832646
fflush	gets
there s a pretty good chance that when the cache gets fflush for content updates that they could collide like that but i don t have a great way to test this scenario in development because i m only working on a single box

3832665
range	minimum
these are the dates that correspond to the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit signed integer. additionally not all platforms support negative timestamps therefore your date range may be limited to no earlier than the unix epoch

3832702
post	put
the page post back and i can put some code in the button s submit method

3832713
width	height
note that this example doesn t make much sense why would you multiply x y height and width by two

3832723
rel	src
click the thumbnail the large image fades out new one fades in src getting called from the rel attribute of the link

3832742
children	parent
well if the children contains no reference variable or all children reference variable are set to null then removing the parent and setting the parent reference to null will remove the children from memory also.but you have to manually remove listener attached to them

3832776
post	put
if google were feeling evil they could put something in their copy of jquery to log your keypresses steal personal information from the page you re on to tie into their web tracking database make you post â œi love google

before you ask...i ve tried in google-chrome ie and firefox

3832791
integer	unsigned
i want to read 4 bytes which are a little-endian encoding of an unsigned 32-bit integer and assign the value to a java int

3832793
firefox	safari
it s working in firefox but not safari

3832793
firefox	safari
i don t understand how that can be possible since firefox and safari usually render these types of things the same

3832793
firefox	safari
what could it be that is causing this difference between safari and firefox

3832810
superclass	subclassing
in the subclassing init the superclass with the required style and override layoutsubviews as follows

3832815
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
meanwhile you can throw unchecked-exception runtimeexception or its subclass and this will not break contract

3832843
min	max
equal to min max seed1 max seed2 max seed 3 etc

3832844
int	chars
please look at the following code that just convert an unsigned int to a string there may be some unhandled cases but it s not my question allocating a chars array in the heap and returning it leaving the user the responsibility to free it after the use

3832845
ethernet	wireless
connect iphone through windows 7 wireless and workstation through ethernet to the internet

3832858
width	height
you can set the frame components x y width height but it s not immediately obvious how to do so

3832863
salt	md5
using cakephp s built in function with sha1 and md5 and salt and you ll end up with something harmless in the end

3832865
folder	directory
by referencing the existing folder as a iiswebdirectory i was able to select it and then create an application without creating a virtual directory

3832876
cassini	iis
i am able to debug using the vs development server cassini but when i change to use the local iis web server and create virtual directory i am unable to debug

3832879
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can defer enumeration and the call to the consumer and have them convert the items to a list or you can create a method that will create a list for them on demand or change the way they will interact by making your definition an ienumerable and just returning the iqueryable

3832946
put	get
also if i put class-specific properties on a derived class and provide metadata for these properties i get results but only for these properties not the properties from the base class

3832961
free	malloc
for instance when i m not using the standard malloc implementation throughout my program i would be very upset about having to find and call the corresponding free the upshot is i wouldn t use such a function

3833036
vim	emacs
getting ready to try out vim or emacs for rails development

3833036
vim	emacs
i m not looking for reasons why or why not to use vim or emacs and i don t want opinions on which is a better editor

3833068
children	parent
you cannot look inside what children do i have - only upwards what are my parent and sideways what s next to me

3833084
versioning	upgrade
this is why this feature can t be upgrade to versioning 1.0.4

3833095

i ve actually written a closed-source library which implemented floating-point math in the integer unit in order to make floats provide identical results on multiple platforms intel amd powerpc across different compilers

3833121
rubygems	bundler
i m trying to find a bundler command that will make any gems from github register with rubygems but nothing so far

3833175

i don t know what goes on in that sendajax code but that get looks like it should be a post to me

3833190
dbf	dbase
i m generating dbf file to get imported to legacy systems that only accepts dbase ii or iii

3833190
dbf	dbase
i initially started working with this component vfpoledb.1 but it only generate dbf files in dbase v format which isn t backwards compatibily

3833190
dbf	dbase
anyone knows a component or driver to generate de dbf file in dbase ii or iii

3833202
udp	tcp
i would expect that a custom tcp or udp server running a custom protocol that is ideally tailored for your particular needs would be the most efficient solution but since you re not really telling us much about what you need to communicate it s rather difficult to answer

3833234
opera	firefox
i once did a test where opera an firefox where finished after a few seconds but msie hadn t finished after 20 minutes

3833235
datagridview	datarepeater
visual studio has lots of easy tools to help you integrate your sql server into the application from using things like the datagridview to the datarepeater take a look at this article it should help you get started

3833252
vim	textmate
i think vim is a great editor and as pointed out yahuda katz wrote about how he converted to vim from textmate

3833296
postgresql	mysql
this should do the trick sorry no postgresql db to test on but it works on mysql

3833326
free	malloc
which only requires one call to malloc and one call to free

3833356
min	max
what do the max min values mean in the physical wave form air pressure

3833356
min	max
with this code i almost always get a min of 0 and a max of 128

3833376
single-quotes	double-quotes
i also ditched the double-quotes in favor of single-quotes which meant i had to escape the single-quote in the regex

3833396
folder	directory
my default java -version is jdk1.6 just after opensolaris installation however as i have no javac i downloaded jdk1.6 for solaris and after executing the jdk1.6xx.sh i did cd to the folder of jdk and then inside bin directory i ran javac however its giving me noclassdeffounderror java lang object

3833445
inherited	properties
augmenting the object.prototype object in that way is never recommended because those properties will be inherited by a great number of objects -even also by some host objects- and as you know the primary concern is that they will be enumerated by the for-in statement

3833507
minimum	max
i have set a minimum pool size of 5 and max of 50

3833518
children	parent
parent can access children but children should never access parent

3833520
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
what you want is void viewdidappear or void viewwillappear method..

3833664
inherited	properties	hide	show

hide	show
this way if it s checked they show if not they hide

3833712
gridview	repeater
a binding container can be as lincolnk demonstrated an repeater or gridview item a calendar cell etc

3833732
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
i try to build a expandablelistview with a own expandablelistadapter but the expandablelistview is not visible in my activity -

3833757
pull	push
but when i now push this to the bare repo and pull it to the working copy on the server settings.py is deleted there - which is bad because i have to keep this specific settings.py

3833786
inherited	subclassing
how to annotate inherited id with generatedvalue and field with index within subclassing

3833843
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
in the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods one parameter is event which is a uievent object

3833865
width	height
instead of measuring window width height you could break your h2 and p into separate components and give the p area a layout of fit

3833885
button	checkbox	hide	show
so say if someone checks a checkbox the row should be highlighted there is a toolbar that will show hide button etc

3833885
button	checkbox
so what i want to do is this whenever a checkbox is clicked or whenever a toolbar button is clicked i want to announce to anyone who is listening that this event occurred

3833888
zipalign	jarsigner
then you need to add the call to jarsigner and zipalign in the bat to complete the task

3833911
mockito	easymock
this is the best comparison i ve seen of multiple java mocking frameworks including easymock and mockito

3833911
mockito	easymock	mockito	unitils	mockito	jmock	mockito	jmockit	jmock	unitils	easymock	unitils	easymock	jmock	easymock	jmockit	jmockit	unitils
it includes easymock mockito jmock sevenmock jmockit rmock unitils

3833911
mockito	easymock
i used easymock first but have moved to mockito

3833933
put	get
however this does not seem to work no matter what i put for directionslt i get pjm which is the default selection

3833956
spaces	delimiter
join the array with a single spaces or whatever other delimiter

3833993
post	get	post	put	put	get
you can specify your resource calls through a get post delete or put http methods

3834014
hide	show
does anyone know how i can hide show or add remove these elements from the page

3834020
children	parent
i have a parent object pool that can have 0 to many children question

3834049
hide	show
you can handle the onchange event with a javascript function that will determine which element to hide or show then change the style for the appropriate element

3834049
addclass	removeclass
jquery would use the addclass removeclass or toggleclass functions.

3834119
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox ie google-chrome so i assume webkit browsers all will fail to the find the specific helvetica font required and move directly to the first font they encounter in the helvetica family

3834175
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
currently i know that firefox gives the command button mac the code 224 while google-chrome and safari give it the value 91

3834199
cvs	svn
the ability to move things around is one of the greatest advantages of svn over cvs after all

3834239
keydown	keyup
otherwise for keydown and keyup events the property you need is keycode in all browsers

3834336
hex	binary
this raises questions about how best to store bit flags in c++ and why c++ doesn t support assignment of binary text to an int like it allows for hex numbers to be assigned in this way via 0x

3834379
clearance	devise
the docs are pretty good and i know it works fine with devise it s pretty agnostic that way i ve also used it with clearance

3834398
public	protected
warning ca1811 microsoft.performance backupwindowviewmodel.backupcommand.get appears to have no upstream public or protected callers

3834441
children	parent
the closest i ve come is by using the preloadchildren attribute on the treeloader but this still only loads when the parent node containing children is loaded

3834475
equals	gethashcode
i suspect by duplicate you mean an object with equals field values to another object - you need to override equals gethashcode for that to work and or implement .

3834475
multiplying	add
the add and multiplying approach to combining several hash codes into one is the standard one recommended by josh bloch

3834475
multiplying	add
we really don t care if the repeated multiplying add leads to an overflow because we re not looking for a magnitude as such.

3834559
spaces	linefeed
then you need to read the file in and use spaces and linefeed whitespace as separators

3834581
post	get
edit as per the other post - a join is likely to be more efficient however if you have multiple records in tableb with the same subid you will get duplicate records from tablea returned

3834589
rss	feed
multiple rss feed

3834673
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
hdpi ldpi mdpi refers the density of pixels on the screens not the screens size

3834673

webkit	gecko
how do i use rendering engines like gecko webkit etc in python

3839235
hide	show
what the css equivalent of hide is dependent how your js show it later but generally display none or visibility hidden

3839241
hash-collision	key
just for your information if do not already.the difference between the hashmap and the hashtable is that hashtable is synchronized and does not allow null as key also the main difference is that hashmap has enhanced hash function that prevents two different object getting in to single bucket or to prevent hash-collision

3839451
typedef	struct
the key insight here is that when dealing with a declaration like typedef struct name1 name2

3839451
typedef	struct
and then typedef struct name1 name2

3839460
explode	implode
you can do this with explode array_slice and implode

3839502
apache-poi	excellibrary
if you want formatting consider using an excellibrary such as apache-poi or jasper reports

3839508
ant	pom.xml	inherited	properties
is there any way for the ant build.xml file inherited properties set in the pom.xml file

3839650
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the issue is you re naming your action method slightly wrong so if the old local server isn t case-sensitive most pcs and macs are case-insensitive when tested locally it doesn t matter

3839683
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
when you use versions of sql server before sql server 2005 while the sqldatareader is being used the associated sqlconnection is busy serving the sqldatareader

3839685
pull	push
also note that the downstream socket type is now called push and the corresponding upstream has changed to pull

3839689
put	get
if i put this in the controller and model then i get nil object errors from activerecord

3839711
width	height
this effectively lets the button decide what height it needs and then you set the width to that calculated value

3839731
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
- subscribe for mousedown mouseup and mousemove events

3839731
mousemove	mouseup
next handle the mousemove and mouseup events to find out how much you need to move your curve

3839731
width	height
and width height properties can be set easily so you can do it this way

3839755
versioning	upgrade
i want to be able to update this application however i cannot find installshield variable that returns the number of already installed productversion i know that i can workout this versioning manually by using upgrade node and defining set of rules however right now i m searching for the simplest solution

3839755
versioning	upgrade
i want to be able to upgrade to the current versioning not only from the previous versioning for example 3.0.2 but also from earlier ones 2.1.0 1.0.0 etc

3839765
google-chrome	firefox
i ran a few browsers against this test and found that firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 6 support file reader api and local storage

3839784
post	get
update 2 just tried wiring it to an actual page and firebug spits this error message out in addition to the two get post

3839835
min	max
use the min or max aggregate function

3839964
versioning	upgrade
one advantage of this multi-layer method is that you can have multiple potentially incompatible libraries of the same name but within each major versioning you can freely upgrade them since they re supposed to be compatible

3839976
rtp	rtsp
live555 is a powerful library for rtp and rtsp streaming

3839990
folder	directory
i could generate one json file from my directory with all metadata from files inside this folder but i want to get one for each file

3840005
exponent	modulo
is there a possible way to find out the modulo and exponent of the public key created with seckeygeneratepair the security framework in general

3840033
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
obtain the files by file#listfiles on a directory from one disk iterate over each of them create a new file on the other disk read from a fileinputstream from the file from one disk and write it to a fileoutputstream on the file on the other disk

3840035
toolbar	docking
mainwindow a modern action-based main window toolbar menu and docking architecture

3840053
stdout	fflush
if you have access to the source code you can probably just add calls to fflush stdout after every printf

3840056
ubuntu	linux
also it seems like linux has ubuntu fedora

3840056
ubuntu	linux
also is there any difference between using linux with user interface like ubuntu using an ide to create programme and the command line terminal using vim to create programme

3840058
hide	show
if this is element 6 then hide play pause if it is element 1 show play pause

3840099
temp	tmp
you don t show the full file name of the temp file you refer to but dreamweaver has a preview in browser option that creates temp files typically with random characters starting with tmp but i ve not used that feature in quite a while

3840112
visualvm	jhat
monitoring memory with jruby part 1 jhat and visualvm

3840112
profiling	debugging
their basic argument although they are too polite to spell it out that way is that using anything other than jruby to debugging memory leaks is just plain stupid simply because jruby can use java tools which have more engineering effort put into them than all ruby profiling tools together

3840139
qlabel	pyqt
see wxwidgets and pyqt for a trivial example with a qplaintextedit should be easy to adjust for a qlabel

3840144
ssl	https
when you use https the ssl tls connection is established before any http traffic is sent thus the whole request including the url and its parameters will be encrypted and won t be readable

3840166
firefox	safari
now if i request this on the local development server i m using safari but firefox works too it works and i see a black square

3840184
range	minimum
i trying to do a validates_length_of but specifying the range minimum maximum at run time

3840196
inherited	subclassing
i do want the attribute to get inherited by other subclassing just not this one

3840207
client-side	server-side
is there a way to script the transform to happen client-side or is the only option to do it server-side

3840246
portrait	landscape
i use uiscrollview and pagecontroller it works on landscape but not portrait

3840246
width	height
if the app starting portrait mode and then when i rotate the device the view do not fit to screen i think that the uiscrollview content size need to redefined then i assign the height to width of the content and width to height of the content but it does not properly

3840250
hide	show
my problem is that it only show the elements matching the pattern and hide their children except they also match the pattern

3840354
firebird	dbisam
you could use a database such as dbisam firebird etc

3840418
width	height
you need to set a height and width on the ul or whatever container holds the images

3840427
uiview	calayer
i m trying to draw a bunch of preloaded images in a uiview s calayer but whenever the image displays the app s memory usage spikes and the memory is not reclaimed whenever the image changes

3840451
vmware	virtualbox
if you want to experience with linux get a distribution of your choice linux-mint is a good introction coming from windows and try it in a vm vmware or virtualbox

3840452
width	height
i m trying to make text automatically resize to fully fit inside a static 200 width 100 height div

3840526
free	malloc
the biggest issue you ll have will be with malloc free vs

3840527
inherited	properties
you could inherited off the attribute and add a properties that controls whether the attrbiute code fires or not

3840550
min	max
here i m using max but min or even avg would work just as well

3840569
keydown	keyup
how it works is simple a content script is injected into every page which then listens for keydown and keyup events

3840619
adc	uart
then to actually communicate that data to a computer you can fairly easily throw all those adc values onto the uart for the computer to pick up and process as it sees fit

3840673
client-side	server-side
i have a mixed client-side server-side validation using jquery validation plugin

3840675
ubuntu	linux
imho ubuntu is best for starters or anyone as a matter of fact because it has a lot of support a good user base and is compatible with pretty much any linux software installer rpm deb etc. you can choose any other distribution it doesn t really matter but i recommend this one

3840675
ubuntu	linux	xfce	kde	xfce	gnome	xfce	kubuntu	kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
1 ubuntu a linux distribution comes with gnome as gui while kubuntu with kde and xubuntu has xfce

3840691
thin	unicorn
based on my research so far i am currently leaning towards nginx + haproxy + unicorn thin + memcached + mysql and deploying on linode

3840700
post	put
i would put the post outside of color box

3840749
floating-point	fractions
floating-point numbers are normally represented as binary fractions times a power of two for efficiency

3840755
pop-up	dialog
a better way to do this is to pop-up a dialog box and get the name you wish to use

3840804
width	height
i would like after that to be able to retrieve in code-behind the width or height of my column 0

3840804
width	height
edit since i have children into my grid 0 i accessed it s width and height with

3840811
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari and opera

3840860
serializable	deserialization
the property will need a setter even though it s a calculated field so that the string from the serializable object can be fed into a new instance on deserialization

3840873
margin	height
although they vary slightly as to how they retrieve a height value i.e some would calculate the whole element including padding margin scrollbar etc and others would just calculate the element in its raw form

3840905
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works just fine in google-chrome safari but bugs in firefox - i just can t find an explanation for which it wouldn t work

3840942
int	double
you can also create other versions for the other integral types supported by sum double float int long

3840972
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and ie work perfectly and firefox too only if i run it with administrator permissions

3840982
scheme	racket
it appears plt scheme has changed name to racket

3841007
hide	show
2. have the hover trigger a separate offset div to show hide

3841029
client-side	server-side
however you will need to perform similar validation on the server-side anyway because javascript can be disabled at the client or your html can be edited client-side to remove the validation call from the form element

3841115
installation	upgrade
as for updates i don t believe you could have it do updates automatically when they re available without some other mechanism having the app call home and check for updates or something but if you just point the browser at the updated package to download it it will handle the upgrade as well upon download and installation

3841130
mouseover	mouseleave
that will stop the mouseover animation and perform the mouseleave animation immediately

3841130
mouseover	mouseout
without it the mouseover animation will continue to run and if the mouse has left the area before it finishes it won t register that it needs to run the mouseout animation

3841199
google-chrome	firefox
i am able to browse the internet when i enable the autoproxy url in most browsers i use ie 7 ie 8 firefox google-chrome

3841199
nexus	artifactory
i can manually download these libraries from maven2 repositories and have an internal repository hosted using artifactory or nexus but i would like to know if there is any way i can do it from ide itself.

3841209
kde	gnome
of course kde and gnome might have separate screensaver implementations by now - there is very little uniformity when it comes to linux guis unfortunately.

3841269
int	double
how do i detect whether a variable is float double int etc

3841284
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it renders fine in ie safari google-chrome and every other browser invented by man but in firefox the background images do not show the feedback link on the left and a white box around the content

3841312
hide	show
that is we d dynamically set this style to none hide and show using jquery

3841320
hide	show
if you want to show and hide you can use those jquery methods

3841332
postgresql	mysql
supports more databases sql server mysql postgresql oracle sqlite + more

3841363
postgresql	mysql
not sure what postgresql sql server mysql etc will or won t allow

3841410
ant	maven
netbeans offers great integration with ant and or maven for build purposes it s basically just a gui wrapper around those tools and there are a number of ant tasks out there that can do what you re wanting

3841410
ant	maven
if your netbeans project s are maven-based then you can always plug in one of these ant tasks there using the antrun plugin for maven

3841410
ant	maven
if you re not used to dealing with ant or maven directly in netbeans then just switch to the files tab and look at your project s root directory

3841410
maven	pom.xml
if its a maven project the build script will be named pom.xml

3841437
gridview	formview
i ve got a gridview formview master detail relationship going on

3841449
isapi	iirf
since iis 6.0 doesn t have a convenient way of turning off compression based on the user agent i used iirf an isapi filter that rewrites urls to rewrite the accept-encoding header when it comes from safari

3841449
chunked	transfer-encoding
but if safari is receiving dynamic compressed content that is the server is serving a response being rendered by asp.net and the content length is not known until it s done so the server sends transfer-encoding chunked then safari goes into flaky sir-hangs-a-lot mode

3841477
rss	feed
i m parsing rss feed however some feed have what look to be blank images in them from feedburner

3841496
equals	compareto
but when i perform a compareto i get a non-zero number and equals returns false

3841528
uilabel	uibutton
i found the fontlabel open source that can use ttf with uilabel but unfortunately i can t set my uibutton s titlelabel to a created fontlabel

3841541
mvp	presenter
first i m not mad because i use mvvm in winforms- i know about mvp model view presenter pattern and it s variants

3841643
equals	gethashcode
it should still obey the contract of gethashcode even if the field order changes equals values will have equals hash codes within the lifetime of that process

3841674
gitx	repo
git and subversion are fairly different and i know a tool to view a log and diffs for a checkout of a part of the subversion repo certainly wouldn t be the same as viewing a git repo via gitx

3841708
post	get	post	put	put	get
a post does not seem correct because it is not idempotent while a put is and thus more closely resembles the behavior or of a get

3841734
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend getting a more advanced browser toolkit such as the firebug plugin for firefox or using google-chrome s developer tools

3841736
onfocus	onblur
the reason it doesn t work is that you re calling the functions immediately and assigning the return value of undefined to onfocus and onblur

3841736
onfocus	onblur
instead onfocus and onblur should reference the functions by name

3841736
onfocus	onblur
now onfocus and onblur are referencing the functions and will call them when the events occur

3841737
pull	push
bundles are easier since it does not maintain that the two repo from which you push and pull have to be available at the same time

3841804
postgresql	mysql
there are exceptions though mysql and postgresql seem to have additional smartness that allows it

3841813
typedef	struct
with typedef you are saying that frame_t and struct frame_s are the exact same type

3841817
int	double
but not for int double etc

3841821
typedef	struct
usually you do such a typedef so that you can use the typedef name frame_t and don t have to write struct whenever you refer to the type

3841835
spaces	delimiter
for delimiter other than spaces such as commas peter s answer seems more appropriate

3841843
equals	gethashcode
heap the fact that for a value type equivalence relates to value while for an object type equivalence relates to identity even when an object defines a different form of equivalence by overriding equals and gethashcode the concept of reference-equality still exists and is still useful

3841893
int	double
widening conversion is when you go from a int to a double you are increasing the precision of the cast

3841893
int	double
narrowing conversion is the inverse of that when you go from double to int

3841896
pull	push
mercurial is able to compress data being sent for both ssh and https so you can push and pull faster

3841902
int	double
a widening cast is a cast from one type to another where the destination type has a larger range or precision than the source int to long float to double

3841929
post	get
however a few things about the post confuse me and i d love to get some help deciphering it

3841953
portrait	landscape
if i create the main view in portrait mode then rotate in landscape and after that i create my modal view.

3841953
portrait	landscape
the modal is in portrait mode and not in landscape as it should be

3841955
free	malloc
i played around with free and malloc but it didn t work..

3841955
memcpy	realloc
i m aware that the realloc could also result in a memcpy call but not everytime

3841967
children	parent
to implement this you need a parent class or interface that is something like bookoremptyspace stupid name that can have children book or emptyspace

3841969
sharpmap	proj
there s a decent implementation in the sharpmap proj which you should be able to use independently careful of the license though it s lgpl

3841976
pop-up	dialog
when run from the console it pop-up a dialog saying blah.exe has stopped working

3842033
post	get
third you can post the parameters to a queries resource and have that respond with 201 created and a new url like queries 78a65g82 in the location response header which the client then calls get on repeatedly or even in ranges if that s a benefit to retrieve the result

3842087
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add	multiplying	modulo
you can multiplying add subtract divide find modulo and exponentiate any number that has an exact string representation

3842088
centos	linux
i m implementing my own graph library in linux fedora 10 and centos 5 with gcc 4.3.2 and using stl containers then i found some problems with memory

3842094
google-chrome	firefox
.hide worked great in firefox google-chrome but not in ie6 7 8

3842149
free	malloc
in addition to the stl container it might be the libc itself doing so the new delete - malloc free implementation

3842154
implements	extends
these descendant stylesheets can extends base styles with more granularity as needed e.g. might get extended by or which is a great design pattern for implements so-called object-oriented css

3842199
tinyint	boolean
cakephp considers tinyint 1 to be a boolean so

3842219
put	get
but if you just get a silent crash you re going to have to put on your detective hat as per xavier s answer

3842231
passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	thin	unicorn
i personally prefer passenger over thin unicorn having run nginx to thin backends for a long while just for the convenience but your proposed setup is fairly standard

3842231
ubuntu	centos	redhat	fedora
many folks go with ubuntu or redhat centos fedora distros - i like centos myself - but it s really just about what you feel most comfortable with

3842231
ubuntu	centos
if you don t have a favorite distro i would recommend trying ubuntu centos as they tend to be quite friendly to the beginner and have extremely robust community support

3842246
cos	sin
what actually goes into the computation of trig functions like sin cos tan and atan

3842266
mouse	keyboard
note the highlighting works fine when a user selects a row with mouse or keyboard

3842268
put	get
when i put the lines that are causing errors in an implemeation cointext i.e between implemtation and end i get

3842276
cos	sin
so if you re on such a processor and if you have no dependencies in your code you don t need the result of one sin computation in order to start the next one then you probably won t get much faster than using sin and cos directly as they will be fully pipelined achieving an effective rate of 1 per cycle

3842289
free	malloc
there is also overhead of malloc both time and memory because malloc puts a special header _crtmemblockheader before the memory area it returns that s why you have to give exactly the same pointer to the free and are able to use functions like _msize

3842295
hide	show
click 1 should hide show and click 2 should reverse

3842309
terminate	timeout
it seems that the connection to the database has timeout and has been terminate by the database server

3842341
ssl	https
how would i apply ssl https to my php login system

3842341
ssl	https
i ll need some kind of ssl https checking

3842389
post	get
here s how it works assuming no caching specified on the server side by default get requests will be cached by the browser and post requests not cached unless you specify the cache true attribute when sending the ajax requests which allows you to override the client caching strategy

3842406
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
unless you have a huge installation base and draconian upgrade policies costs like microsoft with it s office you should have no problems with users needing to open new versioning files on older versioning of software

3842406
versioning	upgrade
one thing you can foresee and consider now is to create a some free player to let users that have new format file and old versioning of software see this new file and maybe decide to upgrade and b converter module that will convert newer format to older possibly dropping some unsupported features elements

3842476
folder	dir
my new problem is that i am now storing user uploads in a folder inside of my django app so i can t just remove the whole app dir anymore or i would loose all of my users files

3842512
firefox	safari
it shows up fine in safari and firefox but in ie7 it is nowhere to be seen

3842515
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode will say that they are not equals

3842612
google-chrome	firefox
however if you re into web development i think test www selenium is becoming indespensable for testing javascript-heavy web pages and their behavior in the most common web browsers firefox iexplorer google-chrome etc.

3842646
min	max
then summarize those values for min max and average

3842647
kentico	dotnetnuke	kentico	umbraco	umbraco	dotnetnuke
i am intrigued by sitefinity umbraco and kentico for sites where all that s really needed is a cms but not enough that i ve bothered trying them over dotnetnuke

3842667
dictionary	map
to relate two strings it s easiest to use an object to create a dictionary map as shown below

3842681
width	height
that means the packer computes how large a master must be to just exactly meet the needs of its slaves and it sets the requested width and height of the master to these dimensions quoting from the official tcl tk man pages 1

3842704
comparator	icomparer
another option would be to pass in an icomparer or a delegate comparator for custom comparing

3842707
min	max
on the one hand if you do not close the connection it will remain open until it times out 1 min under load you will hit the max connections default 10

3842713
width	height
the content itself has much more height than width and it would be perfect to have the screen split down the middle horizontally with the content on the left and the virtual keyboard on the right

3842719
sorting	grouping
i am at a loss as to how to split the string and then cover all the sorting grouping combinations given that there are no rules around the form_name format

3842759
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for a google-chrome or firefox extension that will auto validate your webpages from specific urls

3842773
webclient	httpwebrequest
1st code that goes before using a webclient or httpwebrequest object

3842805
phpstorm	aptana
aptana phpstorm are the ones i ve tried and saw that at least phpstorm show very good notices when something s wrong in your js code including jquery

3842812
dictionary	map
to relate two strings it s easiest to use an object to create a dictionary map as shown below

3842816
google-chrome	firefox
changing background-position in a css sprite on a visited is working for me in firefox 3.6 but not in google-chrome 6

3842879
post	get
the problem is that i can t get the old individual blog post to redirect to the new ones - they have the same name structure on the new domain name eg olddomain.com post-1 is now newdomain.com post-1 but if i type in one of the old post urls i get a 500 error

3842981
printf	strncpy
have you looked into using the alternate safe versions of functions like printf strncpy etc.

3843014
try-catch	exception-handling
is there something pure-java to do this or do i have to create an other type of exception-handling which is not an instance of ioexception to avoid the try-catch body will handle it

3843088
pull	push
i use bitbucket as my repo and i can simply perform push on my dev box and run pull update on stage prod box

3843090
public	protected
you can access public and protected parent member variables via

3843141
opera	firefox
the technique you re using for non-blocking scripts appending a script dom element will not keep script execution order on all browsers only on firefox and opera

3843155
int	chars
the issue is that range treats its arguments like int and if you give it a single chars it will convert it to its ascii chars code

3843155
int	chars
in the first case you re getting all chars between chars a int 65 and chars z int 122

3843155
int	chars
this is one of the rare cases where php converts single chars to their ascii codes rather than parsing the string as int the way it does normally

3843155
int	chars
if needle is not a string it is converted to an int and applied as the ordinal value of a chars

3843168
svg	vml
different ways of rendering the chart svg vml versus html 5 canvas

3843193
hide	show
i have a set of tabbed divs that i am hiding and showing with jquery hide and show this works great in all browsers except ie where the tabbed elements that have been hidden when show are not clickable as links or focusable selectable as form select text field etc

3843230
stdout	stderr
read both the stdout and stderr streams of the process returned by runtime#exec

3843289
cpython	pypy
true lazy evaluation is not available in cpython of course but is available in pypy using the thunk object space

3843331
mouseup	mousedown
i just noticed that mousedown or mouseup event of the datagrid is still fired when the disabled cell is clicked

3843353
post	get
by default php will recognize that get post data that contains s should be made into an array

3843378
children	parent
there is nothing wrong with using pointers for this it s clean using pointers as well because parent nodes own their children so cleanup and destruction is easy

3843387
uiview	subviews
i have a uiimageview add to a uiview as a subviews

3843406
put	get
this will make your complex datamining much more difficult--you don t just need to put data into the database you also need to get it out

3843416
put	get
also you can put asserts into pointer accesses before you get something from the pointer

3843467
git-rebase	undo
i don t think you can undo a hard reset to get uncommitted changes back - you can undo a git-rebase because the blobs are still available but if you never committed your newest changes to git ever anything it overwrote is most likely history

3843486
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview so if you want to make sure your notification is visible to the user you can add it directly to the keywindow using addsubview and it will instantly be the top most view

affinity	processors
also so i don t open yet another question - how can i as a process control my own affinity - on which processors cores should i be allowed to run

3843538
ubuntu	centos
the easiest way is to use any server oriented distro like ubuntu server or centos

3843560
stdout	stderr
note that the php exec functions only capture the standard output stdout not the error output stderr

3843560
stdout	stderr
you should redirect stderr to stdout when executing your command

3843602
inherited	properties
uiimageview inherited from uiview so it has a layer properties

3843643
put	get
this predates d2010 and extended rtti. your #2 looks like the best way to get it and is probably how a hypothetical trttiobject.unitname would calculate it if they were to put one in

3843646
hash	md5
my goal is to submit a md5 hash to and receive the plaintext back

3843649
getter	setter
i tried to create a simple double object and it s getter and setter but when i run the application it throws an error telling that column calc_column doesn t exist because jpa eclipselink is trying to use it as a valid database column column calc_column is either not in any table in the from list...

3843668
pull	push
very good git integration when i pull push my repo i want the management files to go too

3843673

you should probably post some of your code to get better answers

3843687
rss	feed
i m trying to build an rss reader and i m trying to use a feed from craigslist

3843704
oncreate	ondestroy
this causes the normal chain of onstop ondestroy oncreate etc.

3843827
implements	extends
since arrays implements which in turn extends you could use an empty array for your empty collection

3843830
pascal	delphi
but turbo pascal or delphi for the last two lines which we ve already established doesn t support nesting would accept all of those as perfectly valid comments

3843833
udp	tcp
the length of the udp header is fixed unlike the length of the tcp header

3843845
hash	md5
in general the output of a hash function is formatted as a hexadecimal string for example the md5 of foo.mp3 is 10ebb1120767e9de166e0f5905077cb1

3843845
folder	directory
you can create 16 folder one for each of possible hexadecimal characters - so you have a directory 0 one named 1 and so on up to f

3843872
put	get
when you get to a text token that would put you over the limit copy only enough characters to reach the limit generate closing tags for any unclosed tags on your stack and stop processing

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however this only works in firefox and not ie6 7 8 google-chrome or safari

3843968
cyberduck	winscp
cyberduck on mac or winscp on windows are good options

3843989
folder	directory
to stop a user from seeing the directory all you need to do is create an index page in that folder

3843989
ftp	telnet
you can also rename it via telnet or your ftp program and you should be familiar enough with one of those so as not to need explaining

3844097
width	height
for now i am just handling the datacontextchanged event of the window and setting the width and height from the viewmodel manually

3844109
int	double
as far as i know notsimple is not an element such as int double etc

3844126
button	checkbox
what i need is just selecting input file select output directory a few checkbox or such trivial options and big process button

3844134
int	double
2 types can be primitives like int double or objects of a particular class

3844140
floating-point	integer
note that this only depends on integer arithmetic which avoids errors due to floating-point rounding.

3844145
post	get
if you want to post code we can get into greater specifics

3844150
int	boolean
a string is namely an object not a primitive like int boolean etc for which the would work as intented and expected

3844160
pecl	pear
as codaddict already mentioned try pecl zip module or pear file_archive

3844274
pwd	chdir
you can change your pwd using chdir and then do the fopen s

3844283
intersect	contains
i might need to know what all strings a given id contains and then intersect the list with another list obtained for a different id

3844314
width	height
i can control the height via css but cannot figure out how to change the width i want thinner than the default infowindow

3844345
put	get
you have to put in a reasonable amount of effort to get a sensible timestamp

3844399
nunit	mstest
then i ran tests in both mstest 2008 and nunit 2.5.2

3844399
nunit	mstest
nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster

3844399
nunit	mstest
thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

3844428
getter	setter
i wrote a setter and getter method following apple s conventions and noticed that despite having no variable i can still access the setter and getter using the dot syntax

3844449
accessor	properties
likewise accessing a properties which is an accessor message and accessing an instance variable which is just accessing a variable nothing more are very different

3844453
jar	war
both the ejb jar and war are deployed in the same ear

3844458
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it with firefox and google-chrome but seems to work okay

3844489
google-chrome	firefox
i have a div section in which i have an image whose onlick event should execute a function called in it but it is not executable in firefox or google-chrome with my code infact the image is not clickable at all

3844516
mouse	keyboard
it is pretty quick to insert all the quotes and _ in the vba editor if you put them in the clipboard and use the mouse and keyboard to click ctrl-v click ctrl-v buzzing down through the rows

3844526
google-chrome	firefox
however when firefox or google-chrome tries to view the page it won t display

3844608
swt	windowbuilder
i am using google windowbuilder pro for swt and we use a lot of custom components here

3844648
qevent	qapplication
use a queued signal slot connection or a custom qevent and qapplication postevent to do this

3844673
pop-up	dialog
afterwards a dialog box will pop-up when the user next syncs their device asking if it s ok to send data to apple

3844689
getchar	fgetc
btw why did you not use fgetc or getchar

3844708
post	put
i put up a set of simple post on dependency injection and its benefits here

3844710
g++	gcc
to clarify - your source file ends with a .c extension and you are compiling it with gcc not g++

3844733
int	chars
this time the value 65536 can t be considered as a chars at compile time the max value for a chars is 65535 see character.max_value so it will be considered as an int so x will be too

3844733
int	chars
to summarize if one of the operand is an int and the other a chars there are two possible conversions

3844733
int	chars
the int is narrowed into a chars loss of precision

3844733
int	chars
the chars is widen into an int no loss of precision

3844734
int	chars
since you are using a chars the x is 88 in ascii and it is being seen as an int since they are compatible

3844735
int	chars
if one of the operands is of type t where t is byte short or chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representable in type t then the type of the conditional expression is t

3844735
int	chars
binary numeric promotion converts the chars x to an int 88 and the second statement prints 88 - hence the overall result of x88

3844736
int	chars
in your example x is converted from chars to int and x has an ascii code of 88

3844741
int	chars
this applies to both statements since both chars and int are numeric types and thus 5.1.8 trivially applies

3844749
png	ico
use imagemagick to convert the ico files to png files

3844755
dictionary	map
there are 13k airfields in the us and i ve created a map of about 300k permutations again a dictionary with prefixes of varying lengths each corresponding to a list of matches

3844768
accessor	properties
also accessor properties will give you problems they could be mimicked with widely supported non-standard methods such as __definegetter__ __definesetter__ but again you can t change the properties attributes

3844768
inherited	properties
another problem aside the properties descriptors is that the object.create method can accept null as an argument to create an object that doesn t inherited from anything

3844768
inherited	properties
this can t be emulated with the crockford s object.create shim because when the new operator is used with a constructor function that has a prototype properties containing null -or any other non-object value- the newly created object will inherited from object.prototype anyway by default

3844844
getter	setter
properties rather than getter and setter

3844851
hex	binary
if you want to know what it looks like in some other base base 2 or binary you either have to provide the proper printf format string if it exists x for hex or just build that string yourself and print it out

3844905
getter	setter
the only thing that comes into my mind is the abbreviation poco for plain old c-object or pojo for plain old java-object which denominates a very simple object that only has some simple attributes and setter getter for this - no other logic or functionality

3844941
post	get
i need to send and receive get post requests

3844949
getter	setter
insert in every public setter a boolean value like m_ischanged then using a public getter only to check if one of the properties has been changed

3844969
switching	screens
i get the same problem when switching to fullscreen the gray area covers the entire screens but i only have a small box in the corner being rendered to

3844972
put	get
edit i will put example of the site i want to get

3845000
margin	height
easiest fix for this is to simply remove any margin or padding you have on elements you ve set to height 100

3845021
int	chars
since i found that a explicit typecast worked as well chars sizeof int

3845032
int	boolean
boolean operators are usually used on boolean values but bitwise operators are usually used on int values

3845039
onfocus	onblur
i am not able to call a functions on onfocus and onblur events both perfectly working in html but not in php here is code in php

3845096
int	boolean
in theory and and or come straight from boolean logic and therefore operate on two boolean to produce a boolean while and | apply the boolean and or to the individual bits of int

3845126
charindex	substr
using the charindex and substr functions

3845150
folder	directory
i want to point to a folder and then the php script should take the list of sub directory from that folder and save it into the database

3845159
vb.net	vb6
am a vb6 and vb.net average programmer and would be ok if help comes from any of the programming languages i mentioned

3845169
keydown	keyup
also you should be doing this for the keydown event because keyup is too late

3845184
poe	anyevent
you may want to use anyevent or poe

3845220
integer	unsigned
a signed 64 bit integer is long an unsigned is ulong

3845312
x86	64bit
i am using an unmanaged library in a .net application which is used on x86 and 64bit systems alike and therefore is compiled as any cpu

3845312
x86	64bit
is there any way to still keep the any cpu one binary way with different native .dlls regarding the p invoke signatures for x86 64bit systems

3845331

3845442
google-chrome	safari
it works in some browsers but not safari or google-chrome

3845498
webclient	httpwebrequest
you would use the httpwebrequest httpwebresponse classes or simpler requirements can be fulfilled with webclient

3845551
gmail	hotmail
hotmail and gmail users don t receive them or they end up in spam-folder

3845578
profiling	debugging
you will be able to see if you can debugging in the cloud if you can profiling when load testing if you can do fast work inhouse which then works well when deployed to the cloud

3845592
width	height
how can i change the dimensions width height of the body element after the content has been loaded

3845612
public	protected
only public and protected members are accessible in subclasses

3845642
int	chars
the list passed in could be of either int or string and i want to return a list of all members of the passed in list that have an even number of chars

3845657
post	get	post	put	put	get
most of the web servers and frameworks support by default get and post http methods and do not promote or even disallow usage of put and delete methods

3845702
bluetooth	usb
usb device bluetooth usb host

3845710
getter	setter
and of course update getter setter and mapping accordingly

3845760
dbf	dbase
i m using c# and .net 3.5 trying to import some data from old dbf files using odbc with microsoft dbase driver

3845760
dbf	dbase
the dbf s are in dbase iii format and using ibm850 encoding for strings

3845784
quicksort	mergesort
but it would be silly to compare quicksort and mergesort on the basis of the depth of recursion of the mergesort vs

3845795
post	get
then do a get or a post with ajax to delete.php

3845795
post	get
as davide suggested in the comments it might be a better idea to use post commands instead of get to perform this kind of operation

3845807
implements	extends
the easiest way would involve your classes all implements an interface or extends a base class that expose the common attribute lifetime used for the comparison

3845814
width	height
note that you can also use width and height here as well.

3845833
post	get	button	checkbox
if you have a submit button below the checkbox just send the form to the server with post or get whatever you require

3845840
screens	tablet
screens resolution small normal phones large tablet

3845878
uiview	subviews
there are many different kinds of uiview s see the graphic in the uiview programming guide link so for your case you could use a simple uiview with a background image set to your calendar box graphic and add a subviews of type uilabel

3845882
post	put
there really are no performance benefits of using put and delete over post

3845912
multicastdelegate	delegation
because i want to avoid making it specific to the pythonengine and thus engine.operations.invoke i ve tried several ways of storing and implementing these things as delegation but i think the crux of my problem is that i don t know how to store some kind of multicastdelegate base type that is compatible with a pythonfunction

3845920
udp	tcp
then you just use tcp udp normally

3845926
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
this also explains why addition subtraction and multiplication have the same result as a bit pattern regardless of whether you compute with signed or unsigned integers

3845927
versioning	upgrade
i just want to test the app in a real device but it seems the sdk does not match i only have a 10.5.8 mac and can not upgrade to 10.6 rightnow then i could not get the lastest sdk versioning 4

3845933
vbulletin	phpbb
there s phpbb vbulletin but they re older so i doubt they meet the above 2 criteria

3845972
setinterval	settimeout
i m aware of both setinterval and settimeout functions but it s not suitable for my case because i need to create an img dom element in the interval of 7 seconds

3845983
setinterval	settimeout
the solution is to use timers settimeout or setinterval

3845983
setinterval	settimeout
now that you know why a blocking sleep function won t work check out tomalak s link for a few solutions using settimeout or setinterval

3846002
put	get
can some one put a guide or an article which will get me started on the process

3846043
rss	feed
i m using php to process rss data however often feed have more than image in the description

3846058
setinterval	settimeout
you re complaining about settimeout and setinterval but then describing how you are using them badly

3846058
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
either user settimeout not in a loop and have it call another settimeout if there is more to do or use setinterval and call clearinterval after a maintained count is reached

3846077
post	get
if you get stuck with anything you don t understand post it here

3846078
post	get
the implementations vary from simple things like sending get post requests to advanced topics like automatic cookie handling and javascript engines

3846088
decoder	encoder
the mx library has a base64 encoder decoder class but there are a few other implementations laying around..

3846104
backgrounding	multitasking
since ios 4 s multitasking jettisoning also happens to backgrounding tasks.

3846115
puts	gets
you can change where it gets its files from and where it puts them so you aren t tied to its default structure

3846136
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari ie not tested but firefox styles the closebar with the #ebdfd3 background somehow adds a padding to the image and messes up the position of the container element

3846136
google-chrome	safari
i really don t have a clue what to do considering the fact it works in google-chrome and safari

3846160
width	height
i have a problem i want so many control on my window form label textbox how can i disable all control when my form load to caught one by one and do visibilty false is very irretating for me and after that i want to pass the control inside the function and set its width and height how can i achive it

3846206
width	height
you have to realize that your control cannot have the width or height bigger than the container in which that control is

3846225
portrait	landscape
the standard approach is to put the portrait version in res layout and the landscape version in res layout-land with the same name appwidgetmain.xml

3846251
folder	directory
the way i understand the directory structure is that you have source packages in src folder and they are built into the build folder

3846252
width	height
now what happens is that layer4 and layer6 witness some animation but interestingly the height changes and not the width

3846253
unsigned	short
the ranges of signed char unsigned char and unsigned short are implementation defined but again commonly they are -128â 127 0â 255 and 0â 65535 respectively

3846257
calloc	malloc
it hasn t been allocated any space by way of malloc or calloc

3846257
unsigned	short
unsigned short takes up 2 bytes atleast on my system

3846259
postgresql	mysql
in particular you might want to use model classes and a persistence layer to avoid dealing directly with sqlite mysql postgresql odbc blah

3846259
postgresql	mysql
the easiest way is to use the db-provided c library libpq5 for postgresql 8.4 libmysqlclient16 for mysql 5.1 etc

3846265
unsigned	short
such a value not within the range representable by unsigned short

3846265
unsigned	short
in this case your unsigned short can represent values up to 65535 so -35 is brought into range by adding 65536 which gives 65501

3846294
unsigned	short
unsigned short has a range of at least 0

3846321
bash	subshell
pure bash using subshell much slower

3846346
disk	ram
a good host for mysql is a decent two-core system with plenty of ram and the fastest disk io channels and disk you can afford

3846353
postgresql	mysql
i imagine a web developer would have to know html php and database knowledge eg mysql or postgresql

3846353
post	get
i recently read a post on linux journal that mentions redcap but it seems you have to get institutional permission to use

3846354

vb.net will not fade away and vb6 and vba have not yet exhausted their potential

3846487
debian	linux
the top of the file usr local etc mono 4.0 settings.map on one debian linux machine is

3846490
vb.net	vb6
microsoft is focusing on making c# and vb.net not vb6 similar in what is being termed as a co-evolution of the languages

3846502
persistent	transient
a static transient property defines a list of property names that should not be persistent to the database

3846503
persistent	transient
using transient key word gorm can be directed not to persistent specific property

3846503
persistent	transient
digitalcopy property included in transient declaration notifies gorm not to persistent digitalcopy

3846532
int	chars
our compiling process knows that this means storing an int followed by a pointer to an array of chars

3846532
int	chars
it therefore knows that accessing _id means accessing the int at the address of the start of the structure and accessing _username means accessing the pointer to chars at a given offset from the address of the start of the structure

3846543
folder	directory
is there another place in which the root directory for folder is set

3846546

decimal	ieee
decimal is a built in python class that handles floating points correctly as base 10 not as ieee 7somethingsomething standard

3846757
public	protected
don t use inner classes in c++ unless you really know what it does for inner classes protected and private members of the outer classes are seen as if they were public

3846772
width	height
but when this window resizes i want to make the mychild width and height to fit the window

3846784
google-chrome	safari
i have a site that is fully functioning in google-chrome safari and heavily relied on sqlite to store access data

3846800
typedef	struct
you are declaring the struct in the typedef

3846863
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this is either explicit in the class name uiviewcontroller uitableviewcontroller or implicit uitabbarcontroller since a uitabbar is a view

3846892
width	height
an easy trick here would be add empty a href ... s after your img tags and then use css to make them display block position absolute and set the top left height width and z-index to position these otherwise invisible anchors above the relevant parts of your images

3846963
intersect	contains
a given id contains and then intersect

3846963
post	get
they even work together here s a blog post from a 10gen member to get you started 10gen makes mongo

3846978
disk	ram
another possibility might to to use a ram disk

3847015
keydown	keyup
in non-ie browsers before version 9 the event associated with a keydown or keyup event has a keycode property the same property ie uses for all key events

3847039
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
unfortunately this is only supported in very modern browsers like google-chrome safari and the firefox 4 beta

3847050
uibezierpath	nsbezierpath
from what i can see to save messing around with coregraphics i can use uibezierpath i ve done similar with nsbezierpath on the mac

3847074
folder	directory
okay so i m trying to get a directory of folder and sub folder but it just goes into a infinite loop

3847074
folder	directory
what is a better way to create a directory of folder and sub-folders

3847094
vsto	add-in
add-in using visual studio tools for office vsto are automatically loaded within a shim and executes within a separate appdomain

3847094
vsto	add-in
vsto is a gorgeous system for making very rich excel add-in but execution speed is its weakness for applications such as yours

3847108
client-side	server-side
same language for client-side and server-side

3847108
client-side	server-side
i just can t see how sharing code between server-side and client-side could be useful in practice.

3847112
inherited	subclassing
since constructors are not inherited there is no way to force a zero arg constructor to be present unless there are no constructors in the subclassing

3847130
implements	extends
because it makes your code not clean what if you will implements some another class which extends your base class but forgets to implements the foo method

3847146
margin	text-align
the equivalent of align for images is float for div elements it is either margin or text-align depending on if you are dealing with the block itself or some inline content inside it

folder	directory
i am trying to get all music files from all of the nested directory that itunes created and dump them into one folder so that i can use a more competent program to organize my music no offense to itunes fans

3847168
pop-up	dialog
from what i can discern from your question the user experience you are trying to create is a modal pop-up via dialog which contains a series of cascading drop-down lists

3847168
pop-up	dialog
essentially you want to load a modal pop-up via dialog which contains three drop-down lists

3847173
super	extends
the passed list is a or any class not extends number nor in the super hierarchy of number ie

3847173
superclass	subclassing
even if string fits in object which is a superclass of number you woudln t be sure to be able to add a number to a list that contain any subclassing from one of the super classes of number

3847178
mouse	keyboard
i am trying to do away with the mouse and keyboard for an app i am working on and would like to use only the touchscreen

3847203
struts	wicket
if you already know java why not use one of the rich web application frameworks on java such as spring or struts or wicket or google web toolkit

3847247
gif	png
only replace images jpg jpeg gif png

3847280
profiling	debugging
tool support for profiling and debugging multi-threaded multi-event programs

3847321
implements	extends
since number extends object implements serializable this means that the only types that are currently capture-convertible by are

3847321
super	extends
pecs stands for producer- extends consumer- super

3847375
keydown	keyup
i ve edited this based on tim down s comment and replaced keycode with which which is correct across keydown keyup and keypress events

3847378
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
ok let s say i have a navigation system constructed in nested divs and i want to show sub-menu divs and sub-sub-menu divs when i do a mouseover on the menu div and hide sub-menu divs and sub-sub-menu divs on a mouseout or more precisely when i mouseover a different menu div

3847385
post	get
later once the subscriptions is acknowledged you will get post requests with the content of the update in the body

3847431
blogspot	blogger
you do not have to do that google owns blogger blogspot and does that automatically

3847466
superclass	subclassing
in your first choice the logs of a subclassing end up in the category of the superclass

3847470
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop update the arrays with the return value of the function and call the function again

3847483
hide	show
i believe what you need is a popup window where you can have list of options whenever your button is clicked show this window hide it when user selects an item in the list or clicks outside of the working area

3847495
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.3 khtml like gecko google-chrome 6.0.472.63 safari 534.3

3847499
hlsl	glsl
also you need to decide how you will interact with gpu - through gpgpu libs - such as cuda opencl or just through pixel shaders - such as glsl hlsl

3847507
width	height
i have quite an odd problem here - i am using jquery for resizing my background image png width 1793 height 1200 size 872kb

3847538
post	get
i ve not yet coded error handling for when the post does not exist so that when people type random things in the url they don t get the single_post view

3847573
hex	binary	octal	decimal	octal	binary	octal	hex
to make it work with any representation decimal hex octal binary you need to pass in the base as a parameter

3847598
int	chars
also it is a little dubious that value an int variable is assigned and compared against n a chars literal

3847602
rss	feed
i m attempting to generate a dynamic rss feed for a website and i m running into trouble writing a mysql query for it

3847640
width	height
how can i validate image properties height width in kohana 3 before resize

3847660
ati	nvidia
however according to the ati stream computing guide this is the situation for radeon cards for 5xxx banks are 2kb apart and you want to make sure that you distribute your accesses meaning from all worgroups simulateously active equaly over all banks so i would imagine that nvidia cards behave similary

3847700
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
or at least ie8 google-chrome firefox and opera

3847737
integer	unsigned
depending on how you access this memory space either via the f data member or the u data member the program will interpret the memory region as either a float or an unsigned integer respectively

3847744
debian	linux
debian linux distro

3847752
getter	setter
i would define a getter and a setter function in a.c

3847752
getter	setter
using a setter getter has a bunch of advantages

3847760
pull	push
now interestingly if i create an almost blank db with just a single test entry in it i can push pull it fine

3847760
pull	push
either way i did an explicit push this way and a subsequent pull still has the same problem

3847770
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
one tab displays a uinavigationcontroller the other a uiviewcontroller that i have customized

3847770
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it does not appear that the uinavigationcontroller is a delegate of the uitabbar or uitabbarcontroller which would have been one option

3847815
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
what uitabbarcontroller is doing is that whenever you tap a already selected tab it checks if the uiviewcontroller of that tab is an uinavigationcontroller

3847826
rss	feed
if your tweets are public you can grab them in an rss feed without login

3847857
pull	push
i switch my ruby version to 1.8.7 when using taps to push and pull when i get errors so you might want to give that a try

3847870
put	get
how can i get the album and song values and put them into php variables

3847879
client-side	server-side
you can t get this value with php because php processes things server-side and the hash in the url is client-side only and never gets sent to the server

3847898
put	get
all nodes get put in the smallest bbox possible

3847913
implements	extends
if a extends implements b then is a greater-than b

3847919
super	self
it actually equals to super b self .example

3847941
int	double	nsinteger	double
however if not an nsstring i don t know the datatype of value as it could be nsnumber nsinteger int float double etc.

3847946
getter	setter
in other cases in other languages one would have a getter and setter method something like int getid to obtain a value and void setid int val to update it

3847946
getter	setter	public	protected
up until private setter being introduced actually what changed with c# 2 is the syntax for having a private setter and a public or protected getter in the same block we could have a private method to do the work of the private setter so private setter aren t really necessary

3847946
getter	setter	public	protected
encapsulation is a matter not of whether your setter or getter are public private protected or internal but a matter of whether they are appropriate

3847946
public	protected
as for your last question to be immutable means that a class has no public protected or internal setters and no public protected or internal methods that change any fields

3847963
maven	m2e
i use maven and eclipse with m2e for java projects

3847964
hide	show
you only want to hide and show the direct child of #tabs

3847964
fadein	fadeout
include the fadein in the callback of the fadeout this ll make things appear a little smoother since it ensures that fadein only begins once fadeout ends

3848009
public	protected
private setters allow you to create read-only public or protected properties

3848009
getter	setter
yes you can create a read-only property by only specifying the getter but with auto-implmeneted properties you are required to specify both get and set so if you want an auto-implemented property to be read-only you must use private setter

3848015
for-loop	loops
after these changes it should be obvious that you can omit i entirely and therefore replace the for-loop with a while loops

3848017
fadein	hide
edit i removed the hide fadein slow and now it s working correctly in firefox

3848056
super	self
unless you have super -calls involved or more generally subclasses that override x and call directly to a.x self as part of their override s implementation looking for the first item in type self .mro that has an x attribute would work --

3848056
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if you do need to cover for super -calls it s harder -- unless you happen to know that no super -class of a defines an x attribute and of course it s easier to know about your superclass than your subclassing though multiple inherited does complicate it

3848059
folder	directory
so it seems these files need to exist in a folder outside of the library in a virtual directory in iis for instance

3848067
stdout	stderr
so if you explicitly redirect stdout and stderr to nohup.out then nohup doesn t print that message

3848067
stdout	stderr
note that if you redirect just stdout nohup prints a redirecting stderr to stdout message

3848127
google-chrome	firefox
for regression testing in firefox and google-chrome i

3848127
google-chrome	firefox
make sure function x still works after a change you can use the free imacros for firefox and google-chrome addons

3848172
backgrounding	multitasking
i am looking into the feasibility of supporting multitasking while doing audio recordings in the backgrounding

3848230
put	get
it s good to handle this in general even if it s not happening in this case. it depends exactly how it s implemented but i don t think that you re allowed to put a on the end of a command to get it to run in the background

3848236
quicksort	mergesort
i m trying to write my own mergesort function in the same fashion as c s quicksort function

3848255
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
rootviewcontroller - uitabbarcontroller - uinavigationcontroller - subviewcontrollers

3848257
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence and associativity

3848272
afp	smb
our only real issues have had to do with afp and smb on the mac mini -- nothing to do with hudson at all more just our internal network infrastructure

3848286
rss	feed
what i d like to do is have a facebook status feed alongside my twitter feed see footer of this page but cant seem to find a way of doing this without creating an app to convert my statuses to rss then reading the rss in php

3848301
getattr	setattr
for normal attribute access use the getattr setattr delattr builtins

3848310
scheme	racket
i m working on a deque in scheme sicp exercise 3.23 and i ve got a simple doubly-linked list implementation i would like to test out but i can t seem to find out how to print out a circular list in scheme mit-scheme and mzscheme racket

3848315
pull	push
sounds like you could db pull from your main app and then db push into your production app

3848332
ienumerator	idisposable
and again for completeness ienumerator t with idisposable

3848332
ienumerable	ienumerator
c# s foreach keyword supports looping over anything that has a getenumerator method that returns an ienumerator and therefore you can use any type that implements ienumerable with a foreach loop

3848352
jaxws-maven-plugin	jaxb2-maven-plugin
until now my options are jaxb2-maven-plugin axistools-maven-plugin and jaxws-maven-plugin

3848352
jaxws-maven-plugin	cxf-codegen-plugin
this leaves us with the jax-ws ri and the apache cxf stacks and their respective maven plugins the jaxws-maven-plugin instructions to use the jaxws-maven-plugin can be found on the usage page and the cxf-codegen-plugin

3848361
put	get
next i created a windows form application i then added the dll and put it in my resources menu and it builds just fine however at runtime i get a tryloadexception which the documentation seems to say means it s not in the assembly but then why does it compile just fine

3848378
profiler	gprof
it looks like the cpu profiler part is like so many other profilers that are based on the same concepts as gprof

3848388
packets	pcap
pcap will return a pointer to a data packets to me

3848415
free	malloc
you can have the caller allocate a new array and pass in both pointers or you can do it yourself with malloc don t forget to free

3848415
memcpy	memmove
memmove and memcpy may use such optimizations on some architectures

3848417
sip	sdp
i wrote up a couple of code project pages on getting started with sip sdp for anyone else who comes across this page it is pretty generic between languages and apis

3848427
qobject	qvector
in the moment the data is stored column-wise in qvectors together with one global timereference qvector in one seperate qobject

3848474
fread	strlen
fread does not nul terminate the buffer so strlen is not appropriate

3848482
sudo	passwd
i am a ubuntu user 10.04 as of now since i use it over a year i have to manually enter the command sudo pppoeconf everytime i turn on the computer and want to connect to the internet the i click enter some times enter my passwd of my internet provider then i click enter some more times to have internet

3848498
webrat	cucumber
cucumber using capybara and culerity we just converted from webrat in order to get coverage of js-heavy front-ends from cucumber

3848503
ubuntu	linux
i m a ubuntu 10.04 user who is looking for a way to for example make my computer type a + character when i hold down the windows key i think it s called super in linux world and press the k key

3848507
disk	ram
i believe it spawns another process to save to disk does that mean it actually copies the memory and i should always assume if i have 16 gigs of ram 8 is the max for a single redis process

3848608
post	get
the idea is to get the categories and then iterate through all post for each category

3848614
stdout	stderr	feof	fread
using php s proc_open i can start a process read from stdout and stderr separately an arbitrary number of bytes at a time using fread while the process is running detect when the process is done using feof on the stdout and stderr pipes and then use proc_close to get the exit code of the process

3848614
stdout	stderr
read stdout and stderr separately

3848614
stdout	stderr
read stdout and stderr an arbitrary number of bytes at a time while the process is running without having to wait for the process to finish

3848673
client-side	server-side
the types of client-side form fields server-side handlers and database tables match up

3848673
haskell	ocaml
there are also some web frameworks in haskell ocaml and scala that try to do some of that

3848673
haskell	ocaml
there are type-safe embeddings of sql into haskell for example or an html templating language in ocaml that doesn t allow the user to generate invalid html

3848675
stdout	stderr
read stdout and stderr separately an arbitrary number of bytes at a time

3848675
stdout	stderr
as it warns it s easy to get yourself deadlocked when you have separate stdout and stderr pipes if you re not careful

3848700
bindingsource	dataadapter
i also suggest that you read the msdn both related to bindingsource and dataadapter as you need to use both in conjunction for your functionality to work as you would like it to

3848730
innodb	myisam
for a forum should i use myisam or innodb for the table that stores the text

3848747
innodb	myisam
apart from mysql s native full text searching solution which as you already identified requires the myisam storage engine you may also want to consider the popular third-party search engines sphinx and apache lucene with which you can use innodb tables

3848762
innodb	myisam
in fact that is one of innodb s major advantages over myisam it has row-level locking

3848805
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
overloading means two methods or more with the same name but with different parameters just like your example.while overriding you implements a method from an interface or abstract-class so the method in the superclass has an implementation and in the subclassing has a different one still they have the same method name and parameters

3848814
post	get
i want to get my blog post ordered in however way i decide and then have comments ordered within my blog post by reverse order by date or any other sorting i want

3848817
colt	jama
generally though jama jampack and colt are getting old and do not represent the state of the current performance available in java for linear algebra

3848833
hbase	hypertable
bigtable vs cassandra vs simpledb vs dynamo vs couchdb vs hypertable vs riak vs hbase what do they have in common

3848845
hide	show
but when i wanted to hide some of the nodes from appearing on menu while staying show on sitemappath i cannot figure it out

3848858
sorting	filtering
how to index a table innodb or ndb with about 10 possible filtering fields with range sorting ... like this in mysql

3848867
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
ps. firefox google-chrome and opera work a expected

3848869
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

3848943
submit	submission
value and title are only examples the latter should describe what is the purpose of the submit control in a non-ambiguous way there can be many reset controls and obviously a true submission form element

3848955
uiview	cagradientlayer	uilabel	cagradientlayer
how do i make cagradientlayer draw behind the text of the uilabel or do i have to put a uiview behind the uilabel with the cagradientlayer as background

3849099
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller for example maintains a stack of uiviewcontroller each of which handle one page of the display

3849100
yacc	bison
are you using yacc or bison

3849104
int	chars
therefore i would use an int if ever possible or possibly a combination of two int - but certainly never a varchar column - especially if that column is potentially wide 10 chars and is bound to change

3849143
children	parent
in that case you can call qobject children on the widget that is the parent of all your qlineedit s if they share some common name qobject findchildren will also work

3849157
implements	extends
i am looking for hints how this is best implements starting from scratch extends prioriyqueue or queue ...

3849212
post	get
i also want to get the name slug of the post for each comment without running a query for each comment

3849229
vim	emacs
i m trying to switch to emacs from vim for a few months and faced the strange problem

3849250
rss	feed
the first thing the app does is to fetch an rss feed and then display it

3849271
folder	directory
but it will only work if i copy precompt to every sub directory and every folder that contains a .pcf file

3849327
decoder	encoder
but you can easily modify an encoder decoder to do this on android yes

3849343
width	height
i want to add a view inside a framelayout programmatically and to place it in a specific point within the layout with a specific width and height

3849355
textview	listadapter	textview	imageview	imageview	listadapter
the thing that i am wondering is how is the mechanism of listadapter and if i want to write template with xml in i think it will be how it should be composite view that i want to write something imageview and textview

3849373
range	minimum
instead i want to pick them according to the minimum date range in which all items can be picked

3849398
ienumerable	ienumerator
similar to how foreach is with ienumerable and the ienumerator calling getenumerator current movenext although i think it doesn t do this with arrays only collection classes

3849409
width	height
i have a site with width 100 and height 100 and overflow hidden on the body

3849423
width	height
put a link around a box with css-defined width and height for instance

3849556
persistent	transient
is transient and you don t require message persistent

3849559
post	get
the type of request to make post or get default is get

3849582
google-chrome	safari
the problem here is not the function but that safari and google-chrome thinks the scrollheight is something alot bigger than it is

3849582
google-chrome	safari
i have tried alerting the scrollheight and the nr is always around 2000px in google-chrome and safari but in other browsers it is dynamic as it should be 500 300 800 etc .

3849582
google-chrome	safari
i noticed when i click a link on the index and then click the browser back button the iframe does resize correctly in safari and google-chrome

3849582
google-chrome	safari
t figure out why google-chrome safari can #39

3849600
public	protected
on the other hand because javascript has no concept of public and private methods there are no internal methods that could be protected by simply signing a class

3849611
width	height
is there a way to add an onresize event for my tnav or even to send the width height values from the form1

3849613
post	put
if you want it restful you could go about it this way put the parameters to the server at a location of your choosing or you could post them and let the server place them for you

3849613
put	get
consider this put tells proxies that they shouldn t cache the response but a retry by any infrastructure element along the line is definitely possible since it s idempotent just like get

3849613
put	get
what does get give you over put

3849614
qtcore	qtgui
also you can use the core non gui classes by themselves they are in their own qtcore namespace separate form the qtgui namespace and there are compiled to separate dynamically linked libraries

3849617
versioning	upgrade
what i would like to do is use the spare space on the lite versioning data screen to explain that more data is available in the full versioning and offer a button to upgrade however i can t figure out if apple will classify this as upselling well how else am i going to mention the full versioning

3849626
haskell	scheme
some small experience with haskell and scheme i wanted to play around with this library to learn about reasonable applications of this library

3849639
post	get
i use some java script code to get some user inputs and want to attach those to request post data

3849643
google-chrome	safari
i just asked a question about why a certain js code won t work in google-chrome and safari 100 but after more troubleshooting i think i have found out that this is the question i should be posting

3849643
google-chrome	safari
this works fine and it does in fact get resized but in google-chrome and safari the resize is setting a height higher than it should be

3849643
google-chrome	safari
so if the height is 500px then google-chrome and safari sets it to around 2000px which is the maximum of the iframe document height

3849643
google-chrome	safari
one thing that confuses me is that when i click a link on the main page and then hit back the page resize works good and is set to 500px as it should be even in google-chrome safari

3849644
hid	keyboard
i am currently trying to get simple keyboard input on osx right now i am doing it through the leopard hid manager object and that generally works but since that is pretty low level i am wondering if there is an api available that has some extra functionality build it like key repetition or unicode support since when i catch the events on hid i o level i think i have to write all these fancy extras from scratch

3849645
allocator	stl
as to the security holes if you refer to buffer overruns allocator deallocation errors the answer is stl

3849700
outputstream	inputstream
the the client is able to send requests to the server via the outputstream and read server data from the inputstream

3849747
versioning	upgrade
although in the past i managed to manually extract the stuff i needed for my work and add it to the versioning control it becomes a real pita to later upgrade it to a newer versioning - the subdirectory structure changes files change and you never really know what files are the bare necessities and what files can safely be removed

3849749
width	height
as for setting the width and height of the view also like quinn1000 said you supply the v.setlayoutparams method a layoutparams object depending on the container you chose absolutelayout linearlayout etc.

3849776
ocp	principles
i would personally recommend robert martin s articles for getting a good hold on this especially the ocp principles

3849787
imagemagick	pdftk
i need to call ghostscript imagemagick s convert pdftk etc

3849808
width	margin
if your parent div has a variable width and your images are left floated i think the only way to make sure your images are equally spaced is to declare margin 10px on all sides or at least on the left and right side

3849819
metaspace	permgen
as of java 8 the permgen space has been replaced with metaspace

3849819
metaspace	permgen
what is the difference between permgen and metaspace

3849819
metaspace	permgen
java 8 from permgen to metaspace

3849830
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
given an photograph uploaded by a user what is best approach to creating a number various sized thumbnails using imagemagick or graphicsmagick

3849833
google-chrome	safari
at the moment it s a webkit google-chrome safari etc. specific thing you re seeing or rather not seeing as bobince points out in other browsers you can see the real url in the bar

3849873
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the closest thing i can think of is writing a firefox google-chrome ie safari plugin and have the user install it on his her browser to run your gui to control your device

3849899
boost	stl
what i found was the qt s containers were much easier to use than standard template library or some of boost s specialized ones because at the time i didn t know stl well enough

3850037
rss	feed
disable your rss feed too as google uses rss for indexing

3850042
google-chrome	firefox
its blazing fast in google-chrome and dog slow in firefox

3850042
google-chrome	firefox
in the google-chrome profiler i spend 10 in a method in firefox the same method is 30 of the execution time

3850049
rss	feed
before working on an rss feed in php i just had a few questions that aren t covered in the basic online guides

3850053
notepad++	textpad
i have neither notepad++ nor textpad installed so i can t say for sure but one of the following might work there

3850068
superclass	subclassing
assume a valid superclass and a valid subclassing ie the classes work

3850068
super	self
self super init

3850075
post	get
after processing post request your code should redirect a browser using get method

3850095
next	except
this will match anything except z and therefore stop right before the next z

3850148
width	height
i tried adding a standard iframe with height and width 100 however when i use them to display them in the simulator from the local files i cant scroll even after setting scrolling to auto

3850159
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also do keep in mind that there is a java console on the browser ie firefox google-chrome safari you can take a look at to see what s the error you are getting on applet execution

3850176
post	get
check which will be get or post

3850177
equals	gethashcode
so i have a class which overrides equals object obj and gethashcode along with implementing iequatable

3850187
trie	tree
they are purely functional tree indexed fixed-width integers in the form of a trie and thus have fixed depth

3850212
firefox	safari
it works perfect in firefox and ie but not at all in safari

3850248
hide	show
you should hide the ul using js create the li s loaded with content and then show the ul

3850248
hide	show
in fact all the css should be hardcoded into the stylesheet hide the ul load the lis show the ul

3850733
ant	cruisecontrol
is there any way to pass the cruisecontrol modification set to a custom ant task

3850733
ant	cruisecontrol
on any modification an ant script is called by cruisecontrol which in turn calls a custom ant task

3850733
ant	cruisecontrol
this custom ant task needs to know which files exactly have been modified to trigger the cruisecontrol run so that it can select the correct test host based on the names of the modificated files they contain the architecture in their name

int	double
either single or double quotes are fine and int will be treated the same way css does not have a distinction between strings and int

3851102
free	malloc
yes somehow free knows how much was malloc ed but it does so in a way that is not visible or accessible to the programmer

3851102
free	malloc
if you do decide to try and decode what malloc and free does then it will lead you down the road to proprietary compiler implementations

ieee decimal floating point rather uncommon or

3851309
division	multiplication
as hroptatyr mentioned the multiplication is quite fast and it s much faster than division

3851309
division	multiplication
so the basic idea is to transform the division into multiplication like

3851344
super	extends
the children simply extends this calling the super s constructor feel free to use this

3851347
rss	feed
i m parsing forum threads with nokogiri and putting them into a rss feed

3851347
rss	feed
the forum itself doesn t have rss or any other kind of news feed

3851367
int	double
either constructor is going to need a conversion int to int64_t vs int to long double

3851375
getter	setter
what you can do instead is using the good old getter setter and if there is a lot of them generate them with your ide

3851375
getter	setter
eclipse generate all getter setter in package

3851375
getter	setter
java getter and setter

3851383
getter	setter
i m not sure why creating a getter setter for each private variable is a problem but passing around strings that map to a variable s symbolic name would be hard to maintain and confusing

3851401
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr work as expected

3851402
rss	feed
you can embed html in rss items but imo that results in lousy looking feed and can lead to problems farther down the road if someone else wants to reuse the data

3851410
queue	fifo
as a fifo queue you can use for instance java.util.linkedlist or java.util.arraydeque

3851455

3851469
opera	safari
i haven t checked it in opera or safari though

3851478
realloc	malloc
msize called on a pointer returned from malloc or realloc would return the actual amount of memory the system had allocated for the user program at that address which might be more than was requested if it got rounded up for alignment reasons or whatever.

is there a way to configure the emulator to tablet specs namely samsung galaxy tab

3851588
opera	safari
because some browsers older safari and opera report onload completed before css renders you need to set a micro timeout and blank out and reassign the iframe s src

3851592
folder	directory
after performing a clean build i can find stock.class in my classes stockscreener directory however when i click run main project in netbeans i immediately see the class disappear get deleted from my view of the folder

3851596
backgrounding	multitasking
specifically the sections on the application life cycle multitasking and executing code in the backgrounding

3851600
mousemove	mousedown
mousedown creates a high z-index div transparent body with a nice border which has its dimensions informed by mousemove

3851637
touchesbegan	touchesended
but the problem is when i double-tap my touchesended withevent method only fires once but my touchesbegan withevent method fires twice

3851637
touchesbegan	touchesended
since touchesbegan sets a timer and touchesended invalidates it then when touchesended only fires once the timer is still running

3851640
superclass	subclassing
sometimes you want to generate a superclass with certain functionality and allow the subclassing to wrap it up in a neat package

3851641
uiview	subviews
so to get the terminology right a view-controller is an object that manages a single full-screen view or almost full screen if it s nested inside a navigation controller or tab bar controller for example and a view is the big area managed by the view controller as well as all the subviews images buttons labels etc. within it they are all uiview sub-classes

3851691
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 6 os x similar errors in firefox and safari

3851750
inherited	subclassing
it would be impossible for a subclassing to implement a private abstract method because private methods are not inherited by subclassing

3851771
mouse	keyboard
xevie is a x extension providing functionalities to allow users intercept keyboard mouse events

3851776
groupbox	panel
you group radio buttons by drawing them inside a container such as a panel control a groupbox control or a form

3851780
division	multiplication
when you compile this function using g++ -o2 it will not do an actual division but some magic multiplication bit-shifting and correction instead

3851790
groupbox	panel
if you don t like your container to be visible - use panel control instead of groupbox

3851790
groupbox	panel
as you can probably guess the upper one is a groupbox the lower one which is invisble but allows only one readiobutton within it to be selected is a panel

3851842
put	get
then you put the left tab corner background on the link tag and the right one the span maybe it s a bad example because you could use the list tag to avoid the span but you get my point

3851889
goto	break
goto 2 break after a maximum number of iterations or if the last iteration didn t find any improvement

3851915
put	get
when they are added they get put into another queue to be lazily compressed down via gzip or some such

3851919
draggable	droppable
i ve read lots of articles and tried everything i can think of but i can t manage all three position a draggable object make it move correctly and get the droppable object to recognize it

if i define the height and width as fill_parent it fills over the two text views

3852000
submit	submission
use a submit event handler to pick up the form submission and execute script eg using jquery

3852015
wordpress	joomla
the top cmses we re evaluating are wordpress drupal and joomla

3852019
for-loop	loops
i do realize that it is stylistically better to move the declarations outside the for-loop and the swap to the end of the inside of loops

3852050
free	malloc
in c is it enough to just use free on the pointer return by malloc even though the memory-area allocated by malloc may be huge and might have been casted into different types and structs etc

3852061
free	malloc
so it is really ok to call free on it and it is going to release the same amount of memory you initially got by calling malloc

3852063
free	malloc
not only is it ok but the only way to free a memory block allocated by malloc is to give the pointer returned by malloc to free

3852063
free	malloc
as far as the issue of might have been casted into different types and structs etc. - there s no problem with that as far as malloc and free are concerned as long as when you free the block there s nothing left actively using it

3852063
free	malloc
however you might need to be concerned about other issues concerning casting into different types and structs such as alignement and aliasing issues - but malloc and free have no part in that as long as you don t corrupt memory outside the allocated block

3852080
post	get
my present concern is for the get request as post will be handled by the same method i expect

3852080
put	get
another approach would be to put my sso solution in front of these services which would then force people to log in if they don t have credentials so the authentication would be done by sso and since the web service directory could be a subdirectory of the main sso page then i could decrypt the cookie and get the username that way but that would be annoying for the mobile users which would include the senior management

3852091
getter	setter
in case you don t know project lombok helps with some of the annoyances of java with stuff like generating getter and setter with annotations and even simple javabean like generation with data

3852105
firefox	safari
so i m attempting to figure out where my cross-compatibility issue is - from what i can tell firefox and safari have been working great however internet explorer surprise

3852144
guava	lombok
i ve recently discovered an interesting way to create a new instance of an object in guava and project lombok hide a constructor behind a static creator method

3852155
getter	setter
followup - the lombok developers recognize that not generating javadoc comments for synthesized getter and setter methods is an issue

3852156
freebsd	linux
is this 8 bits true for another os such as freebsd mac linux

3852209
chown	chmod
anyway after beating my head against this problem for some time since chown and chmod don t seem to work on mounted samba shares this finally worked

3852230
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux so i m wondering what the easiest way would be to suppress the actual browser instances showing up for the user who started the selenium instances since i am threading like 25 of these at the moment and its kind of strange annoying having all of them open

3852234
nsformatter	nsnumberformatter
creating a subclass of nsformatter or nsnumberformatter in my case and overriding getobjectvalue forstring errordescription as follows overrides the default behaviour of returning nil which makes the binding use the registered default value to instead return 0 when the text field is empty

3852263
width	height
and we want to add a comment at the line minwidth 800 minheight 600 to say this is the minimum width height of the application

3852314
jobs	cron
using cron or scheduled tasks it s pretty easy to get these jobs to run

3852331
wordpress	joomla
my best advice is to look at how other apps drupal joomla wordpress handle localization and implement something similar

3852331
translation	localization
these files are then loaded by a localization class which has functions that handle setting the language to be used based on a config value or user setting loading the file and handle the translation of the string-id into the string value

3852338
packets	multicast
binding filters incoming addresses so if you bind to an adapter address you only get packets with matching destination address unicast packets if you bind to a multicast address you will only get multicast packets

3852338
packets	multicast
to get multicast and unicast packets you must bind to inaddr_any or in6addr_any

3852463
installation	upgrade
is there a guide or guidelines for the upgrade installation process

3852494
put	get
the senior programmer has told me that it s better to put this logic inside currentcustomer s get accessor because then

min	max
the 0.0901 number is simply max - min 10 + smalldelta

3852592
accessor	properties
he is also anticipating not leaving it in the properties accessor but refactoring it elsewhere

3852725
groovy	gpath
in groovy you will apply it in form of gpath

3852736
rtmfp	rtmp
flash is used to communicate with rtmp server and stream video and audio using rtmfp p2p but the actual client logic is handled in c#

3852829
next	except
there s really nothing to be gained by letting them go except a if you re not actively using them you save a few steps and b a few days before expiration next year

3852877
subtract	add
i m using timers to add subtract a number from the current x coordinate to get it to move

3852919
x86	64bit
movq assuming you re talking about x86 is a move of a quadword 64bit value

3852933

postgresql	mysql
many people swear by sqlite postgresql or even mssql i ve admittedly only used mysql and sqlite

3853043
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3853043
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3853058
fseek	fread
at the c runtime library level look at fread fwrite and fseek

3853067
hide	show
as mentioned it would be better to include other elements which you can show hide in their entirety rather than modifying content dynamically like this

3853070
cvs	svn
i m a long-time command-line cvs and svn user

3853096
width	height
the width and height of the silverlight control are such that i should get a vertical scroll bar which i do and no horizontal scroll bar

3853153
disk	ram
also it is unlikely unless your system has less spare ram than your disk controller that scenario 3 will come into play

3853189
int	double
d is for int use f instead it works for both float and double types

3853198
post	get
here type import matplotlib your package name which you are trying to import if you get an error like importerror no module named matplotlib that means as matthew f suggested you need to update your pythonpath either in user specific env or in windows system env otherwise post the error message that you are getting while running the script

3853241
rspec	capybara
i do an rspec integration test of the jquery ui autocomplete functionality by using capybara

3853282
octal	decimal
why does an octal number string cast as a decimal number

3853382
boost	stl
i am a c++ programmer and over the years have been subjected to hearing the notion that stl is not good for use in embedded environments and hence usually prohibited in usage for embedded environment based projects.i believe stl libraries like boost are far more powerful and provide a much more faster less error prone means of development ofcourse the syntax is little intimidating but once past that i think it s a real treasure .also i find the claims that stl is heavy and increases final footprint of code absurd because since it is templatized one is only going to get compilable code which he asked for and not the entire stl

3853382
allocator	stl
coping with huge dymanice allocator by stl containers

3853402
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
i have seen openfiledialog and savefiledialog in silverlight but what if i required to select path of folder in my computer

3853407
qlist	qvector
classes like qlist and qvector can be replaced by stl counterparts without much problems but the signal slot part is something else

3853407
put	get
if it s not you ll have to get each sample out of the qvector and copy it to a memory chunk then process then put it back in the qvector

3853407
qlist	qmap
which brings us to your question about qlist qmap it can be done with any of them but they are actually designed as dynamic containers with random access iterators while you are having chunks of memory of a fixed size holding 2d data

3853439
boost	stl
finally boost is template based so if your looking at the size of generated template code it ll suffer the same as stl

3853439
boost	stl
to clear up my last statement which was just refering to boost vs stl

3853439
boost	stl
stl gains because you can pass your project around and not require a download accompanyment of boost

3853464
strtol	atoi
the process that did popen could then read that line from the filehandle it got and extract a useful pid from that using strtol or atoi and keep that around to use with kill later on after having read the actual output of its child process

3853515
udp	tcp
keep in mind that tcp has some reliability features not found in udp

3853534
submit	submission
i would like to change the default behavior of zend_form so that whenever the submit button is clicked form submission is prevented and an arbitrary javascript function is called

3853537
wordpress	joomla
it is true that drupal has got a sharper learning curve than joomla or wordpress

3853537
wordpress	joomla
but drupal i believe is more powerful than wordpress and joomla

3853537
wordpress	joomla
wordpress though fast maturing with version 3.0 is still a ways away in being as feature rich as drupal joomla

3853538
tostring	getter
the same goes for the tostring annotation and its parameters which clearly communicate the desired behavior regarding included excluded fields usage of getter or field access and wether or not to call super.tostring

3853538
getter	setter
and again by annotating an entire class with getter or setter accesslevel.none and optionally overriding any divergent methods it s immediately clear what methods will be available for the fields

3853560
google-chrome	firefox
it shows nicely in firefox google-chrome

imperative	declarative
i read several tutorials on cas they use imperative declarative security to use the cas

3855677
cpu	hyperthreading	fflush	gets
this contrasts with the situation on a cpu without hyperthreading where when the instruction pipeline stalls it has to be fflush and refilled with instructions from another process before the cpu gets back up to speed

3855677
processors	hyperthreading
if you are running loads in which pipeline stalls are perfectly synchronised and represent a major part of the total execution time of your program mix then you might double the speed of a program by going from an unhyperthreaded processors to a hyperthreading processors

implements	extends
uikit is not thread safe therefore you cannot change the view from the background all nsobjects have the selector performselectoronmainthread since nsthread extends nsobject then you can use that method to execute code in the main thread that is where you should change the uiviews frame also you must have the reference to the uiview somewhere...the way i would do it is define a protocol on the nsthread subclass and implements the protocol in the views view controller then whenever u need to change the view frame call the delegate method in the main thread to change the views frame...hope this helps

post parameters are lost because sendredirect sends a 302 moved temporarily redirect which instructs the browser to load the specified page with get request

3858995
free	malloc
create a global or static memory pool where you can put your objects imitating the heap malloc free

3858998

melt	reshape
in response to your comment i believe cast and melt from the reshape package are much simpler for your purpose

3859054
pull	push
for when you re moving it to from a parent class you can use refactor- pull up or push down but this will not automatically change references for you only an issue with push down

i understand the getter setter methods but have yet to understand any of the information online for constructors or even understand their purpose

3859356
getter	setter
i have to create getter setter and constructors for each of the properties so it would seem i should learn to use these methods

3859441
int	chars
you are interchanging int and chars with the assignment of without a cast

3859442
hash	salt
one potential problem i can see is using the same salt every time when generating the sha-1 hash

3859442
hash	salt
if you use the same salt every time the attacker could very easily determine the hash for 0.99 or some other low amount and then substitute that in for any transaction they want to pay 0.99 for

3859445
width	height
the second line coerces it into a matrix of height m+1 and inferred width note that it must be square for this to work

so sorting as a date time and filtering like a string would be what i d like but can t seem to bring the two together

3859727
vmware	virtualbox
you best bet is probably a virtual machine vmware or virtualbox and taking a snapshot before compiling and running the program

3859751
firefox	safari
i m guessing that firefox is taking the first xsl text command literally while ie and safari are treating it as part of the page

3859751
firefox	safari
are ie and safari correctly rendering this or is firefox

a mailserver especially of the larger isp s and free services gmail hotmail msn live etc. will not stand for a torrent of mail without fighting back after the first couple of hundred thousand they start rejecting you

3860059
alarmmanager	wakelock
the caveat with this example is that it does not deal with the wakelock gap the excellent commonsware code does that if you need it but it may give you some more ideas about how to potentially address the poll using alarmmanager and service stuff

3860067
implements	extends
you could implements your own session org.apache.catalina.manager and swap it into tomcat s configuration although the interface looks rather lengthy - so perhaps look at extends managerbase or standardmanager first

just tested opera and safari and it works on both of them as well

3860102
dictionary	map
if you pass that hurdle then the nightmare of making the hash values somehow magically consistent arises -- and what if two actually different keys in one dictionary map to equality in this sense with the same key in the other dictionary which of the two corresponding values should be used then..

g++	gcc
i m using mingw gcc g++ gcc 3.4.5 to compile

3860112
pull	push
how can i push pull to and from both accounts from their respective github credentials

3860149
post	get	post	put	put	get
the problem seems to be that php only really completely understands two http methods get and post with put considered to be for file uploads

3860149
post	put
just forget the put verb and use post instead

3860153
post	get
for example to obtain form parameters you can use to get the form input value either query string form post or cookie with the name input1

3860169
min	max
another option is to calculate formulae for the intervals that form each edge essentially lines with a min and max value and solve these

3860197
next	except
uncheck everything except other and type ctrl+j into the field next to it

3860422
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

3860430
irix	linux	solaris	irix
this page which i can t read right now maybe blender.org is down shows that blender 2.49b for windows was built with python 2.6 for linux irix and solaris doesn t say for macosx for powerpc requires python 2.3 for macosx for intel 2.3 or 2.5

3860430
maya	blender
python 2.5 is pretty solidly guaranteed for reasonably recent maya and blender except for blender 2.49b on macosc for powerpc only you re limited to python 2.3

3860464
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome and ie8 in compatibility mode

3860486
google-chrome	firefox
imacros for firefox google-chrome free open source works with many ajax sites and works on linux too

3860486
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome version is still a bit buggy but the firefox version works great

3860490
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib

3860495
free	malloc
the implementation for this modified behaviour of free using malloc_trim could be done using the malloc hook functionality

3860513
versioning	upgrade
i leave the upgrade code the same for each installer versioning

3860530
post	put
if your in earnest i could probably put together a usable example and post it on my blog or something

3860574
subscript	superscript
other things in mathematica work like normal word processors -- you can style fonts as italic bold big small colored -- but the subscript and superscript functions common in word processors seems to be missing

3860615
multiplying	multiplication
if you are using one thread do to do one multiplication then for that thread you have to pull two pieces of data from memory multiplying them then do some logarthmic number of adds

3860620
rsa	aes
the programs i use have 2048 bit rsa and 256 bit aes level encryption respectively

3860629
hide	show
what i m trying to do is show hide a list of options depending on the approprate check box status

3860636
versioning	upgrade
well the basic processes workflow are delivered as part of the product our customers can change these processes and adapt them to their needs the problem arises when trying to upgrade to a newer versioning of the product then trying to update the database records data there are problems for records deleted or modified by our customers

3860640
spaces	delimiter
so basically you have to first iterate over the stream copying each character into another streambuffer and then when you hit a delimiter like a spaces or a comma use the second streambuffer with the time_get facilities

3860644
implements	extends
as you mentioned a class like hashset implements set but a class like treeset though it also extends abstractset implements sortedset instead which is more specific than just set

3860644
implements	extends
it extends abstractqueue but doesn t explicitly implements queue

3860678
width	height
this goes wrong early the size of the rotated bitmap is not width x height

3860687
matplotlib	scipy
update i think the following first example named tick label like annotations on the matplotlib transformations page of the scipy cookbook covers the general method you re after

3860690
put	get
unfortunately if i put a breakpoint in the position indicated in the code above then all i get is the typeloadexception with no inner exception

3860704
width	margin
slogan should have a fixed width for the margin 0px auto to center it

3860754
hash	md5
you could generate a hash on the server such as an md5 or better sha-1 or something based on the form structure which you then send back to the server on the form submission and recalculate on the server to see if the user tampered with anything in the form

3860812
wordpress	joomla
i would tend to stay away from wordpress as extending it is not nearly as simple as drupal or joomla

3860851
subtract	add
but the original load store add subtract and or etc instructions are all there

3860851
subtract	add
286 specific nuances may not work perhaps as with other new features of specific generations but the core instructions load store add subtract push pop etc all still work and will continue to work

3860851
toolchain	binutils
you will want an instruction set reference and an assembler like nasm or gas gnu assembler part of binutils that comes with most gcc based compiler toolchain

3860934
post	get
you must add a post as ie tends to cache the data results using get requests

3860943
int	chars
my view is that a c implementation cannot satisfy the specification of certain stdio functions particularly fputc fgetc if since the int needs to be able to hold any possible value of unsigned chars or eof -1

3860943
range	minimum
obviously sizeof int cannot be 1 if char_bit is 8 due to the minimum required range for int so we re implicitly only talking about implementations with for instance dsps where typical implementations would be a freestanding implementation rather than a hosted implementation and thus not required to provide stdio .

3860943
int	chars
chars converted to an int and advances the associated ï le position indicator for the

3860943
int	chars
reading back unsigned chars values outside the range of int could simply have undefined implementation-defined behavior in the implementation

3860943
int	chars
then there would be no way an application could read any data written by itself only from an input device on stdin which could be implemented so as to only give positive chars values which fit in int

3860943
int	chars
eof is traditionally -1 but may be any negative int and hence distinguishable from any valid chars code

3860953
mouse	keyboard
it s probably better to just fork out and buy a mac mini then you can use your existing monitor mouse and keyboard and it s pretty ok price wise

3860966
width	height
one of these properties is dimensions returns a class with height width and depth properties

3860971
lxml	beautifulsoup
libraries like beautifulsoup lxml or even pyparsing will make for more robust web scrapers

3860982
int	chars
because a hosted implementation must implement stdio.h and if fwrite is to be able to stick int on the disk then fgetc could return any bit pattern that would fit in a chars and that must not interfere with returning eof

3860996
backgrounding	multitasking
your app does not need to take advantage of the multitasking features but it does need to gracefully handle being put in the backgrounding and never receiving a notice that the application will quit

3861015
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also as an addenda i d strongly suggest that you develop your sites scripts with either google-chrome with the web inspector safari webkit as with google-chrome mozilla firefox with firebug as above and or opera with dragonfly

3861099
width	height
i don t understand why you are accessing pixel data blindly by 1d index while you already know the image dimension proved by the usage of iplimage height and iplimage width and opencv does provide function to access pixel value

3861111
free	realloc
and your first realloc calls the length with 0 which is a free

3861121
lisp	smalltalk	eiffel	smalltalk
not surprising given that ruby was influenced primarily by perl smalltalk eiffel and lisp

3861143
onclick	onsubmit
all this being said it s quite possible that overriding onsubmit of the form is more in-line with your interests than overriding the button s onclick anyway as s.jones suggested but at least this should solve the mystery

3861167
filtering	grouping
you can do this by choosing the content grouping in the views filtering drop down

3861207
pop-up	dialog
use jquery dialog they are purely javascript and so pop-up blockers will not block this

3861271
versioning	upgrade
it s a script that upgrade internet explorer so that it will act as a newer versioning

3861291
post	get
maybe is too easy but can t really figure out how to get this done because i don t know how to deal with custom post types and taxonomies in an homogeneized custom permalink structure

3861306
post	put
you re probably sending your request with the wrong verb post instead of put

3861387
post	put
in that i have put method or post method which consumes the json as mediatype in the rest web service

3861387
post	put
how do we pass that json as input from client side to those put and post method and how would we consume the json format in the put or post method from server side

3861404
hide	show
this hide both the elements i want to hide small and show the big form

3861426
octal	decimal	octal	hex
hex decimal octal unsigned signed string character etc are manifestations of programming languages

3861426
int	chars
it may seem logical to use unsigned chars above but unsigned int depending on the target processor could produce much better cleaner faster code

3861443
width	height
then use a single call of fillarc int x int y int width int height int startangle int arcangle to draw your crescent shape

3861465
sitecore	kentico
hope there are some people around with experience in multiple big w-cms s sitecore kentico episerver etc

3861506
int	chars
the interface for fgetc says that it returns the chars read as an unsigned chars converted to an int

3861506
int	chars
similarly nowhere does it say that you can t pass eof to fputc so long as that happens to coincide with the value of an unsigned chars converted to an int

3861506
int	chars
of course platforms where you will have real problems are those where and the conversion from unsigned chars to int is not an injection

3861540
int	chars
sizeof int 1 with one-complement s or sign-magnitude negative values or padding bits in the int type not all unsigned chars values can be converted to a valid int value

3861636
post	get
the http command would almost always be get or post and would be almost irrelevant

3861643
primefaces	richfaces
you can t use richfaces 3.3.3 and primefaces together

3861643
primefaces	richfaces
primefaces needs jsf 2.0 features and richfaces 3.3.3 doesn t work with them

3861683
ssl	https
in this case your service will be secured with https requires server certificate for ssl which has to be trusted on clients and authentication will be provided on message level with username token profile soap header

3862026
submit	submission
somebody could submit post requests to your form submission pages without actually using your site which is the exact same problem

3862027
implements	extends
you could create an interface or an abstract class let s say typeabstract for instance that typea and typeb would extends or implements depending on your choice

3862068
post	get
i would get those strange outputs under the list of post

3862075
submit	submission
this is a noob question i belieive in a content management system as well as several other types of sites that work on submission once you submit a url in a url shortening website for instance how do you use php to redirect to the appropriate url without a 404 or without using an htaccess

versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to visual studio 2010 which includes versioning 2

3862230
folder	directory
don t think there s much difference other than it looks like you can drop schema classes in the grails-app ldap directory instead of having to specify them in config - i do it the same way as you with schemas specified in the config but might be worth trying them in the grails-app ldap folder

3862261
google-chrome	firefox
if it s in google-chrome or firefox then you won t be able to access the cookies through httpwebrequest and even for newer internet explorer versions i m not sure if you get automatic access to the cookies when going through winhttp.

folder	directory
if the library comes in a zip i usually decompress them under a c dev directory in order to facilitate further migrations and to make the folder shorter to type and easier to find

3862755
folder	directory
instead i will then use the cmake gui to browse for the directory where the header files and the library files are located and manually set up the correct folder

3862880
google-chrome	firefox
as to the cookie name the default name for asp.net session cookie is asp.net_sessionid but the name can be different as it can be changed in web.config or they might not be using asp.net sessions their own implementation for example so you ll have to check the cookies you get from the domain of that application you can use an http sniffer like fiddler or more easily if you re using firefox or google-chrome you can check the names and contents of the cookies you get from that domain in the options dialog box

3862883
httphandler	httpmodule
you need to watch out for things like custom httpmodule and httphandler that your root application may use but your sub-applications don t

3862955
memcpy	memset
for simple operations such as memset memcpy etc where there is very little computation there is little point in simd optimisation since memory bandwidth will usually be the limiting factor

3862966
post	get
but i don t like webob s php-like usage of get and post for parameter dictionaries because http is not limited to get and post and the distinction is not necessary when accessing params

3862972
post	get
also check the httpclient is doing a get not a post

3863010

accessor	ivar
in this line you simply assign a string value to your ivar and your accessor methods do not get called - so if you re assigning autoreleased string it may be released and become invalid

3863095
post	get
worked it out in advanced list properties you can set an option to edit only your own post however where i was going wrong is the ui still shows the edit option but you get an access denied message when you try and save....great

3863399
ienumerable	icollection
use ienumerable if client code needs to index use icollection and so forth

free	malloc
it depends on the implementation of malloc free how exactly this memory is handled internally

3863484
free	malloc
malloc will manage the memory internally in some way and doesn t necessarily immediately return anything free to the os

3863484
free	malloc
it probably just internally marks it as free and would reuse it on later calls to malloc

3863484
free	malloc
the physical memory used might increase because the memory that is getting free needs to be swapped in if your malloc implementation stores some management information next to the allocated block for example how big the block is

3863502
installation	upgrade
installation cannot upgrade a per-user

3863518
dynamic-languages	typechecking
a lot of people complain about java these days but despite the lack of static typechecking most people would probably consider ruby and python easier to write in most cases java being a fairly simple static language-which are much harder to design well without large built-in feature sets then a simple dynamic-languages

3863523
public	protected
hmm first check the definitions public private protected etc then check the build order

3863864
post	put
however you can of course put the post data in your response body and give them to your swf that way via flashvars

3863902
superclass	subclassing
subclassing is in this context there are other contexts that are completely different another name for a derived class in which context the base class is called a superclass which is why java has a keyword super that is analogous to base in c# though with some differences

3863980
post	get
webob allows you to access post get parameters jointly by accessing request.str_params attribute

3863980
post	get
additionally request.method gives you acces to the http request type which is not limited to post or get

3864003
post	get
for what it s worth preauthenticate doesn t need to be set for get requests only post although if you do set it for a get request everything will still work but take slightly longer

3864036
many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-one	one-to-many

3864231
dictionary	map
however for numbers back to words that s quite a different problem and the easiest solution to this is to just build a dictionary and map both ways

3864282
min	max
if you hate joins you could combine the max and min managers and even then it would work if there is always 2 managers and they can t have the same name

3864283
ant	maven
in turn the ant-plugin very occasionally calls out to some native scripting language application packager whatever but we re finding that over time we can generally find a maven or ant plugin task to do the trick

3864990
expandablelistview	spinner
i would like to use a spinner to allow users to select values from the 2nd lvl of the array but i would like to display the selection options in a expandablelistview using the values of the 1st lvl of the array as category headers

3865008

i have an asp login form that opens into a prettyphoto modal window via iframe from my main asp page

3865190
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you would probably want to do the animate block in viewdidload or viewdidappear

3865269
post	get
however if i change the post to get and change request.form to request.querystring it does work

3865269
post	get
the problem with get is that we can t enter very much data into the description field of our form without getting a 414 error - hence the use of post

3865283
dictionary	map
like django s lets me store and retrieve nested dictionary attributes but written entirely in python to ease deployment and avoids javascript syntax for map reduce

haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
lisp scheme ml haskell etc

put	get
to keep things simple i can accept the same protections in place on both dev and beta -- basically don t let it get spidered and put something short of user names and passwords in place to prevent everyone and their brother from gaining access again there s a need to be practical

3865419
onresume	onpause
i imagine such a task will never have onresume or onpause called

3865441
post	get
in addition you can mark your action method as only accepting post requests to prevent any one from trying to access it with a get request

3865513
vsto	add-in
i am convinced you are on a wrong way com add-in based on add-in express vsto or shared add-in should read and write excel cells at the same speed

3865513
vsto	add-in
vsto doesn t allow developing a com add-in supporting office 2000-2010

3865513
vsto	add-in
vsto beats add-in express in one area it allows creating so-called document-level add-in

the steps to get mysql and entity framework working are available in this blog post

3865596
expandablelistview	spinner
you cannot directly use an expandablelistview for the spinner popup any more than you can directly use a listview for the spinner popup

3865596
pop-up	dialog
subclassing spinner and overriding whatever drives the pop-up dialog

3865596
pop-up	dialog
copying spinner into your project and replacing whatever drives the pop-up dialog if overriding will not work due to method visibility etc.

3865596
expandablelistview	spinner
don t use a spinner and instead use a button plus an alertdialog containing an expandablelistview or something like that

3865609
folder	directory
the application s working directory is not where the .exe file is located but probably in the bin debug folder

3865662

xml serializable deserialization is rarely the constraining factor

3865762

3865764
post	get
i ve made a similar chaining interface before i like your idea of using it on get post vars

3865831
post	put
if you d like to pass the id value of the page to the next page in a post request without using flashdata you can put it in a hidden input box with name page_value or something

3865844
bash	zsh
since you are using bash this would also apply to zsh or similar you could use its in-built parameter substitution

3865889
post	get
using a post instead of a get isn t really going to help fix your problem because anyone can fake a post nearly just as easily as a get

3865892
rar	zip
how might i get the size of the contents of a zip rar 7z file after full extraction

3865910
vb.net	vb6
this is redundant both in the vb6 and the migrated vb.net

3865910
vb.net	vb6
so just change to this in either vb6 or vb.net

3865910
vb.net	vb6
you could just replace with this code in either vb6 or vb.net

3865914
folder	directory
by default excel assumes that the folder of the file specified is user s my documents directory

i have a web application some functionality of which is available as a toolbar in a browser ie firefox google-chrome

i ve spun up two codeigniter applications both relatively simple and both took twice the work twice the amount of new code than if i had gone with say cakephp

3866092
int	double
they are concrete data types--they aren t abstract but are as concrete as int and double

3866104
int	chars
fgetc returns an int not a chars so you can tell the difference between eof and a chars with the same value as eof

int	chars
the problem is that you re storing the int return value of getc in a chars which collapses 0xff onto -1 actually it s implementation-defined behavior but that s what common implementations will do

3866129
int	chars
the return value of getc is an int whose value is either in the range of unsigned chars or eof which has value -1

3866130
put	get
if i loop through the whole collection i m going to get duplicates of my property types unless i put some ugly previous value and current value comparisons in there

3866173
int	chars
i personally go for option 2 in my apps as that s how i ve seen most third-party applications do it and it avoids the slew of problems that you already brought up in your post with regards to mixing chars and int primary keys in the django orm

3866177
client-side	server-side
you ll probably need to learn both a server-side and a client-side language

3866189
width	height
to solve this problem you can set width and height of the main div

3866189
width	height
if you set width height and overflow auto you ll get also a scrollbar in case of a too long content

3866217
int	chars
edit i realized this write is part of iostream library is this the same as the int write int fd chars buf int size system call

3866271
put	get
if you find that if you put them in one table you will routinely have to add a type check to all queries so you only get the right one then they fail the data test

3866298
macvim	textmate
about 6 months ago i switched from textmate to macvim for all of my development work which primarily consists of coding in ruby ruby on rails and javascript

3866298
macvim	textmate
any ideas on how to fully replicate the textmate behavior described above in macvim

3866353
super	extends
you can extends change the behavior of your super parent class

3866353
implements	extends
where you are more interested in having the class implements some kind of a contract service methods with arguments - more of a contract and the behavior is different for different implementation nothing generic that you can bundle up in an abstract class and extends the behavior

3866396
sitecore	dotnetnuke
i m wondering just where a cms - out of box like sitefinity sitecore sharepoint dotnetnuke etc

3866408
ssl	https
i have a website thats currently being accessed on an https url but the certificate is expiring soon and we do not want ssl on this website anymore so just an http access is fine

codeigniter	cakephp
great documentation that would limit you to codeigniter or cakephp

3866449
unicode	ucs
utf-8 is like the other utf encodings a character encoding to encode characters of the unicode character set ucs

3866495
int	double
math.max has overloads that take int double and decimal

3866496
width	height
i think that since you are setting both the height and width properties that the image is coming up with a weird aspect ratio

3866511
google-chrome	firefox
i tried to call my helloworld by just including javascript inside webform but when running it page is blank on both google-chrome and firefox

3866544
equals	compareto
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equals only if they are equals in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equals to 2.00 when compared by this method

3866548
put	get
afaik you can simply get the python executable and put them somewhere where the scripts can access them inside your project code

3866556
post	get
it looks like you need to get the result for hdntype from your post action first in a separate function then call submit on the form

3866608
opera	google-chrome
i can t seem to get the following functionality to work under google-chrome and opera latest versions on windows xp

3866611
try-catch	exception-handling
the application exception-handling should be used only for the program not to crash and for logging purposes not to be used as one big try-catch aound the application

3866613
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
apple only supplies you with callback methods such as touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

3866623
int	chars
given int a float b chars c sometimes all of them or none of them can be set

3866637
stdout	stderr
for a compiler error messages about the code being compiled are the normal output so they should be written to stdout not stderr

3866722
hide	show
there s a seperate spot where i show hide the create new link as well

3866751
google-chrome	firefox
have you tried to run it in a debugger like firebug for firefox or google-chrome s developer tools

3866784
ant	maven
i m currently migrating our build process to maven from ant

3866813
comparator	comparable
i am creating a list holding comparable objects and wish to create one object that serves as the minimum of the list such that it always returns -1 for its comparator method

3866841
getter	setter
i have the following code for a property whose getter setter i write manually using the dynamic keyword

3866841
getter	setter
if i add the retain i assume it is going to be ignored because i wrote the getter setter myself

3866879
queue	fifo
i am trying to make a fifo queue that is filled with my own class object

3866889
getter	setter
so even if you do have your own setter and getter you need to keep the retain to keep your place in memory because in the end you only have a pointer to that position and that is why the compiler tels you that you may modifying another object or what ever takes the place of your object

3866935
spaces	delimiter
delimiter include white spaces spaces tabs newlines the comment-start character | which can occur on its own line or after other text and the comma to separate operands in an instruction

3867026
public	protected
instead of private it can also be declared default protected or public

3867035
gif	png
so for perfect compatibility you should stick to gif jpg or png formats

3867056
getter	setter
1 is there someway i can leave the data in that panel and just access it with getter setter

3867056
getter	setter
should i for instance move the player data to the jframe class which holds all the panels and add getter setter there

3867099
opera	google-chrome
opera uses a dotted underline and google-chrome doesn t style it all for example

3867131
opensuse	linux
i run a 64bit linux machine with opensuse 11.3 i have the necessary -devel and -32bit packages installed to build applications in 32bit mode

3867131
ubuntu	linux
i found the following instructions for ubuntu linux h p indefinitestudies.org 2010 02 08 how-to-build-32-bit-python-on-ubuntu-9-10-x86_64

3867145
typedef	struct
in addition you have to distinguish between the forward declaration of a struct and of a typedef

3867145
typedef	struct
the easiest way to have that is to use the same token as struct tag and as a typedef identifier

3867145
typedef	struct
you d have to find out to which it applies to the struct declaration or the typedef

3867192
installation	upgrade
clickonce will greatly simplify this process of installation upgrade

3867245
width	height
what do i do to limit just one of two dimensions width or height and let the component and or the layout manager decide automatically about the unspecified dimension

3867259
for-loop	loops
unlike the standard for-loop the enhanced for-each loops isn t trying to make guarantees about its own mechanics

3867275
for-loop	loops
what value should obj have before the for-loop is run and what value should it have after loops is run

3867416
int	chars
the ti c55x compiler i am using has a 16bit chars and 16bit int and does include a standard library

3867432
innodb	myisam
having written a similar query on a different large table i did notice that changing the engine from innodb to myisam sped up the query considerably innodb is not needed for these tables as they do not have foreign key checks

3867442
filtering	grouping
add another filtering from the drop down grouping content

3867471
int	double
double can accurately represent int up to a very large value 2 53 no rounding errors up to that value

3867552
profiling	instrumentation
another recommended option when profiling asp.net is to profiling using instrumentation mode

3867562
pop-up	dialog
either the pop-up disappears when the modal dialog is displayed staysopen false or it stays visible on top of the dialog staysopen true

3867562
pop-up	dialog
however i did find a work-around that approximates the behavior i wanted simply re-open the pop-up isopen true after the dialog is closed

3867582
vxworks	qnx
posix is probably the closest you will get to that being supported on linux unix osx which is unix qnx vxworks beos and many others

3867620
error-handling	exception-handling
local cf dev exception-handling thrown by error-handling template

3867688
versioning	upgrade
don t want to worry about versioning upgrade for the client libraries - to make a lot of work to upgrade my existing code

3867737
udp	tcp
in general the sort of while listener loop you re describing is created in a thread for instance a udp or tcp server waiting for a connection

3867738
hide	show
when you click on a link it will hide the one currently show and only show the section corresponding to the link you clicked

3867745
unsigned	short
this can get negative so q shouldn t be of type rgb16 which apparently is unsigned short but of type short instead

3867766
folder	directory
just make sure your version control directory are not in a reachable folder for the webserver inside the document root and you can keep checkouts rather then exports there without much problems

3867783
clang	llvm
clang with llvm will generate high quality asm files

3867795
hide	show
because this is a product with multiple clients we need to enable disable hide show buttons based on the features client have bought

3867831
ostream	istream
conversely you could accept an istream to read from and an ostream to store compressed results into

3867902
tostring	string.format
in some situations it can be useful to use string.format and again the tostring method is called for you

3867936
pull	push
and then working locally i can push and pull without trouble

3867944
width	height
but now i d like to be able to interpret parameters like height width etc

3867949
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
add tags in code like rcs cvs svn for history information

3867949
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
additionally can tfs do something similar to rcs cvs svn as mentioned

3867954
getter	setter
bean should be considered just an object for temporary state preservation having setter and getter that might have light additional functionality

3867954
getter	setter
the term bean started to be used in spring framework for instance where it is just a class that is part of application context spring container not a getter setter javabean at all

3867978
serializable	deserialization
i ask because of all the serializable deserialization that will be going on between the 3 services is probably going to consume a lot of cpu for the server and have a performance impact on the application as a whole or am i wrong

3867979
uicontrol	uibutton
you must use a uicontrol to properly get event dispatch for instance a uibutton instead of simple uiview uiimageview

3867987
versioning	upgrade
at my current job it goes without question that if a new versioning of a technology that we use in our project is released we upgrade it asap

3868007
inherited	properties
how do i modify this entity or do i create a separate documentviewmodel class for it to support multiple document types with common properties so some form of inherited or interface implementation should be implemented

3868014
cassini	iis
the error goes away when i remove the web.config or remove the virtual path new debugger configuration or move debugging from cassini to iis and manually create an application at new

3868014
cassini	iis
this and cassini are supposed to make it easier for my content creators to participate in development and testing with their local copy of vs2010 without having to install iis on their windows pcs

3868015
vsto	add-in
i ve got a word add-in in vb.net and vsto that exposes a com compatible object via word.comaddins.object so that the add-in functionality can be called external to word without accesses to word itself being cross-process

3868015
vb.net	vb6
the technique worked in vb6 but with vb.net it still works but it s much slower than the same code running directly from the addin via a task pane as if the calls are all cross process when they shouldn t be

3868015
vsto	add-in
but i put together this vb.net vsto add-in and expose my add-in object via the requestcomaddinautomationservice function of vsto s connect object

3868045
initializer	class-method
static class-method can also be passed without initializer an object of that class by passing the class name instead of an object at index 0

3868083
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
open an url in safari firefox google-chrome

3868093
width	height
if there are more panels then the containing panel can hold in its width then they are gridded downwards and if there are more panels then the containing panel can hold in its height then the inner panels are aligned in the same grid with the exception of the last row which is centered with the row before last

3868098
for-loop	loops
however in either case you can also use a for-loop and check each characterâ loops is essentially what these two wrap up

3868099
tripledes	aes
i personally would use aes for my encryption as it is lighter and more secure than tripledes in fact i think it is the de facto algorithm at the moment

3868138
rss	feed
i m trying to add core data to an app that loads news form of an rss feed so i can store articles offline

3868143
opera	safari
it plays nice on safari and other new browsers safari mobile opera mobile included

3868149
post	get
i make an ajax post on a page that ajax post uses two hidden fields to retrieve some data send it to the action and get some json to show up

3868150
autoresize	scrollbar
when i resize window tabpanel iframe contents doesn t resize like a browser does and i see just scrollbar is it possible autoresize iframe contents also

3868159
onenote	ms-office
an alternative if you have ms-office onenote 2007 you can simply print it to send to onenote 2007 printer

3868187
width	height
never had that but one difference between your width and height is that in file_item.xml you have twice wrap_content but for width you always have match_parrent

3868205
accessor	properties
you can make members of the class private with private and provide read-only accessor by using properties readonly or simply writing only a getter

3868250
polymorphism	specialization
macros tend to be hard to debug so unless you need their ability to do string concatenations which is their distinctive advantage over templates in some cases i would personally go for a template based solution using static polymorphism techniques like as you indicated the curiously recurring template pattern and or if applicable template specialization to handle custom data structures

3868262
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is it seems to work correctly on google-chrome and on firefox 3.6 - 4.0 but in the last cases only with firebug

3868273
post	get
nick helped me get the form posting in this post but it seems to have broken the other button

3868343
mouseover	mouseout
it is like on mouseover on the delete-button is treated as mouseout of the div-element representing the post

3868346
post	get
works like this - here s how i get a single post

3868346
post	get
here s how i get a mixed-bag of post

3868346
post	get
here s how i get a collection of reviews child of post

3868359
put	get
i m sure it was a bug but not if it happens on the server or on the client side when i was working to produce a project to put a support ticket while trying to reduce it to the minimum possible it happens delphi xe was released and i m under sa so i get it the last minute

3868364
subtract	add
each particle is a div and i simply add or subtract a random number from each div s top and left position each round

3868364
min	max
i read up on math.random a little and i ve tried to use a function that returns a random number from min to max inclussive

3868364
min	max
my problem is that using the min and max from above -5 5 all the particles drift up and to the left very fast

3868364
min	max
to counteract this i have to use a min and max of -1 5

3868364
min	max
why does a min and max of -5 and 5 cause an upward and leftward drift

3868370
vsto	add-in
because it uses the native .xll interface it skips all the com integration overhead that you d have with vsto or another com-based add-in approach

3868383
children	parent
you can manage your own hierarchy using parent fields or you can make the parent object listen to its children and re-dispatch events

3868399
snmp	mib
any change in behaviour due to the order of the mib variables in the request sounds like a problem in the implementation of this mib at the snmp server

3868420
postgresql	mysql
note i m putting in my 2 cents even though i am not familiar with postgresql but rather mysql and oracle

3868420
min	max
if you want a different created_at you have the option to substitute first with other functions like avg min max or last in oracle you can also try adding order by on other columns including ones that are not returned to give you a different created_at

3868449
width	height
i wonna change it change paper width and height

3868541
mouseup	mousedown
the very definition of click incorporates the mousedown and mouseup movement

3868553
post	get
is it a get post cookie value

3868569
portrait	landscape
it seems like the actionsheet gets it s orientation from the view passed into showinview and my rootviewcontroller was in portrait mode even though my current view was in landscape

3868639
width	height
is there a way to find out the width and height of the follow image with jquery

3868735
min	max
this now becomes one of the most common so sql questions - retrieving rows containing some aggregate value min max

3868760
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but has no effect in firefox

3868793
post	get	post	put	put	get
i don t really understand the pro s and con s of using post vs get vs put requests on custom controller actions and whether to use links or forms buttons

3868793
put	get
but this triggers a get request and i feel like it should be a put or a post. or should it be a link at all

3868797
sorting	grouping
tmp_table_size - for some complex queries particularly those using grouping by or complex sorting mysql needs to first create a temporary table containing the data and then run some operations on it in order to create the result set

3868818
width	height
on another note getting some information would help out like the original image width and height your image width and height your html markup displaying the image and your css style

3868837
post	get
remember if javascript is disabled in the browser the above statement will fall back to a get request instead of post

3868873
spaces	delimiter
i d like to process the file field by field each delimiter by a spaces or an end-of-line character

3868885
put	get
then since it s actually the edges of each section that get rounded put each cell in its own section

3868892
post	get
all the post about this issue tell me to use gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config path but this does not seem to work with windows as i get the same error regardless

3868912
width	height
so the trick with the jquery cycle plugin is to set a specific width and height for your images

3868918
post	get
to get this you need to truncate the post before outputting it

3868920
for-loop	arrays
before when i was using a regular for-loop i was updating a wpf progress bar using dispatcher displaying the completed by dividing the current arrays index by the arrays size

3868994
move	drag
you can call dodragdrop with a data object containing or representing the control to begin a drag drop operation then handle the container s dragdrop event and move the control

3869002
typemock	moles
in .net typemock isolator and microsoft moles allow one to isolate any class property or method - be it sealed static protected or non-virtual

3869002
typemock	moles
however while i can t speak for typemock isolator i can say that using mocks in microsoft moles is extremely slow

3869046
setinterval	settimeout
i ve been using javascript settimeout and setinterval but i think they are dependant on the speed of the computer and the amount of code in the program

3869059
setinterval	settimeout
the settimeout and setinterval functions are pretty much the best you re going to get

3869116
setinterval	settimeout
you ll have to use settimeout or setinterval in your solution but it will be inaccurate for the following reasons

3869137
typedef	struct
you cannot use just key without explicitly writing struct before it inside the definition of the structure because the structure is not yet defined typedef

3869138
ubuntu	linux
i am running this on ubuntu linux with utf-8 as locale

3869144
int	chars
if i replace all long long int with chars the code works perfectly

3869151
post	get
chris i can t post a comment on your answer i get an error when i try to so i ll just post it here

3869196
google-chrome	firefox
it provides browser addons for ie firefox and google-chrome to record a web browsing sequence

3869196
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox google-chrome addons are open-source freeware

3869235
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
stick to malloc realloc free and cast the pointers

3869260
put	get
i ve put the inline errors and warnings i get in the comments

3869263
typemock	moles
in my opinion moles typemock are not really comparable to mocking frameworks and they are surely not a replacement

3869263
profiling	instrumentation	typemock	moles
typemock and moles are not mocking frameworks in the strict sense - they are some sort of profiling which use runtime instrumentation under the hood

3869263
typemock	moles
i have no concrete figures on that but from my own experience i d estimate that instrumented tests are around 100-400 slower typemock seeming to be faster than ms moles

3869263
typemock	moles
- with typemock or moles you basically can do whatever you want and this really is a bad thing and the main argument against developing with typemock or moles

3869263
typemock	moles
if you want to cover a brownfield project with tests which was not written at all with testability in mind then you have to use one of typemock or moles in my opinion typemock is the better choice

3869263
moq	moles
if you re starting a new project you re doing a greenfield project then use a mocking framework i personally like moq because of its simplicity and use ms moles as a complementary for things you can t have an interface for .net framework types

3869286
hide	show
i m using the jquery toggle effect to show or hide more information about list elements

3869321
apache	nginx
technically i think upload has not much to do with rails but rather the webserver apache nginx so as long as the server can handle concurrent requests then there not much work for rails app to do except to move the file to proper storage and to create database record to track the file

3869336
children	parent
using parent and children you can create ul and li items respectively

3869364
stdout	stderr
if you print to stdout or to stderr for a windows application you can still access the output through redirection

3869427
versioning	upgrade
but keep in mind as marek quoted success of your upgrade dependes on what are the changes customization you have applied to the 2007 versioning of the site

3869484
interpreted-language	compiled-language
but to the extent that your assumptions are valid it s because c is a compiled-language while python is an interpreted-language

3869499
google-chrome	firefox
further it may be worth the effort trying in different better webbrowsers like firefox and google-chrome

3869508
ubuntu	linux	firefox	safari
the reason you can run the precompiled binary safari on a mac or firefox on ubuntu linux is because it s been specifically built for that operating system architecture x86_64 and set of libraries

3869555
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari do well

3869555
google-chrome	safari
jsfiddle example for google-chrome and safari only 4x more particles

3869574
haskell	ocaml
i know a few people who learned ml ocaml f# first and then moved to haskell

3869598
int	chars
int value zero sometimes referred to as the ascii nul chars

3869598
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from 1 through 31 except for alternate streams where these chars are allowed

3869603
subtraction	addition
that will make it easier to do operations with this value equality greater than less than addition subtraction etc...

3869637
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade by iphone to 4.1 from 3.1.3 versioning

3869644
accessor	properties
a properties should have get and set accessor

3869658
psyco	distribute
psyco works as a plug-in for python that basically does jit compilation so even though it can speed up execution quite a lot in some cases it doesn t produce a machine-code executable you can distribute

3869696
put	get
suppose there is a call to get analytics data from a third party or through our cache data on a server for the most popular items and we show these items names on all of our pages should we put this code in model controller or view helper component

3869704
extjs	gxt
i have a web-application whose ui is implemented in gxt extjs gwt

3869735
sql-insert	sql-update
i tried add own sql-insert and sql-update in xml files with convert but it didn t work well eg

3869752
mp3	wav
is there a class for convert wav 2 mp3 in java

3869759
int	chars
you could consider creating an int value with the element repeated 4 times since this is ansichar in delphi 7 shifted like ord element + ord element shl 8 + ord element shl 16 + ord element shl 24 then typecast the string to a pintegerarray and loop over it length str div 4 times comparing as int instead of chars

3869788
portrait	landscape
now when i am trying to rotate the view from portrait to landscape its rotating the inside view but tabbar does not rotate and it stays at the same place ie at the bottom of the portrait mode where as every other ui are rotating properly

3869819
cout	cin
if your primarily programming lang is c++ and you are doing object oriented programming then it is going to be cout cin and endl - hands down

3869819
cout	cin
in addition to that you get the perks of having cout cin work on user defined types as well -- something that is not possible with printf scanf

3869850
gif	png
img can handle only simple image formats like jpeg gif or png

3869880
hide	show
it works for one of my li actually it looks like it appends itself to only one li and as i hover other list items it displays the show and hide functions to the last list item

3869886
cout	cin
if you were to ever debug the calls to cout cin endl etc in your debugger you will find that these are surely convenient oo wrappers over the standard c library

3869886
cout	cin
most c++ programmer are also used to see cout cin endl etc instead of their c counterparts like printf scanf and so on

3869914
post	get
i would have thought that using post variables are a bit safer that get simply because a lot of mvc frameworks use the pattern

3869966
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
workaround to avoid inherited mapping remove all of subclassing and use join to map its inherited properties

3870009
children	parent
it seems that the more safe way of cascade deleting would be to remove the children objects first brothers then clear the collection of the parent sister and only after that delete it from the context as there is something inside ef itself that tries to connect the entities and removes stuff from something else

3870040
portrait	landscape
ie want to have to default style at portrait mode and black translucent at landscape mode

3870102

the need for the proper alignment sometimes means that when you want to create an int array in an arbitrary chars array you might have to shift the beginning of an int array forward from the beginning of the chars array

3874704
int	chars
for example if the chars array resides at 0x1001 you have no choice but to start your constructed-in-place int array from the address 0x1004 which is the chars element with the index 3

3874724
accessor	properties
since you declared your properties as retain using the properties accessor to set it automatically retains it

3874724
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
so when you initialize you either have to take ownership and set the ivar directly or do like you re doing and use the properties accessor to set the properties and then relinquish ownership in the init method by either releasing an object you own or as you did in your second instance using the convenience constructor so that you never owned the returned instance

3874724
accessor	properties
so just remember if you ever use the properties accessor even within the class itself you will get the features you set on the properties nonatomic retain etc.

you use the properties accessor whenever you do one of the following

3874975
strncmp	strstr
do you know the c-standard functions strstr and strncmp

3874986
min	max
is there a good hack that will make the query planner utilize the check constraints and indices of sub-tables for max and min queries

3875114
for-loop	loops
iterate with for-loop or while loops

3875114
for-loop	loops
when should one use a for-loop instead of a while loops

3875117
vb.net	vb6
that depends on which of the vb.net ui libraries you are using winforms or wpf what s the vb6 tag doing in your question btw

3875128
for-loop	loops
in a working version of this script i cut the for-loop and just numbered each upload individually i had this piece of code without loops 10 times each with its own number

3875129
banking	payment
for instance - internet banking has a list of tabs for accounts payment tools reports

its not going to be making the actual payment but it will at some point integrate with a leading bank s internet banking system

3875147
uilabel	uibutton
i have an iphone app with a main view that has a uilabel and a uibutton

3875160
for-loop	loops
they are functionally identical however it can be argued that the for-loop is less error prone because all of loops functionality is right there together

3875165
post	get
get the client post data as a map

3875165
gzipinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
final gzipinputstream inputstream new gzipinputstream new bytearrayinputstream gzipped

3875177
for-loop	loops
generally the difference between a while loops and for-loop is syntax and not performance related

3875207
put	get
this is so that i can get the html.somefunction to work without having to put using at the top of all my pages

3875212
folder	directory
then i searched the original python s sqlite3 package original directory from the python s standard library location and placed it in the jython s lib folder

3875214
post	get
only if you don t maintain your summary table all the time you can get around this locking problem but a more detailed discussion of this is beyond the scope of this post

3875240
realloc	malloc
appart from all the obvious realloc and malloc answers if your using msvc you can use _expand which will attempt to resize the block without moving it

3875270
children	parent
you can do a first pass over the table to build all of the nodes build a hashtable from name to node then do another pass where you can add parent-child relationships between two nodes add parent pointer to child and add child to list of children in the parent

3875317
maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml
i was using maven-shade-plugin with true and it was removing the org.apache.commons commons-email jar dependencies in installed .m2 project a pom.xml file

3875326
move	drag
however the views and buttons don t seem to process touch and move drag events

3875326
portrait	landscape
it s as if the last 1 3 of the screen 480-320 doesn t propagate events to receivers after a rotation to landscape from portrait

3875364
fadein	fadeout
the like button fades in and out for each new image using jquery fadein fadeout again being called with externalinterface

3875419
for-loop	loops
the one notable difference between a for and while loops is that a continue statement in a while loops will branch to the top of loops while one in a for-loop will branch to the third part of the for clause the one after the condition usually used to bump variables

3875421
onclick	onchange
in my case the workaround was simple for my case it was valid to use other event instead of onchange not sure if it was onclick or onselect so i attached my code to this other event and my code worked but i m not sure if this could work for you

3875471
post	get
normal get post the statelessness

3875472
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	ubuntu	debian
it is already packaged at least for debian ubuntu gentoo is os and de independent and has graphical and command line interfaces

3875495
for-loop	loops
as to when it became popular to postincriment in for loops my copy of k r 2nd edition uses i++ on page 65 the first for-loop i found while flipping through.

3875496
pem	pkcs#12
there is an option in the demo to import a certificate from the browser s keychain however it involves a manual process at the moment exporting from the browser as pkcs#12 and importing as pem

3875497
qtcpsocket	qsslsocket
for ssl tls connections u should using qsslsocket instead of qtcpsocket

3875516
for-loop	loops
if you re performing a count-based loops then a for-loop would make the most sense

3875547
client-side	server-side
ajax has solved a lot of problems by streamlining user experience and allowing the developer to control the flow server-side and client-side scripting

3875603
move	drag
and then in the drag and drop code which is the move dragger and up functions you have to make sure to deal with both the clicked on element and its associated element

3875611
width	height
for example i might start with a with a certain size possibly dependent on its contents width height auto

3875611
width	height
i ve tried copying the element s float clear position width height margins and padding but this is a little cumbersome

3875666
outputstream	inputstream
for the socket i m going to return an inputstream and outputstream that are wrapped by logging to intercept the data

3875698
serializable	deserialization
the biggest benefit is that as you build your data object over time the serializable deserialization will grow with it

3875702
inherited	properties
another approach is to have all your objects inherited from a shared base class that has a color properties

3875723
ubuntu	linux
these projects would be build on linux specifically ubuntu if that makes a difference

3875769
cvs	svn
in mercurial and unlike in svn and cvs adding a file overrides the .hgignore file so you can put this in your .hgignore

3875770
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in ie7 and older and google-chrome safari and firefox

3875780
int	chars
however strange things happen when i enter invalid values such as values larger than the maximum storable int or chars

3875848
jobs	cron
have you checked the system s cron jobs

3875959
hash	md5
ideally you should use sha256 although md5 would work because the attacker doesn t know the hash value so collisions don t come into play

3875968
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
use a modified version of mark peters solution but instead of assigning a uncaughtexceptionhandler you wrap each submitted runnable into a runnable of your own which executes calls run the real runnable inside a try-catch-block

3876058
postgresql	mysql
but in low traffic sites mysql postgresql is better

3876058
postgresql	mysql
i prefer mongodb for analytics web clicks counters logs you need a 64 bit system and mysql or postgresql for main data

3876123
explode	fgetcsv
however explode ing on | makes me think fgetcsv may work too and if that works a load data command in mysql could possibly skip php altogether

3876130
free	malloc
the memory addresses reported by mtrace are the locations where the malloc and free functions are called

3876196
hide	show
however some tools will hide some results pgadmin will only show the last and some tools have some sort of requirement to get to the next result set .net s idatareader s will not allow you to read from the second resultset until you call nextresult

3876196
union	distinct
you can also choose between union all or union distinct the default where the latter will only send rows that aren t repeats

3876215
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3876226
addclass	removeclass
but if you need to use the method twice you might use removeclass and addclass instead so the script reads better

3876229
mouse	keyboard
just remember that user may interact with those widgets using either mouse or keyboard and even using ctrl+v to paste text

3876262
width	height
the basic idea is to determine the largest rectangular area of the source image having the same aspect width to height ratio as the thumbnail image and then trim off crop any excess around it before resizing to the thumbnail s dimensions

3876279
folder	dir
trying to have dir command that displays size of the sub folder and files

3876279
folder	dir
these soultions are great but i am looking for something resembles dir output handy and simple and that i can use anywhere in the folder structure

3876286
inherited	properties

lxml	libxml2
libxml2 used by lxml will check for the existance of a catalog in etc xml catalog and the xml_catalog_files environment variable see libxml2 docs

3876338
vsto	add-in
this works ok but i have done two unrelated projects recently that were deployed with click once in one case and as a vsto outlook add-in in another case and that was a much nicer experience for end users mostly because of the auto-update features of clickonce

3876338
vsto	add-in
the other idea i had was to create an outlook add-in project and somehow put these classes in that project and use the vsto publishing functionality to push it out

3876382
post	get
the route that received the ipns was setup to receive get requests and not post request

3876477
websphere	ibm
update the apache-jvm is handled by either mod_jk or via ibm http server connection to websphere

3876492
stdout	stderr
i m writing a program that forks multiple child processes and i d like for all of these child processes to be able to write lines to stderr and stdout without the output being garbled

3876492
stdout	stderr
both the main process and the backgrounded one the child process share the same stdin stdout and stderr filehandles

3876558
hide	show
there was a lot of extra code to hide and show each ddl according to what the user did that is unnecessary for getting to the bottom of your problem

3876598
folder	directory
the directory i want to upload is huge so going through folder one by one is out of the question

3876633
freemarker	velocity
you could reuse jsp as view layer and switch later to freemarker velocity

3876638
super	extends
it is super light-weight with a lot of options and flexibility to extends to do almost anything you could want

3876677
hide	show
when building a report in business intelligence studio 2008 i ve noticed that the hide show details indicators default to a plus sign + if the row s are set to display when the report is initially run

3876679
google-chrome	safari
i don t have safari installed nor google-chrome but would like to know roughly how much of the browser market will behave with my site especially as i m using a lot of timers screen measurement etc

3876683
put	get
you might need to do some fine-tuning i m not at a place where i can easily put together an exact code sample but this should get you going in the right direction

3876770
pop-up	dialog
the strange thing is that the dialog window that pop-up does not implement dragmove and i m not dragging around my mainwindow either

3876797
button	checkbox
see a complete demo on jsfiddle uses a checkbox instead of radio button

3876846
disk	ram
much cheaper to add the appropriate disk space which you need anyway and ram

3876885
for-loop	arrays
then use i and al within the for-loop constructor so you are not recalculating the length of the arrays on each hit along with a var creation over and over

3876948
ubuntu	linux
the application is installed on ubuntu linux so whatever my solution it can t be some hokey windoze-only solution

3876958
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so i guess you simply want to show a uitableview inside a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller

3876962
width	height
the way i understand this which maybe incorrect is that self.navigationcontroller.view.frame was same as self.view.frame and both were equal to x 0 y 0 width 320 height 480

3877038
robocopy	xcopy
i think you can use a synhronization tool like microsoft sync toy or use xcopy with d param in postbuild options or robocopy

3877044
post	get
this meant that all data had to either be loaded at load time or you would have to bounce data along via get or post operations load page change data send data load page etc.

3877044
post	get
neither loading an entire data set into the client nor reloading the base page with each get or post request was cheap in terms of resources

3877102
subtraction	addition
you can store times as a struct timeval there are macros for doing addition subtraction with struct timeval values

3877191
versioning	upgrade
if you could be impacting multiple projects then it might be better to actually package it with the application as you can control when you upgrade to the newest versioning of the jar on a per project application basis

3877207
min	max
its fairly easy to prove for specific case of min and max but for aggregates in general its a tough case

3877210
internationalization	localization
the broad topic you re asking about is called internationalization and localization or i18n and l10n for short

3877223
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
in addition to the reasons stated which can mean ub or disaster you may end up with objects reconstructing themselves and unnatural dependency cycles among subclassing that override accessor - the subclassing may have established their own dependencies although the subclassing ivars are effectively out of reach and should not be known to the superclass

3877274
hide	show
datatables is now supporting colvis which allows you to show hide columns as well as fixed header fixed columns

3877274
sorting	filtering
with the amount of data you d dealing with you could also take advantage of the sorting filtering and paging to make it a little easier for the end-user to consume

3877292
min	max	width	height
the size policies will work in combination with your min max height width settings and those of the other widgets in the layout

3877301
openssl	crypto++
i don t know the actual size increase caused by crypto++ the latest openssl dll s size that you need to deploy along with your application is around 1.5mb

3877324
post	get
yes you can post all you want even works...but you won t get a response back

3877324
post	get
this works the other domain will get the post

3877392
implements	extends
i don t fully understand your usecase but you can try to implements a custom formatter or handler or you can extends an existing one like simpleformatter filehandler

3877422
for-loop	arrays
this is nested inside another for-loop which creates an arrays of the movieclip rows

3877452
inherited	subclassing
this allows you to manipulate a large assortment of animals knowing they all have a set of common methods expecting the same arguments without creating an inherited nightmare by just subclassing

3877472
integer	unsigned
to make this a bit cleaner instead of casting the address to an unsigned integer i d consider saving the address of the callback in an array and passing its index in the array instead

3877525
webrat	cucumber
we use delayedjob to run some of our long running processes and would like to test with cucumber webrat

3877526
width	height
the inner properties name length width height are then understood as regular properties

3877526
width	height
i can serialize and deserialize a custom tbox object that has name length width and height properties

3877529
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works correctly on firefox and google-chrome however it does not work in ie no version works

3877547
tcplistener	tcpclient
i was going to use tcplistener and tcpclient to send information between applications but then i came across msmq

3877603
mouse	keyboard
i want to display all these images at once as a cuboid with 50 alpha and navigate using keyboard or mouse

3877604
button	checkbox
the validator fires when i click the submit button and if no checkbox are checked indicates the validation has failed

3877604
button	checkbox
however if i check one of the checkbox the validation message does not go away until i click the submit button again

3877650
for-loop	loops
some languages such as ada enforce this by making the for-loop counter a constant within loops body

3877687
hide	show
show or hide comments based on the server response

3877687
hide	show
show hide comments with links

3877730
keydown	keyup
b send the keydown + keyup events

3877733
fgets	strtol
for safe handling of input of indeterminate length use fgets and sscanf or strtol or strtoul if base.level cannot be negative

3877737
interbase	firebird
interbase firebird

3877737
interbase	firebird
specific of database interbase firebird

3877766
post	get
it seems that immediately after a new user registers the google crawlers are going to the same registration webpage which i send information to as a get instead of a post for reasons which i will not get into

3877826
width	height
using css you can change the width height padding etc

3877834
for-loop	arrays
then i used a for-loop to assign the one that i have fetch to the arrays

3877840
togaf	enterprise
enterprise architect usually via an enterprise architectural framework like togaf or zachman

3877841
bash	zsh
in bash zsh and others

3877843
put	get
so- i put a try catch around the problem area naturally to try and get some sort of feedback on the error

3877854
opera	google-chrome
i tested this in webkit google-chrome 6.0 ff3 opera 10.6 ie7 ie8 ie9 even ie quirks

3877867
mousemove	keydown
you could maintain a variable lastactivity which is updated on each document mousemove or document keydown

3877876
post	get
first off yes i know this is insane i m not going to get into why let s just accept for a moment that img src is not working because of security constraints but an ajax request with the proper authentication in the post will pull back the image

3877934
post	get
note you are using post and not get http method in the code you provided

3877976
union	distinct
i am currently using union all and a distinct in the outer query as this proved much faster than using union s for the uniqueness of data

3877986
median	percentile
as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways

3878003
stdout	stderr
with the php 4.3.0+ cli binary these three streams are automatically available identified with the constants stdin stdout and stderr respectively

3878004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
thanks to the invaluable help of stack overflowers i have my jquery working perfectly in firefox safari google-chrome oprah

3878016
ssl	https
that s what https ssl tls is for

3878016
rsa	aes
it s a jquery plugin that will do aes encryption and can utilise an rsa public key

3878024
ssl	https
http over ssl tls https is secure enough

3878024
rsa	aes
2048-bit rsa and 256-bit aes should be secure enough

3878025
width	height
the click method should be similar to assuming a single post to save all the dropped items x y width height original object id

3878079
profiling	debugging
right way to find what cause performance problems in vim is to profiling it or check debugging output optionally - comparing with vim setup without troubles

3878087
fadein	fadeout
you can also use the fadein and fadeout methods

3878112
accessor	properties
another curve-ball for you - as you know poco s with ef mean the poco s have all the properties on the db - so i might have a postid properties with get set accessor as ef needs to get set these properties

3878135
subtraction	addition
using two s complement to represent negative values has the benefit that subtraction and addition are the same

3878137
spaces	delimiter
perhaps you should just get the line allowing n to be the delimiter and then just iterate through and tokenize the input by spaces

3878147
subnet	packets
and even if you did use the ip address associated with the default route and told the users of the other hosts about this address there s no gaurantee that a packets from their end to your host will arrive because their hosts might be on a different subnet not accessable via the default route

3878152
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
you should be comparing bufferedreader and bufferedwriter

3878152
outputstream	inputstream
the basic reason for that is that different types of reader s and writer s may have different ways of being initialized and different ways of functioning not necessarily wrapping an inputstream or outputstream at all

3878165
children	parent
i have a parent class and a children class

3878165
children	parent
in a parent class i define a function f and want to print in it name of children class that extended parent class and name of children method that called this function

3878198
int	chars
this could be done in a variety of ways all of them boiling down to converting each chars 0 .. 9 to the corresponding int 0..9

3878243
for-loop	loops
thus you could use a for-loop only in places where you know loops will run for certain pre-determined number of times before the actual loops execution starts

3878271
for-loop	loops
when someone else comes along and decides to add modify loops if they are using a for-loop the person doing the modification can generally be confident that so long as they don t mess with items inside the for expression s they aren t going to break iteration in loops

3878293
inherited	properties
since fiction inherited from book fiction has a title and author properties

3878319
for-loop	arrays
i figure that i can write a for-loop and iterate over the imagedata arrays and manually combine and set every rgba value per pixel but i m wondering if there s a better way

3878325
free	malloc
in a modern os all the memory gets paged out to disk if needed anyway so feel free to malloc anything up to a couple of gigabytes

3878331
realloc	malloc
prefer a temporary file if you need want it to be visible to other processes and malloc realloc if not

3878346
fgets	getline
i ve done a whole series of answers on the pitfalls of using functions on non-controlled data enter user 14860 fgets into the search box above some of which here here and here for example include a perennial favourite function of mine getline for safer user input

3878357
post	get
what we have noticed is that we get some people liking the article on our website and some liking the wall post but we d prefer to have the total number combined but i am not sure if this is at all possible because really they are two different subjects

3878363
mouseup	mousedown
the three arguments are references to the functions that handle moving dragging starting mousedown and the stopping mouseup

3878363
width	height
to make an object resizeable you would simply create a second set of drag and drop methods for the resizer and just adjust the target elements height and width based on dragging the resizer

3878382
jboss	weblogic
deploying it on other application servers turned out to be much more difficult jboss weblogic websphere but there are not many reasons for this usually we had few but dropped this after several attempts basically failed

3878421
for-loop	loops
move the for-loop the bubble_srt call outside the while loops

3878444
unix	bsd
found on bsd unix systems which

3878528
selecteditem	selectedindex
also setting selecteditem null or selectedindex -1 don t work either

3878529
udp	tcp
for tcp but not for udp kernel does not keep track of application write boundaries only of how many bytes are there to send how many have been ack-ed etc

3878530
debian	linux
i doubt the windows code will run under os x maybe not even the fedora linux rawhide under debian linux

3878534
put	get
you can just as easily put an entire application in one big honking source file but you may find that the file will get rather big leading to the compiler complaining about it or at least taking a long time to compile it

3878549
shadowing	named
this gives you greater leeway in reusing variable named without chance of collision albeit at the expense of increasing potential shadowing

3878552
post	put
from my extremely rusty recollection you sort of treat the put methods the same way you treat post methods

3878552
post	put
the main difference between them put post is in the meaning

3878552
post	put
put typically creates a new resource at the uri whereas post can append to it there are also a few other meanings to what exactly post does

3878572
uialertview	uipopovercontroller
basically the best way to do this is to implement custom uialertview subclasses that look behave how you want via custom animations and being able to click behind and disappear if you want that functionality as uipopovercontroller has it

3878590
min	max
the min and max value is set 0-20

3878614
packets	multicast
the caveat being you can only receive broadcast and multicast packets unicast packets are delivered to the first open socket

3878665
scrollable	panels
you need to make the containing panels implement scrollable and set the preferred scrollable viewport size according to the width

3878666
uiview	calayer
every uiview subclass has a calayer attached to it so you aren t restricted at all in terms of where you get your mask or maskee from

3878744
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on an npapi plugin on linux and have run into several issues with google-chrome albeit it works perfectly on firefox

3878762

moving to declarative programming as compared to imperative programming - xaml is declarative programming

3878773
accessor	properties
edit #3 declaring instance properties with accessor

3878773
int	double
double to int

3878773
int	double
a double is a more precise type than an int in a general manner of speaking

3878773
int	double
if you are using a double inside the guy class then you need to either change it to an int or cast it where appropriate or use double all the way through the process

3878816
inherited	properties
properties of book are inherited by the two derived class

3878899
width	height
so i need to calculate image and each string s position including their width height to measure the cell height and wrapping areas

3878907
phpunit	simpletest
it s all syntactic salt that saves overhead from the phpunit simpletest point of view

3878932
google-chrome	firefox
at first i thought it s bug in a browser but i tried it in firefox google-chrome and ie9 and they all behave exactly the same way

3878970
keydown	keyup
could it be that you are not checking wether the the event was fired for keyup or keydown

3879023
width	height
the way i m doing this is by resizing the canvas so that the height and width are the same

3879023
width	height
if the height and width are different i change the higher of the two so that it is the same as the lower 600x500 becomes 500x500

3879035
for-loop	loops
you can break down a classic for-loop into a while loops and still be equivalent

3879070
snmp	mib
now i am developing an snmp webserver and i want to get the data from mib in the windows to insert in the mysql data base

3879086
hide	show
i would like to depending on what the user selects using the other system.windows.forms items show or hide different items in the system.windows.form.checkedlistbox

3879152
pull	push
let s imagine i want to stream three files to a user all in a row but instead of him handing me a stream object to push bytes down i have to hand him a stream object he ll pull bytes from

3879186
pop-up	dialog
instead it pop-up a dialog indicating that one must manually enable it

3879219
width	height
sometimes can vary in size and float left doesn t work well when thumbnails have different height and width

3879260
rss	feed
that s actually standard character encoding for xml and basically that s what should be used for multilingual rss or atom feed

3879275
hash	md5
cast the row to text and use md5 to make a hash

superclass	subclassing
you can however access superclass fields from subclassing so you could do something like this

3879360
superclass	subclassing
while methods defined in subclassing can look up the hierarchy to resolve fields the same is not true for classes defined higher up in the hierarchy superclass won t look down the hierarchy to resolve fields and their values

use + - and other operators along with sqrt abs sin and other functions available in the standard library to massage the data you can create some functions of your own too

3880006
int	boolean
is a boolean expression which when used like this gets converted to an int with true becoming 1 and false becoming 0

3880009
int	boolean
when casting this boolean to an int for subtraction it will become 1 if true 0 else

3880021
int	boolean
will return a boolean true or false and that is the implicitly cast into an int 0 or 1

yes - it does suck however you can use the assets folder and have sub directory in there and load images that way

3880393
inherited	properties
you do this by chaning the inherited properties of the page directive like this

3880433
post	get
if you post your site domain and urls that you want to get indexed

3880658

i have written a handler for the close anchor as follows it removes the element from the droppable but it doesn t make it draggable aggain

3880681
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
depending on how your app works you may want to create another managing viewcontroller to present specific views in a manner similar to a uitabbarcontroller or a uinavigationcontroller

3880708
width	height
but the problem is this event is fired before the form is actually resized - so when the form is maximized i get the height of the form before it was maxmized but i want the width of the form after it has been maximized

3880775
width	height
my solution is to iterate over all links all a elements grab their location top left height and width values and href and create a new a element at the same position placed in the upper layer

3880791
ftp	telnet
it s not the http library it s often made out to be but a generic data transfer library for ftp sftp scp http put smtp telnet etc

3880791

3880837
slideup	slidedown
the slideup and slidedown functions could also be used to achieve this

3880893
post	get

i have not specified a fixtures directory in my settings.yml so according to the docs django should be looking in my app fixtures folder

3880957
int	chars
question about int and chars in c

3880957
int	chars
i rememeber from my studies that chars are little int and viceversa and that s okay to me

3880987
boost	stl
the lesson in general is never pass stl container boost or anything of the like

3880995
int	chars
the c format parameter interprets the corresponding value as a chars not as an int

3880995
int	chars
however when you lie to printf and pass an int in what you tell it is a chars its internal manipulation of the value to get a chars back as a chars is normally passed as an int anyway with varargs happens to yield the values you see

3881168
children	parent
i need to find a parent with parameters are children id

3881168
children	parent
ex find a parent has exactly children 1 2 3

3881168
children	parent
i tried where child_id in 1 2 3 but it will return incorrect parent in case parent has children 1 2 3 4

3881172
width	height
attributes like height width and val of on content change

3881186
gif	png
i am more familar with gd so i ll suggest you check out the functions imagecreatefromjpeg png gif imagecopyresampled which can both crop and resample

3881186
width	height
you input the width height desired aspect ratio this will spit out an array that contains the corrected dimensions

3881186
width	height
it s probably best to specify the ratio by dividing desired height by desired width

3881186
width	height
you can then use that info to crop the image w imagecopyresampled at the same time you can specify to the function the destination width height

3881186
gif	png
you can then use iamgejpeg gif png to output the image as a file to a public directory on your server

3881220
children	parent
maybe add a count condition if a parent has 1 2 3 for children and 3 children it s all good

3881223
post	put
possible via urlrequest - send your desktop data to server handler with post method then put it into database there

3881225

the ord function returns an int uniquely expressing the chars s value

3881230
opera	google-chrome
somewhere along the line the encoding got switched to a format that was screwing up in ie9b and google-chrome but not opera 10

3881280
free	malloc
now if malloc fails you do free emergencymemory and hopefully you have enough room to recover

3881289
httpresponse	request
it appears that the system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer class tries to obtain the httpresponse for the current request presumably to apply appropriate character encoding

after sleeping on it it dawned on me that even though i was typing my list as ienumerable it was really still an iqueryable as that s how it came out of my linq query in my repository

3881328
ienumerable	iqueryable
so answer would have been you idiot are you sure you re dealing with ienumerable and not iqueryable

3881329
filesystems	ntfs
it s a windows application written in c# that could run on both ntfs and fat32 filesystems

3881340
16-bit	64bit
if you only return 16-bit or 32-bit aligned pointers an uneven pointer-address lsb equal to 1 will be at least mysterious and would create an opportunity for using my all-time favorite bogus-value 0xdeadbeef for 32-bit pointers or 0xdeadbeefbadf00d for 64bit pointers

3881352
facebook	fbconnect
i also use #import fbconnect fbconnect.h in my projects but you don t need to add the facebook ios sdk to your search paths in xcode

3881352
facebook	fbconnect
since facebook for some odd reason chose to put their header files in an additional subdirectory also named fbconnect underneath the main source directory in the facebook-iphone-sdk project you need to add the additional fbconnect when importing this file

3881359
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i have tried executing the code in google-chrome opera and safari and they all work fine

i am particularly interested in using ironpython to run a python web framework such as django or web2py

3881441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this kind of ugly code and it is not only related to the component is used in order to assure a compatibilities and identical behaviors among all browsers including all ie and ie6 also firefox safari google-chrome and so on.

3881441
hide	show
eventually you can also simulate this behavior with buttons and some javascript that will hide or show different panels or using one per tab to refresh the content of a basic panel

3881449
ubuntu	linux
i have several usb mass storage flash drives connected to a ubuntu linux computer ubuntu 10.04.1 kernel 2.6.32-25-386 and i need to tell them apart programatically from bash if possible but i m not afraid of compiling either - i need to find which block device corresponds to which physical device dev sdb1 - device in usb port 1

pull	push
have a second local git repository and perform cherry picks on it every time actual commit and push is performed to the working branch go to that second repository pull the changes and perform cherry pick there

3881506
for-loop	loops
its just my logic that we generally use for-loop when we know the exact count of our itterations and we use a while loops when we generally want to check a condition.then we use them according to ur requirments

3881538
entity-relationship	diagram
the cons are the need to build your own db access layer and having to produce entity-relationship diagram for future reference and updates to db

3881542
min	max
keep 3 more columns for min max and the sum of the 15 columns

3881583

in the bag i have to set the reference begin to _begin and end to _end

3881591
cvs	svn
firstly i have migrated my cvs repository into svn repository

3881619
int	chars
when you pass an int corresponding to the c conversion specifier the int is converted to an unsigned chars and then written

3881619
int	chars
when converting an int to an unsigned chars

3881626
for-loop	loops
you can most always i can t think of an example where you can t write a for-loop as a while loops and a while loops as a for-loop but picking the one which best first the situation usually comes down to my above points

3881654
google-chrome	firefox
i m developing a cross-platform npapi+xpcom extension for firefox and google-chrome windows linux and mac

3881694
maven	pom.xml
i tried from a brandnew maven installation the following pom.xml

3881725
google-chrome	firefox
document.ready not triggered after ajax request in ie but work a charm in firefox and google-chrome

3881725
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in firefox and google-chrome

3881730
hash	md5
the only possible problem i can think of here could be if it would somehow be possible to exploit md5 collisions that two different strings can generate the same md5 hash - in that case someone could potentially log in with a password that is not correct but generates the same md5 hash

3881730
hash	md5
he wrote of the attack that w e already knew that md5 is a broken hash function and that no one should be using md5 anymore.

3881755
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the only glaringly obvious problem i see is that the password is stored with as simple md5 hash with no salt

3881755
hash	md5
from your point of view this isn t so much of an issue but from the user s point of view it s a major security flaw since someone with access to the database can fairly easily crack sufficiently bad passwords by just googling their md5 hash

3881758
maven	pom.xml
if pom.xml a asks for 4.8 and b asks for 4.8.2 and b depends on a then maven has to make a decision

3881876
post	put
that s what post and put are for

3881953
jquery	scriptaculous
richfaces 3.3.3 comes baked in with jquery 1.3.2 and prototype and scriptaculous as well

3881957
for-loop	loops
knuth s loop-and-a-half also works better in several languages as an infinite loops with a break rather than a for-loop

3881996
web.py	bottle
in particular i d recommend bottle and web.py both of which can be used with more or less finagling with the excellent mimerender library for solid content negotiation

3882049
width	height
then when you listen for that event re-lay out your application to the new fullscreen width and height

3882058
cpython	ironpython
i haven t used ironpython extensively but the 2.6.1 release behaves almost exactly like the cpython 2.6 interpreter disregarding standard library

3882058
cpython	ironpython
a lot of the extensions for cpython don t work with ironpython

3882058
cpython	ironpython
so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython

3882084
ssl	https
https ssl works fine

3882086
ssl	https
https ssl only solves the middle man part of what you want to achieve

3882114
ssl	https
another benefit of ssl is that it allows the use of strict transport security which not only forces https on all site activity but also prevents a man in the middle from spoofing your site to a user and making them think they are accessing your site

3882149
post	get
there s a great page on wikipedia about post redirect get

3882156
google-chrome	firefox
using c# and any .net version i d like to create a program that can read the source code from any open tab using ie firefox or google-chrome

3882214
post	get
when i execute this to the server i get a request type of option which i think is the first call of the two needed to complete a post request

3882214
post	get
i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle

3882221
parsley	graniteds
i want to use the parsley framework and i want to use graniteds for remoting

3882221
parsley	graniteds
as of 2.1 graniteds generates as3 service classes from your java code as local proxies and i want to use these classes in parsley

3882221
parsley	graniteds
this would be because parsley is creating instances of the service classes without actually injecting them with the relevant context to do the graniteds remoting

3882221
parsley	graniteds
i need to figure out how to give the graniteds context to the service classes which parsley instantiates

3882221
parsley	graniteds
i m familiar with graniteds but not with parsley so maybe this is the solution but applying it correctly is above my head

3882245
uiview	subviews
each uiview inside cell.contentview.subviews so the subviews of cell.contentview are removed

3882245
retaincount	dealloc
it will remove them from the superview and probably call the dealloc method if the retaincount is 0

3882290
hide	show
in browsers the xml format view is mostly a stylesheet adding syntax highlighting and emacscript event handlers show and hide chlids nodes etc.

why i want to do this aside what i m asking is how to forward declare a non-struct typedef d struct type so that i can declare pointers to it

3882352
equals	gethashcode
i found a forum post suggesting that overriding the gethashcode and equals methods on the entity classes might help

3882362
comparator	comparable	implements	extends
my goal is very simple today i am trying to work out the proper way to implements comparator or the comparable interface for my class which extends defaultmutabletreenode

3882373
submit	submission
to prevent form submission i d use a submit handler instead in this case working with your keydown handler and probably a blur handler as well to reset the flag

3882414
int	double
it should accept 4 different datatypes including double and int which would lead to a lot of different combinations

3882422
typedef	struct
it s up to the implementation whether this is a typedef of a struct whose name you don t know anyway or something else

3882481
datamapper	activerecord	mongoid	mongomapper
in my opinion it s hard to say which is better if you have datamapper experience you ll like mongomapper but if you used activerecord mongoid it s your preferred choice

3882485
integer	radix
parseint - parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix or base

3882485
int	chars
if parseint encounters a chars that is not a numeral in the specified radix it ignores it and all succeeding chars and returns the int value parsed up to that point

3882496
folder	directory
i ve created a directory on the same level as my domain folder

3882576
ant	maven
both ant and maven know how to compile only those files that have changed or that depend on files that have changed

3882582
pop-up	dialog
i create a non-modal dialog pop-up to display secondary information to the user while they work in the main window

3882582
pop-up	dialog
currently it pop-up centered on the non-modal dialog pop-up window which by chance had focus at that time

3882615
min	max
i have a form that validates zip codes on a min max length basis

3882634
public	protected
i want to have example of a class that uses private public protected and static

3882658
versioning	upgrade
just because the new compiler versioning is backwards compatible does not mean that teams will want to upgrade

3882682
std	ostream
i d like to provide an std ostream that may or may not from the user s point of view encrypt its contents

3882705
move	drag
if i touch down on a button and drag then the scroll view doesn t move

3882715
uiview	subviews
each uiview class or sub-class can maintain his view hierarchies by addsubview and those codes will remove all subviews from cell.contentview

3882736
webchromeclient	webviewclient
-when initializing the webview set the javascript plug-ins the webviewclient and the webchromeclient

3882750
cpython	ironpython
i was wondering whether objects serialized using cpython s cpickle are readable by using ironpython s cpickle

3882750
cpython	ironpython
the objects in question do not require any modules outside of the built-ins that both cpython and ironpython include

3882759
hide	show
the dropdown is show after an ajax call completes succesfully then i want to hide it when a user clicks anywhere

3882779
google-chrome	firefox
i implemented kelso s solution and it works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome

3882821
folder	directory
drop the php page into the same directory as the file and it will tell you the correct path to the folder and then just add on the filename.xxx

3882934
put	get
the only way to access instance variables in page methods is to first put the variables into session during the initial page request - but this is a rather fragile strategy you re better off figuring out another way to get the data or values in question

3883016
typedef	struct
yes you can use the typedef symbol without needing the struct keyword

3883069
super	extends
make on super class a that extends acitivity

post	get
with _linkbypost it sends the cookie information as get parameters on the form action along with your post data

3883131

when the enhanced for-loop foreach loops was added to java it was made to work with a target of either an arrays or iterable

3883140
equals	gethashcode
and implement equals and gethashcode in your custom class

3883143

i m using the jquery autocomplete plugin and it s fine in firefox but i m having a problem in google-chrome

3883266
inherited	properties
take a look to the inherited properties of you elements using a tool like the firebug so it will easier for your to change them

3883302
uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller
if i set uiscrollview height to self.view.frame.size.height and setautoresizingmask uiviewautoresizingflexibleheight then when the view loads the uitabbarcontroller and the uinavigationbar the scroll view frame resizes to suit

3883318
folder	directory
also i would use svn-externals to share library directory kept as separate root folder of repository among various projects

3883328
google-chrome	firefox
note the examples show the difference the most in firefox and ie google-chrome seems ok

3883342
post	get
i ve attempted it here with the help of other post but can t seem to get it to work

and i have on submit button i am validating before submission

3883366
hide	show
when i click on the show or hide button the text input should appear or disappear

3883366
hide	show
the problem is that if the element appears safari hide it then show it

3883377
width	height
the way i understand this which maybe incorrect is that self.navigationcontroller.view.frame was same as self.view.frame and both were equal to x 0 y 0 width 320 height 480

3883435
hide	show
well you could make the code a lot simpler by using the jquery toggle function to show hide the element

3883460
for-loop	arrays
to find the three greatest elements in an arrays length 100 is a combination of a for-loop and an if statement s the most effective way or is there a more efficient method

3883464
post	get
post redirect get comes in to play to stop a user resending their post data if they refresh the page they ve been redirected to after submitting a form

3883487
column-count	height
2 specifying the column-count property all columns have the same computer-generated height the number of columns is defined by the author

3883494

then all you need to do is hide it and show it at the appropriate moment

3883497
apache	nginx
i need to accomplish this with the default django installation and not by using a webserver like nginx apache etc

3883497
folder	directory
now i don t mean two separate django applications but the separate folder inside the app directory

3883506
for-loop	arrays
for an arrays of greater size a for-loop with an if comparing the 3 elements to the current one sounds fine

3883519
for-loop	arrays
assuming the arrays is not sorted you have to go through each element with a for-loop or something equivalent.

3883558
client-side	server-side
i have got a form the user clicks send and everything works fine using a prg pattern and doing both client-side and server-side validation

3883607

int	double	int	chars
if by special chars you mean less-frequently used unicode chars like â â or â¼ then you can use either the function regexprep or set comparison functions like ismember and you can convert the chars string to its equivalent int code first using the function double if needed

3883688

up until now when adding a new feature i just copy pasted another button checkbox changing the variable names and id codes this worked pretty well

3883706
getter	setter
since you aren t doing anything in your getter setter you could get rid of them and just mark your arraycollection as bindable then set it as the dataprovider for the datagrid and be done

3883706
getter	setter
getting rid of the getter setter allows the arraycollection to handle dispatching that event for you

3883707
submit	submission
contradictory to the other up-voted answers please note that you do not need to explicitly return true from your submit handler for natural form submission

3883716
avrdude	attiny

3883742
for-loop	arrays
here s what you need to do after you have parsed out your json string and loaded that into a nsarray where you have nsarray keys written above from there you could put that into a for-loop where you iterate over the values in your keys arrays

3883760
post	get
a url http request get or post corresponds to the user browser client asking the server webapp with struts2 in top to perform some action

3883804
post	get
once the html is sent to the browser what the user does with your site is out of your control until his browser performs another get or post request or opens a persistent web socket connection

3883809
put	get
if it s one request you could theoretically get rid of datagrabber and put it inside your view controller but i like to separate my concerns - api and view controller stay separate

3883840
nsdateformatter	uidatepicker
both on device and simulator uidatepicker and nsdateformatter are returning incorrect dates adding or substracting the difference from gmt 0 from the selected date according to the current time zone set on the device or mac

3883841
implements	extends
i think what is frustrating me is that as jon hanna points out sometimes a virtual method simply indicates you must implements me whereas other times it means you must extends me -- if you fail to call the base version you break my design

3883854
google-chrome	safari
when i open the page in safari and google-chrome it s beautiful

3883878
nsmutablestring	nsdata	nsmutablestring	nsstring	nsstring	nsdata

3884034
hide	show
instead hide the anchors inside...the ones you want to show like this

3884096
getter	setter
if you partially override only the setter that could be useful so that you can respond to that event in addition to calling without having to bother with a boilerplate override of the getter as well

3884109
cos	sin
as sin cos etc

3884109
cos	sin
it includes cos sin and hundreds of others

3884116
opera	google-chrome
how can i force the same behavior resizing and moving in opera and google-chrome

3884120
integer	unsigned
it would be used to get the signed value of the unsigned integer or one more than the maximum value of a signed integer

3884120
integer	unsigned
the uint32_t would be casting it to an unsigned integer while the -0 would be forcing it to be negative flipping the signed bit and returning the unsigned value with it flipped

3884159
nsdateformatter	uidatepicker
you need to set the timezone properties of your uidatepicker and your nsdateformatter

3884183
post	get
however i want to return a new set of products based on the changes made by the post and not have to make a separate get call

post	get
using a post and then a get call appears to be the answer

3884192
maven	pom.xml
with the maven eclipse plugin i can configure checkstyle or sonar configurations by adding the necessary invocations to the pom.xml and calling mvn eclipse eclipse to create the project configuration

3884192
maven	pom.xml
what i want to accomplish is that people simply import maven project and they automatically get a project preconfigured with the correct checkstyle configuration which is possibly downloaded from somewhere as defined in the pom.xml without having to manually go into the project preferences and click around a lot

3884193
jar	war	jar	.war
if you have several .war files with the same jar files in them remove those jars from the war files and put them in the directory where all the common libraries of the web server are located

3884558
stretchblt	bitblt
it s very close to using bitblt or stretchblt parameter-wise except for the last parameter which is the alpha-blend structure and is very easy to understand

3884665
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
currently this works perfectly in ie and opera but it fails in google-chrome and safari

3884677
folder	directory
do we have a solution or should it downloadable folder be child directory of the webroot

3884695
post	get
using urllib2 are we able to use a method other than get or post when data is provided

3884695
post	get
i dug into the library and it seems that the decision to use get or post is conveniently tied to whether or not data is provided in the request

3884702

it works if i launch in portrait but if i launch in landscape the screen stay black until my app start

3884703

3884737
int	chars
load and zero- or sign-extend it to fill an int -sized word depending on whether plain chars is signed or unsigned

3884737
int	chars
in order for this to work reliably c should have type and unsigned int should be strictly wider than unsigned chars

3884738
try-catch	exception-handling
i have found consistently during that time the most effective exception-handling handling process is deferring to if-then before try-catch

3884797
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
this happens only when i change the category and or suppliers both are dropdownlistfor the other fields checkbox and textbox are ok

3884821

for example with ascii if you don t have a barrel shifter you can actually change the asrbits to 4 9-5 since convertval will be + -32 depending on the toupper or tolower operation

3884855
accessor	properties
the fix is to use list to retrieve the list of steps it appears using the indexed accessor on the factory returns invalid step instances where the id is just the index of the element and all properties are null

3884860

3885223
google-chrome	safari
webkit has implemented the fegaussianblur effect but filters are unstable and are disabled in safari it may work in google-chrome 5 - should definitely work in google-chrome 6

3885227
width	height
for example wpf uses nan to represent the width and height of visual elements that do not define their own size

3885305
put	get
the echo statements are fairly simple - echo checking file... might get put in the log as che then no more output

3885345
chunked	transfer-encoding
from what research i ve been doing it seems that when iis sets the transfer-encoding to chunked when compressing dynamic content which removes the content-length header as it violates the http1.1 standard when doing that

3885393
submit	submission
the other possibility regarding this i really need to read over the jquery tools docs... is that you need to manually submit the form - that is you might be successfully binding the handler but the form s never actually submission

3885395
width	height
reduce the actual height and width of the image but hopefully in a way that will not distort it

3885415

3885608
onclick	onchange
you don t want onclick - you want to use the onchange of the where you ll test its current value to see if it s what you want

3885622
onclick	onchange
why not use jquery throughout with the onchange event instead of onclick

3885626

what it could be and i ve noticed from sniffing is that it sends the header + post data upload data as one packet and firefox google-chrome sends it as 2 seperate packets

3885717
equals	gethashcode
i have a class which derives from contentcontrol and i m not able to override gethashcode and equals method

ubuntu	linux
i was wandering how could capture video from the built-in camera of my netbook under linux ubuntu

3886634
innodb	myisam
you ll need your data in mysql and it must be in a myisam table not innodb or other.

3886683

3886690
maya	blender
for unity you can create 3d model animations and import them but i am not sure if its compatible with blender but it is compatible with maya

3886723

this may not be your ideal solution but you could show or hide your animated image just using javascript

3887014
typedef	struct
since you have already typedef it in particle.h drop the word struct from the array declaration line the line where the error is

3887016
inherited	properties
when i click the ellipsis next to the picture properties of a timage it calls an inherited method - i don t know which - to allow me to load a picture

3887022
typedef	struct
firstly in c++ you don t need to typedef your struct

3887041
inherited	properties
just leave the flavour properties out so it inherited it from iapple

3887044
inherited	properties
no you donâ t need the new keyword to inherited a properties from an interface in another interface

3887059
inherited	properties
when there seems to be a need to replace an inherited properties for the inherited make sense i generally look for one of two things

3887060
rss	feed
btw atom feed are the new standard for rss i hear

3887074
public	protected
virtual functions can have public protected or private access

3887074
public	protected
should i use protected virtuals instead of public virtuals

3887110
ienumerable	iqueryable
evaluating a query whether ienumerable or iqueryable is a potential source of exceptions even when the query itself is not null

3887155
int	boolean
in that by default xquery support basic data-types as int float decimal boolean types

3887186
super	implements
there is quite a bit of literature out there on the subject what i described was just a super simple method you could implements in an hour or so with opencv

3887222
int	double
i want to write a conditional statement depending on whether a variable is an int or double i.e

3887238

i have no idea how x could be an int or a double without you knowing at compile time but

3887245
int	double
public void foo int x double y ...

3887246
put	get
other people say that you can put an open parenthesis before each glob and then your editor will not get grumpy about the mismatched parentheses

3887266
post	get
my experience with ajax is limited-- i ve only used them to store data to the server a-la post commands and so i really have no idea how to get data back from the server

3887273
int	double
now back to the suspected problem i expect that you need to use double somewhere not int - in your other question you talked about scaling factors

3887274
hash	md5
create an md5 hash of the string and take the first three bytes as the red green and blue components respectively

3887289

3887388
vim	emacs
maybe it is circumvented by emacs and vim

3887415
hash	md5
its important to point out that as long as your hash function does a decent job of being pseudo-random it doesn t matter which one you use whether it is sha1 md5 or any form of checksum --these numbers assume completely random inputs and thus you can only approach these values by using increasingly better hash functions

3887467
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox can use woff and ttf ie uses svg and eot

3887473
subscript	superscript
i am developing an application that needs some kind of subscript and superscript support to display text that refers to chemical formula if i do it in a textbox winforms and want for example show water formula it would appear as h20 rather than h subscript 2 o sorry i coudn t find how to do it here

3887474

3887803
try-catch	exception-handling
in java you can call option s isempty isdefined and get without any special hassle the really useful option methods such as getorelse are another matter. checking the result of the isdefined method in an if-clause should be faster than checking exception-handling in a try-catch block

3887832

3888645
typedef	struct
when you only want to expose opaque pointers you put the typedef in your header file interface and the struct declaration in your source file implementation

3888758
wxpython	pyqt

this approach is a lot less long-winded than the surrounding abstract class and allows more flexible uses such as children that are also parent

one way i can think of is hooking into the change of the viewport size and checking if the height width ratio has changed

3888859
uiswitch	uibutton

int	chars
reverse the order of the structure members such that the int precedes the chars

3889158

this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested

3889163
gridview	sqldatasource
is there a way i can hide all these elements they are detailsviews and gridview plus the multiview and menu if the sqldatasource is blank

use to get an object you can put in the collection

3889235
nsinteger	double
nsarray is more like a list in java into which you can add objects but not values like nsinteger bool double etc

so first put pointers and double then int then shorts and any chars members last

3889254

3889583
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
while it would be ideal that ie7 6 users all move to ie8 or google-chrome firefox opera they will still be around for years to come maybe ie6 will not last as long as ie7 but ie7 lacks any real javascript changes

3889634

im rendering 2 pages each side of the page in focus so that the pdf image is ready to mask the layer before it starts drawing.pages are destroyed again when they are +2 pages away from the focused page

packets	multicast
just send udp packets to for instance address 224.1.2.3 which is a multicast address

3889901
xul	xbl
if you re using the firefox plugin exclusively then you can create new xform extension components by wrapping any combination of html javascript xforms and xul widgets in xbl

3889901
xul	xbl
in your case probably the most efficient way to get this working would be to wrap the xul colour picker component in xbl then write a little bit of javascript to link the picker s onchange event back to your model

3889904
google-chrome	safari
some browsers like safari and google-chrome have a pretty good javascript engine making them more efficient

3889909
ciimage	nsimage
what i need is an image whether it be a cvimagebufferref ciimage or nsimage doesn t matter from the current frame of the h.264 sample that is given to me by the output object s call back

ant	cruisecontrol
that said you can do compilation on demand quite well with ant and or cruisecontrol

3890098
avd	galaxy
i installed the add-on provided by samsung so i could create an avd that would emulate a galaxy tab but unfortunately my most important project uses the google api for using the maps external library which is not supported by the single additional target that the add-on provides

3890119
post	get
other than that post is rather similar to get except that the data is sent in the body of the request instead of the url and there are two ways to encode them multipart-form-data in addition to the urlencode that s shared with get

3890143
equals	gethashcode
one point i haven t seen mentioned is that when you override the gethashcode you should also override the equals to keep consistency and to avoid unexpected behaviour

3890151
int	boolean
public boolean oneditoraction textview view int actionid keyevent event

3890168
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately after applying the pie it seems ie8 is just does not want to look the same as google-chrome or firefox

3890186
spaces	delimiter
in the above string spaces seems to be a good delimiter between words so lets use that

3890186
strdup	strtok
if you want to store the returned values from strtok you need to copy the token to another buffer strdup p

inside the http request post data is actually formatted pretty much the same as get data

3890199

concerning innodb and myisam i do not know

3890335
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in my case i also so long as there s no overt restriction to the contrary include a conditional comment somewhere on the page that pops up a modal dialogue linking to various other free browsers typically google-chrome firefox safari and opera and suggesting the users might like to up-grade in order to improve their experience

3890335
google-chrome	firefox
if a client requests it then fair enough but normally explaining the cost-per-hour just to givie curvy-corners is enough of an incentive to allow for rectangular boxes in ie and curves in firefox google-chrome etc

3890375
put	get
however as far as i can determine this function doesnâ t get called if i put an alert at the start it brings nothing up

3890385
hide	show
how many events would be optimum if we were to hide show events based on the checkbox clicks - each checkbox click involves looping thru the list of events and identifying which ones need to be show and this list is rendered at once

3890428
onfocus	onblur
in onfocus onblur method just remember last focused widget

3890505
put	get
you re trying to use a get request but put a body in it

i think i m hitting a limitation of bitmapimage though as the image seems to get cut off at 2048 pixels in either height or width

3890521
post	get
i just read so many post about installers for a java app and i d like to get some opinions as for the best choices

3890549
post	get
ah note you can pass both get and post variables in the same request

3890569
pthreads	fcntl
for pthreads systems take a look at fcntl

3890571
opera	firefox
changing the scrollbar color in firefox is not as trivial as it is in internet explorer and opera

3890571
margin	height
set the margin and padding of html and body to 0 and set the height to 100

3890580
minimum	max
a wm_getminmaxinfo is called to determine the minimum size and max size the window its called during snap so that it does not resize the window beyond its actual outlined size so if you have an application that is 500 in height and that is a constant height you dont want windows to resize it to fit the height of your screen

3890595
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome 6.0 but does not disappear after click in mozilla firefox 3.6 why

3890622

btw why do you use shfileoperation instead of the operations provided by qdir and qfile

3890685
for-loop	loops
i am facing a problem that after i created the jquery post i was able to receive all the data but as a one peace so when i began rephrasing them i succeed until the final part which was the inserting into the database where inside the for-loop and if loops i am getting the value but when i wanted to start inserting them into the database i am getting null values below is the for-loop and if loops

3890711
std	ostream
subclass std ostream and make call my_print_f

3890736

3890762
rss	feed
currently i have a script that inserts items of rss feed just post in the url in a form and submit

3890762
rss	feed
if an item in the rss feed is removed then my script needs to detect this and delete the row or insert a flag into my table to say its been deleted.

3890786
set-cover	np-complete
the general set-cover is np-complete but here with have the no-overlapping constraints does it helps

3890791
mdpi	hdpi
so in fact the drawable directory is pretty much the same as the drawable-mdpi directory and because you don t have the ldpi and hdpi versions defined the system automatically builds them out of your mdpi resources

3890798
redhat	fedora
on redhat or fedora that is apache unless you re using a different web server other flavors of linux might use www or some other user

3890808
prng	random
there is a discussion of how to make a multiple-stream mersenne twister random number generator at multiple stream mersenne twister and also an implementation source code in fortran 95 at ishikawa prng mt_stream_en.html

3890868
pull	push
ps i don t know if it s a pull or push replication how do i check this

i should hide all visible sub menu and images before show right image for the menu

3890959
std	ostream
std ostream is responsible for formatting but not printing itself

3890959
std	ostream
std cout combines a std ostream formatter with a std streambuf -derived object that writes to stdout

3890959
std	ostream
as std cout is just another ostream you can replace its streambuf too

3890964
comparator	comparable
it can be constructed to use the content s natural sort order via the comparable interface on each object or via a comparator

3890977
stdout	stderr
first is to invoke your script with redirection of both stderr and stdout into the log file

3890982
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome etc

3891090
ubuntu	debian
that s what led to the dependency-based boot in debian ubuntu

3891103
glfw	sdl
it isn t sdl but glfw works on windows with haskell through cabal

3891105
hash	salt
for extra security against dictionary attacks you should also salt the hash passwords

3891120
post	get
anyway i m sure it s not a perfect idea it would require some js on client side to manage and i haven t been able to do a project yet to see how it unfolds but the post was trying to think about how to get there and back again so i figured i would give my thoughts

3891123
ilist	icollection
you can check that the object is of type icollection generic or ilist non-generic and that their isreadonly property is not set to true

3891191
writetofile	nsdata
however this only works for files that are local - if you want to copy a file from a server you should have a look at nsurlconnection to load the data and then nsdata s writetofile atomically method to save the contents to the file system found here .

3891255
firefox	safari
just go into safari open preferences then select firefox as the default browser at the top of the first tab

3891304
inherited	properties
i assume you re using winforms - where properties inherited is the normal behavior

3891314
mouse	keyboard
it won t get around to doing its normal duties which include painting the controls and responding to the mouse and keyboard

3891350
punctuation	words
and if you wanted to strip all punctuation at the beginning and end except for example the dollar-sign in front of a words you could use this

3891361
ocp	principles
a good heuristic would be to use some kind of metric like robert martin s instability and abstractness pdf or metrics for lack of cohesion to better prepare your systems for change and to have a better chance of following the ocp and all the other important principles of ood

3891446
onresume	onpause
i have some common actions fired in onpause and onresume methods

3891452
kde	gnome
you likely want to set up a program to start on kde gnome login

3891455
int	chars
if you really want to get through the bottom of it then try to understand arrays and pointers through int rather than chars

3891467
hash	md5
if you are storing passwords do not store them as clear text use md5 most popular or some other hash

3891516
hide	show
in code i now wish to selectively show hide that uiscrollview

3891544
std	ostream
on the other hand in case of option 2 the operator still will be found because ostream is in std same adl rule

3891546
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome nor safari

3891569
ubuntu	linux
all the team members under 10 in number will login to the linux ubuntu server box and run the build script

3891573

according to quirksmode safari and google-chrome donâ t support blur on links and or form fields in all circumstances.

3891590
versioning	upgrade
the helper will then create the database if it doesn t exist upgrade it if an older versioning exists or simply open it if it exists and the versioning matches

3891599
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you want a uitabbarcontroller respectively it s view to be a subview of a uinavigationcontroller

3891617
int	chars
when doing this query the trivial way it will be horribly slow as sql server does an implicit conversion of the column value from int to chars in order to apply the wildcard every single time that query is run

3891617
int	chars
the idea would be to create an index that stores the converted to chars value of that int column so sql server can reuse that instead of reconverting millions of values every query

quoting from the c-- faq simply c-- has no high-level types---it does not even distinguish floating-point variables from integer variables

3891736
postgresql	mysql
if you using stuff like linq to sql it takes a little more attention to make it work and mysql and postgresql are not supported that well

3891808
intersect	contains
finally intersect will only give you results that contains all your parameters

3891811
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git
just because you have a centralized version control system if it is not sane enough for you checkin checkout style cvs very slow to do anything then install bazaar or git on your local machine and version control

3891840
next	except
easy enough except it will screw up the validation standard error that s supposed to appear next to my field and i haven t found a solution for that yet

3891841
rss	feed
if simply replacing your data with new data from the rss feed won t work for you you could run through a few steps

3891856
put	get
and don t get caught in the band-aid syndrome put any old fix in that will work

3891970

3891980
udp	tcp
in windows xp sp2 if necessary is there any way to detect from a userspace application that a tcp udp socket from any process has opened

3892003
versioning	upgrade	disk	ram
more likely with later versioning of windows since they need more ram and tend to suffer when the machine was upgrade instead of wiped before the install due to disk fragmentation problems especially the paging file

3892004
3des	aes
3des is getting quite old now and is getting replaced by aes so i m wondering if biztalk has built in support for it yet

noteview extends linearlayout and contains two button and a checkbox

3892010

i could dynamically create a canvas element and hide it but then again i don t want to show the image directly to the user anytime so there s no point of actually having a canvas element in the page

3892028
hide	show
inside there is a panel that i want to show hide on click of a hyperlink inside the usercontrol

3892028
hide	show
currently with my existing code if i click the hyperlink in any row it show hide the panel in the bottom row of the gridview

3892028
hide	show
therefore my question is how do i get the actual unique id i need to show hide on the correct control in the correct row

3892045
hide	show
why don t you just show it indefinitely until the mouse moves then check to see if the mouse is over it and hide if it s not

3892049
width	height
edittext has width as fill_parent and height as wrap_content

3892084
visualvm	jstat
visualvm is able to make a jstat connection to the process which it discovers automatically but this means i don t get access to mbeans or for example the cpu history chart

3892125
put	get
but when i put my break point on that line and press f11 the debugger says that there is no source code available so i cannot get into it deeper

3892173
hide	show
when i hover over a top level menu item how do i hide all sub-menus and show only the hovered items

3892180
put	get
get the old versions of the libs from the previous version of the package and keep them around just for your binary you could put them somewhere out of usr lib and load them just for your program with ld_library_path

3892194
equals	gethashcode
every property is virtual every mapping file is an embedded resource every composite id has its own class which overrides equals and gethashcode

3892216
hide	show
there are also all sorts of really cool effects you can get for show and hide - such as fade blind and many more

3892231
google-chrome	safari
the table has border-spacing set and in google-chrome and safari the space between the header row and the rest is doubled

3892232
ffmpeg	avisynth
i ve seen both splicer and the directshow.net wrappers but i m not sure it s worth the time to bring all of the editing into our app and not just use avisynth ffmpeg mencoder to perform the actual editing after the user sets all of the above things

3892232
wmv	flv
it d be nice if it would use directshow at some level so that any codecs installed on the machine will be available as the videos could be in wmv flv divx mp4 etc

3892241
coalesce	nvl
you can t use nvl or nvl2 or coalesce which are similar here because there s no data on which these functions can operate

3892263
put	get
to use it you d normally multiply by some multiple of 10 to get the number of decimal places you want then convert to integer and put a decimal point in the right place in the result

3892266
gridview	rowdatabound
you can do this at the rowdatabound event of gridview

3892266
gridview	rowdatabound
write below code at your gridview rowdatabound event

3892289
ocp	principles
good design principles like the ocp are not add odds with good development processes like unit tests and tdd

3892379
division	multiplication
now integer overflows resulting from division are a lot more rare than say multiplication

3892379
division	multiplication
why should a multiplication overflow which is much more likely to accidentally occur be silently ignored by the hardware but a division overflow is supposed to trigger a fatal interrupt

3892405
put	get
i didn t put much research into it but this link might get you headed in the right direction

3892409
width	font-size
for instance if the date format is yyyy-mm-dd is there some trick to convert those 10 chars to a width which will guarantee that it shows ok in any browser using any font and font-size without also taking up any excessive space

3892430
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
when you get an integer overflow with integer 2 s complement add subtract multiplying you still have a valid result - it s just missing some high order bits

3892446
salt	md5
but it doesn t just md5 s the original password but a very mixed-up password using salt and other methods

3892496
int	chars
if the range of an int is -128 to 127 use chars instead of int or unsigned chars if it s 0 to 255

3892520
16-bit	64bit
what i think you are being asked to do is take the 64bit of data you have and treat it like 4 16-bit integers

3892520
width	height
those percentages when multiplied to the image height width give you 4 coordinates

3892547
put	get
i have created site on my local machine that works fine on debug mode but when i put the site on local iis 7.5 of my machine i get

3892566

can you utilize onpause onresume to close open the connection

3892629
opencv	emgucv
i do not know any good signal processing libraries in .net but emgucv opencv is wrapper around opencv which can do advanced signal processing

3892661
post	get
is there any difference in network communication for http get and post requests

3892661
post	get
what would be the total time for a get vs post call

3892680
int	chars
it can return either eof which is a negative int constant if there were no remaining chars to red or there was an error or it can return the value of the chars read as an unsigned chars and converted to a int

3892680
int	chars
in side the loop you need to be careful in the comparison of the returned value due to the way the fact that ch is the unsigned chars converted to an int

3892680
int	chars
on most platforms the simplest thing to do would be to create a chars variable for comparison purposes although you could put your chars constants throught the same unsigned chars to int conversion routine

3892699
put	get
for login versus non-login shells the one way to get complete control that i found suitable was to put my changes into something like .local_bashrc

3892714
post	get	post	put	put	get
i am trying to get the last post date of my wordpress blog for my program to show when the last date that we put important information for the user on it

3892738
post	get
gets are used for that post are used for requesting data be changed on the server or for security reasons don t use get to submit a password for example

3892808
post	get
if you use post only to replace get it will be indistinguishably

3892848
justmock	typemock
i know there is typemock and justmock but both are commercial products and quite expensive

3892859
firefox	safari

3892930
mouseup	mousedown
capturing the mousedown mouseup events in the textarea or a div containing the textarea and calling event.stoppropagation

3892965
integer	unsigned
c99 defines conversion from unsigned to signed integer types as follows â 6.3.1.3 signed and unsigned integers

3892965
integer	unsigned
many but not all implementations will simply interpret the unsigned values as a twos-complement representation of a signed integer

3892965
clang	llvm
clang llvm gives exactly the same result

3892965
integer	unsigned
a better solution of course would be for the c standard to pin down the behavior of conversions from unsigned to signed when the signed type is a twos-complement integer without padding thus specifying the behavior for all of the intn_t types

3892977
post	get
you can send more data with post than get but this doesn t mean they respond faster it s a separate issue

3892977
post	get
there isn t exactly a lot of involvement of whether the string inside the tcp packet is get or post the network looks at it says oh you re tcp huh

3892988
implements	extends
i have managed to create a menu using the xml and a class that extends preferenceactivity and implements onsharedpreferencechangelistener now i would like to be notified everytime the user changes a value from preferences when a user changes the username

3893001
children	parent
although the parent company will still appear in each of the ranks as it has children that are in that particular rank but the measures will only be from the children that are in that rank

3893017
ironruby	ironpython
managed javascript was also dropped however the developers were reassigned to work on chakra the ecmascript engine of ie9 which means that of the original four dlr compilers vbx managed javascript ironruby ironpython only ironpython and ironruby survived

3893017
ironruby	ironpython
well actually there s some doubt about the latter since while ms refuses to officially announce anything about ironruby they also have reassigned all developers to other projects so that there is only one half-time developer where half-time doesn t even mean half-time on ironruby but half-time on the dlr ironpython and ironruby together inside ms left

3893027
filesystems	ntfs
also if you can rely on the target filesystems being ntfs you could symlink to the 32-bit or 64-bit dll as needed

3893028
oncreate	ondestroy
you should be able to open your database in the oncreate method and close it in the ondestroy method

3893050
post	get
ok so we have a get and a post request

3893083
integer	unsigned
from a programming standpoint there s no reason that an unexpected divide overflow should be any more or less serious than an unexpected integer overflow signed or unsigned

3893100
openfire	ejabberd
xmpp based pubsub for example using any one of a number of xmpp servers openfire ejabberd ... and writing your client code including publishing trigger with smack

3893101

it s perfectly safe assuming it has a terminating condition a break or return statement or even a goto i suppose somewhere

3893136
spaces	linefeed
linefeed some text spaces at beginning only for this post linefeed

3893138
profiling	debugging
if you re tyring to debugging a system using sql profiling and tracking the sp starting and sp completed events may help figure things out

3893140
post	get
you would use the metaweblog.getrecentposts method to get the most recent post

3893175
post	get
given the same amount of information the post message doesn t exceed the get post should technically be faster on the serverside by nano-to-picoseconds

3893175
post	get
the get stores data in the query string the post stores the info in the message body

3893175
post	get
you ll notice this if doing any ajax it s a lot easier to send a get request than post

3893175
post	get
get has the ability to outperform post requests

3893209
winpcap	wireshark
use winpcap or a separate packet sniffer such as wireshark to monitor the nic

3893357
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
by huge numbers i mean if you took a gigabyte instead of 4 8 bytes etc. and tried to add subtract multiplying divide it by some other arbitrarily large or small number

3893357
subtract	add	disk	ram
for every byte thus i can add subtract as i read the number from the disk and not risk running out of ram

3893363
backgrounding	multitasking
with the support of multitasking in ios 4.0+ is there any way that i can have my application run in the backgrounding and detect the launching and exiting of other applications

3893375
domxpath	domdocument
i was able to get it domdocument and domxpath working locally after running the fetched html through php tidy but php tidy isn t installed on the server and its a shared hosting server so i have no control over that

3893448
width	height
of course you will need to adjust the width of .image and the height of the img tag this can be done through css but the rest will be done for you

3893463
rubygems	rvm
i don t use rvm and re-installing rubygems didn t resolve the issue.

3893476
opera	firefox
in firefox opera ie the ckeditor is working and looks great

3893476
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari it is not sizing correctly and is extending past the container that it is inside

3893476
google-chrome	safari
i assume this is because google-chrome and safari are currently the most standards compliant

3893514
gson	jackson
my favorite is jackson others like gson and flex-json also work well

3893529
set	bag
for your immediate purposes in your inspector view right-click on the jpanel and select set layout - grid bag layout

check out scotthanselmans article back to basics 32-bit and 64bit confusion around x86 and x64 and the .net framework and clr

3893533
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i was wondering if i could use a for-loop to loops through the results 0 arrays and get the page and title names and insert them into a new arrays

3893572
min	max
the key is that the data structure must have very fast faster than o n max min insert remove and update operations

3893594
google-chrome	firefox
my most sincere apologies i some how completely missed the fact that this was a google-chrome issue and had been testing in firefox thats why i wasn t showing the same problem

3893609
getter	setter
there are two properties with the following getter and accompanying setter in scheduledthreadpoolexecutor

3893616
width	height
but i don t know is it possible to access width height from flashplayer

3893638
googletest	gmock
but my recommendation is googletest together with gmock gmock comes with a copy of googletest bundled

3893643
width	height
most fonts have a character width less than the height so assuming width height will definitely work

3893643
width	height
just make sure that the width height comparison reflects the current font size and not any hard-coded value

3893663
for-loop	arrays
the textbooks i have say that int arrays are set to zero but they also recommend that one should write a for-loop to set all values to zero just to be clearer

3893706
portrait	landscape
maybe the content size fit in portrait and not in landscape

3893706
portrait	landscape
for example if you contentsize is set to 700 900 it will fit into the scrollview when in portrait mode and not in landscape mode

3893714
kde	gnome
most also bundle desktop environments like kde or gnome

3893714
ubuntu	debian
packages like dbus are upstream and flow downstream to distributions such as debian fedora ubuntu and the like

3893734
children	parent
now you can instantiate forms set them as children to the main mdi parent and have all the window functionality you re looking for.

3893747
post	get
it would only work when javascript is on the client side but sending a post to some script every 15 seconds will get you a reasonable amount of granularity

3893765
for-loop	loops
i thought i could use modulus and a for-loop to iterate through and create an infinite loops but when i put this in it s like it executes everything all at once not iterating through fading in and out for each item

3893778
ubuntu	debian
that said i started with debian in 1994 and still use it as well as ubuntu and i ve been maintaining packages for debian since 1995 too

3893778
ubuntu	debian
when i develop on ubuntu i sometimes take a source package from debian unstable and build it locally -- which is actually pretty simple yet really useful

3893786
pop-up	dialog
when my android activity pop-up a progress dialog what is the right way to handle when user clicks the back button

3893824
daemons	systemd
daemons function for uclinux systemd without mmu and fork by jamie lokier in patch format

3893831

google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to connect to a web page through a httpurlconnection but it s not responding the same as a regular browser firefox google-chrome

3893852

3893864
firefox	safari
firefox and safari have no big problems with it

3893902
cvs	svn
i recently did a survey of common lisp users and most of them simply manage libraries by hand by downloading project archives and checking things out of git cvs svn etc

3893902
cvs	svn
it grabs libraries from git cvs svn for you

3893924
hide	show
so to hide the grid you cane use and to show it back

3893961
vbo	normals
the number of elements in an attribute array must all be equal if you have a vbo made of 64 vertices you will need to have 64 texcoords 64 normals etc

3893963
put	get
if i put a breakpoint in the page_load event i see that i get in and the btnaddsave_click event is also executed

3893967
quicksort	heapsort
there are several that have this property including quicksort merge sort heapsort etc. but which one to use depends on your use case

3893974
r5rs	r6rs
this is not possible with r5rs and i m not sure about r6rs

3893975
width	height
x y width height

3893985
quicksort	heapsort
the general purpose algorithms like heapsort or quicksort are optimized for in place sorting of an array of items

3893993
inherited	subclassing
the normal reason for subclassing is to inherited behavior

3894016
getter	setter
the first thing that keeps getting suggested to me is to use the propertychanged notification but that would only work for the setter not the getter

3894038
quicksort	heapsort
in the comments and by kriss in his answer you may want to have a look at heapsort which provides a theoretically better sorting complexity than a quicksort but will won t often fare better in practical settings

3894046
ant	maven
but you can always embed ant in it if you need to using the ant plugin for maven

3894055
fast-forward	merge
pushed only if the merge on that central subrepo is a fast-forward one

3894055
fast-forward	merge
they won t be able to push back that submodule if the merge isn t a fast-forward one

3894058
ant	maven
you can get maven s dependency management by using ivy together with ant

3894059
hide	show
i need to write a jquery function that be able to capture whenever either checkbox cb1 or cb2 is clicked to hide show it s corresponding info div info1 or info2

3894074
vim	textmate	textmate	textwrangler
well i use vim in the console but subethaedit textmate and textwrangler are popular editors i know

3894079
opera	firefox
this doesn t effect opera 10.5x firefox 3.5.x or likely any other browser this is all i ve tested so far

3894079
opera	firefox
firefox opera alert hello

3894082
apache	nginx
i am using a freepascal web module designed for apache cgi-bin with nginx

3894125
hide	show
when a change occurs it traverses to the .next element sibling and calls .toggle which will show hide based on whether the checkbox was checked or not

3894254
dictionary	map
although not as flexible as using a dictionary you might be able to get by using a simple lookup table to the map box numbers to a particular box in boxes

3894300
post	get
i m using jquery s form plugin as suggested in a number of threads like this one to make an ajax post to a .net mvc controller and consume the json i get back

3894300
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome but in some other browsers including firefox 3 the form submit results in a save or open this file dialog box

3894323
spaces	delimiter
but if you have just a list of words separated by spaces you can define a set of delimiter and split the string with an api function

3894330
hlsl	glsl
does somebody know where i can find a sample of shader hlsl cg glsl backend-independent class

3894422
pop-up	dialog
all are to be done on pop-up model dialog user remains on same page

3894426
folder	directory
choose all files by status and folder path . in the folder area on the left select your root directory

3894460
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up look for the variable called selected_resource_loc

3894460
pop-up	dialog
choose it and dismiss the pop-up dialog

3894481
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately i notice in google-chrome firefox etc that after clicking on different pages my app is leaking memory

3894499
post	put
what about the other methods put post and delete

3894502
pop-up	dialog
i also am trying to to make it so when the user clicks on a day a dialog pop-up telling the user what events they have scheduled for that day

3894520
hide	show
i can get the indicator to show by adding it as a subview to tableview but i can t figure out how to hide the rows until they are ready to be displayed

3894567
ienumerable	iqueryable
only when you call a method that takes the iqueryable and produces a concrete or ienumerable result tolist and similar asenumerable etc is the tree evaluated by the linq provider linq2objects is built into the framework as is linq2sql and now the msef

3894567
ienumerable	iqueryable
any ienumerable class in the framework can be cast to an iqueryable using the asqueryable extension method and linq providers that will translate the expression tree like orms will provide an asqueryable as a jump-off point for a linq query against their data

3894567
sorting	grouping	min	max
ones that do require knowing the entire collection sorting via orderby grouping with groupby and aggregates like min and max will slurp their entire source enumerable into a list or array and work on it forcing evaluation of all elements through all higher nodes

3894572
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
my thoughts were two nested for loops the outside goes through each index of the textfile arrays and the inner for-loop compares the first letter of the desired pattern

3894581
min	max
when you hit the up and down spin buttons the value is parsed and then compared to your min and max values

3894647
factors	mean
if you mean the value that corresponds to the thumb placement uses a different conversion factors from pixel position to real value that would need to be implemented in the function you built to do that translation

3894696
background-image	background-position
e.g. background-image background-position etc

3894710
integer	fractions
lastly deal in fractions values for velocity and acceleration which will be turned into an integer position change only at the last minute when you re drawing the object s new position

3894736
folder	dir
when i go to the root folder in my browser it does load the index.php view i want to make a link to show.php which is also in my views dir

3894749
min	max
but i like to use min and max more

3894775
ienumerable	ilist
i have a virtual method that returns an ilist or rather post-answers an ienumerable and the default implementation is empty

3894780
accessor	properties
because the object returned from the get accessor is autoreleased in the current scope it remains valid if the properties value is changed

3894780
getter	setter
the performance of technique 2 is significantly better than technique 1 in situations where the getter is called much more often than the setter

3894786
ant	maven
if you really want to use hibernate use maven ant and generate your mappings and anything you want with hibernatetools in maven that would be

3894788
pull	push
after that the server will have a full copy of the repository and you will be able to push and pull to and from it

3894797
getter	setter
if you re using synthesize you don t need to care about the getter and setter implementations so long as you ve specified the property options retain copy etc. correctly

3894797
getter	setter
unless you see actual perf problems regarding the getter and setter which would be doubtful i wouldn t worry about how it s implemented internally

3894797
getter	setter
if you really want to use a specific getter or setter just implement it on your class

3894797
getter	setter
alternatively you can implement both the getter and setter and leave out the synthesize statement entirely

3894797

if you use innodb engine for mysql tables then you can count with fk safe transactions but a performance not as fast pretty in the same level as postgresql which is good

3894961
postgresql	mysql
but now i think you have a better panorama about postgresql and mysql

3895267
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

3895307
gridview	repeater
this is fairly doable with a gridview but a repeater would also work as well as a simple ajax implementation returning a table structure

3895415
post	get
i m still fairly new to cakephp but i think you could use countercache to track the # of comments per post model record in a field in your post table and then use some simple conditions in your find to get what you are looking for

3895415
children	parent
countercache automatically updates the cache count field in the parent model record field when children model records are added deleted

3895544
integer	unsigned
the only way i can see that this reasoning might fail to be valid is if and the 8-bit integer types are extended integer types with trap bits that somehow flag whether the value is signed or unsigned

3895544
int	chars
with that said i would still never use uint8_t and always explicitly use unsigned chars in case the implementation implements uint8_t as an equal-size extended int type because chars types have special privileges with respect to aliasing rules and type punning which make them more desirable

3895552
button	checkbox
for example button checkbox textfields etc

3895567

you can then write custom logic in javascript to determine the case in which each validation control is either enabled or disabled and tie it to one of the client-side events of the text boxes onblur onchange onkeyup etc

3896027
hide	show
i didn t understand much of what you said but to add a hide show event you could do something like this

3896387
hide	show
when you click view button your div is show and view button is hide

3896438
hide	show
i would recommend rather than trying to dynamically add stuff like this to the page instead have it all setup and just hide and show the select lists depending on the input

3896438
hide	show
adding new elements to a page is very costly and the code to do something like this is going to be very complex however it would be quite easy to use the css property display none and display block instead display none will hide an element while display block will show it

3896533
bonjour	avahi
but unfortunately i do not think the windows implementation of avahi msdns bonjour supports aliases correct me if i am wrong with examples of how to support this

3896533
bonjour	avahi
my only disappointment is that the windows implementation of bonjour avahi does not support the aliases that this implementation announces it will only see the main avahi hostname normally announced ie server.local in our example above

ui to object updates does not requires implementation of inotifycollectionchanged nor inotifypropertychanged

3896760
pop-up	dialog
if you want to stay in the ssms designer world you could also create a database diagram of your tables involved and then just drag drop your table2id column from table1 over to table2 and drop it onto the id column there - this would graphically tell ssms what you want to do and you just need to review your choices and click ok on the dialog that pop-up

this because some tags can be seen as children of parent of other tags while others cannot so for example dialog tag is a concept that is also indipendent from jquery so a content with both tags jquery dialog has implicitly the relationship needed

3896949
inherited	properties
if your table structure is that all flat records represent a single properties but not all properties records refer to a flat then that s table inherited

width	height
for instance the wpf datagrid has virtualizing turned on by default but if you place the datagrid inside a stackpanel and don t provide any width height restrictions then you effectively nullify virtualization since the stackpanel allows the datagrid to grow infinitely thus having to create datagridrows for hundreds of thousands items

3897647
width	height
in winforms the hosting control propbably provides specific width height restrictions and doesn t allow the usercontrol to grow infinitely
