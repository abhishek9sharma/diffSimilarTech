sorting	filtering
csv gives you objects that look and feel like ruby hash es and array s so you can use all the standard ruby methods for sorting filtering and iterating including the aforementioned enumerable#sort_by

1700403
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
unfortunately at the moment there is no ie support and to get the other browsers that support it to be happy you have to use both wav and ogg or mp3

1700403
mp3	wav
unfortunately it doesn t natively support wav so either you use a typically slow wav reader or you go with mp3 and have multiple audio formats to worry about again

1700406
sorting	filtering
it has multi column filtering and sorting row based events paging and can work with the dom or accept data via ajax call

1700434
viewdidload	dealloc
by the time you dealloc your viewcontroller you try to release strapproval but the viewdidload allready released this value and you get a bad-access

1700701
width	height
the main app area grid is set to auto width and auto height

1700701
width	height
this is working as expected and it does scale to fit the whole application in height and width

1700701
width	height
the usercontrol is also set to auto width and height and by looking at the default settings in expression blend the horizontalalignment and the verticalalignment are set to stretch

1700701
width	height
however the prism loaded usercontrol only stretches in width and not in height

1700701
width	height
i have tried going trough all settings an manually overriding them to width and height auto horizontal and vertical alignment to stretch but nothing seems to work as expected

1700745
lisp	smalltalk
there are several reasons for this a lot of rubyists are already seasoned smalltalk or lisp programmers when they pick up ruby so they don t need those books

1700803
children	parent
a parent has a collection of children

1700810
getter	setter
also you should note that c# use properties as opposed to java for example that uses getter setter

1700815
rdf	owl
the fact is that some people rightfully don t want to dig into the xml xpath schema rdf rdf-xml owl and whatnot and they are happy writing

1700844
hash	salt
now you just need to pull all records from the database where the passwordformat 0 run them through a console app to hash the password and save the salt hash password to the database as well as update the passwordformat field to 1

1700857
gif	png
for some reason certain images jpg gif or png will show up as byte code when accessed directly on the server

firefox 3 and safari both think the content type is text html

1700857
photoshop	paint.net
the first image works fine in photoshop cs illistrator gimp paint.net and any other image editing software

1700872
outputstream	inputstream
basically you just need to get the inputstream from the fileitem object and write it to any outputstream to your taste using the usual java io way

1700872
outputstream	inputstream
and now downloading the file create a servlet which takes the file identifier as request parameter or pathinfo and uses the usual java io way to read the file into an inputstream and writes it to the outputstream of the httpservletresponse

1700872
post	put
the more effort you put in asking a question the more you will encourage others to post more code

1700932
hide	show
basically 2 buttons operating like tabs to show hide stuff

1700963
ready	each
another approach is to always have a blank record in each pane ready for the user to fill out eliminating the need for the add record menu item

1700963
hide	show
however it would help if you provided easy ways for users to resize and hide show each pane

1700979
slideup	slidedown
you could use slidetoggle instead of checking for visibility and then using slidedown or slideup

1701055
int	chars
when i convert an unsigned 8-bit int to string then i know the result will always be at most 3 chars for 255 and for an signed 8-bit int we need 4 chars for -128

interlocked uses atomic assembly instructions for compareexchange cmpxchg increment inc etc

1701340
width	height
one of the page-related options in the cms is background image and stretch page width height to background image width height. so that with large background images the whole thing becomes visible

1701370
put	get
what you probably want to do is to put a comma separated string like bak log dfd in the settings then you can split it to get it as an array

1701392
int	chars
i got store an int in a chars array

1701426
udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
for data streaming my plan is to use rtp rtsp transport over udp for desktop data the internal protocol will be vnc rfb but the transport will be rtp itself

1701426
rtp	rtsp
i have seen jmf java media foundation which seems to have support for rtp rtsp audio and video capture display but this package look very outdated

1701429
put	get
however when i scroll down the page and put the element outside of the viewport and then back in i get a broken image

1701431
superclass	subclassing
the superclass only has the methods every subclassing needs

1701436

i don t know the answer to the question yet but to get past it i took the redirectmode attribute out of my web config and put custom logic in the global.asax application_error handler to do what i wanted

1701438
aptana	radrails
but aptana has a quite good support of rails development with the radrails plugin

1701470
superclass	subclassing
alternately you can use a superclass and extend it using a subclassing that only extends the functions that subclassing needs

1701534
pow	math.h
generally math.h or a vendor-specific file included by math.h provides the prototype for pow its declaration but the implementation is buried in some library file such as libm.a

1701543
google-chrome	firefox
my primary target is ie8 but would like to support firefox and google-chrome also

1701551

these statements pull the bytes out of the array and push them back into the value

1701574
google-chrome	firefox
no not in firefox and google-chrome

1701575
textmate	aptana
i d say it s probably better than aptana or netbeans but i use textmate fulltime and haven t revisited it in a while

1701591
width	height
the following creates a 9 page pdf without having to calculate height and width

1701637
hex	binary
i had to use another object and convert the string values into hex values in order to write binary values into the registry field as below

1701676
children	parent
i have an bll that does validation on user input then inserts a parent poreo and then inserts children porboxeo

1701739
emacs	textmate
i ve been trying to use textmate as a replacement for emacs

1701756
width	height
if device s screen is not square its width and height should change

1701760
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in general i d suggest developing in ie and one of the standards-compliant browsers side-by-side firefox google-chrome safari opera

1701779
spaces	delimiter
problem is when calling sqlcmd i m assuming that s what sqlcmd resolves to from a command window the values for any and all -v parameters are spaces delimiter -- that is the parser hits -v reads the next characters through the as the variable name then reads all characters after the and through the next spaces or end of line as the value to assign to the variable and that embedded spaces will mess you up bigtime

1701837
hide	show
so as my moon example stated you either render everything out to start and show hide it with javascript

1701881
required	placeholder
each haml page or partial can then add their own required files to those placeholder

1701887
google-chrome	firefox
i think it s related to this bug about firefox textareas and its font mozilla 3.0.8 and google-chrome height in em bug workaround

1701958
post	get
all it does is read data either from an environment variable for get requests or from stdin for post requests

1701997
jar	war
however you should make a standard jar war other with ant for your project and include ivy dependencies inside that jar

1702003
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i ve tested with sharpziplib and dotnetzip to the compressed byte array

1702015
gridview	repeater
your original code doesn t work not because it s incorrect but because you probably have more places with trcomment in which case it should error or because your current code is inside a template of some sort in a gridview a repeater

1702064
aptana	rubymine
notepad++ doesn t have great autocompletion rubymine is too slow and not that great and netbeans aptana are too heavy

1702083
jython	pypy
for example app engine is still using python 2.5 apparently upgrading its specialized sandboxed python runtime and all it relies on is not a zero-effort proposition so they prefer to keep putting their energy towards adding engine features instead -- so i believe are implementations such as jython and pypy i think ironpython s in the process of migrating to 2.6 but the current production version is still 2.5

1702094
put	get
once i put something on both text boxes and press search i get a result list gridview from a ms sqlexpress 2008 database

1702131
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the button1 is inside an updatepanel and the scriptmanager is on the usercontrol

1702144
gridview	rowdatabound
my suggestion would be to add a handler to the rowdatabound event of the gridview control and change what the column displays based on the toggle value

1702180
getter	setter
c# 3.0 offers us getter and setter with compiler generated backing fields - this is really great but there are plenty of times that you still need to use a backing field

1702193
children	parent
if your parent object has 100 children you would run 101 queries which is not good

1702193
children	parent
one way to try to optimize this is to join everything using an outer join clause in the sql that way both the parent and children objects are loaded at once in a single query

1702193
children	parent
thatâ s what a join does the parent rows are repeated for each children

1702292
interbase	firebird
given the ancestry of firebird is it a fairly painless well-understood path from ibxpress interbase 6 to whatever with firebird

1702389
inherited	properties
if it s impossible to have the different classes all inherited the same interface you can get all the properties defined in an object as a collection and then their value through key lookup where the key is the name of the properties

1702399
google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly in ie8 firefox google-chrome

1702418
aptana	rubymine
works everywhere and linux rubymine aptana vi emacs netbeans

1702421
inherited	properties
you should introduce a new interace containing the common properties and let the other two interfaces inherited from your new base interface

1702426
ssl	https
i ve read that networkcredential doesn t support ssl and i m hitting an https site

1702511
jar	manifest.mf
netbeans automatically creates a manifest.mf file inside the application jar and also creates a folder called lib which includes all dependencies

1702522
width	height
the nwidth and nheight parameters must specify a width and height that are supported by the current display driver because the system cannot create cursors of other sizes

1702522
width	height
to determine the width and height supported by the display driver use the getsystemmetrics function specifying the sm_cxcursor or sm_cycursor value

1702617
udp	tcp
since the designers of boost took this into account for tcp sockets i have a hard time imagining they wouldn t do the same for udp sockets

1702630
jsf	seam
for almost a year know i developped applications in ejb3 jpa for persistence and business and seam jsf for presentation

1702630
jsf	seam
i don t need the list of possible options for gui or data access or business layers but the easiest ones when you know ejb3 jpa seam jsf etc

1702646
mouse	keyboard
i know about the getlastinputinfo method but that would only give me the duration since last user input - keyboard or mouse

1702666
jboss	weblogic
ejb is just supported by heavy application servers like jboss or weblogic the only thing that comes to my mind is to use spring hibernate without ejb and have an embedded servlet container like jetty or tomcat

1702666
jsf	seam
this way for the view you d use jsf seam

1702668
swt	swing
with you java knowledge you have three choices swing swt or javafx

1702680
hide	show
in your css try setting the div s overflow property to either auto show scrolls bars or hidden to just hide the content if it goes outside s the div

1702721
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel	qtableview	qabstractitemview	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel
one way is using qt model view classes with base at qabstractitemmodel but they need that you widget inherits qabstractitemview this is widgets like qtableview etc.

1702742
integer	unsigned
in this case we know that it s between 0 and m-1 because we re starting with an unsigned integer

1702752

one possible solution assumes chosen deserialization method allows private field serializable

1702832
postgresql	mysql
bonus points if you can tell me how to do this in postgresql or mysql

1702833
min	max
in addition i noticed that you also have a possible exceptional scenario for your full constructor when the min value is greater than the max value

1702855
min	max
i don t think you need orderby in the inner query at all - use max or min

1702860
hide	show
toggle actually calls hide show so in onready call show on the desired ul

1702869
profiling	debugging
it also works well against remote application servers you need to enable profiling agents and turn on remote debugging in the jvm but it lets you run profiling against pretty much any j2ee environment

1702877
decltype	auto
c++0x is going to introduce a type inference using the decltype and auto keywords

1702885
min	max
i would also extract the default min and max into a constant probably so that the test would look like assert.areequal defaultminimum mynumber.minvalue

1702885
min	max
i would have a test checking that an invalid min max throws an exception

1702894
jar	manifest.mf
or if it is a jar file then you need to specify it in the class-path entry of its manifest.mf file

1702897
accessor	properties
you can use regular properties mark them with the datamember attribute and make the set accessor private

1702928
letter-spacing	font-size
you can set the font-size letter-spacing etc

1702945
sdl	glew	sdl	clutter
the game uses a few libraries glew gl sdl sdl_mixer sdl_image and lua 5.1 that would clutter the distribution directory though so is it possible to make a static binary with that method

1702976
submit	submission
common causes for this are the html form fields not being contained within the form element or the submit button having a nonstandard javascript function fire instead of submission proper

1703025
post	get
by the way you are sending the parameter padid via get and post

1703128
queue	fifo
queue are typically fifo while stacks are lifo

1703141
put	get
if i leave them off i get sqlexception invalid column type but if i put around the variable i get a warning from groovy

1703153
client-side	server-side
i suggest you use a customfieldvalidator and write your own javascript validation or make use of a server-side validation scheme which should probably be done anyway as i find it to be a bit more reliable than the client-side stuff that gets automatically generated

1703158
min	max
then perform the processing for min max and average later on

1703166
min	max
print out min max sum lines.count .tostring 000.00

1703240
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

1703313
swt	swing
swing or swt aren t bad options

1703411
post	put
stack overflow only let s me post 1 hyperlink initially so i ll put the css in a comment

1703424
public	protected
the same argument for can be made for using protected properties as can be made for using public properties instead of exposing member variables directly

1703424
getter	setter
if this just leads to a proliferation of simple getter and setter then i think the damage to code readablity outweighs the benefit of being able to change the code in the future

1703427
int	chars
if the machine is little endian and you need big endian int floats you just swap the relevant chars

1703440
stateless	stateful
or stateful and stateless are handled in other layer

1703472
maven	m2e
maven and the m2e plugin handle the building side of things great

1703540

it is the contract of subclassing that when a superclass calls a method on itself if that method has been overridden it will be the subclassing method to be invoked

1703543
post	get
i ve read get file icon used by shell and the other similar post - and already use shfileinfo to get the associated icon for any given extension and that works great

uiview	subviews	uiview	uiwindow
every uiview and this the uiwindow has a property subviews which is an nsarray containing all the subviews

1703582
dreamweaver	aptana
although i regularly look around for dreamweaver replacements and i ve certainly been impressed by aptana i still tend to use dreamweaver in my development stack simply because whereas i can compensate for some of the more coding-orientated features it misses i find the wysiwyg nature of the editor invaluable

1703587
put	get
spreadsheetgear for .net will let you load an excel workbook put values in cells calculate get results as raw values or formatted text and more

1703671
expander	grid
the xaml code below works fine except i want the expander button to be between the listbox and the grid

1703722
union	distinct
actually looking at it you won t need the distinct s either as the union will do that for you too anyone any idea if it s more efficient to use distinct to pre-filter the clauses or just let the union handle all the duplication

1703730
post	get
you d then get a post array you could reference like this like this

1703759
int	boolean
update this is even stranger when you use large int values 255 as only the byte that is used for the boolean is being modified to a 1 thus changing 0x0f00 to 0x0f01 for the b.bvalue2

1703789
width	height
i m accepting any file that getimagesize accepts meaning it has a width height i m just checking that it doesn t return false although my real scope would be jpg|jpeg|png|gif|bmp|tif|tiff

1703837
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux i give the command

1703865
post	get
i ve noticed that if you make the post all call too often more than once every few minutes you ll get throttled

1703865
post	get
if you don t need to get all of your post you should try using the v1 post recent call with whatever options you may want

1703880
maven	pom.xml
i d love to have a command line tool that can implement the i need this as a dependency go get it functionality of maven possibly even using the pom.xml files of various packages

1703959
children	parent
when i drop a toolstripcontainer on a mdi parent and assing fill to a property dock it hide all the mdi children

1703978
union	distinct
if you can use all the tables in one query you can use a union to get the distinct rows

1703985
lisp	scheme
in a sense any real-world development in lisp or scheme can be considered language-oriented since you are developing the language of your application and its abstract tree as you code along

1704001
post	put
now if i missed some language please post and remember to put the link

1704015
hash	md5
you may wish to consider using another build system such as scons which does not rely solely on the timestamp but actually computes the md5 hash of source files and bases its decisions on the hash

1704068
vim	emacs
i m sure there are scripts for both vim and emacs

1704117
clang	llvm
that probably also the reason why the developers of llvm also came up with clang and started from ground-up

1704168
width	height
layout is triggered by css properties such as width or height

1704168
width	height
if you remove the width and height from the center div you ll see that it no longer contains the float because it no longer has layout

1704168
width	height
in any case this is what the html would end up looking like with the width and height removed from the center class

1704175

first of all the image support in swing is based on awt so doing it with swing does not make much sense

1709046
versioning	upgrade
oh i m using 3.5.2 and don t tell me to upgrade because i can t because of the versioning of jasper server

1709051
openmap	geotools
i looked quickly at geotools but it seemed like getting started at least a year or two ago was more complex than what we had already accomplished with openmap

1709051
worldwind	openmap
openmap requires little in horsepower versus worldwind which needs pretty decent video card

i have a clistctrl class and at the moment when a user selects one of the sub items i am displaying a ccombobox over the subitem which the user can then make a selection from

1709093

if it is then i suggest that you toss some salt in your url a second number a guid the customers email hash etc. that you could then match with the id to verify that the url is correct

1709130
int	chars
it s used a little differently than most chars pointers because the algorithm starts at the end of the buffer and moves toward the start that s because we produce the digits from the end of the int

1709137
int	double
but i am stuck going forward because pantheios requires inserters an api to convert fundamental types to string to handle for example int double float pointer etc

1709171
kde	gnome
gnome has its own place to store the proxy settings and i am sure kde or any other de has its own place too

1709177

pop-up	dialog
i don t want the dialog to always pop-up that depends upon the setting of a dropdown

1709347

from the original set collect the min and max latitude and min and max longitude

1709347
min	max
northwest corner is max latitude and min longitude

1709352
submit	submission
since you are programmatically submission the form there is no explicit user action on an individual submit button so nothing is sent

1709358
inherited	subclassing
subclassing activerecord base and have every model inherited from your subclassing achieves the same as 1 but every model in your app needs to extend an unconventional class so why go through the trouble

1709367
client-side	server-side
client-side code is not compiled and not compressed with iis default settings - pointless whitespace in client-side script is like adding pointless thread.sleep calls in server-side code

1709418
apache	nginx
i m using nginx as a reverse proxy to apache mod_wsgi and django

1709450

1709625
maven	pom.xml
if not i guess i just have to look through the pom.xml for each new maven project to figure this out

1709664
post	get
it at least sounds like that it fired for example a plain get request instead of a post request to the server and or that the server ignored the particular request because it didn t recognize the url pattern and or the request parameters

1709681
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
it has width height padding margin and border properties

1709698

1709938
lisp	smalltalk	lisp	prolog
using a language which has very few concepts that integrate cleanly smalltalk lisp prolog ruby rather than languages which are made up of every syntax hack in the world - making it impossible for mortals to understand the semantics of code like c++ and perl

1709945
min	max
my strategy is to look at all the points in my set determine the min and max and then calculate a number between 0 to 1 accordingly and use stretch fill to stretch each polyline to fill the grid cell

1709945
min	max
my desired effect would be that a point at 0 .5 would be vertically in the center of the cell but in reality the polyline gets stretched vertically to fill the entire cell depending on what the min and max y value is

1709945
min	max
if .5 is my max and .7 is my min in the polyline then .5 will be clear at the top of the cell and .7 clear at the bottom rather than .5 in the center and .7 7 10 to the bottom

1709945
width	height
the reason i m using 0 to 1 values is because i want the width and height of the grid cell to be easily changeable via a slider or something to adjust the height of the graph or dragging the window wider to adjust the width

1709955
firefox	safari
it works as intended in safari firefox etc

1710024
public	protected
if on the other hand it s a public or protected method and can be accessed by clients consuming your library you should definitely throw with a meaningful message and preferably a well-known exception type

1710070
ubuntu	linux
this is python 2.6.4 r264 75706 on linux ubuntu 9.10

1710072
spaces	delimiter
here s a hint with spaces as your only delimiter how would you tell fscanf where the city name starts and the latitude starts

1710082
post	get
a nice way to enable real-time updates to state of the app is by using comet which is essentially a geeky codename for keeping an alive long standing unterminated get post request to the server that server finishes and responds to when something happens on the server

1710127
versioning	upgrade
then when you want to upgrade to use django 1.1 you simply change the versioning number in your requirements file and re-run the setup

1710140
cpython	ironpython
in cpython they happen to be very reliable and predictable as long as cycles aren t involved ie when deletion is handled by reference counting but in other implementations jython and i believe also ironpython deletion happens when the garbage collector gets around to it which could be much later

1710157
spaces	delimiter
if you have spaces in your city name you either need to use delimiter or define the city name field to be fixed length

1710220
int	chars
chars fgets chars s int size file stream

1710256
folder	directory
add the .svn folder and any others that do not need to be copied to the output directory

1710265
fgets	strtok
i ve tried using a combinations of fgets and strtok but i m getting confused here

1710327
post	get
in general what should i do if get post parameters that should be there are instead mysteriously missing

1710350
width	height
if your window can be re-sized absolute layout is not recommended - it may be a good idea to use width 100 and height 100 and then use the minheight minwidth maxwidth etc

1710350
width	height
in your case you could set the minimum width height of the spacer between 2 components so that the page scales proportionately

1710357
children	parent
the key to this algorithm working is that the children are placed under their parent - wherever they are - in one pass

1710359
firefox	safari
the images are showing up in safari and firefox but not ie6

1710440
rsa	dsa
try to use other encryption algorithms besides rsa try dsa el-gamal elliptic curves crypto moderate

1710474
fast-forward	merge
however when pull -ing git will only merge other-branch if it can perform a fast-forward merge

1710474
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward merge is a merge in which the head of the branch you are trying to merge into is a direct descendent of the head of the branch you want to merge

1710474
fast-forward	merge
for example if you have this history tree then merging other-branch would result in a fast-forward merge

1710474
fast-forward	merge
however this would not be a fast-forward merge

1710483
folder	directory
put static files in the public folder within the app s directory

1710504
junit	unitils
using a tool like unitils to glue together hibernate dbunit and junit has worked exceedingly well for me

1710543
ssl	https
it has great ssl https packet analysis and will be a tremendous help debugging and finding the problem

1710574
try-catch	exception-handling
the unhandledexception event does not capture the exception-handling in the traditional sense like a try-catch block to the best of my knowledge it is merely an information point allowing you to perform logging and such tasks

1710652
codeigniter	kohana
but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork

1710657
rar	zip
also i wanted to know if there are any unrar libraries for air or someway to read rar archives with air kind of like how you can with fzip and zip files

1710718
rss	feed
i am looking for an open source component that can help me track a large number of rss feed 10k rss sources

1710718
rss	feed
i don t care about the programming language but it should be something with a simple api where i can add or remove rss feed and asynchronously receive notifications every time an rss is updated

1710734
spaces	delimiter
it is ok for throwaway code but that data looks suspiciously like comma separated values and the third field may even be spaces delimiter chunks of data

1710734
spaces	delimiter
and if those spaces delimiter chunks might get longer then this

1710769
post	get
you may want to get a list of comments within the context of a given user that user s commenting history for a given post all the comments on that post or maybe just all of the comments period though this is not terribly likely

1710850
udp	tcp
maybe in some cases you would prefer to connect and send udp datagrams maybe in other situatinos where performance was less of a factor you would send using tcp ip

1710856
multiplying	add
the operations are simple things add two numbers multiplying two numbers etc.

1710892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome and firefox support at least 80 000

1710919
folder	directory
this will recursively exclude all .svn directory from the various source folder

1710943
post	get
you ll need to post a code example to get more specific help if you still need it

1710959
stdout	stderr
you can use system.setout and system.seterr to redirect stdout and stderr to instances of printstream

1710977
hebrew	thai
it works for russian german but not for chinese hebrew thai

1710990
aggregate-functions	sum
for aggregate-functions sum stdev etc.. you have to pull all data into application layer and calculate or maintain aggregate entities which update on each data insert update

1710994
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and google-chrome but in firefox the element remains disabled

1711047
int	chars
sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string

1711047
dictionary	map
note that string is handled via a dictionary map to an integer

1711106
onmousedown	onmousemove
the one clever thing we do if i may say so myself is to pre-populate two sparse arrays with snapping coordinates onmousedown so that they are easy fast cheap to look up onmousemove

1711169
versioning	upgrade
for example if your server is upgrade from versioning 1.4 to 1.5 or to 1.6 it s interesting to make a dump then a load of your repositories to take full advantage of the improvements

1711179
getter	setter
a class properties are derived from the private and public getter setter methods

1711204
ienumerable	iqueryable
but you re working with iqueryable not ienumerable

1711224
uiview	subviews
personally i wouldn t use a uiscrollview - i would just subclass uiview and deal with dragging myself positioning the uiview subviews as the touch moved events occur

1711225
haskell	ocaml
i m not sure if that s true for scala but coming from ocaml haskell it seems right.

1711229
getter	setter
for example eclipse will allow you to generate the getter setter methods of your choice for your class

1711243
int	boolean
a given value of enum int boolean or string type can only be one value so it makes sense to switch on such a value

1711249
free	malloc
at least they overload malloc free to track leaks so it seems as usable point to add anything you want

1711289
screens	tablet
it turns out that on tablet pcs you have to turn off hardware acceleration for flash to go full screens

1711300
capitalize	capitalization
capitalization will be based on how you capitalize your directory name control name - but in either case should highlight appropriately

1711301
rar	zip
sharpziplib might help i m not sure if they support rar but you can compress the files in other formats i.e zip

1711307
put	get
but if you still want to avoid frames and put the contents into a div with the id externalconent you could request the stylesheets the same way you get the other contents and prefix every rule in them with #externalcontent

1711328
public	protected
regarding public or protected - in general it is more question of how you intend to control access to destructor

1711350
jquery	curvycorners	width	height
i am using the jquery curvycorners plugin i can get this working on a div tag but as most of the content is empty and the width height is 90 of the page the corners are only rounded at the top

interbase	firebird
because we re using a few different systems in a variery of versions interbase versions 4 and above firebird mysql my orm wrapper class not sure what to call it is bound to grow big

pop-up	dialog
message boxes doing away with pop-up s and dialog boxes auto-save the flow from one stage to another accuracy of data saves and a host of other things that make the user experience truly amazing

1711369
windows	wow64
to launch a system32 located 64bit app from a 32bit app at least on vista 2k8 7 doesn t work on x64 xp or 2k3 run it from the sysnative directory c windows sysnative telnet.exe alternatively disable wow64 but that is generally a bad idea

1711392
post	put
http put and delete for example should always be idempotent but http post may or may not be

1711419
firefox	safari
the strange thing is that a it is not occuring at all in firefox or safari - ok is that really so strange

1711455
getter	setter
the html 5 audio element appears to have a volume getter setter on it so you could do something like this in jquery

1711455
firefox	safari
this seems to work in safari 4 though i couldn t get it to play with firefox 3.5

1711490
int	boolean
so far i ve been returning either nothing an int or a boolean to java via the jni interface

1711532
firefox	safari
however when testing on safari and firefox the service always returns -1

1711536
serializable	deserialization
also there was framework which allowed serializable deserialization of these containers using higher layer abstractions

1711589
pull	push
then you copy your work into it and hg push and hg pull to sync between the google repository

1711590
jstl	taglib
you just use jsp servlet further the usual way the jsp as being a view template technology can just be used to write the necessary html css js in and the output can be dynamically controlled with help of taglib such as jstl and el

1711595
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
use the wcf svcutil.exe utility with the dconly switch instead of xsd.exe - this will attempt to create a class based on the wcf datacontractserializer which can handle a few things better than the standard .net xml serializer

1711605
apache	nginx
compared to other cms it sucks plenty of processing power and ram from your server and - unless you are going to have a very small site - i recommend to deploy it in conjunction with nginx rather than apache

1711605
wordpress	joomla
if your site is contrarily a small-scale one with standard functionality plus a few custom bits maybe wordpress joomla could fit your needs better not because they are less powerful but because drupal strengths would be unused in this case while wordpress joomla simpler architecture would probably represent an advantage in this scenario

1711607
chown	sudo
i hate to accept my own answer after kyle gave such a good response but i don t need the pythonpath fix to make it work now that i did sudo chown -r +r opt google_appengine google_appengine_1.2.7

1711622
pull	push
for #3 to update you local copy hg pull -u and to commit your change hg commit followed by hg push

1711632
width	height
the div content is empty but has a height and width vaule...this causes problems in ie as only the top of the div tag is cornerd the table isnt at all

1711658
internationalization	translation
translation system - this is pretty complex simply because internationalization is fricking hard to do

1711658

1711725
mouseover	mouseout
here are the mouseover and mouseout functions

1711729
multiplying	add
i think your best bet is to use rand to generate a random float between 0 and 1 and then multiplying to set the range and add to set the offset

1711734
width	height
does anyone know how to get the width and height in actionscript for a flex application running inside the flash player in the web browser

1711779

if that doesn t get you what you want need post an example of your input and your php code that s not working

1711785
oncreate	onnewintent
i did both of these things and onnewintent never fires and oncreate fires every time

1711811
uiview	calayer
the reason this is so is because uiview assumes that if a calayer s delegate is a uiview then that calayer belongs to the uiview and the uiview is part of the hierarchy

1711811
uiview	calayer
however if you create your own calayer and assign the delegate to be the uiview the uiview will end up calling itself as part of the recursion

1711917
inherited	base-class
in our homegrown mvp-framework we had a typed base-class that all pages inherited from

mp3	wav
i am working on an application that requires the ability of saving the text as mp3 and wav file

1711963
many-to-many	one-to-many
having the association table mapped though will mean that you have to create a one-to-many property from formula to the association table formulaingredient and then you have the option to include also or not it is up to you the many-to-many property to the ingredients table

1711983
rss	feed
iphone web app from dashcode rss feed template works when deployed on simulator but not on an iphone

1712126
getter	setter
there is no getter setter for arbitrary properties in javascript

1712126
getter	setter
in firefox you can use javascript 1.5+ s getter and setter to define x and y properties that square their values on assignment eg.

1712159
implements	extends
then your real class simply extends your mystream class implements the two or three remaining methods that you really need

1712175
hide	show
if you want to show hide the validation marks maybe you can have them all declared in the html next to you text boxes like this

1712175
hide	show
and show them or hide them with this jquery code

1712246
mp3	wav
i don t think there is built-in support in .net for converting to mp3 but this should be straightforward with the help of a 3rd party library utility like lame once you have the audio data as wav

1712250

post	get
however usually things get out of order in the application on the receive side if you post multiple buffers to the socket with wsarecv or socket.beginreceive or networkstream.beginread it is very easy to find yourself processing them out of order

i was wondering how can i create a piece of php code that will check a jpg gif png or any other types of images using the getimagesize

1712366
portrait	landscape

if you want to use aggregate functions min max count you need to provide mysql with information on which columns to perform the aggregation on

1712481
post	get
let s take a post service in which you want to access the db to get a post

1712497
yacc	bison
because c syntax is context-sensitive it very difficult if not impossible to parse using traditional parser-generator tools such as yacc bison whereas pascal syntax is easy to parse using the same tools

1712532
division	modulo
after performing the division you will need to store the result back to the timeval probably making use of the remainder after division or modulo x y

1712552
int	double
when you re working with plain old data types int double you can divide

1712562
rss	feed
for my software development programming class we were supposed to make a feed manager type program for rss feed

1712562
getter	setter
i mean i get why they do it maybe later on they want to validate the data in the setter or increment it in the getter

1712562
getter	setter
why are getter and setter so loved when they are unneeded

1712567
decoder	encoder
oh also it has a json encoder decoder built in based on crockford s json2.js

1712567
firefox	safari	decoder	encoder
that native json encoder decoder is already available in safari 4 firefox 3.5 and ie8

1712569
getter	setter
here s a nice long so discussion on the subject why use getter and setter

1712592
put	get
i gather that this may have something to do with the array size being a variable i don t get this message when i put an integer literal there like

1712597
getter	setter
if you don t need validation then you don t need a getter and setter you re absolutely right

tcplistener	tcpclient
how do i use a tcplistener and which portno i need to use to listen incoming tcpclient from the other end in net compact framework

just increase ram disk space split resources among servers load balance etc

1712934
hex	binary
however since the character data in there is actually just a hex representation of a 160 bit number i thought it might be better to store it as binary 20

1712946
hex	binary
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

1712957
short	base
even with the alphanumeric and case-sensitive restrictions base 36 obviously provides a much more compact representation than decimal allowing for short and arguably clean-looking ids

1712974
width	height
and it can even be auto-adjusting by trying to keep the maximum height and width roughly the same

1713041
subtract	add
including a global used-everywhere list of scripts which you can add to or subtract from on the fly

1713052

super and all subclassing superclass stuff only works with new-style classes

1713072
min	max
a table that has field name value type min max etc.

1713083
hex	binary
the biggest problem we ran into was constantly annoyingly having binary data show up in the console everytime you type select you hear a million beeps and you have to always do select hex or insert unhex which is a pain

1713083
hex	binary
lastly if you mix and match by mistake binary and hex unhex and join on this value you could match records you never intended to

1713101
min	max
edit the current scipy version started to normalize all images so that min data become black and max data become white

1713119
content-length	content-type
a traffic sniff from addons.mozilla.org upon clicking on add to firefox shows that all you need is the content-type set to application x-xpinstall and the right content-length

1713143
pull	push
try git pull to fetch and merge the changes then you should be able to push

1713152
gridview	objectdatasource
the example uses gridview and objectdatasource

1713158
pull	push
you can perform git pull resolve potential conflicts and git push the result

1713158
pull	push
alternatively you can rebase your change between x and b on top of a with git pull --rebase and push the result back

1713169
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works fine in firefox but in ie and google-chrome the masterdiv dynpagecontent disappears

1713185
getter	setter
an object in its getter and setter calls an update method that transfers all of the class s information over the socket connection to other connected clients

1713207
freebsd	opensolaris	freebsd	linux
what are some of the major pro con of freebsd vs gnu linux vs opensolaris

1713226
getter	setter
getter setter are of course good practice but they are tedious to write and even worse to read

1713226
getter	setter
how many times have we read a class with half a dozen member variables and accompanying getter setter each with the full hog param return html encoded famously useless comment like get the value of x set the value of x get the value of y set the value of y get the value of z set the value of zzzzzzzzzzzzz

1713235
free	malloc
no new not even a malloc -- because those can lead to memory leaks if a developer forgets the corresponding delete free operation

1713349
width	height
but when i resize window form elements still have initial width and height

1713384
.htaccess	httpd.conf
whenever you do have to change your rules you will have to restart your apache server if you put it in your httpd.conf as opposed to them being instantly detected in .htaccess files because it reads them all on every request

1713444
nonetype	iterable
but i believe it s typeerror nonetype object is not iterable since self.accept can return none

1713445
folder	directory
if i put correct admin username and password then i must be able to put the folder in that directory

1713484

like ragez said..it uses css and javascript to show and hide img

1713572
for-loop	loops
clearly if you have for-loop which counts from 2 to n that is n cycles meaning that if you have an input elements your loops will count from 2 to an meaning that it is on the same level az the input so it s o n

1713582
superclass	subclassing
now every time i reference the node in the subclassing and make a change i have to make the same change in the superclass or they will be out of sync

1713635
uiview	subviews
since addsubview is on the stack my guess is that something is trying to remove one of the uiview s subviews during construction

1713637
children	parent
if a parent divs children are appended to a different div and then back again i get the exception in ie only

1713681

1713825
g++	gcc
g++ is the gnu c++ compiler where c++ is the system c++ compiler in the case of ubuntu c++ is a link to g++ however in another system it could very well be a link to a non gcc compiler

jpa has its own query language called jpql hibernate supports an extended version of it called hql

1713878
mouse	keyboard
also on unix consider your tty device - it connects a keyboard and a mouse to a screen - three quite different bits of hardware

1713929
client-side	server-side
building images server-side is pretty easy - the trick is linking them to client-side requests

1713945
freebsd	linux
there are versions for mac os x windows linux and freebsd

1713945
freebsd	linux	gtk	motif
on linux and freebsd in currently lispworks 5 uses x11 motif for the gui - this will change in a future version lispworks 6 to gtk

1713999
rsa	dsa	rsa	aes
a standard way would be to use pkcs#7 as the signed envelope format rsa or dsa as the asymmetric algorithm sha-1 as the hash algorithm and aes as the symmetric algorithm

1714025
ssms	sqlcmd
ssms has correct settings by default so does sqlcmd osql etc

1714029
post	put	post	get	put	get
request type get put post delete

1714049
folder	directory
it always gets you the path of the executing dll or exe will be in bin folder for web apps then you can deduce the app directory from it

1714068
getter	setter
as an alternative you could create your own registry so that you can make it s content more explicit by defining your own getter and setter

1714110
unix	sunos
perl cpan provides unix uptime - however it is not currently compatible with sunos but may be in the future

1714185
firefox	safari
so either your clients trust you and install you firefox ie safari etc. extensions or .

1714241
udp	tcp
it s almost like p2p audio video chatting so i think that i must to stream them using a specified udp tcp port

1714247
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
runtimeexception exist so that you don t have to declare every single method to throw nullpointerexception etc

1714273
actionscript	mxml
cdata tags are useful in mxml because they to define an actionscript script block within an mxml file allowing me to combine an ecma type scripting language with and and the like and valid xml in a single file

1714273
actionscript	mxml
i suppose another option to combine mxml and actionscript would be to combine them in the way you combine html and javascript and that is to wrap the script in an xml comment tag inside the script block and the choice to use cdata instead was made by the developers of the mxml compiler

1714273
actionscript	mxml
i suppose the reasoning probably has more to do with editing as the mxml editor validates your code against a schema to check syntax and provide context help as well parsing your actionscript code for syntax and context help

1714310
codeigniter	cakephp
i believe drupal and codeigniter are also still targeting php4 perhaps cakephp also

1714317
put	get
i put up with this in the stl because well it makes sense to see algorithms apart from basic components and because of the you get used to it factor

1714349
mouse	keyboard
i m writing an application that monitors the personâ s mouse and keyboard

1714349
mouse	keyboard
if they have not used the keyboard or mouse for 1 minute it will pop up a message that says â œyou have not used the mouse or keyboard for 1 minuteâ along with an ok button

1714375
ienumerable	ienumerator
you can implement ienumerator interface and ienumerable and return false from movenext function of ienumerable interfase

1714388
mouse	keyboard
but to monitor all mouse and keyboard activity in the os you will have to hook to the api which is platform dependent and will require using the jni

1714402
ncover	testdriven.net
if you use the testdriven.net addin you will get a very good unit test runner and ncover thrown in as well

1714431
width	height
turns out if the control doesn t have width and height set explicitly it will have desiredsize of zero right after it is created

1714435
mouse	keyboard
using synergy you can control one machine with the keyboard and mouse from the other and use copy and paste

1714440
ienumerable	ienumerator
it can also be used for generic ienumerator or ienumerable use an array of the appropriate type

1714450
post	get
with the code from the other stackoverflow post you probably get away without specifying the actual methods being the event handler

1714469

1714721
width	height
and that s it that s all you have to change to make the slider have a bigger width and height

1714743
post	put
but when i put this on a custom page i m working on it seems to just be pulling out the page name i m currently on and the link to this page even though i m thinking the above function should be retrieving a post

1714757
post	get
as linked in another post demonstrates how to get the cell id and send it to google s unpublished api for resolution

1714784
width	height
but is there any api which can give system screen height and width of the system

1714805
hide	show
this extends jasperreports to hide or show columns or groups of columns in a report based on user input or other parameters.

i would connect the ads with categories with a many-to-many relation the ads with the sellers with a many-to-one and either relate the area with the ads with a many-to-many or do the same with sellers and areas depending on what sort of design you re after

1715018
children	parent
the parent movieclip will take the size of its children or what is drawn in it

1715079
pull	push
if you want hg to push pull from a git repo then consider the hg-git mercurial plugin

1715087
return-value-optimization	nrvo
your compiler might also be smart enough to apply nrvo named return-value-optimization

1715095
versioning	upgrade
now however i have upgrade to the latest versioning of the zend framework 1.9.5 i needed to upgrade for another issue and now my subdomains no longer work

1715098
button	checkbox
button checkbox etc freeze while

1715116
jar	war
you might have a convention for loading the code - for example from a special directory or from a specially formatted zip file as war files and jar files

1715177
put	get
the best guess i have is that maybe the index fell behind although i had assumed that if i get a successful return from put then the indexes are updated

1715181
awt	swing
for an awt swing application you need to use non-standard appcontext class which could change at any time

1715181
securitymanager	classloader
the plug-in process will need a securitymanager set and a classloader to both isolate the plug-in code and apply an appropriate protectiondomain to plug-in classes

1715192
serializable	deserialization
transient fields are lost at serializable but you need them only after deserialization so you have to restore them to what you need in the readobject method.

1715220
titlebar	window
icon in the window s titlebar will be

1715259
hash	md5
i m not quite sure if this is what you re asking but md5 is 128 bits 32 hex digits while sha-1 is 160 bits 40 hex digits so it s fairly easy to tell the difference between them providing of course that you know that your hash will be either md5 or sha-1 and not something else

1715259
hash	md5
if you re asking whether you can determine if a given md5 hash is a hash of a hash or a hash of some other data then i believe the answer is no .

1715277
hash	md5
md5 gives a 128-bit hash value

1715311
width	height
ps to be fair i am guessing that w and h are width and height so they are probably always positive

1715344
post	get
there are lots of places you could have gone wrong...and if you post some code you re much more likely to get a solution but some possibilities

1715405
oncreate	onnewintent
that s probably why oncreate gets invoked every time instead of onnewintent which would only be called if the activity is already existing

1715405
oncreate	onnewintent
but if you go up higher on the activity stack into other activities and from there call your artistactivity.class again it will skip oncreate and go directly to onnewintent because the activity has already been created and since you defined it as singletop android won t create a new instance of it but take the one that is already lying around

1715405
onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
same for onrestart onstart onresume onpause ondestroy

1715434
hash	md5
i am trying to input a text file that contains md5 hash and keywords one per line into a c# app

1715434
hash	md5
is there a way to check if a string is an md5 hash

1715448
post	get
since i want the user s updates to the fields and not the current database fields to be what displays on this go back action i have to pass the values around via post get params

1715456
hash	md5	hex	binary
well an md5 hash is really just binary data - if you ve got a string then it s presumably encoded in some fashion base64 or hex

1715457
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so you most likely have had issues with firefox opera google-chrome and safari you did not know about

1715461
hash	md5
a md5 hash is a 128 bit value

1715461
hash	md5
a md5 hash has no internal structure or any kind of signature that allows you detect if a 128 bit value is a md5 hash or not

1715470
installation	upgrade
allow individual installation to be upgrade without affecting other installation at all

1715485
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
im trying to programatically do a uitabbarcontroller using a uinavigationcontroller inside each uiviewcontroller called by the tabs.

1715489
hash	md5
first thing to do is examine the file to work out how the md5 hash are encoded then design a match based on that

1715496
google-chrome	firefox
even if it doesn t work in every browser though that would be ideal even just firefox google-chrome would be excellent

1715609
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
is it possible to disable the mousedown mousemove and mouseup event of each div as long as they are part of a selection

1715611
google-chrome	safari
it is a known issue that document.implementation.createdocument isn t implemented on safari google-chrome webkit so you ll likely have to resort to loading the content in an iframe and accessing the contentdocument object of the iframe

1715628
hash	salt
i think thinking of user logs in store their userid timestamp and a hash of timestamp + salt + hash of their pw in a cookie

1715628
hash	salt
then when they visit the site next check if a hash of the cookie timestamp + salt + hash of their pw is valid

1715646
profiling	debugging
i either have sql profiling listening on the database or if you re in debugging mode with vs you can move the cursor over the linq statement and it is in the tooltip

1715710
margin	height
the issue is that without the margin on the bottom the page height is shorter then the window bounds thus your footer div ends and the body of the page bleeds through

1715766
bresenham	dda
for example bresenham s line algorithm is a dda optimized to use integer arithmetic

1715769
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use may want to use an inspector tool like firebug for firefox or the one included one in safari or google-chrome

1715800

then hash random + salt + password + ip

1715850
google-chrome	firefox
this had no ill effects on firefox and fixed it in google-chrome

for this app i m experimenting with other approaches to mvc not other frameworks puremvc or mate but writing my own mvc base application

1716009
int	chars
for example if you define chars as a single letter from the users point of view it can be more than 2 bytes for example this chars aìš is two unicode code points u+0041 u+030a latin capital a + combining ring above so it will require two .net chars or 4 bytes int utf-16

1716026
width	height
we could simplify user s subscription to item details observations by tagging observation type for example height weight width would be tagged with all dimensions physical

1716029
strtol	getline
you should probably use getline to read a line no matter what and then parse it with strtol or similar instead

1716083
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 4 dev on this same machine both work as expected

1716097
int	chars	fgets	strtol	fgets	strtok	strtol	strtok
it s a better idea to just read whole lines in with fgets and then working on them with functions like strtok and strtol which btw will correctly parse int and tell you exactly where the invalid chars begin

1716117
rss	feed
what i need is a tool that can track for me a big very large number of rss or atom feed and issue events when they are updated

1716153

the only way i can think of is to use to create a temporary ram disk and mount it under say temp tmp_ram_disk so that the save-to-disk option won t be slow but sure how to do that or if it s even possible

1716227
folder	directory
is apps part of the web folder hierarchy or just a physical directory

1716250

although if you get start properly with a good book pragmatic defacto rails book 3rd edition is a good choice you will never put that one down even after so long as the references are just too useful

1716297
firefox	safari
now that works fine in firefox and safari but not in ie

1716312
channelfactory	wshttpbinding
ps i think you should be fine now - you create the wshttpbinding and it uses all the defaults as in the config and you define your endpoint address to point to the server where your service is hosted and in the channelfactory you specify the contract being used - that s all there is

1716322
stdout	fflush

lxml	libxml2
currently i have 2 varieties lxml and libxml2 that both seem to work

1716647

nsurlconnection works by default with ssl and can access https sites

1716663
memcpy	malloc
i have to malloc some space and know 3rd parameter of memcpy - size

1716710

but you would need to replace all links by forms with buttons and you need to modify the server side code so that it listens on post requests instead of get requests to take actions accordingly

1716726
maven	pom.xml
everything works fine during compile time but at runtime maven overrides the jtidy in the pom.xml with its own implementation in maven-core-2.0.7-uber.jar

1717830
quicksort	heapsort
with that proviso the short answer is that in most current standard libraries std sort is implemented as a intro-sort introspective sort which is basically a quicksort that keeps track of its recursion depth and will switch to a heapsort usually slower but guaranteed o n log n complexity if the quicksort is using too deep of recursion

however zenity does not honor the -geometry option which is supposed to be standard for all x applications and its documentation gives options for controlling window height and width but not placement

1718166
equals	tostring
as far as a solution for your particular problem you might consider creating your own methods maybe getstringrepresentation getcustomhashcode and equalsobject and have your objects extend a base class whose equals tostring and hashcode methods call these methods

1718166
equals	tostring
this is one of the reasons that some people have suggested that equals tostring and hashcode should never have been included on the object class in the first place

1718170
implements	extends
it is a bad idea to force classes that implements your existing interface to extends a specific abstract class

1719275
accessor	properties
the whole purpose of writing an accessor method is to hide the implementation of certain properties of the class from external users

1719275
accessor	properties
so in your case by making the accessor static you automatically declare and expose the fact that the corresponding properties is specific to the entire class not to a particular object of the class

1720747
subtract	add
one way to make this approach easier is to add your top fields to a separate panel that is autoheight true then after showing or hiding fields simply measure the height of that panel and subtract it from the window height plus margins padding to get your html editor height that s what i ve done in the past when i couldn t rely on a layout to manage it

1720943
folder	directory
i ve also seen other solutions on the same server of having the same web application run side-by-side and either change the root directory in iis or change the web.config to point to a different folder but the problem with this is that you have to do an entire build and deploy even if it were for a simple bug fix

nstableview	nstabview
just create a tabless nstabview with two tabs put one nstableview in the first tab and another nstableview in the second tab

1721011
springlayout	miglayout
there are plenty of more modern layout managers out there miglayout formlayout springlayout ... and for that matter you can almost always get what you want just by nesting jpanels with borderlayouts

1721072
couchdb-python	couchdbkit
prior to that i ve tried couchdb-python but some bugs maybe ironed out by now with httplib was giving me some errors duplicate documents..etc but couchdbkit got me up and going so far without any problems

1721371
hide	show
i have done some simple javascript to show and hide some div when you mouse over hot spot on a image map

1721371
mouseover	mouseout
the functions are appropriately called on the mouseover and mouseout events

1721392
int	chars
basically you can just cast your int to a chars if you want a really rudimentary solution

1721404
nunit	nmock
for .framework they should use nmock and nunit

1721434
tolower	toupper
the error does sound strange but as konamiman pointed out a little refactoring won t hurt although i don t like to use toupper or tolower

1721458
keydown	keyup
any keydown or keyup event is raised at panel level

1721472
bluetooth	usb
we were wondering if we could use a hid wrapper driver that simulates the usb identifiers and pnp in a way that the application thinks that a stick is connected and then links the bluetooth virtual comport data to the app

1721474
put	get
somehow get a shared secret password random generated string etc onto both the server and the iphone client - this must be done out of bounds and not as part of the request ie hard code it into each component or put in a config file

1721544
outputstream	inputstream
buffered readers writers inputstream outputstream read and write to the os in large chunks for optimization

1721588
width	height
maybe pass the width height of the array to the function or use a struct containing that information and resolve the 2 dimensions onto a 1-dimensional array like so

1721618
keydown	keyup
instead most of the times like if the child element is a button control will even eat up the keyup keydown events

1721635
opera	firefox
it works fine on firefox opera and webkit based browsers but as usual ie is giving me headhaches

1721646
post	get
303 â find your response here but use get even if you started out with post

1721760
hide	show
when your planeprojection rotation is greater than 90 degrees hide the front element and show the back element

1721769
mouseleave	mouseenter
my delphi knowledge is a bit rusty but shouldn t there be mouseenter mouseleave events

1721777
onchange	onblur
it s a bug in the ie6 onchange event where it doesn t fire until the checkbox loses focus specifically when the onblur event fires

1721804
lisp	scheme
i also heared about scheme and lisp compilers but i don t like this language

1721834
put	get
as long as i can t get it working since if i put in my class

1721850
udp	tcp
at the risk of just pointing you back the comments to that post explain that udp doesn t block on the tcp ack but you could still block on a kernel buffer overflow

1721858
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome but doesn t move a little in firefox why

1721868
16-bit	64bit
i believe azul s version of hotspot uses 64bit references with 48-bits for address and 16-bit type information

1721886
free	malloc
never mix malloc free with new delete

1721886
boost	stl
there are const references to avoid copy construction of objects passed to functions and stl containers and strings for the other storage requirements and use smart boost shared_ptr pointers if you really need pointers and don t want to track them by hand

1721887
nsstream	nshost
during my efforts to bring this code to the iphone i discovered that nshost isn t available in the iphone sdk and should instead be replaced with nsstream and the related networking classes

1721908
free	malloc
call the correct deallocation routine is for arrays allocated via only delete for pointers to single objects only and free ... only for memory allocated via the c api such as malloc ..

1721908
short	base
these are required for correctness in short the base class must have explicitly marked the destructor as virtual

1721929
facebook	fbconnect
im trying to integrate fbconnect to my application and want to know if the facebooker plugin is still applicable now that facebook has made some revisions to its api

1722005
put	get
do you think should i put that out of the while loop and get all the emails from an array

1722099
implements	extends
however you can implements an interface in you model by extends the doctrine-generated model and implements the interface in the subclass

1722134
typedef	struct
struct typedef unions members of unions and struct and enum values typically are in lower case in my experience rather than the c++ java c# etc convention of making the first letter a capital but i guess it s possible in c too

1722153
webrat	cucumber
webrat within cucumber is only for html and cannot do post

1722155
innodb	myisam
myisam uses table-level locking for updates and innodb uses row-level locking

1722155
innodb	myisam
so as i understand for tables with frequent concurrent updates several updates per second it is better to make them innodb and for other tables if we don t need transactions and foreign keys of course it is ok to be with myisam engine

1722180
innodb	myisam
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

1722181
rsa	dsa
i d like to know at least the certificate type x509 rsa dsa and whether it s a public or private key

1722186
innodb	myisam
i am a newcomer to mysql myself but when i installed it it explained that innodb is optimised for transactional operational systems and myisam is great for reporting dw systems

1722221
put	get
but honestly the right way to handle this would be to get rid of that singleton and to put the data in 2nd level cache and to invalidate the cache if you update the table manually

1722229
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
this could be any type of filesystems - ntfs fat etc but all it means is that you re about to be working with the files on the system

1722315
min	max
i have two field name and age and i want it to validate for required maxlength number char min max

1722375
typedef	struct
i do find camelcase useful to type names like struct typedef and enums

1722382
submit	submission
what i want to know is if i am submission my login form then my submit action

1722402
implements	extends
extends and implements are very well tested by mootools developers themselves

1722402
implements	extends
i d suggest having a good read up on what extends and implements do on the mootools docs clientcide website mootorial etc

1722463
gmail	hotmail
whilst i was testing i used a friends smtp server to test on and my socket worked fine but when i tried the same thing on a big email provider gmail hotmail etc it had none of it

1722512
wan	lan
i read somewhere that you should use the address of your lan wan interface but i don t how to obtain that address

1722518
typedef	struct
struct names and typedef s in camelcase gtkwidget trackingorder

1722538
converter	multibinding
its purpose is to implement converter that support multiple bindings multibinding objects so you can bind to more than one task

1722543
accessor	properties
for a non-real-world example consider a precompiler that generated accessor to the named capture groups of a regex via similarly named c# properties or methods

1722593
firefox	safari
this will fire a click event in safari but not firefox or the version of ie i tested

1722607
getter	setter
respectively each entity class also has this fields and getter setter pairs

1722649
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
but there are lot of ready-to-use jsf component libaries with an ajaxical sauce for example richfaces icefaces primefaces etc

1722682
inherited	properties
since user controls inherited from system.web.ui.webcontrol they have a page and parent properties

1722707
hex	binary	integer	unsigned
generally it makes sense to use hex when the number being represented is more of a technical computer or hardware limitation parameter as these types of values are often based on base-2 constructs because the internal limitation is tied to the number of potential values that can be represented by some binary number a value that muist be stored in an 8 bit byte or in a 16 bit unsigned integer for example

1722720
cvs	svn
i ve been working with cvs and svn in teams of different sizes and ime there are very few cases when merging becomes a real problem

1722768
client-side	server-side
they have a server-side and client-side api progress bars client-side validation and is ajax enabled

1722772
range	max	range	min	min	max
it will function as an required validator a min max validator and a range validator for date comparisons on the client side

1722774
folder	directory
the page i m trying to load is in the same directory as the page i m calling it from and both are in a folder one level deep from my web root on my remote server

1722855
jlist	jtree
jlist has a jtree

1722858
versioning	upgrade
to enable the dollar safe mode upgrade your versioning of mootools and make sure you include mootools after prototype

1722882
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
do you perhaps have controls in your gridview such as dropdownlistfor checkbox etc..

1722882
updatepanel	scriptmanager
a simple not the most efficient way to do this will be to add a scriptmanager control to your page to enable ajax controls in it then add an updatepanel control and move your gridview inside this updatepanel

1722887
for-loop	arrays
another answer for the first question is to use one for-loop and perform linear indexing into the arrays using the function numel to get the total number of elements

1722897
client-side	server-side
even if you could work out these client-side problems as far as i know any generic web server is going to wait until it s received the entire post ed file upload before passing it on to the server-side web app so there s no opportunity for a server-side component to update status as it receives each chunk

1722898
ant	maven
maven does allow you to use ant tasks using the antrun plugin

1722910
bottle	turbogears
i strongly recommend turbogears or bottle

1722953
primes	modulus
your modulus must be primes

1722958
division	modulo
edit ok now i see what could go wrong with trying to do a division by 2 in a non-prime modulo as it is similar to a division by 0

1722973
onclick	onchange
i had the same problem but with ff i managed to deal with it using the onchange event rather than the onclick

1723078
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari have long standing bugs in their issue trackers about this if anyone feels strongly enough to vote on them

1723105
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve tried to call the imagepicker from the viewdidload viewwillappear or awakefromnib nothing changes

1723106
sorting	filtering
i created my own collection inheriting from bindinglist which supports sorting filtering etc

1723106
sorting	filtering
i found this codeproject article with an implementation of ibindinglist which supports sorting filtering etc

1723114
sorting	filtering
is a good option but note that it doesn t support sorting or filtering out of the box

1723114
sorting	filtering
datatable is probably your best option if you need sorting and or filtering capability

1723146
mouse	keyboard
my solution to this was using cordinates and simulate keys klicks im using global mouse and keyboard library for this found at this location

1723152
implements	extends
although a bindinglist does not support sorting out of the box you can extends it by creating your own list that derives from bindinlist and implements your own sorting

1723156
width	height
these methods get and set the height or width of the elements

1723223
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
there is a lot of confusion on this topic but to answer the ops question yes logical evaluation is the same in vb.net as it is in vb6 as it is in vba

1723226
getter	setter
class definition is much less verbose without the getter setter boilerplate

1723230
qgraphicsview	qpainter
i ve tried with modifying the osciloscope example of qwt tried to use qgraphicsview and qpainter to reach high framerate drawing

1723242
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if you have a sqlconnection opened and attach a sqldatareader to it and then try to run another query using the same sqlconnection then it will throw an error

1723302
accessor	properties
in order to access the members of another class you need to create accessor methods to these properties

1723326
photoshop	fireworks
you could merge them together using photoshop or fireworks

1723340
setinterval	settimeout
avoid eval and avoid passing a string in to settimeout and setinterval

1723341
hide	show
if not is there a plugin that hide selects when a modal dialog is show

1723352
width	height
if you want two backgrounds then you need two block content elements of full width and height

1723381
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so inside the uitabbarcontroller i ve added about 10 sub uiviewcontroller objects as tabs

1723405
allocator	stl
i think you ll find the available allocator implementations are under include stlport stl in your installation

1723429
packets	multicast
i know how to set the ttl on the sending multicast socket but i want to know the remaining ttl of the arriving packets

1723458
config	ini
however it looks like you are parsing an ini style config file

1723472
aggregate-functions	sum
also as bill karwin mentions nulls behave specially in aggregate-functions count sum avg etc. calculating avg temperature on the above data would give you -14.5 as the null row is ignored

1723548
rss	feed
this is probably a more complicated approach than you re interested in but since the start page can show rss feed you could write a web app that would query vss via the com interface list your checkouts and publish that as a feed

1723548
rss	feed
if you re not looking to roll your own i did a quick search and came across vssrsssvc an application that generates rss feed from a vss database

1723551
post	get
i don t currently have access to an open wifi network with which to test further but i ll update this post if i get a chance

1723565
instances	transient
so all this does is confirm that transient scope is being used and that the controller factory is returning a different instances of the same controller when requested

1723566
inherited	properties
a blank newly instantiated smxfr object has the extended properties in place but all of its inherited properties and objects return error error #2037 functions called in incorrect sequence or earlier call was unsuccessful

1723566
inherited	properties
i get living handle properties from that and all other that is inherited properties throw error #2037

1723609
versioning	upgrade
the file versioning is also important for windows installer when you upgrade an existing versioning over a previous one

1723660
awt	swing
i think swing awt cannot do this without a guest program specific jni

1723673
post	get
post the code where you use the smxfr class and get the said error

1723785
cassini	iis
since you are running iis 5.1 you may need to use the visual studio development server aka cassini to host your visual studio project

1723830
children	parent
you can make your objects all expose the same method call it attemptsave and calling this method on the parent object will result in it calling in cascade those methods of all children

1723831
inherited	properties
the main difference is that the value of a normal .net properties is read directly from a private member in your class whereas the value of a dependencyproperty is resolved dynamically when calling the getvalue method that is inherited from dependencyobject

1723838
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 2 safari 4 firefox 3 opera 10 ie6 ie7 mdash

1723843
width	height
select the plot area of the chart and then manually set the height and width of the plot area

1723843
min	max
just setting the axis min and max values will still allow the chart to be squished

1723859
inherited	properties
dependency properties provide properties value inherited

1723860
superclass	subclassing
if it doesn t make sense for this to return a value in the superclass then you can make the superclass abstract which means you cannot construct an instance of it directly you can only construct one of its subclassing and declare the method abstract in karakter too

1723872
portrait	landscape
it does not matter if the picture is landscape or portrait the function knows exactly what to do

1723872
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome works same as safari

1723888
aptana	rubymine
if you need an ide i personally recommend rubymine although aptana is a worthy offering as well and free

1723901
imperative	declarative
i would recommend you though to always use linq instead of writing for or foreach loops because in the future it will become so intelligent that it will actually be capable of distributing the work over processors and take into account hardware specific things see plinq and it will eventually be faster than if you wrote the loops yourself declarative vs imperative programing

1723918
getter	setter
the more code means constructor copy constructor assignment operator and destructor which is a fair amount and of course the getter and setter

1723947
rss	feed
the string to be scrolled is created using an array of characters and their sizes using dx measure string created from the source string rss feed and stored in an array

1723947
rss	feed
the rss feed in this case was about 500 characters long

1723947
rss	feed
the memory seems to crawls up as each character is added subtracted and once the entire rss feed string has been scrolled the memory usage stays static - at 200m - from then on in

1723954
cvs	svn
if two more people edit a form at the same time conflicts can arise in svn cvs that are nearly impossible to reconcile

1723975
move	drag
so for example if i clicked on the drag handle div and then move my mouse upwards out of the div as the div only move left and right it then doesn t catch the onup or onmove events

1723978
width	height
in general how does one set a control to take up the entire height and width of its container

1723987
versioning	upgrade
as for vss- tfs - microsoft supports an upgrade path which should keep your versioning history but if you don t need it the history i would just get the latest versioning from vss check it into tfs and archive the vss repository

1723989
qlistwidget	qtreewidget
i ve created a child class of qtreewidget that i want to be able to drag items from another tree widget too i want to handle the insertion myself though as well as from a qlistwidget

1724025
int	double
some are string s some are int s and some are double s

1724027
width	height
if you set the width and height using the star notation it will occupy as much space that is left in the container

1724027
width	height
setting the height and width to auto will make the control use as much space as is needed to display the contents of what is in the control

1724057
public	protected
do not use across assemblies public or protected if value might change in future because the value will be hardcoded at compile-time in those other assemblies

1724079
inherited	properties
one option for doing this is making all of your pages inherited from a base class that contains a relativeurl properties that can be overridden for individual pages

1724146
inherited	subclassing
i am using fluent nhibernate with table per subclassing inherited mapping

1724205
int	chars
in the case of int longs chars this makes sense

1724242
int	chars	int	double
the general precedence order from highest to lowest is chars int of any sign or number of bits single double and logical

1724249
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it on my computer with firefox 3.5.5 safari 4.0.3 google-chrome and opera 10.1

1724253
mockups	balsamiq
i also checked out how to design a user interface for the app via using balsamiq s mockups and submitted some ideas to my potential user base my peers on my team to have them give feedback

1724254
int	boolean
language specs define bitwise operators only when both operands are of primitive int types or both are of boolean type

1724262
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller whose tabs are uinavigationcontroller

1724262
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
this seems to work great when i only pushviewcontroller one level but fails when i drill down multiple levels in my navigationcontroller

1724329
mvp	presenter
see also model view controller mvc for web development and model view presenter mvp or model view viewmodel mvvm for desktop development

1724351
debian	linux
edit 1 this is on a debian lenny linux system in case it makes any difference

1724364
hide	show
all that said it looks like you are wanting to show hide divs

1724368
children	parent
normally when you load things with nhibernate the parent get loaded first and the list of known entities in the session will have the parent before the children

1724368
children	parent
if you don t have the parent in the list before the children the auto-dirty-check code doesn t work because it goes sequentially through the list of known entities mark child entities as dirty as it goes

1724368
children	parent
the moral of the story is this if you disable the auto-dirty-check behavior and you do custom loading of entities make sure that you load the parent up before the children

1724380
versioning	upgrade
the downside is that when they went along and discontinued the free versioning i was in the position to either pay for an upgrade or stick with what i have

1724412
cvs	rcs
the usual way to get revision history on a file is not to examine the repository-wide history file but rather it is to run the cvs log command which will extract the rcs revision information for a given file or subtree

1724433
vb.net	vb6	fortran	ada
language aware and handles many languages c c++ c# java objectivec php vb.net vb6 ada fortran cobol ...

1724460
post	get
i have accomplished this for the select boxes of the from using session variables however i can not figure out how to get the actual path of the file upload input to post

1724477
srp	principles
separation of concern vs single responsibility principles soc vs srp

1724477
srp	principles
single responsibility principles srp â every object should have a single responsibility and that all its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility

1724485
int	chars	ord	chr
chr and ord convert chars from and to int respectively

1724489
srp	principles
single responsibility principles srp -

1724492
subtract	add
it doesn t add or subtract to what clients can pass to your function

1724515
int	double
the types will all be simply values of strings int double and dates

1724574
getter	setter
my suggestion is to use one of the already existing orm implementations which already supplies facilities for getter and setter methods of related models

1724574
getter	setter
in the other case you have to write specialized getter and setter by yourself for every model

1724581
post	get
the only way to get rid of the post part of the url is with named routes but those require some duplication to make restful

1724604
onclick	onfocus
i have definitely tried onclick and onfocus to no avail

1724630
compare-and-swap	lockless
however i notice that there are papers at the end that can do the true lockless queue ing using a double compare-and-swap dcas operation

1724666
memcached	apc
most people seem to be using apc for the bytecode cache and putting their sessions in memcached

1724709
ubuntu	opensuse
edit 1 should i install opensuse since it is novell and they are behind mono instead of ubuntu

1724724
folder	directory
and even then you still need to parse the html page which represents the directory index and parse all elements representing the files and folder yourself

1724748
post	get
i want to get a lookup table that will give me all the post related to a given tag so i use the following code

1724756
spaces	delimiter
string begins with item1 and spaces following it until 10 spaces are taken up followed by a delimiter | and string 2

1724774
getter	setter
given this scenario where you have transfer objects pojo s with just getter setter which are passed by a client library to your api what is the best way to name the transfer objects

1724793
width	height
i would recommend adding two hbox s both 100 height and 50 width each and align them separate

1724807
equals	tostring
traversableforwarder -- forwards most methods to underlying except tostring hashcode equals stringprefix newbuilder view and all calls creating a new iterable object of the same kind

1724838
udp	tcp
this exposes less functionality because you can only control three things through ipsec for the adapters tcp ports udp ports ip protocols

1724863
portrait	landscape
im using a uiwebview to access a website when i rotate the phone landscape the uiwebview is properly resized and the scrollbar are on the right place on the right edge... but when i acess any of input fields to fill the information required and exit it the uiwebview scrollbar jumps to the middle of screen looks like it get back to 320 the width of the screen on portrait

1724870
queue	fifo
in contrast to a queue fifo a stack means you can handle the most recent data first while leaving old data last

1724981
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
use getelementbyid getelementsbytagname to locate your hidden input and assign it the value

1724985
multiplying	multiplication
but remember if you use matrix class becomes matrix multiplication and you need to use multiplying for elementwise

1725019
folder	directory	vmware	virtualbox
the source directory is a shared folder between windows and linux a virtualbox feature but i m sure vmware has the same thing

1725094
nsoperation	nsmanagedobject
since nsmanagedobject is not thread-safe i m sending in the nsmanagedobjectid from threada main thread to threadb via an nsoperation derived class

1725149

here is my code which reads out and parses the rss feed data

1725162
jquery	simplemodal
.modal.close function of simplemodal jquery plugin gets called when closing modal window

1725189
inherited	properties
you could create a custom class like scorecardformviewmodel and include the items you need as properties and have your view inherited scorecardformviewmodel

1725214
width	height
if set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height

1725280
button	checkbox
it might be better ui to use a toggle button to check all uncheck all instead of a checkbox for all

1725280
button	checkbox
so 1 button + 4 checkbox instead of 5 checkbox

stdout	stderr
the code in question is normally very simple on windows unixy systems - typically does a bit of library initialisation opens stdin stdout stderr sets timezone etc sets up the environment processes the command line for passing to main

post	get
how can one get the full http rest request body for a post request using jersey

1725331
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you generate a client proxy from the wsdl using either svcutil.exe or add service reference in vs or wsdl.exe and invoke the method

subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
is there a library available in javascript to handle large numbers with accuracy sort of like what oracle does by storing the number as a string and allows for operations like add subtract multiplying divide mod etc

1725348
inherited	properties
onsubmit is a method id is a properties form is a node with a node type of 1 which means it s an htmlelement and inherited generic html properties

1725354
kde	gnome
read platform settings supports windows kde gnome

1725422
hide	show
it s expected that navigating to a new tab will hide the controls from the previous tab and show the ones from the new tab -- but then again tabs are a navigational paradigm

1725457
ubuntu	linux
we observed this rapid cpu spikes only on ubuntu linux where as windows it runs without on itch

1725464
subtract	add
i have the following dynamic sql statement where i want to add startrowindex + maximumrows and subtract 1 from it

1725484
children	parent
if a next h3 comes or page end you create a div and add it after the starting h3 all collected elements should be removed from their parent the html and added as children of the div

1725488
inherited	properties
one thing about objects is that they can inherited properties from a parent class of object

1725488
inherited	properties
so since element defines the name properties and textfield and checkbox and all their friends inherited from element they all automatically have this name properties available too

1725498
boost	stl
stl boost cover all the low level stuff

1725579
children	parent
but that seems to require that the parent pom.xml info is declared in the children

1725601
qtabwidget	qtabbar
the only methods pertaining to the qtabbar that i see in qtabwidget are protected and i don t see a need to inherit from the class other than for this express purpose

1725601
qtabwidget	qtabbar
other than this the only thing i can think of is to subclass qtabwidget and then i can control the size of the qtabbar by extending or overriding features of this class

1725616
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
as it is if your report contains any sorting grouping or filtering at all it is forced to parse the entire file before it can show the first page which i suspect is the main cause of the huge delay

1725629
opera	google-chrome
working correctly in ff3 opera google-chrome and even ie8

1725640
width	height
so here is my question does anyone know how to dynamically pass a height variable to swfobject when it is set up to width height 100

1725646
memcached	apc
a few options if memcached apc is too much or not possible

1725708
squash	merge
i wanted to have a simple solution to squash two merge commits together during an interactive rebase

1725708
squash	branch	squash	merge
i don t just want to rebase the my-feature branch since it is a published branch of its own i just want to squash together the last two merge commits into one haven t published those commits yet

1725722
printf	fgets
now try the same with wide characters and replace printf with wprintf fgets with fgetws etc .

1725735
decimal	ieee
there is also a new decimal type in some implementations based on a new definition from ieee 754r mdash

1725760
rss	feed
contact the author of the rss feed and tell him to fix it either by removing the cdata tags so the entities get interpreted or by putting the intended characters directly into the html file

1725766
adplus	cdb
in the past i ve set up a zip file that contained some of the contents of the debugging tools for windows like cdb and adplus which can be installed just by unzipping it on a users machine

1725776
width	height
you can assign the box a fixed width and height and then give it s margin-top and margin-left properties the negative half of the height and width

1725782
width	height
so if you set margin-top and margin-left to negative of one-half the height and width respectively you ll get a centered box

1725785
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have my mainwindow with a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

1725804
put	get
another way that i have seen is to get the max from the table and increment it and put it into the new row

1725832
post	get
the problem is applying the style pre render is pointless the javascript is building the table post render is all i could get to work

1725892
sharepoint	spsite
i m trying to get an spsite for a remote sharepoint url

1725895
vb6	vba
the following is the existing vba method accessing the vb6 app

1725897
google-chrome	firefox
here s an example that works in firefox and google-chrome

1725897
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval and clearinterval are standard js functions

1725935
int	chars
from portability viewpoint chars cannot be smaller than 8 bits and nothing can be smaller than chars so if a given c implementation has an unsigned 8-bit int type it s going to be chars

1725970
jdom	dom4j
while i agree with and want to second the other two at the moment answers that proposed using a standard tool such as dom4j or jdom i d like to posit an off-the-wall suggestion

1725999
versioning	upgrade
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached

1726021
accessor	properties
the val accessor works like the value properties except that it s extended to work nicely even with input fields like selects and checkboxes

1726023
webkit	gecko
viewing it in either gecko webkit or presto an unintentional vertical space occurs after the object before the second div see

1726031
pull	push
the amount of overhead needed to use dynamic data structures extra memory use extra instructions needed to pull and push the data from sram keep track of which dynamic variable resides where moving memory blocks around when variables in between get deleted.... just doesn t justify the merits

1726042
binutils	mpc
according the the gcc build instructions you can build binutils concurrently with building gcc as well as gmp mpc etc

1726042
binutils	bfd
alongside the compiler bfd binutils

1726042
mpfr	mpc
likewise the gmp mpfr and mpc

1726042
mpfr	mpc
mpfr and or mpc source distributions

1726042
mpfr	mpc
to gmp mpfr and mpc respectively or

1726042
binutils	mpc	mpfr	mpc
this works fine for gmp mpc mpfr but i can t seem to get it to build all of binutils

1726046
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu at least seems to have much better support here using utf-8 and providing a font with broad grapheme support

1726057
width	height
as you are responsible for painting the entire form it is probably simplest to define your own content rectangle that is positioned say 10 pixels in from the top left of the form and has a width height 20 pixels less then the form width height

1726090
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i found this one the other day which doesn t seem bad but it doesn t work in google-chrome works in firefox and opera but i didn t get chance to check out ie

1726122
bmp	png	bmp	tga	png	tga
i used this image because i ve found it in various file formats tga tif jpg png bmp

1726218
tlistview	tdbgrid
tlistview is not a data-aware component and there isn t afaik a vcl tdblistview - if you need a grid of data you can either bind to a tdbgrid or use a 3rd part tdblistview which you can find with a quick google

1726307
punctuation	words
note that this array will hold bytes of data not necessarily characters letter numbers and punctuation marks as we typically understand the words character

1726312
mapquest	directions
part of what i want to offer subscribers to my application is a map showing the location of their customer with the option to get directions the idea is that they can just easily get the directions from one place instead of copying pasting and going to google maps or mapquest or whichever

1726320
width	height
if you omit the height and width on an image then it can be a little unpredictable

1726331
hide	show
i ve found great workaround for this - hide table before populating and then show it when done

1726346
pop-up	dialog	uilabel	uibutton
i d like to pop-up a dialog on top of the view controller at some point and i d like to design that view in interface builder because it s fairly straightforward background uiimageview some uilabel and a uibutton

1726360
fadein	fadeout
if your request is to have a text fadein effect you just have to apply the fadeout to the black layer over it and vice-versa

1726377
boost	blitz++	boost	eigen	eigen	blitz++
but it d be a tragedy if the c++ world revolved around that one library and boost and poco and wxwidgets and clutter and blitz++ and eigen and and 101 other wonderful things yes gtkmm and ace even were stifled at birth because the gatekeepers of the standard library didn t see fit to admit them

1726393
free	malloc
i wouldn t be so worried about the quantity but the frequency of memory which you leak but if you leak even just a few bytes very very often your malloc s data structures will grow and might make it dramatically slower to traverse them to allocate new memory and free

1726393
freebsd	linux
does not apply to even remotely dlmalloc-based systems freebsd linux etc there it s just don t care all you loose there is memory perhaps a few times more than the amount you think and not performance

1726421
subtract	add
i want to manage a google reader folder of feeds that i can add and subtract feeds to programatically

1726422
client-side	server-side
it s not client-side code but you mentioned php so maybe server-side code is an option

1726428
pop-up	dialog
however the great little tool reflector is able to go further and actually display the contained types and handles gracefully the missing reference issue by giving me a pop-up dialog to browse for it

1726521
post	get
do any actions require a post or are you taking action with a get

1726531
children	parent
the parent pom and its version does have to be declared in the children

1726531
maven	pom.xml
set up a public maven repository deploy the parent pom.xml to it and put the repository information in the child poms

1726531
maven	pom.xml
you can tell maven to look for the parent pom.xml on a relative path before it checks repositories this is to help you when you have local changes to the parent pom.xml not yet deployed

1726546
avr	microcontroller
in particular avr microcontroller like the atmega series

1726561
spaces	delimiter
the exec method that accepts a string uses the spaces character as a delimiter to break up the string into commands

1726571
pull	push
sorry for the vague answer but here goes you need to push chat text out to every connection for a given user id not just responde to a pull from a given connection session

1726585
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are known to be slow on localhost when ip6 is enabled

1726592
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
abstract superclass - subclassing inherited the behavior of the parent but the parent cannot be used to reference a subclassing you want to store in the database

1726592
superclass	subclassing
superclass with tableperheirarchy false - subclassing store the parent s fields in the parent s table polymorphism works as expected

1726592
superclass	subclassing
empty superclass with tableperheirarchy false - subclassing store all of their own data in their table polymorphism works as expected

1726641
hide	show
jquery i have two divs that i m toggling back and forth show and hide between on my page using a link to each

1726670
nsurl	nsdata
how can i convert data of the type nsdata to nsurl for use in vdo

1726715
hide	show
as a bonus it won t show both content while loading and hide one when the loading is done

1726720
pop-up	dialog
this is currently implemented via four separate links that upon clicking display a pop-up dialog for the user to enter in their information for the corresponding server they selected

1726728
rsa	dsa
the x509 standard defines certificates and rsa and dsa are two of the public key algorithms that can be used in those certificates

1726728
rsa	dsa
all you don t know is whether those certificate private key are rsa or dsa

1726728
rsa	dsa
the text output of the openssl x509 command should include a subject public key section which will include fields that let you see if it s an rsa or dsa key along with the key size

1726742
width	height
and unlike inline elements a included among these block elements can be assigned a width and height

1726749
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient does not allow you to set the timeout and the default for httpwebrequest what webclient uses is 100 seconds

1726749
webclient	webrequest
update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest

1726770
hash	md5
i d like to implement a system that generates unique nxn blocks when given a md5 hash as an input currently i m splitting the md5 into sub-strings and just using them as hex colour-codes does anyone have any good ideas on systems i could use to generate these images

1726777
integer	unsigned
you can remove the ambiguity by explicitly casting the integer indices to be unsigned so that no conversion is needed

1726783
width	height
one solution is to use the css style display inline-block - the link will then work much like an image - flow inline with text but also allow you to set a width height

1726787
put	get
if you were planning to put some bounds-checking in then i d say replace the conversion operators with getpointer functions since in general you don t want to implicitly convert a safe thing to an unsafe thing or do what std vector does which is that users get a pointer with

1726791
integer	unsigned
convert the operator to use int rather than unsigned int then you will get exact matches when integer literals or you can have two sets of operator

1726812
firefox	safari
again i have other pages using the same techniques that seem to be working fine unde msie and of course i see no problems in either firefox or safari whereever i ve tried it

1726815
post	get
i added c windows system32 inetsrv fcgiext.dll ext .php get head post

1726827
floating-point	integer
despite the fact that my go port used floating-point math versus integer math the results are impressive

1726860
google-chrome	firefox
also other browsers firefox google-chrome never quit asking for the password and show the errordocument

1726936
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
if you take a look at the pack manual pack is used to convert a string in hex octal binary to his number representation

1727027
free	strdup
please note you have to free all strdup strings after or you are going to create a memory leak

1727089
vb6	vba
learn vb6 or vba if you have a special need like programming microsoft access or creating vb scripts

1727091
maven	pom.xml
i m looking for a tool that given a maven pom.xml file tells me all the licenses that are used by the dependencies and recursively their dependencies

1727102
post	get
this post was a mouthful but i had to get it off my chest

1727128
post	get
just compare value sent by post or get with an array

1727131
switching	screens
i have a solution for 50 of the problem namely i have written the following applescript code to switching the location of the dock based upon my screens resolution but i have to manually invoke it

1727185
zlib	libpng
zlib libpng license

1727198
quicksort	mergesort
and yet most people use quicksort instead of mergesort

1727244
disk	ram
as to whether it s faster or not the answer will depend upon a number of factors including the size of the file the disk drive speed and the amount of ram available

1727265
ant	maven
if you prefer you can edit property files in unicode and run native2ascii automatically as part of your build process in ant maven etc

1727299
mouse	keyboard
i find that i don t generally want to use the mouse in vim though as it takes my hands off the keyboard

1727368
int	chars
if you replace chars by int it saves one chars and still works but it s of questionable legality

1727383
width	height
if you don t want to subclass stuff you can use qt stylesheets to quickly set the height and width of your tabs like so

1727383
qtabwidget	qtabbar
note that the stylesheet refers to qtabbar even though we re calling setstylesheet on qtabwidget

1727441
uiview	subviews
you could try adding the uiwebview as a subviews of the main uiview in the controller

1727452
firefox	safari
disclaimer my experience with manifests and cache is all safari and firefox may handle some things differently

1727492
prng	random
let s see how you get your results random.getlong is called twice and then you remove some of the bits random bits the prng created

1727499
prng	random
from what i can tell the random class offers a prng with a cycle length of

1727542
jlist	jtree
that means giving jpanele its own jlist and jtree and so on

1727572
folder	directory
i am using windows i could just copy the folder to the gems directory but how do i initialize it

1727586
int	chars
in jpa 1.x it can be either a string this is the default a chars and an int

1727586
int	chars
if you d set the discriminator type to int or chars then you could write for the values 1 2 3 or a b c etc

1727592
gridview	repeater
now i need to get the imagepath from that the datatable serverpath and bind it in a repeater or gridview control and show the thumbnail images there

1727596
mktime	strftime
you can tie together mktime and strftime to do that

1727612
width	height
i know my width will be 180px but how can i get the height

1727664
for-loop	loops
is there a for-loop or for each loops in scheme

1727670
hash	md5
i know of the md5 hash header that can be added

1727690
hash	md5
i m almost certain the answer is no but if you want to be extra paranoid you can precalculate the md5 hash before uploading compare that to the md5 hash you get after upload then when downloading calculate the md5 hash of the downloaded data and compare it to your stored hash

1727725
implements	extends
basically i don t see any benefit in using public class newfunctionality t extends oldfunctionality extends t in comparison with public class newfunctionality extends oldfunctionality public class filterbytype t extends list extends t vs public class filterbytype t implements list t

1727733
firefox	safari
currently there is an underline in firefox but not safari haven t looked at ie and the area bellow the img receives the background color on hover

1727734
gif	png	tiff	png
how can i check to see if the image is a png gif tiff and jpg and if so create the thumbnail and save it to the thumb file

1727748
punctuation	words
basic words splitting uses whitespace and punctuation .

1727748
punctuation	words
make sure you skip sequences of punctuation whitespace instead of counting extra words between them

1727782
pop-up	dialog
i ended up setting the iframe.src property to about blank initially and only set the source when the dialog actually pop-up

1727794
setinterval	settimeout
you can do this using settimeout or setinterval

1727796
implements	extends
assuming you know beforehand what the variable portion of the query is going to be you could use the template method pattern extends the plsqltemplate class and implements a set of abstract variable provider methods to return the specifics of the query

1727821
freemarker	velocity
you can use template engine like freemarker or velocity

1727831
hash	md5
what is the probability that the first 4 bytes or first n bytes of a md5 hash computed from the byte sequence will be the same for distinct files

1727831
hash	md5
in case this can not be computed specifically for md5 hash then what is the probability that any hash function that generates uniformly distributed m-byte hash will compute hash with collision on first n bytes for given range of inputs

1727854
servicebus	was
i was reading up on activemq which seems like a great implementation of a servicebus where producers can post messages and other processes can receive them

1727859
gdi	directwrite	gdi	direct2d	directwrite	direct2d
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space

1727863
textmate	gedit
i d also give a gentle nudge into trying a text editor instead a full blown ide - i like textmate on os x and gedit on linux

1727868
hash	md5
md5 hash algorithm is designed so that a small change in the input results in a completely different hash so i would say that md5 hash bytes are distributed with equal probability i would not bet anything on it anyway

1727868
hash	md5
anyway you can apply a post-processing to your hash for example you can use keyed md5 to increase its randomness and to make it more secure by the way since plain md5 hash have been proved to be insecure

1727871
hash	md5
md5 hash are typically hexadecimals so there are 16 possible values for each byte

1727882
post	put
set the method to post and put your file contents into the body

1727918
dictionary	map
it s simpler than using a dictionary and conceptually cleaner as well as you don t really want to map keys to values

1727963
hash	md5
md5 isn t an ideal hash function as we know but the weaknesses are somewhat incidental here finding a collision on 4 bytes is well within the realm of a reasonable brute-force attack so there s no need to resort to cryptographic weaknesses

1727991
opera	safari
safari and opera don t like it

1728006
inherited	properties
the interest of the parent concept in maven 2 is to inherited properties dependencies configuration

1728011
put	get
to put it a different way implicit in the concept of callback is that you re going to seem to be called back in-the-same-thread how does this happen how does it get synchronized

1728065
put	get
i would get all the results put them in an array of ids and values

1728147
vsto	add-in
i am developing the add-in for the outlook 2007 using vsto

1728148
datalist	repeater
if you don t especially need a repeater to do this you can use a datalist instead and set the

1728171
inherited	properties
you need to inherited from form and override a couple of properties

1728229
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if file extension is .html then you should rename it to .php or add addhandler x-httpd-php html definition to httpd.conf or .htaccess

1728230
post	get
you will get one result in the post which will contain the selected value

1728231
vsto	add-in
we have a situation where we will have two vsto outlook add-in which both start off with some common shared code but the shared code will probably diverge over time

1728236
hibernate	gilead
if you want to go the hibernate way you should have a look at gilead or its predecessor hibernate4gwt

1728254
put	get
use regular expressions to get the name values from the json string and put them in the html

1728288
extjs	mootools
can anyone recommend me nice tooltip script which is javascript library independent meaning no help code from any of libraries such as jquery prototype scriptalicious mootools extjs etc.

1728297
mouse	keyboard
cover both onfocus and onmouseover - in cases of keyboard and mouse usage

1728307
memcpy	malloc
so i cannot malloc specified number of bytes and do memcpy

1728330
ubuntu	linux
my target is linux ubuntu so platform specific answers are ok

1728338
hide	show
you may or may not wish to show hide the systray icon on minimise restore but i wouldn t recommend that because it would be weird behaviour unless you re also hiding from the taskbar

1728352
onmousedown	onmouseup
4 if the xy onmousedown xy onmouseup then assume a click event - so zoom

1728369
firefox	safari
when i drag a file from the desktop to the browser and i keep the browser in focus safari or firefox for now i know everything works right dragging having the app respond etc.

1728463
profiling	benchmarking
pear has a benchmarking library for php profiling

1728512
webkit	gecko
are there bindings for layout engines like gecko or webkit for perl

1728566
decoder	encoder
if there is a format there is usually an encoder decoder for it

1728658
cpu	processors
in theory if you are running on a multi-processor cpu then the threads could be run on different processors so the work is done in parallel but even then there is no point in having more threads than processors

1728697
cpython	ironpython
you can then use cpython jython or ironpython to run the library depending on which ide you are trying to integrate with

1728743
jstl	taglib
a commonly used taglib is jstl which provides the tag for exact this purpose

1728786
post	get
swap post for get if you re not

1728802
rsa	dsa
finally the pkcs #8 format is not too difficult to parse and the rsa dsa key pair objects are as per pkcs #11 and relatively easy to convert to a .net x509certificate once you figure out where all the bits go -- i actually did this in vb.net a while ago but unfortunately am not able to share that code

1728813
mp3	wav
one format like pcm encoded wav for recording and processing but compressed mp3 for storage

1728835
rpm	yum
if i use yum remove command or rpm -e command

1728835
folder	directory
but after installation my application automatically creates some extra folder in home directory

1728856
gridview	rowdatabound
you need to handle the rowdatabound event of your gridview

1728856
gridview	rowdatabound
this link demonstrates how to use the rowdatabound event to modify the value of a field in the data source before it is displayed in a gridview control

1728870
pop-up	dialog
for dialog always use in-page elements which are much more reliable and less annoying than window pop-up

1728892
hash	md5
at this hash size the weaknesses in md5 are pretty irrelevant since the best known attacks on md5 take roughly 2 32 computations while one can generate a collision in even an ideally secure 32-bit hash in around 2 16 computations since by merely choosing random inputs you have 1 in 2 16 chance of a collision so after roughly 2 16 random guesses you ll probably have found a colliding pair of inputs

1728916
versioning	upgrade
do we need to upgrade to a newer versioning

1728934
pull	push
i would like to access clone push pull a private via ssh git repository while behind a corporate firewall that only allows http proxy access

1728968
getter	setter
personally i would just re-expose the properties i am interested in perhaps putting them into a different - making sure to have both setter and getter

1728973
pop-up	dialog
my suggestion would actually be to add it to the help menu on your main form and possibly in some kind of very intrusive pop-up dialog

1728977
hash	md5
then form an md5 hash to compare with any new documents

1728978
passenger	thin
the provider allows for mongrel thin passenger fastcgi web servers which seems very flexible but i honestly don t know the differences between them

1728978
apache	nginx
i have looked at passenger on the surface - which does seem very appealing to me - but i was under the impression that passenger wasn t the actual webserver and instead was more like a layer on top of apache or nginx and managed spawned instances of the application like a mongrel cluster

1728992
interpolation	splines
i presume these are polynomial splines functions therefore you can actually interpolation your dataset near the edges with actual polynomes

1728992
interpolation	splines
solving this equations you ll get two polymones a1 x 2 + b1 x + c1 and a2 x 2 + b2 x + c2 which will be interpolation and smothly accessed to the splines funcion

1729008
background-color	transparency
this is accomplished by specifying the position and setting the background-color to transparency

1729019
getter	setter
for a property to be visible in the designer they have to be public properties with a getter and setter - from what you re saying the properties are only getter

1729039
apache	nginx
if you have a nix environment then passenger + nginx or apache is very popular as well which uses the standard ruby or ruby enterprise interpreter

1729055
apache	nginx
go with apache nginx + passenger

1729055
apache	nginx
additionally passenger is now available for both apache and nginx

1729055
apache	nginx
if you need better performance and scalability you can use nginx as a frontend proxy and forward all rails requests to multiple backend servers each one composed of apache + passenger

1729062
datarow	bindingsource
the datarow is part of a datatable which is bound to bindingsource that is bound to datagridview.datasource

1729070
getter	setter
however when i removed the getter and setter methods from an entity to have persistent fields the values for the corresponding instance variable was not retrieved from the database

1729070
getter	setter
does that mean we must have getter and setter methods even though we have persistent fields

1729073
post	get
if you spend the time to clearly define the parts of your upload-process-render architecture and you find that it can be applied to almost everything you are doing then all you need to do to make it a web service is define a clear 1-2-3 set of rules for using the system get post data etc.

1729074
apache	nginx
mongrel and thin are single ruby process servers that you would run multiple of as a cluster behind some type of proxy like apache or nginx

1729074
apache	nginx
passenger creates an interface between apache or nginx that creates an application spawning process and then forks out processes to server up incoming requests as they come in

1729100
onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onkeydown	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onkeyup	onmousedown	onkeydown	onkeyup	onmouseup	onkeyup	onkeydown	onkeydown	onmouseup
i can record all things happening onkeyup onkeydown onmousedown onmouseup using textarea cursor position and keys information and make it cross-browser some time later but i can t handle things like pasting using mouse right button and selecting paste or pasting from the menu i can handle onchange but i will have no information is it pasted or already recorded as pressed keys and it fires only after focus change

1729130
getter	setter
anyway just create protected getter and setter methods as a workaround if your provider needs that

1729140
getter	setter
while on persistence property there is a getter and a setter method for each property

1729152
implements	extends
the class they extends provides a number of abstract methods which they must implements one of which is called updateaction and is automatically invoked at set intervals

1729152
put	get
so my question is at what point in a forms life cycle do the controls on it get disposed of and therefore where would it be best to put the code that stops the update thread

1729193
docx	.doc
the resulting .doc file was 2725kb or 2697kb as docx

1729209
width	height
canvas width and height should be set as html attributes and not in the stylesheet

1729251
public	protected
or is there another way to do what i want to do have a public super class and a set of public base classes that are all in the same assembly and use internal types from that assembly in their common protected code

1729258
pop-up	dialog
on your server instance expand security- logins and right click on the correct login to pop-up the properties dialog

1729266
hide	show
the show password button can hide the password field and show the text field and copy the value of the password field into the text field

1729271
client-side	server-side
this procedure involves server-side as well as client-side programming but can be accomplished easily

1729275
explode	htmlspecialchars
have you tried adding htmlspecialchars to the explode

1729275
explode	htmlspecialchars
sex explode boom htmlspecialchars s

1729290
pascal	delphi
and free pascal is a delphi compatible pascal compiler for amongst others linux platforms

1729303
super	implements
to be serializable to implements the serializable interface either directly or through one of its super classes

1729303
getter	setter
to that you can add getter and setter for properties of the class that conform to a specific naming convention if you want the fields to be discoverable in certain circumstances making that class some object you can drag and drop from a visual editor in your ide for example

1729370
range	infinity
a null endpoint would mean that the range goes to infinity in that direction

1729479
put	get
simply put its good practise but i would say don t get too hung up on getting 100 right all the time brain power is better spend on other problems than arguing over weather a dl is better than a ul for a given problem etc

1729498
vb6	vba
learn vb6 if you have to deal with legacy application or one of the microsoft office applications that still use vba

1729498
vb.net	vb6
even then the syntax between vb.net and vb6 is close enough to make the transition easy

1729498
vb.net	vb6
the main issue of switching between vb6 and vb.net is the support libraries

1729502
phpunit	simpletest
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .

1729518
post	get
get edit page renders available products user selects them and then submitted post edit action picks selected from selectedproducts

1729737
opera	firefox
some browsers will display a warning message firefox the others will just do it quietly looking at opera

1729737
post	get
in order to avoid this you need to assure the page the user is getting is the result of a get request not post

1729749
interpolation	splines
splines interpolation

1729762
cpu	hyperthreading
now its as if my pentium cpu has two cores i bet its the hyperthreading

1729782
phong	shading
for simple shading you can stick with drawing triangles using gdi but if you want to do gouraud or phong shading the colour values vary across a triangle

1729791
ironruby	ironpython
the specific example i have in mind is writing an application in c# but using ironruby or ironpython to write the tests

1729791
ironruby	ironpython
as i see it using ironpython and ironruby have several advantages over c# code as a testing language

1729806
innodb	myisam
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam

1729806
innodb	myisam
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

1729806
innodb	myisam
1 but when it is time to change from myisam to innodb

1729826
ant	maven
currently i will have to call an ant task from maven as follows

1729860
hide	show
it should hide or show tooltip on each button click

1729860
hide	show
now the weird thing going on is when i click on the hide button it hide itself and when i click on show nothing happens

1729861
strsplit	substr
one suggestion there was to use readchar and then do string manipulation on the result with strsplit and substr

1729887
width	height
i have an image with the value x width and y height

1729897
hide	show
if you hide it with code placed in an external css file you will not be able to show it again with javascript

1729922
width	height
let then given any new height y in your case 60 px to find the new width x

1729926
width	height
i assume you want the width after the rescale to relate to the height in the same way it did before the rescale you want the aspect ratio to remain constant

1729948
jruby	mri
similarly with ruby you could ask about the difference between ruby and python or jruby and mri but the difference between ruby and jruby doesn t make sense

1730016
multiplying	add
you should probably take an estimate of programmer costs hr and multiplying it by the estimated time it would take to add the needed open source functionality 60-80 hours

1730017
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
as a general rule you should let the database management system handle filtering grouping and sorting that you need

1730039
ironruby	ironpython
i would love to see the situation improve as both ironruby and ironpython mature but right now the testing c# story isn t so good

1730104
jtextpane	jeditorpane
a jtextpane or jeditorpane will do this for you automatically without the need for the above code

1730134
post	get
i on the other hand am looking for something that would just render a view without having to post get and generates me a simple string that i can send off through my email code

1730148
ant	maven
there is no official plugin for integrate ice with maven you can use ant and slice2java ant task

1730148
ant	maven
i not maven expert but seems that maven could run ant task maven antrun plugin - usage

1730149
min	max
i am using views to extract last months max val and last months min val

1730167
lisp	scheme
my first lisp learning experience was with scheme i ve never touched common lisp felt it was too complex and am now starting on clojure

1730167
lisp	scheme
i m no experienced schemer but i d say that if you immediately start with clojure you will still get the general lisp experience so you definitely won t be missing that by forgoing scheme

1730171
portrait	landscape
when i come into the new navigation controller and it is in landscape is there a way to force auto-rotation to portrait at that time

1730236
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
i ve recently found an interesting alternative to the asp.net asp.net-mvc that i currently do static htmls with advanced javascript doing service calls most examples use openrasta

1730251
int	chars
same for your other declarations chars c int len etc.

1730251
for-loop	loops
if you haven t talked about this loops in your class yet you don t have to use and you should know how the simple for-loop works as well but this is just a suggestion

1730255
int	chars
as you can see in the code above i assign an int to a chars

1730263
innodb	myisam
2 with only 2-3 tps you will not see any significant difference between innodb and myisam

1730298
children	parent
i thought it made sense to give the parent entity its own table and give each of the children their own tables - a table-per-subclass structure

1730317
innodb	myisam
say you have 16g of ram you would probably want to use about 12g for an innodb buffer pool provided you have no myisam tables

1730317
innodb	myisam
likewise if you have only myisam tables you probably want to turn innodb off completely and give a bit less than half say 6g to your myisam key cache

1730317
innodb	myisam
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

1730317
innodb	myisam
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1730317
innodb	myisam
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

1730352
folder	directory
i think you can just #include the files that you need from the main folder you will have to make it accessible from all the sites using soft links will cause the server to think they are in each site s directory

1730357
int	chars
in c assigning an int to a chars is legal

1730434
pwd	chdir
when i try a chdir with a filehandle as argument chdir returns 0 and a pwd returns still the same directory

1730453
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 and safari

1730453
opera	google-chrome
svg fonts for opera iphone google-chrome

1730495
width	height
the problem is that the a element has been made a block by the css so that it appears at the correct height and width

1730495
button	checkbox
so what i m looking for is the checkbox to appear immediately to the right of the element but without having to completely muck up the styling of the button

1730495
button	checkbox
absolute positioning of the checkbox using the known size of the button seems wrong and dirty

1730500
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if you want to throw an exception but you can t change the method specification you need to use an unchecked-exception like runtimeexception

1730512
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 and safari

1730512
opera	google-chrome
svg fonts for opera iphone google-chrome

1730515
vbscript	vb6
vbscript has no concept of a collection object so to create a collection object to pass to our api we built a vb6 activex dll that provides a createcollection method

1730516
uitableview	uisearchbar
this view has a uisearchbar and uitableview

1730636
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
if you feel that visual studio is expensive you can try the express editions or go for monodevelop or sharpdevelop

1730638
width	margin
turns out that the width of my center content margin was dictated by margins instead of just a direct width ie

1730643
ostringstream	std
by including sstream you can use std ostringstream and build a message using the iostream library

1730648
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you could use sharpdevelop or monodevelop though if you don t want to use visual studio

1730656
draggable	droppable
i have the td with a class called droppable that accepts draggable classes

1730659
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in ie but it doesn t work in any other browser tried it in google-chrome firefox and safari

1730676
scrollable	panels
or you can create a custom panels and implement the scrollable interface

1730702
lisp	scheme
with this in mind the direct translation of scheme into common lisp gives

1730731
titlebar	window
when the app first starts the titlebar of the minimized window is visible just above the start menu

1730748
beyondcompare	winmerge
winmerge and beyondcompare are both mentioned in that thread but we re mainly interested in diffs

1730753
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
for what it s worth the system.net namespace has the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes beginning in .net 2.0

1730783
children	parent
the parent supertype takes care of allocating a new id value and the children only reference that value

1730795
subnet	packets
every host on the subnet receives all mdns query packets and responds to the ones for their host name

1730796
post	get
if you post the same in load event the window does get minimized but still shows minimized on the desktop

1730806
vsto	add-in
my current project had done similar code sharing between vsto add-in for word

1730806
vsto	add-in
getting a vsto add-in into gac with an msi installer

1730820
beyondcompare	winmerge
i m a very visually inclined person and i prefer araxis merge s visual representation over winmerge and beyondcompare

1730859
width	height
that is i d expect to find functions with signatures of something like movewindow cgwindowid winid int x int y resizewindow cgwindowid winid int width int height activatewindow cgwindowid winid cgwindowid getcurrentlyactivatedwindow

1730863
postgresql	mysql
my general thoughts on foreign keys is that they re great but not usable in mysql and that postgresql handles them much better

1730871
nsdata	nsstringencoding
- nsdata datausingencoding nsstringencoding encoding

1730892
accessor	properties
as bryan said you expose a ui element as a properties via synthesize or a hand-coded accessor when you need to access it from outside a given instance of that class

1730915
innodb	myisam
as others pointed out note that both tables need to be innodb tables foreign key constraints are not supported by the myisam storage engine that will ignore them

1730944
qlistwidget	qwidget
i ve created a new qt designer form class in which i have one qlistwidget and one qwidget

1730992
many-to-many	many-to-one
it is also possible for users to misinterpret an e-r data model and produce multiplied numbers in cases where there are many-to-one or many-to-many relationships

1731024
apl	algol
remember that sql was originally designed as a user interface language that s why it looks vaguely like english and not at all like other languages of that era algol c apl prolog

1731027
firefox	safari
on firefox and safari the text is unfortunately darkened

1731027
firefox	safari
the hack above where i put the text into a different div tricked ie into displaying white text over the different-colored backgrounds but the same trick didn t work on firefox and safari

1731037
width	height
you need to specify width height on the bordercontainer itself in pixels

1731075
accessor	ivar
if there is no accessor then the ivar will be set directly using the obj-c runtime functions to find it by name

1731075
accessor	ivar
the accessor will be faster since you ll avoid all the slogging through the runtime to find the ivar in question

1731075
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
the main reason why you would want an accessor for an outlet is the same as for any other ivar or properties you want to publish

1731182
hash	md5
what is wrong with an md5 hash for what you are doing

1731182
hash	md5
you can take a look at sha hash for an alternative to md5

1731206
salt	md5
you may want to consider using a salt in conjunction with md5

1731209
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in cocoa touch we have uiviewcontroller and its subclass uinavigationcontroller

1731209
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
my confusion is thus how do subclasses of uiviewcontroller then know about the methods declared in uinavigationcontroller

1731230
hash	salt
if it s for passwords hashing consider using salt hash instead of just brute hashing the password

1731236
hash	md5
nobody is going to brute force your md5 hash the problem will be dictionary attacks agains known hash values rainbow tables

1731236
hash	hmac	hash	salt
and the protection is to use an hmac hash or something similar like a salt hash

1731241
vim	emacs
vim or emacs

1731255
post	get
i have seen some post using scope_identity and identity functions to get the current id

1731261
vim	kate	vim	emacs	emacs	kate
under goroot misc there are syntax highlighting files for emacs vim xcode and kate

1731263
accessor	properties
so following that logic if your mass properties retains and properly releases its value and it will if you use synthesize or follow proper accessor setter examples it s handling its own business just fine

1731271
post	get
this will allow you to build an http request from scratch which will allow you to include the data to post to the url you specify and get a response back

1731281
vim	emacs
i ll see your vim and raise you one emacs

1731285
bindparam	bindvalue
if you re using pdo why not use the bindparam and bindvalue methods demonstated here

1731301
cdr	cons
this function will build a cons cell with the first argument as its car and the second argument as its cdr

1731301
width	height
this way you can quote the symbols you want to appear literally like width and height and evaluate the symbols whose values you need like my-frame-width and my-frame-height

1731302
single-quotes	double-quotes
mysql s default mode allows you to use single-quotes and double-quotes interchangeably and back-quotes for delimited identifiers

1731302
prepare	execute
so here s code to prepare an associative array and pass it to execute

1731306
hash	md5
to answer question 2 the following two blocks have the same md5 hash

1731325
stdout	stderr
you need to capture stdout stderr from the process concurrently or you run the risk of the process blocking

1731331
rss	feed
translates your feed on-the-fly into a format rss or atom compatible with your visitors feed reader application

1731337
pop-up	dialog
however i want to share some common code between them say for example code that handles an action after a pop-up dialog etc

1731351
urllib	httplib
you could send an http head request using httplib instead of doing the http get that your urllib code does

1731377
uiview	subviews
i ve added a uibutton rounded rect to a uiview subclass dialogview which is a subviews of my view controller s view

1731441
post	get
i understand this kind of data need to be submitted using post instead of get but that s how scriptmanager works so would like to get solution by extending this limit

1731480
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
while c# is case sensitive these constructs in asp.net are case-insensitive because much in html is case insensitive at least in html4 -- xhtml is case-sensitive or course

1731498
put	get
third take your whole set of conditionals and put it into a function to get your current state and replace in your function calls

1731527
draggable	droppable
this works because the event is fired first droppable rather than draggable

1731592
put	get
i m not sure how this will translate to sharepoint but for normal asp.net pages i typically put a script like this in the head to get client ids

1731637
onfocus	onblur
i am thinking i might have to use combination of events like onfocus and onblur

1731665
children	parent
closest doesn t work because it searches in the the element itself and it s parent and you need to search inside it s children

1731682
folder	directory
both project folder are in directory c so i think that should be the correct relative path based on the documentation

1731685
post	get
use php s filter_input to get at the post variables

1731702
post	get
for a simpler way to download web resources directly you could go with urllib2 but urllib2 only supports get or post methods no head so you end up downloading the whole resource

1731869
post	get
thank you to lyle and his post reply that helped me get started on this article

1731869
integer	fractions
changing ubercart to accept fractions quantities means the datatype of some table columns must be changed from integer to float m d

1731912
rss	feed
one thing i was considering is periodically downloading the rss feed of bbc news and parsing the content using the yahoo term extractor

1731923
width	height
you are creating the buttons in rows and columns and you want to set the width and height of the parent window actually the size of the window s contentview right

1731944
rss	feed
i used this ages ago to query some data from visual sourcesafe and build an rss feed from the changelog and it worked quite well

1731950
tinyint	boolean
does tinyint in mysql take up more space than boolean

1731960
post	get
does that post back get dropped at the server side or client side

1732026
superclass	subclassing
subclassing know everything the superclass knows

1732121
client-side	server-side
i ve checked the java library a bit further and i think that its providing everything required for client-side and server-side code

1732153
translation	localization
personally i would keep anything national outside the java source and use the localization features to look up translation strings for simple keys and they are placed in your java code

1732193
cpu	hyperthreading
for hyperthreading 50 cpu usage is roughly equal to 100 usage

1732281
width	height
this can be done by keeping width and height variables and accessing the indices as such

1732320
ant	maven
you can t easily use maven as a drop-in replacement for ant and gradually adopt more advanced features

1732320
ant	maven
maven s big win is using it to manage your dependencies in a rational way and if you want to do that in maven and do everything else in ant you can

1732320
maven	pom.xml
you now have a classpath object named maven.classpath which contains all the maven dependencies defined in the pom.xml file

1732320
ant	maven
all you need is to put the maven ant tasks jar in your ant s lib directory

1732320
ant	maven
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications

1732320
maven	pom.xml
for version ranges i recommend working on a plugin that will produce a temporary pom.xml with locked versions for all direct and transitive dependencies and make it part of the maven release lifecycle

1732375
mouse	keyboard
when i connect to my vnc server i am able to see the mouse keyboard movement at the vnc server from my vnc viewer

1732375
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to disable the mouse keyboard movement put the vnc server in a blank mode so that whatever i do on the vnc viewer it will not be reflected on the server side

1732378
hide	show
for example when a user clicks a details button on some product i want to hide the main and show the containing the details for the product

1732385
button	checkbox
however as the other answers have stated you might want to consider using checkbox instead since radio button aren t really meant for this sort of thing

1732402
lvm	xfs
not sure if you re using lvm ext3 xfs or what but if you re on lvm you might want to checkout the dmsetup man page

1732448
getter	setter
is it possible to know if a given dispid result of getidsofnames is either a method a property getter or setter

1732465
post	get	children	parent
i have a parent child table simple tree table structure id parentid where i want to delete and get the id of all children for a given parent id - similar to this post sql server cascade delete and parent child table

1732475
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
lxml uses the full power of libxml2 and libxslt but wraps them in more pythonic bindings than the python bindings that are native to those libraries

1732500
width	height
this has the benefit of allowing you to specify both width and height while allowing the image to still scale proportionally

1732553
updatepanel	ascx
the ascx control is in an updatepanel

1732603
width	height
only the image s height is set on the image so that it can take all the vertical space available while its width is left undefined and i expect the width to scale accordingly with its height

1732603
width	height
for example if the image s original size is 800x600 and if the hbox is 300 in height then image height will scale down to 300 however its width doesn t scale down to 400 instead it stays at 800

1732618
getter	setter
the only thing i can see that i would change is to remove the private field in foopresenter and stick with just the property with a public getter and private setter

1732643
serializable	deserialization
ok the context is some serializable deserialization code that will parse a byte stream into an object representation that s easier to work with and vice-versa

1732663
width	height
maintaining the aspect ratio implies keeping the relation between width height

1732695
getter	setter
just including something like a getter setter definition in a block of javascript code will immediately give a syntax error in ie before you could sniff for their availability

1732717
qfileinfo	qdir	qfile	qdir
i looked at qdir qfile qfileinfo -- nothing

1732720
post	put
these are compatible with solving the problem using the dynamic programming solution i put up in a later post

1734373
cvs	svn
i use neither cvs nor svn i use git

1734399
super	abstract
you can t have an abstract constructor in java so unless you can put all the calculation into the call to super you can t do what you d like to do with the current design as a final variable must be assigned by the time the declaring constructor has completed

1734399
public	protected
you could then make the constructors not public maybe protected and then the only way the objects can be created is via your factory methods

1734405
pull	push
since all of them have processes running using those settings i never want to push instead i d like for each of them to track the other two and pull only when i m logged in

salt and hash

1734930
hash	salt

here s an example illustrating how to use an objectdatasource with a detailsview

1735122
division	multiplication
multiplication is less expensive than division so

1735129
matplotlib	scipy
use python along with numpy scipy and matplotlib packages

1735153

a classic example of breaking the rule as far as i remember is derivin square from rectangle since square can t have both width and height - because setting one would change another and thus it s no more conforms to rectangle rules

1735169
tablelayout	margins
it s definitely not a popular opinion but i m done with my tablelayout in 20 minutes while the css gurus spend hours tweaking line-height margins padding and floats just to do something as basic as vertically centering a paragraph

superclass	subclassing	abc	subclassing
if a client is using a superclass abc with a method something int i then the client should be able to substitute any subclassing of abc without problems

1735350
abc	subclassing
if our something method in the abc base class above has a relaxed precondition that permits any integer then all subclassing of abc must also permit any integer

1735350
abc	subclassing
in reverse if the base abc class something method has a postcondition - such as guaranteeing it will never return a value of zero - then all subclassing must also obey that same postcondition or they violate the liskov substitution principle promising less

1735357
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari brief testing this prevents the page from moving down to the correct and just shows the very top of the page i want it to show the just posted comment

1735374
rsa	dsa
is there a small library for rsa or dsa without any dependencies like gmp or openssl

1735378
free	malloc
if all your application does all day long is malloc one 8 byte chunk in thread a and free it in thread b and doesn t need to handle anything else at all you could probably write a memory allocator that beats the pants off any of those listed so far

1735378
free	malloc
most of the other allocators mentioned are designed as drop-in malloc free new delete replacements that can be ld_preload d

1735378
free	malloc
if you re constantly malloc free ing objects that are all the same size you might want to just write a simple slab allocator

1735397
unix	solaris
this should work fine on solaris unix also just remove win refs

1735413
xna	slimdx
if you just want to learn and become more comfortable with the graphics pipeline you should check out slimdx and xna

1735432
ssl	https
i used this ssl library for a small https server in busybox

1735526
rsa	dsa
it s written in c supports rsa and dsa along with a host of other algorithms and is public domain software

1735531

the logic for serializable has to be shared too it is not unusual for an object to handle its own serializable deserialization

1735542
put	get
first get the current contents of the input and remove the last character then put the modified string back

1735554
firefox	safari

ubuntu	debian
a list which includes file extensions which i find useful is the one included as etc mime.types in debian ubuntu

1735701
free	malloc
virtual memory is an abstraction on top of physical memory and malloc free provide an abstraction on top of that

1735701
free	malloc
free just releases parts of the heap allocated by malloc

1735707
min	max
a is obviously not the correct container for this task as it requires a search on every item to check if inserttime lies between the min and max values

1735725
min	max
if so is your friend - provide an which compares by inserttime and binarysearch for min and max

1735725
min	max
you ll need to create dummy timestampedtrackid objects with an inserttime values of min and max in order to search for them.

1735725
range	max	range	min	min	max
also remember that if multiple items can have the same inserttime you ll need to work backwards from the min index and forwards from the max index to make sure you get the full range

1735799
put	get
so i d recommend instead or in addition to project efficiency tracking to track developers efficiency satisfaction team efficiency satisfaction and try to solve how to re-balance efforts not only because of roi but to get most from people at least unless projects are profitable not to put roi estimations over all

1736222
subnet	packets
if i have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 then does the router make 254 packets for every packets sent ot the broadcast address

hex	binary
pasting as a string is probably not the best way to view arbitrary binary data - you could use a hex editor component or some other visualiser to give you a better view of the data

1736273
post	put
i ve seen this done better with a decorator over the view but this was the dirty hack i put in middleware to copy the post into cookie before the session middleware runs to restore the session

1736292
std	ostream
the fact is cout is an instance of std ostream which has a lot of functionality built into it which is necessary for interoperability with other classes that overload the iostream operators

1736308
cout	cin
i remember many times when my solution didn t make it before the time limit just because of cin cout while printf scanf did work

1736328
cout	cin
before using std cout cin unless of course you mix stdio and iostream in your program which is a bad thing to do

1736344
put	get
sometimes i miss a file and i get a runtime error that it s looking for a certain file and i go find the file on the internet and put it in the right place and it works

1736614
hash	md5
i found a term hash in most description of md5

1736627
hash	md5
generally any of the sha algorithms are preferred over md5 due to hash collisions that can occur when using it

1736630
min	max
is there a way to set a sql constraint for a numeric field that min value should be 1234 and max value should be 4523

suppose two lines of text correspond to each other words by words except for the punctuation marks

1736847
vim	emacs
vim and emacs for non-ide editing work

1736848
gentoo	linux
imo i d say virtualbox + gentoo linux + kdevelop4 gentoo will give you the control you need over your environment

1736860
vim	emacs
having a good command on a powerful editor like vim or emacs is something i would consider as an essential skill for any programmer

1736886
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this all works in firefox safari and google-chrome

emacs vim can be used for any sized projects

1736973
width	height	background-repeat	background-image
i will use a simple div element with the width and height that the animated image will have the png sprite as background-image and background-repeat set to no-repeat

1736983
execvp	fork
however by manually performing the pipe fork execvp of the popen and then dup ing the pipe s read file descriptor closing the original does not block

1737006
hash	salt
the hash function hash input to a value requires a salt value and no proof salt is needed to store

1737023

1737042
oncreate	setcontentview
next create a listactivity as you would normally but add a setcontentview call in the oncreate method so we use our recently declared layout

1737080
post	get
it s possible in php because despite their names _get and _post don t really need a get or post

1737080
put	get
it doesn t matter what the actual request method is - it could be a put and those superglobals would still get populated

1737088
put	get
i loop on the linq query result and for each i open the file do some operation get value and put the result in myfileino.contentpart

1737240
interpreted-language	compiled-language
fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

1737296
width	margin
what you should do is to set float right and width on your element and leave #content without any float or width just set margin

1737330
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
in most cases you can probably use sqldependency or sqlcachedependency

1737381
uitableview	reloaddata
then just create a form and add the data to the list and use reloaddata on your uitableview

1737385
post	get

1737416
codeigniter	kohana
quick question about general mvc design principle in php using codeigniter or kohana i m actually using kohana

1737462
pull	push
alternatively thinking a bit more - and allowing that i use svn much more - the key would be that i could commit to my local wip repository all i want broken code or not and therefore would pull or push my current wip to the laptop and back safely

1737473
integer	unsigned
your problem is that php doesn t have a type byte it only has integer which usually is 32 bits not 8 so if you really need negative value there the bits are correct anyway because unsigned 255 is the same as signed -1 then you should probably add the missing 24 ones or use arithmetics to restore the negative value 255 is -1 254 is -2 and so on 256 - x -x

1737474
disk	ram
make sure your hardware is optimized enough ram fast enough disk etc

1737508
width	height
you could assign a mouse click event to the covering div then iterate through all elements that you know might be underneath inspecting their position width and height to see if that location of the mouse click was within their borders and if it was call their onclick event

1737537
pull	push
in other words a pull mechanism versus a push mechanism

1737576
mockups	balsamiq
use paper and pen or more sophisticated wireframing tools such as balsamiq mockups

1737643
int	double
with the scanner class you are able to request specific types double int ... string

1737710
typedef	struct
it seems that i have to declare p using struct point as the type or using a typedef

1737720
typedef	struct
as far as i know it shouldn t work without a typedef in c99 either as this is simply the way c works but it does work in c++ as a struct in c++ is just a class with all members public by default

1737721
typedef	struct
you have to either say struct point or use a typedef in c

1737725
typedef	struct
if you want to use a struct as a type you have to typedef it

1737733
mouseup	mousedown
if this is the case then it might be best to stop hide the animated on mousedown and then get the activate your function on the underlying elements using mouseup

1737779
typedef	struct
you can use typedef to alias it to another name - typedef struct point point

1737787
ubuntu	linux
i have a mixed windows and linux dev environment and the server is linux ubuntu

1737797
pull	push
option 2 commit on the sending side push to the receiving end or pull from it or put a hg bundle on a flash drive bypassing the work server update on the receiving side and then hg rollback on both sides to eliminate the changeset but leave the changes

1737797
pull	push
pros using push and pull to move over changes like mercurial intends

1737797
pull	push
push to a developer-repo that only you access and pull on the receiving end

1737806
cassini	iis
my solution was to switch to using iis instead of cassini -- just configure iis to point to the development folder and then change the startup url to be cassini has a bunch of other annoying features too like no support for compression so this works better for me

1737844
traceroute	packets
in that case and assuming that the icmp packets associated with traceroute are not filtered stopped on the way a simple traceroute would answer the question

1737847
button	checkbox
menus checkbox radio button spring to mind

1737847
mouse	keyboard
you ll see some of this in dedicated devices such as the iphone simply because that s a platform that neither has a mouse pointer nor a keyboard and only touch

1737864
pylons	turbogears
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone

1737871
vim	emacs
emacs is a great tool so is vim for programming and i use them to develop my code for physics research

1737891
width	height
width and height of this frame generated by width and height of image

1737895
mouseup	mousedown
this problem is caused because you filter the mousedown message but not the mouseup message

1737900
post	get
i just get all post vacancies etc with language pref.language and show them on the pages where needed

1737916
pull	push
then you can push pull docs around and the separate different parent repos will keep track of what point on docs they ve been updated to

1737950
post	get
in asp.net mvc how can i check in a controller method if it was called using post or get

1737950
post	get
i am aware i can limit methods to being called only by post or by get - but how can i check for post get in a method that allows both

1737973
mp3	wav
don t forget that an mp3 file is compressed whereas a wav isn t

1737973
mp3	wav
so the delay might be the time it takes to read the mp3 file into memory and decompress it which doesn t have to happen with the wav file

1737996
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i want a library or some sort of a command that takes an mp3 file location as an input only mp3 i don t need wav ogg or any other type and plays the file to the end of it and make some sort of an equalizer output but only in frequencies as numbers like 31hz 62hz ... 16 khz all the 10 bands available but show them to me as ever changing 10 variables

1738009
folder	directory
i found that mucking around with the .project file can lead to the entire directory being considered a source folder which is not what you want

1738063
cldc	midp
it enables for cldc and midp 1.0 and 2.0

1738077
prepare	execute
as soon as you want to execute more complex queries you had best be prepare for some frustration

1738134
width	height
where #top-left #top-right #bottom-left #bottom-right are using corner images as backgrounds and have both width and height set

1738150
int	chars
you are assigning an int c to a chars result when returning from your function

1738180
int	double
i have a double pointer data- mono_channel where i would like to cast all the double to int and put them in an array

1738180
int	double
the purpose is that alsa takes an int array of samples and my samples are in double

1738180
int	double
so somehow i need my double to be casted to int

1738198
min	max	minimum	max
the samples probably need to be scaled from -1 1 to min max where min and max are minimum and maximum integer values for integer samples

1738203
mp3	wav
will decode the mp3 file to a wav file

1738206
int	double
if is an array of double s the casting is correct although your code is overly complicated -- you should just use index i as the control variable in the loop and use it to index the input array of double s as well as the resulting array of int s

1738214
public	protected
while inside a section of class a code it will always call the version from class a even if the class b version was protected or public

1738214
public	protected
as noted by others if you change the definition to protected or public it will be visible to class b and it will do what you want

1738234
treemap	treeset
you are almost there if you use a treeset instead of a treemap you can use your comparator on one of the fields of the animal class

1738246
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up as expected but as you see in the screenshot below it is way too large and looks like the full facebook homepage

1738274
width	height
the code below works very well for resizing an image by aspect ratio by height and i can also create a separate function by width

1738274
width	height
but i m not always sure if an image will need to be shrunk by height or width

1738274
width	height
for example if the space that the image needs to be resized into is 100 width and 100 height and an image is 150 by 90 then its the width that would need to be shrunk

1738274
width	height
so what i m asking is how could the code below be modified so it shrinks an image by aspect ratio to fit parameters of both width and height

1738308
width	height
the following code will work out which side is needs to be scaled works with non-square boxes which simply checking width vs height won t work for and scale according to that

1738308
width	height
if you do not want it to enlarge where i switch the ratios check if width or height is 1 then and only then do the scale

1738313
int	double
i get cannot convert â double cls_lasvm int int void â to â double int int void â

1738393
typedef	struct
you can define struct like after defining one more typedef like

1738424
inherited	subclassing
they are not inherited by any subclassing and only classes no interfaces can have static members

1738461
versioning	upgrade
the windows 7 upgrade isn t as important as the upgrade to window s 7 s .net versioning 3.5 i think...

1738471
put	get
so i guess you ll still have to put some brainpower into making sure you get the appropriate indices in place to make your system perform well

1738477
appkit	nsapplication
the documentation for deactivate method for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this method directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff

1738489
fink	macports
you have -i sw include and -l sw lib which are standard locations for fink not macports

1738489
fink	macports
in general it s not a good idea to mix packages from fink and macports

1738518
codeigniter	cakephp
it was also said cakephp and zend have a steeper learning curve than codeigniter

1738602
post	get
here showview actually sends get wait for user s post and returns

1738613
hash	md5
for example if i run file1 through c# s md5 hash code and copy nd paste the same file to a new directory...the hash code come out different even tough it is he same file

1738634
int	double
as others have said you should probably declare n and num to be double not int

1738637
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1738650
width	margin
without specifying a margin for your .outer div the user agent will determine the width using width auto which looks like it varies depending on the user agent

1738655
int	chars
people make assumptions all the time that chars is 8 bits short is 16 int is 32 long is either 32 or 64 and long long is 64

1738693
post	get
i m currently trying to implement that feature i ll post the code here if i get it to work

1738722
put	get
if we put it all together in the outer query using these two lists we get

1738773
int	chars
this generality is why the c specification says something to the effect of don t expect much about the sizes of int beyond sizeof chars sizeof short int sizeof int sizeof long int . that implies that chars could be the same size as longs

1738785
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
here i am not talking about trivial runtimeexception such as nullpointerexception and so on

1738786
post	get
i must be doing something wrong because i get weird stuff in my file so weird i can t even paste it into my post

1738817
rss	feed
you just need to give it the rss feed for blog 2

1738884
mouse	keyboard
upgrade the processor 2.53ghz add ram to 4gb after purchase if you re comfortable throw a generic keyboard mouse and monitor on it and you ve got a heck of a machine

1738884
put	get
don t bother with a hd upgrade just get an external usb disk and put all your vm s and extra necessities on it

1738910
codeigniter	kohana
if you re going with codeigniter note maybe take a look at kohana too the php5 fork of codeigniter you can always use libs out of zend if theres something that fits your needs

1738920
haskell	ocaml
haskell s learning curve is somewhat higher than other functional languages like ocaml though it is my personal favorite

1738937
public	protected
iirc that is the error one got when trying to use visibility declarations private protected public in php 4

1738985
x86	64bit
but on 64bit server the environment variable processor_architecture is returning x86 instead of amd64

1738994
implements	sealed
even if you made the return type readonlycollection it still might delay the evaluation and throw for example readonlycollection is not sealed so a subclass could explicitly implements the ienumerable interface and do wacky things

1738997
x86	64bit
x86-64 more precisely which is the 64bit extension of x86

1739030
hide	show
on a button click my form1 hide itself creates a new form2 and show form2

1739055
x86	64bit
if your application is a 32-bit application running on a 64bit os the process version of this environment variable will return x86

1739098
getter	setter
and in the myclass action class you can declare a variable variable named arg with getter and setter

1739161
button	checkbox
to do this with older versions of windows installer you ll need to create a customaction that launches the website and then tie the execution of the customaction to a button another common use is to create a checkbox saying launch blah blah... and then tie a customaction to the finish button which executes based on the value of the checkbox

1739183
feedback	review
but if you have unit tests and review are done by the developer in front of peers then it can be very helpful as he gets feedback from others and everyone can learn from the experience

1739225
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use the firebug extension for firefox or the built-in web inspector in any webkit browser google-chrome or safari

1739231

vmware	virtualbox
setup a virtual machine virtualbox vmware etc which is aggressively firewalled from within the host os with a minimal allocation of memory and diskspace and run the untrusted code there

1739257
vlc	mkv
personally i would set it up so that vlc captures your primary video and audio into a single mkv file

1739283
invokerequired	begininvoke
i want to detect this condition like with invokerequired and then perform the equivalent of begininvoke to give control back to the ui thread

1739283
invokerequired	begininvoke
the problem is the class that is receiving these input events is not derived from control and therefore doesn t have invokerequired or begininvoke

1739312
hide	show
i want to have a check box that allows you to hide show inactive records

1739367
post	put
the only other thing left to do is put in some code to expire the cache entry if the post changes

1739382
vim	geany
in linux i use geany or vim both of which have cc in the later case you will need to set it up

1739399
yacc	bison
that is typically done with lex if you are using yacc or flex for the .l file if you are using bison for the .y file

1739409
post	get
i ve seen ie flake with ajax requests both get and post when a cache-busting string is not used

1739453
put	get
i think you have to escape the dash or put it last because dash defines range of characters and you may get a very unexpected side-effect of dash

1739457
uiview	subviews
i have one uiview which i m using as my main view and i want to repeat the subviews across the screen

1739496
sorting	filtering
a search page with pagination column header sorting and multiple filtering filtering are in checkboxes

1739496
sorting	filtering
i have no idea how to make the three functionalities pagination sorting and filtering work together...want i want to achieve

1739496
sorting	filtering
user gets to filtering the sorted table or if he she did not do any sorting then the current table will be filtering

1739503
try-catch	exception-handling
the try-catch has no effect because the exception-handling is being thrown by code that is outside of the try block

1739508
rss	feed
the response is correct from bit.ly the link is shortened but the only links that show up in my recent rss feed or on the bit.ly home page are those created via the web interface

1739538
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are available on os x using xcode just for its editor is not ideal

1739545
filesystems	ntfs
vista introduced transactional ntfs that will allow you to wrap filesystems operations along with database operations into a transaction that can be rolled back if either failed

1739591
put	get
neither project get put into jar files at the moment

1739648
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
but greasemonkey would only be an option for firefox opera and google-chrome

1739652
range	max
i want to press down with the mouse and rotate the 3d object to a max rotation but when the user moves their mouse i want to slightly rotate it so that it looks like a see-saw rotating from a range of -13 to 13 degrees on the y-axis

1739657
put	get
so naturally when i put those values into my object and try to save that object to the database which has zip as a varchar i get errors because zip is recognized as an integer

1739668
ant	maven
when you re trying out stripes you can get started quickly with either rayures with maven or stripes-quickstart with ant

1739680
hide	show
showclosebutton - option to show hide close button

1739703
int	double
i would think that you have two options multiply by 1000 and store as an int and divide on the way out or just store as a double

1739708
division	multiplication
this is equivalent to using an int 4 bytes and performing multiplication division to take care of the fractional digits

1739754
post	get
i have written a blog post about how to get the silverlight testing framework to output the visual studio testresults.trx log files

1739773
versioning	upgrade
obviously the default rubygems and rails versioning would need to be upgrade but i m specifically wondering about the default versioning of ruby that comes with 10.5

1739783
try-catch	exception-handling
you could put a try-catch exception-handling ex block around sections of code and move it around tighten the block and have it log the exception-handling being thrown

1739831
objectdatasource	detailsview
now what i d like to do is load this data to a detailsview control using an objectdatasource but i m stumped as to how

1739885
accessor	properties
as long as your actionscript class has properties or accessor with names that match the properties on the serialized object and an remote object alias that matches the type of the serialized object then you can cast the object proxy to the remote class without having to do any extra work

1739894
subtract	add
if this isn t working in whatever language the simplest way would be the add or subtract the number that would be on the right side of the modulo until the solution is between zero and that number inclusive

1739930
titlebar	window
if you have you ll notice that on the top-left of the window s titlebar are a few icons save undo redo

1739937
implements	extends
the main difference between extends and implements is that implements changes the class s prototype while extends creates a copy

1739937
implements	extends
this means that if you implements a change into a class all instances of that class will inherit that change instantly while if you use extends then all existing instances will remain the same

1739937
implements	extends
there simply is a difference in the order in which mutators like extends and implements are brought in

1739937
implements	extends
you can implements and extends but you need to declare extends first for it to work

1739937
implements	extends
you need class human to implements ninja instead and class badass to simply extends human

1739941
rss	feed
you could subscribe to the user s status rss feed

1739955
submit	submission
how would that be without using the submit button i don t want it at all just submission the form by pressing the enter key

1739957
int	chars
int actual read packet timeout of 1.5 chars

1740007
mouse	joystick	hid	joystick
question by usb stick do you mean a usb flash drive that contains a file with the instructions or some type of hid device like a mouse or a joystick as the title suggests

1740020
vb6	vba
as jtolle indicated this is simply not possible in vba vb6

1740020
vb6	vba
there is no perfect way to work around this but what i personally do is create a public friend sub call initialize with the parameters i want in vba vb6 you use optional parameters for overloading and then put a quick check in all exposed members of the class that throws an exception if you try to access them without running the initialize method

1740020
vb6	vba
it s not great but it s about as good as it s going to get with vba vb6

1740055
xslt	xquery
saxon an extremely popular java xquery xslt engine by michael kay uses ikvm

1740059
std	ostream
since m_newline is part of log we can t be working with generic std ostream s

1740059
std	ostream
so you need to create a new stream type derived from std ostream i ve left it out here but assumed it s named logstream

1740059
std	ostream
that said you re not supposed to be defining new manipulators and stream classes if you can avoid it because it gets complex can you do what you need using just std endl and wrapping an ostream around your own custom streambuf

1740081
phong	shading
if i misunderstood your question and you already know opengl and want to study more about glsl in particular here s a good phong shading example that shows the basics

1740098
automake	autotools
i would start by learning gnu s autotools autoconf and automake

1740102
multiplying	add
multiplying each the u v pairs by the corresponding weight from the hit test result vertexweight1 vertexweight2 vertexweight3 and add the pairs together ie

1740112
pclose	fork
if you fork and exec and do the rest yourself you don t end up calling pclose directly or indirectly so there s no waiting at close time

1740122
matlab	simulink
a simulink model in matlab can be configured both to run in simulation on your machine before compiling the code to execute on a real system taking measured data as input and calculating appropriate outputs what was before a simulation of a control system is now a fully functioning one

1740138
post	get
this is the get and post data that my server file receives

1740165
collabnet	svn	collabnet	trac
i m running trac 0.11.5 python 2.4.3 collabnet svn 1.6.5 swig 1.3.29

1740193
vim	emacs
using a ide i don t to care so many things like when you use editor like vim emacs

1740193
vim	emacs
alas...if you insist in using vim emacs as your editor you will encounter a deep learning curve you will waste so many time even to acchieve so trivial a function in your editor you will be desperate when you are busy catching up with your timetable if you just pick them up......you have to settle down and start leaning and also playing with editors and a couple of days you will find you ve already achieve more than you can ever expect

1740267
actualheight	actualwidth
when a window is shown it is measured then windowstartuplocation is processed using the actualwidth and actualheight of the window computed by the measure process

1740267
actualheight	actualwidth
the behavior you describe tells me actualwidth and actualheight are measured to be either zero or relatively small at the time of the show or showdialog call and only later set to nonzero values

1740277
hash	salt
the salt is supposedly determined by an array of values each corresponding to a point in the salt. password hash value to introduce yet another part of the salt

1740277
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
ie introduce my own customized salt that i can say do an md5 hash on that and then use that md5 generated by the salt to seed the password at given points in the md5sum

1740277
hash	md5
granted it prevents someone who were to get access to the md5 password list from using a md5 lookup of predetermined hash

1740293
min	max
just use vector3.clamp vector3 value1 vector3 min vector3 max and use the constructor on vector3 that takes a vector2 and an int for z value

1740314
stdout	stderr
close unneeded file descriptors inherited from the parent there is no controlling terminal anyway stdout stderr and stdin

1740341
rdf	owl
i am finding it hard to understand what exactly is the difference between rdf and owl

1740341
rdf	owl
is owl an extension of rdf or these two are totally different technologies

1740379
put	get
however i can t get it to retrieve the .cpp s compile them and put them in the intermediate folder

1740382
rdf	owl
an ontology is a formal way to describe the properties the classes of a given subject and owl is a rdf way to define an ontology

1740382
rdf	owl
rdf uses owl to define this kind of statements

1740448
width	height
when this bitmap s width is m and height is n

1740456
many-to-many	one-to-many
asp.net mvc entity framework one-to-many and many-to-many inserts

1740456
many-to-many	one-to-many
asp.net mvc entity framework modifying one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

1740523
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
in simple terms what he wants to say is that you are setting the content of your controls in your loaded event which resets the height width and also the actualheight actualwidth after the positioning of the window is done

1740538
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
as you state the static method belongs to the class and since inherited describes a is-a relationship between types does it not stand to reason that a subclassing would inherited all of the members of its superclass

1740555
jboss	glassfish
it only has examples for tomcat jboss and glassfish

1740657
cairngorm	flex
i am using flex 3.4 and cairngorm 2.2 and zend_amf for server side

1740719
firefox	safari
some browsers firefox and safari support the non-standard __proto__ property that is probably prototype

1740754
width	height
the width and height of the node object el was 0px by 0px so not setting the overflow to hidden made the rendered item visible

1740756
hash	salt
regarding point 1 the hash_password function is used both to generate the password hash against the salt and including the salt that is stored in the database at signup-time as well as to recreate that hash when the password needs to be verified at login-time

1740756
hash	salt
the hash_password function will first hash the password against the salt and then insert each char of the salt into the password hash at the corresponding salt_pattern offset

1740756
hash	salt
find_salt will extract these salt chars so that the hash can be reproduced

1740756
hash	salt
although you can also see it has hash_password hiding the salt and find_salt finding it this method of encryption can t be called steganography i think because it is clear from the code that there is a salt stored with the password hash the existence of the salt is not secret

1740779
google-chrome	safari
databinding is ok and the required output shows great with mozilla and ie but not in netscape safari and google-chrome

1740809
postgresql	mysql
i personally do not like the ruby implementation on the mac as i had a a lot of problems with mysql postgresql and other gems always being obscure compilation problems which required me to install xcode and then compile all sorts of obscure libraries

1740816
post	get
and some web.config entries that allows post get calls

1740820
put	get
why not put a date and price on the product so that you can drop the price from the dailysales table since you can get it by joining

1740846
min	max
that will match any max element that s a child of salary and that doesn t have a preceding sibling named min and will emit the default min element and then a copy of the max element

1740846
min	max
if you wanted to be even more explicit you could use the pattern which will match any max element whose immediately preceding sibling is not named min

1740869
jboss	weblogic
ruby has access to all the java libraries using jruby if need be but ruby is definitely lacking a proper pure ruby managed application server environment like jboss weblogic or websphere

1740884
ssl	https
make sure the receiving server-side code implements ssl tls the iphone s nsurlconnection and the alternative open-source asihttprequest both support secure connections to https websites by default

1740948
folder	directory
right now each file and folder is stored in an object i created it contains the filepath filetype filesize a pointer to an offset in the file and if it is a directory and those objects are placed in a nsmutablearray

1741032
versioning	upgrade
versioning upgrade

1741036
int	boolean
so objects can be passed into a method by referece but primitives int boolean are passed by value

1741042
postgresql	mysql
in the past i had to migrate gb of databases from sqlite to mysql to postgresql and viceversa

1741061
google-chrome	firefox
more than if i could simply use direct order as in firefox or google-chrome

1741067
put	get
or is it possible to put a process in another shell into background mode and get it into the foreground in the current shell

1741089
opera	firefox
here s test page which looks differently in ie7 while ok in firefox opera

1741105
switching	screens
i appreciate it in windows alt-tab switching but hate it for situations where tabs are visually present at the top of the screens

1741125
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsscene will be filled in the whole qgraphicsview but you have the setscenerect function to choose the qgraphicsscene part you want to see in the qgraphicsview

1741129
hash	salt
the salt is stored in the user db along with the hash passwords

1741129
hash	salt
to start off i just mirrored the db plugin and modified the user_login procedure to read the hash password and the salt from the database and then hash the entered password again with the salt and match it up with the password in the database

1741137
tftp	telnet
inside the telnet proc i do a tftp

1741140
yacc	bison
we will use lex flex and yacc bison to generate an lalr parser

1741140
int	boolean
boolean are handled as int as in c

1741189
inherited	subclassing
a couple of friends was discussing the use of inherited and how to check if a subclassing is of a specific type and we decided to post it here on stack

1741199
inherited	subclassing
i would only use the enum approach if different subclassing may share document types but withotu wanting to share an inherited hierarchy

1741216
yacc	bison
i ve never used yacc bison so i don t know how it is done but this is what seems to be done

1741257
int	boolean	int	chars
a less well-known subcase is with the primitive wrapper classes boolean chars int and so on

1741257
int	boolean	int	chars
don t use to compare instances of boolean chars int and so on

1741261
getter	setter
one thing you can do is to make getter and setter for the properties instead of public vars and have your class extend eventdispatcher if it does not already do so because it is extended from a movieclip like

1741270
buffering	sigpipe
maybe for your use you might want to do the write of the buffering in a separate thread to avoid blocking and make sure you handle sigpipe

1741285
subtraction	addition
i can t see when to set the overflow depending on the operation addition subtraction and the input values

1741309
rdf	owl
in short rdf defines way how to write stuff and owl defines ways what to write

1741309
rdf	owl
owl specification defines exactly what you can write with rdf in order to have valid ontology

1741364
post	get
there are some various other optimisations we make but i m not going to post them here as it starts to get into fairly detailed discussion of sparql engine internals

1741376
hash	md5
i use an md5 hash on the passwords and sometimes usernames to give some degree of security so i m not storing a raw password in my code in case it s viewed by an unauthorised person or something like that

1741376
hash	md5
i ve recently been working on a forum which has a mysql database of users and passwords the passwords are stored as md5 hash but i worry that when sending the login form via http post the possibility of the information being intercepted is there

1741392
hash	salt
you would need to do a client-side hash of the password based on a challenge salt provided by the server

1741400
fortran	ada
from what i know of gcc most of the compilers go from java fortran ada whatever to object code then they all use the same linker

1741457
clang	llvm
apple s clang is in c++ and targets the llvm which is also written in c++

1741484
maven	pom.xml
my first quick solution was to mirror the nexus maven installation on machine that was connected to the internet run some standard pom.xml s to populate the mirrored nexus and migrate the cache via cd-rom to the target system

1741484
post	get
didn t want to post my thoughts at the beginning because i hoped to get totally different ideas

1741524
haskell	ocaml
examples include pascal ocaml haskell ... this is sometimes obscured by the fact that some languages use a c compiler as a back-end

1741685
getter	setter
the only case where i ve seen anything like that that didn t look extremely bad was when a getter setter pair had the same name

1741685
getter	setter
of course a getter and setter are really two extremely related functions they are just opposite sides of the same coin

1741711
keyup	mouseup
to detect when the user has made a selection in a cross-browser way you will need to handle both keyup and mouseup events

you could check detailsview and formview control

1741845
put	get
i know the server is perfectly capable of relaying the emails requested because i can get it to work directly from the command line and if i put

sounds like you either want to use a detailsview or a formview control

1741897
jobs	cron
cron jobs on google appengine

1741928
width	height
but for width and height there is no common-prefix and something like dimension dimension-width dimension-height sounds strange now

1741933
opera	firefox
users might be using weird browsers - ie and firefox are common and we probably have an opera user somewhere

1741976
width	height
given we work in a 2 dimensional space then there will only ever be 2 attributes namely width and height

1741976
width	height
for instance you could easily make the mistake of getting height and width mixed up - in dimension 150px 200px

1741976
width	height
then is 150px the height or width

1741999
pop-up	dialog
rather than putting it on the worksheet could you not have a toolbar button that simply pop-up a dialog

1742017
jquery	scriptaculous
as most have already posted it all depends on what you need to do i used jquery scriptaculous and mootools for some time and for lightweight effects mootools was the most appropriate as for support and medium sized projects jquery

1742023
awt	swing
i would suggest you to use netbeans for gui development in awt swing

1742049
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following jquery code running on my page just fine in firefox and ie but google-chrome seems to be freaking out

1742049

i have tried with both get and post requests and it always breaks in chrome

1742084
hide	show
jquery uses the css display property under the hood of the simple show and hide functions

1742084
hide	show
on page load the tags are hidden using jquery hide and at some point later on they are displayed using the show function

1742092
addclass	removeclass	hide	removeclass	hide	show
instead of using show hide use addclass removeclass and have the style you wish to be applied set up using the class

1742101
implements	extends
you will find jdbcodbcconnection which implements jdbcodbcconnectioninterface which extends connection

1742104

favour the use of jtable over jlist even in situations where your table only has one column

1742134
lisp	scheme
arc - a lisp dialect implemented in scheme

1742142
awt	swing
it guarantees synchronisation between your model data and the view gui and offers input validation on-the-fly conversion and many more useful things provided the link for jface databinding but i m sure there are other frameworks for swing awt as well

1742282
unsigned	short
wmsglen is unsigned short

1742307
hide	show
at first it seemed from the responses that using the show hide functions would not be possible if i wanted a value of display other than block

1742344
hide	show
i need to have the tabs as rendered by jquery s semantic tabs semtabs but without the functionality that show one div and hide the others

1742356
getter	setter
i created a getter setter on my return function then on the document ready just called the setter with that value

spweb	spsite
we ve reviewed all spsite spweb disposal patterns and everything else we could think of - problem being with the crash happening within microsoft assemblies it s a hard fix

1742517
filewriter	printwriter
if both classes are able to let you set an outputstream you might validate that while the classes itself write to printwriter or filewriter or whatever you need in your cases

1742523
getter	setter
if you just make it a public property you don t have to worry about getter and setter

1742553
getter	setter
you can go rightclick on class- source- generate getter and setter

1742563
folder	dir
how to get the list of all the files and folder in the root dir including sub-folders and their files

1742568
disk	ram
i use visual studio 2005 under windows xp and have tried on a 4gb ram machine with high virtual memory settings and lots of disk space

1742611
padding	overlapping
setting an appropriate padding might be a reasonable option but you ll likely run into issues with the element s background overlapping other elements inside the containing block

1742638
postgresql	mysql
if you need to talk to a postgresql database instead you d only change mysql to postgresql in the instantiating call new pdo

1742679
put	get
instead of doing a look up to get the abbreviated name of the month just put that as the drop down list value

1742755
getter	setter
for example if your private variables are named _str and you want it s public getter setter to be named str you can use the following patterns

1742755
getter	setter
now hit find to find the property declaration and hit replace to generate setter and getter

1742760
firefox	safari
i m using jquery to make an ajax post call to a web service and getting a json object back which gives me back some html code that i want to append to a div it works fine in firefox but the problem is that safari doesn t do the appending here is the example

1742764
outputstream	inputstream
i found myself passing inputstream outputstream objects around my application modules

1742798
put	get
my way would be to get d restofstring ++ the match then put together number with restofstring

1742813
post	get
similarly you can use json_decode to read json data that has been sent to your php script using get or post preferably the latter

1742821
outputstream	inputstream
the first abstraction would take inputstream outputstream as parameters whereas the other would take

1742825
outputstream	inputstream
this class has methods to get an inputstream and an outputstream from it so the using code isn t bothered with the petty details

1742876
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
i don t think the navigationcontroller property is set inside of your modalviewcontroller

1742885
width	height
the problem seems to be related to the width and height properties of the image which aren t updated correctly

1742885
width	height
the image s width and height doesn t seem to be correct when it s loaded

1742885
width	height
how can i assure that width and height of the loaded image is updated

1742905
free	malloc
if you allocate the memory with or malloc and then call placement new then you can separate destruction which you do by directly calling the destructor from deletion or free

1742944
jquery	simplemodal
one of the bits of info being loaded here is a jquery tabs setup so the onshow function of the simplemodal is used to initiate the tabs which are within the simplemodal

1742944
jquery	simplemodal
if i do multiple consecutive autocompletes on the same page it all works fine unless i have selected a different tab on the tabs in the simplemodal ....if i select a different tab close the simplemodal and then do another autocomplete i get a jquery error which seems to relate to a selector doing something with the old selected tab that was on the closed modal

uitableview	reloaddata
after rendering a uitableview with a given datasource i want to be able to switch to a different one prior to calling reloaddata

1742987

- the project and blog post should be enough to get anybody started

1742997
loops	while-loop
i am trying to debug right now in c and am curious if it is alright to call opendir repeatedly without having to first call closedir because i am trying to run a loops to open sub-directories when the while-loop that calls readdir encounters them

1743002
gridview	objectdatasource
this user control in turn contains several other controls mainly a gridview that is associated with an objectdatasource

1743003
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
the problem is that when you want to do that you need to have the sudo passwd and be in the sudoers file else it will fail

1743003
sudo	passwd
but you could try to use gksudo graphical version of sudo so when it gets called it asks for the passwd

1743046
folder	directory
right now each file and folder is stored in an object i created it contains the filepath filetype filesize a pointer to an offset in the file and if it is a directory and those objects are placed in a nsmutablearray

ubuntu	linux
i m using kimagemapeditor on linux ubuntu to create an image map

1743170
initializer	eigenclass
the simplest answer the eigenclass can t be initializer

1743186
width	margin
kill your left and right columns give your main div a width and then center that div using an auto left and right margin

1743189
uitableview	reloaddata
when you call reloaddata it forces your uitableview to re-query your data source regardless of the amount of data that is already loaded

1743189
switching	screens
in the light of your edits i m thinking that perhaps the moment you should switching data sources depends on the state of your live data - when you ve got enough data in it to be able to show enough of it on the screens

1743210
width	height
answers to that specific width height question would be very helpful but if anyone knows of some good documentation that goes over flex s layout stuff in general that would be great

1743228
antivirus	norton
i had to turn off norton antivirus outgoing email scan to get emails to go right away

1743307
width	height
the buttons width and height are set to 60 and 22

1743307
width	height
if i select everything in flash it confirms that the width and height of the entire movieclip is 130 and 120

1743307
width	height
and the the width of movieclip always acts as if the buttons width and height are both 100

1743396
pull	push
is there a way to add these people to crm and pull push the contact data from active directory so i m not creating a second repository of information that conflict

1743400
gridview	formview
i have an asp.net page with a custom usercontrol which contains a selectable gridview and a formview which is on the page directly

1743400
gridview	formview
first issue i want the formview s pageindex to be the selected index of the gridview

1743400
gridview	rowdatabound
whenever i click the select link on the gridview all the formatting that i ve set up in the rowdatabound function gets undone

1743411
codeigniter	cakephp
besides you might end up spending more time learning another person s system than developing your own for which you could use rapid development frameworks such as cakephp codeigniter and the likes

1743468
typedef	struct
typedef struct word

1743468
typedef	struct
typedef struct svector

1743486
int	chars
in our example base64_encode treats 1234 as a string of 4 chars not an int because base64_encode does not operate on int

1743549
printf	strlen
it would be extremely rare in such a case to need another header file when adding a call to printf or strlen

1743582
try-catch	exception-handling
there are a bunch of application wide event handlers in that file like application_error that catches every exception-handling that isn t caught within your application so you don t have to use try-catch all the time

1743582
try-catch	exception-handling
but ultimately you don t want to wrap your entire application in a try-catch nor do you want to catch a general exception-handling

1743582
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catches generally slow down your application and a lot of times if you catch every general exception-handling than it could be possible that you wouldn t know a bug exists until months or years later because the try-catch caused you to overlook it

1743590
free	malloc
you would get malloc error for object 01x100000240 pointer being free was not allocated error

1743665
getter	setter
these can be used for a more or less comfortable getter setter generation

1743665
getter	setter
however i only create explicit getter and setter if i need to place some extra code there

1743665
getter	setter
there are some who say it breaks encapsulation if you don t use getter and setter

1743665
getter	setter
however with a language where you can add getter and setter later without changing the interface i don t think that this is true anymore

1743665
getter	setter
and also bear in mind that if you make a variable bindable without an explicit event name the compiler creates getter and setter for your variable wihtout you even noticing it except there are already getter and setter of course

1743665
getter	setter
this is btw a quick dirty way to implement interfaces that declare getter and setter functions

hide	show
the particular page is using an update panel and hide show drop down lists based off of a selection in a drop down list

1743785
hide	show
the page is working perfectly locally using cassini the local webserver used by visual studio 2008 but loses the items from the drop downs and does not show and hide the controls upon callbacks from within the update panel

implements	extends
i need to be able to instantiate an object of a class in dojo at runtime and mix it into another object kind of like specifying an extends or an implements in java but at runtime

caveat i wasted the lower part of the screen so that nothing special was needed to address square screens and landscape portrait orientations

1743880
google-chrome	firefox
returns 0 in google-chrome but it returns the actual height in ie and firefox

1743919
post	get
depending on how complex the application s backend is and how perfect you can recreate the state ie all the way down to external soa services or the time clock it may not be possible to make those get and post requests reproduce the same behavior

1743931
folder	directory
equally of course ensure it has read access to your virtual directory though it looks like it is a permissions issue on the parent folder

1743980
rss	feed
feedsync allows you to publish directly to an rss feed

1744013
dictionary	map
this may apply more to people coming from a dynamic language background as the basic data types lists dictionary etc built in to javascript json directly map to the same or similar data types in python perl ruby etc

1744018
post	get
by the time you get to the code in your original post the content has already been corrupted

1744078
daemons	systemd
i believe the solution is to make a systemd call to launchctl since that s the daemons responsible for starting stopping systemd services

1744100
postgresql	mysql
don t assume that the default postgresql or mysql configuration is the right one

1744100
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
are you using apache or something like nginx or lighttpd

cpu	hyperthreading
in 2 physical cpu system with hyperthreading does an os assign number 0 2 to the first physical cpu and then 1 3 to second physical cpu

1744131
getter	setter
while trying to port and generally playing around with some non-browser code i came across getter and setter that looked like normal object properties

1744157
getter	setter
according to this article by john resig creator of jquery javascript getter and setter are supported in jscript.net 8

1744205
getter	setter
generating getter and setter would then be

for-loop	loops
if you are adding and starting your activity indicator in the same thread as where you are running your for-loop with the 16 computations the indicator won t update until those computations are complete since the current run loops can t finish before that point

i m currently trying to write the inputstream to an outputstream decompressing the data and then i ll need to write it back to an inputstream

1744309
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine

1744312
xlib	gdk
it should be possible to do that using only gdk commands because they map more or less into the same calls of xlib

1744315
put	get
however if i put the same code back in the class file public class email which resides outside the project solution i get the transport error above

1744325
post	get
- either post or get for our http request to the third party server

1744341
postgresql	mysql
i think that you can look in open source db firebird postgresql or mysql and open source fulltext search engine lucene or sphinx

1744378
int	chars
the cin x will read the int but the enter key interpreted as a newline chars will be left in the input buffer

1744382
kde	gnome
gnome x11 kde and a web browser with thumbnail capabilities installed eg

1744404
post	get
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

1744404
post	get
a confused deputy attack where the deputy is the browser is possible regardless of whether you use a get or a post request

1744404
post	get
on attacker-controlled websites get and post are equally easy to submit without user interaction

1744404
post	get
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

1744404
post	get
secondly the request parameters are of limited use to an attacker what they really need is the cookies so if the only thing they have are proxy logs they are unlikely to be able to attack either a get or a post url

1744404
post	get
caching proxies might retain get responses but not post responses

1744404
post	get
having said that get responses can be made non-cacheable with less effort than converting the url to a post handler

1744404
post	get
post requests are naturally immune to this however to exploit the get request a hacker would need to insert a link to their own website into the serverâ s response

1744404
post	get
would it be fair to say the best practice is to avoid possible placing sensitive data in the post or get altogether and using server side code to handle sensitive information instead

1744412
hide	show
i tried the hide show thing but it keeps the old form running in the background

1744472
opera	firefox
textcontent for firefox and text for ie but leaves opera out is there a cross platform way of getting the inner text content of a node

1744491
inherited	properties
odds are this type isn t really intended to be inherited and if it is these properties probably shouldn t be touched

1744503
post	get
get the interface definition for itaskbarlist from this forum post or from the windows sdk

1744533
free	malloc
i have a single malloc and a single corresponding free during each function call but after repeatedly running the code in java the malloc will eventually fail

1744553
starttls	smtps
extended smtps and the starttls command is an example of this

1744631
ceil	floor
the first is to implement the round function yourself using either ceil or floor from cmath and creating a function similar to the following

1744638
post	get
you might be better off adding 0.5 and using floor as mentioned in another post here to get basic rounding

1744653
html5lib	beautifulsoup
i m no expert on other languages but i would go with python and html5lib or beautifulsoup

1744695
width	height	hide	show
i don t believe the javascript runtime in any browser has an event you can hook into in between calculating the layout and displaying the element so you can add it in a way that it can t be seen and doesn t affect the height doesn t cause additional scrolling and then show hide it based on the width at this point

1744699
hide	show
maybe you can append it invisible then check it s width and then consider to show or hide

1744748
serializable	deserialization
the .net xml serializable was escaping the invalid character when serializing it but then it was un-escaping it before deserialization

1744888
post	put
if i copy the dll and its .pdb files with a post build event to the c# app s debug execution dir i still can t hit any break points i put into the dll code

1744935
ienumerable	ienumerator
first of all are you sure it s really ienumerator and not ienumerable

1744935
ienumerable	ienumerator
if so and if indeed you have an ienumerable not ienumerator you can do this

1744945
hide	show
after doing this work i noticed that my nsscrollview would show and hide the vertical scroll bar as i typed

1744952
innodb	myisam
is better on myisam compare to innodb

1744994
ienumerable	icollection
if you implement the icollection ienumerable interface and have a method called add

internationalization	translation
getting the translation of content working is fairly easy using the internationalization module

1745027
post	get
first your server requests for something like this should be post not get

1745031
pull	push
the extension keeps each project in a separate repository but provides options to update push pull all the forest repositories together

1745032
children	parent
its not a big deal but if i expire the parent by updating it s metadata i d like to avoid having to copy all the children into the new copy of the parent

1745039
min	max
- sort the array from max to min value

1745046
cvs	svn
many svn cvs users expect to host

1745047
ssl	https
i have ssl on my website....when the user logs in from a http page the form action is sent to https page would this still secure the posted data

1745055
mouseover	mouseout
i m not sure this will stop the mouseover and mouseout events but give it a whirl

1745063
width	height
i think maybe in ie7 the position and height width of the elements original position before applying the relative positioning is not calculated correctly

1745100
actionscript	mxml
including the flex framework whether via mxml or pure actionscript will significantly increase the size of your final swf

1745100
actionscript	mxml
the mxml version was 175k while the no-flex actionscript version was 2k

1745114
hash	salt
this way even if the database is compromised the actual application would also have to be compromised or both the salt and hash would be completely useless

1745125
ssl	https
but here s the important part and why the only correct answer to this question is both from and to must be https that most people forget https and ssl tls in general isn t just encryption that is only a part of it

1745126
children	parent
i want to write a hql query to select the distinct parent of all children where no records s have a foreign key to them

1745155
children	parent
how does the hierarchical data structure work and can the children display other properties instead of the same property as the parent

1745155
children	parent
the parent will change it s hours to the total hours to the total amount of hours added up by the children

1745157
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter | cakephp | zend

1745184
children	parent
the view is bound to a viewmodel that exposes a list of parent which should be my rows and a children list which is supposed to be the combobox dropdown contents

1745184
children	parent
when i look in the output window i see the binding error saying bindingexpression path error children property not found on object parent

1745229
int	chars
because int can become arbitrarily large in clojure the resulting number becomes bigger with every chars thanks to the

1745239
coalesce	isnull
the following would be much preferred over a isnull or coalesce approach

1745292
imperative	declarative
they can help us implement complicated business rules that may be difficult to express in the declarative form of sql but it then brings us to use the procedural imperative form of sql which is a general feature of sql which is neither very friendly expressive programming-wise and often less efficient performance-wise

1745302
width	height
this algorithm is not efficient by any means o 2 width height ain t good.

1745330
cassini	iis
i get it working easily on iis but using same configuration it doesn t work with cassini

1745352
background-image	background-position
combine your background images into a single image and use the css background-image and background-position properties to display the desired image segment

1745364
vsto	add-in
i have written and successsfully deployed a vsto 3.0 add-in for excel 2007

1745373
put	get
you can put the socket in non-blocking mode then you ll get case ssl_error_want_read or ssl_error_want_write from ssl_accept

1745400
folder	directory
that should show you the root directory folder in and the contents of those folder

1745412
disk	ram
if you do not want to call external commands whether by exec popen or system etc but do not want to modify the source of these utilities and compile them into your code relatively easy just change main to main_cut etc then the only remaining option i see is to embed the utilities inside your code and either extract them at runtime or dynamically create a filing system by pointing at the data inside your code eg using a floppy or cd image and writing a fuse module that picks up the disk image data from a ram address

1745479
config	ini
but this is quite messy as the config file lives outside my python-path and i would rather use a standard config approach such as using ini files or yaml

istream	getline
istream getline istream is string str char delim

checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the advanced search page brings up a form with two required text fields 4 optional dropdownlistfor and two separate areas with multiple optional checkbox to filter the results even further

img src littlepony.jpg alt photo of my cute little pony width 13 height 37

1745597
width	height
you have a tab that s 600 pixels in width with 5px of padding on each side you cannot have a div that is 550px or larger for the width this also applies to the height

1745597
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in addition if you have multiple divs floating that come close to equaling the width height - padding margin when added together it will crash ie 6 but not ie 7

1745644
hide	show
is there an offset option to the show hide command

1745690
jruby	mri
things work perfectly when running under mri but i m getting strange results when running the same code using jruby

1745704
post	get
when i call the post i get the categoryid as a result

1745761
toolbar	tabs
if you want to switch content what you really want is a toolbar because that is meant to alter an-place view in various ways - tabbar is meant for switching between multiple unrelated views and as such you are fighting against it when you try to use the same view across multiple tabs

1745798
pull	push
you could either pull or have the app register for push notifications when active and be told when updates are available you can opt to receive notifications only when the app is open notification data packets are not large enough to hold the data updates themselves

1745806
gitorious	gitosis
i guess i m open to trying to set up gitorious or something if it allows this but gitosis works pretty well for me right now and it was dead easy to set up and i ve heard that gitorious is not so easy

1745806
gitolite	gitosis
i ve heard of other forks clones of gitosis that have per branch permissions like gitolite but i m not sure whether i want to use one of those unless they have other compelling features and are as well documented and easy to use as gitosis

1745824
hide	show
should i use the viewstack navigator to show and hide different screens within the app or is it better to create a new .mxml file for each input screen

1745832
many-to-many	one-to-many
on a side note person to car is technically a one-to-many person owner or many-to-many person driver relationship rather than one-to-one

put	get
if you want to put it in a string though things get more complicated

1745925
post	get
rationale sometimes instead of submitting form variables via post or get i want to pass them into a javascript variable then do something with the variable and then send it somewhere

1745938
inherited	properties
what i do is add a class that inherited from resourcedictionary and override the source properties to check if isindesignmode is true

1746084
getter	setter
the authors notion of relational is quite off and the code they show is not object-oriented by any means they just show a couple of structs glorified with getter and setter

1746095
int	double
note that your coordinates are all double not int these are not precise units

1746122
int	double
rule of thumb int can be cast to and back from double

1746122
int	double
with double you can use much larger int

1746122
int	double
assuming an ieee 754 underlying floating point system you will be able to accurately cast int of 23 bits to and from float and 52 bits to and from double

1746122
int	double
actually you get one more bit because of the hidden bit so you can fit an int up to and including 1fffffffffffff or 9007199254740991 in a double

1746122
int	double
so every single 32-bit int has an exact representation in double

1746143
getter	setter
the authors seem oblivious to this as evidenced by the fact that the operations in their class diagrams are exclusively getter and setter of state information which is why the state optimization data normalization techniques fit so nicely

1746209
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
bufferedreader and bufferedwriter are the most efficient means of writing to and reading from the console as well as any file

1746223
system.in	system.out
in general system.out and scanner on top of system.in are usually enough

scatter	graphing
when i change scatter to plot it graphing the data but each point is part of a line and that makes the whole things a scribbly mess

visualvm	jrockit
you also have visualvm and oracle jrockit mission control

1746341
maven	pom.xml
if you re deploying the source for someone to build and you provide a maven pom.xml file then you don t necessarily need to

1746348
pop-up	dialog
i love the modal dialog but want it to pop-up immediately rather than the painfully slow animate on that it does

1746375
ctime	posix
assuming you re on perl 5 you could remove the entire file and replace the require with use posix qw ctime to get the version that comes with perl

1746416
google-chrome	safari
works google-chrome and safari 4 -

1746434
hash	salt
i d say it is absolutely essential to use a strong hash and salt on your end- neglecting to do so exposes not only your site but completely compromises every user who recycles username password combinations

1746443
width	height
for most controls you set it s height and width to auto in the xaml and it will size to fit its content

1746443
width	height
in code you set the width height to double.nan

1746476
hash	md5
a single nvidia 9800gtx can calculate 350 million md5 hash second

1746476
hash	md5
cheap modern gpus will easily boast one billion md5 hash second

apache	nginx
for several reasons i would pick nginx as a reversed proxy instead of apache and configure it accordingly

ant	maven
complexity for you in the build process but ways to do this pretty easily in ant maven

1746524

vb.net	vb6
this was a very popular feature of vb6 which was ported to vb.net in 2005 i believe

1746578
spaces	linefeed
alternatively if your data does not contain double quotes commas carriage returns linefeed or leading trailing spaces you don t have to surround the data with quotes or worry about escaping

1746589
abstract-class	superclass
what i m trying to do is slip an implementation b below of a abstract-class a as the superclass of class c that also extends the abstract-class

1746595

children	parent
this call finds any ul with at least 4 children more than 3 it then finds the closest div that is a parent and removes the default class and adds the scroll-content class

1746706
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
declare your variable s type as a common super class s type or an interface and extends or implements all the possible classes from that super class or interface

1746725

codeigniter	silverstripe
i have used a couple other frameworks codeigniter cake drupal joomla some cms others not and silverstripe now a bit it seems a little slower in performance than these other frameworks

then i go to the media temple cron jobs and type in the following

1746773
width	height
scale up the hbox change its width height so that it occupies the whole space available

1746811
onfocus	onblur
the onfocus and onblur events work on all form elements and anchors you can try just making your input a textarea and it will work but i would encourage you to do your event binding programmatically

1746842
innodb	myisam
the product web site claims to have a 50x performance increase over other mysql storage engines innodb myisam etc

1746896
put	get
since all a tracker does basically is respond to put get requests this functionality corresponds exactly to the interface that a dht distributed hash table provides it allows you to look up and store ip addresses in the dht by infohash

1746896
put	get
the dht protocol kademlia for bittorrent ensures that put get requests are routed efficiently to the peers responsible for maintaining a given key s ip address lists

1746902
cos	sin
where cos a matches the x value and sin a the y value for the first vector

1746902
cos	sin
are not exactly the cos and sin values for these values need to be read on the unit circle

1746956
fgets	getline
but since you mention c++ you might consider using instead getline caveat fgets also put the n in the buffer it fills getline doesn t

1746956
fgets	getline	istream	getline
both make easy to check for end of file fgets returns null on eof getline sets the eofbit on its istream argument which it also returns

1746975
getter	setter
constructors and getter setter are called as objects are created including propertychangedcallback validationcallback etc on the objects being updated and any objects that inherit from them

1746975
getter	setter
the window and all non-collapsed visuals on it are measured which causes an applytemplate at each control which causes additional object tree construction including more constructors and getter setter

1747026
fgets	getline
fgets for c getline for c++

1747027
sorting	filtering
see this document for more information on sorting filtering arrays

1747028
ant	maven
i don t know of any maven plugin that can add this functionality but you could call the serialver ant task using the maven antrun plugin in the process-sources phase of the lifecycle

1747032
pull	push
.net rx team this is not an official name found that any push sequence events callbacks can be viewed as a pull sequence as we normally do while accessing enumerables as well â or they are dual in nature

1747032
pull	push
anything you do with pull sequences read declarative style coding is applicable to push sequences as well

1747032
post	get
you may go through these post as well to get the head and tail in detail

1747040
printwriter	bufferedwriter
when should we use printwriter over bufferedwriter

1747042
yacc	bison
i need to make a scanner in lex flex to find tokens and a parser in yacc bison to process those tokens based on the following grammar

1747059
mousemove	mouseout
sounds like you want to bind to mousemove not hover but also create a handler for mouseout like to terminate the animations

1747087
inherited	properties
it works quite well except that some properties inherited is blocked textelement.fontsize for example

1747103
printwriter	bufferedwriter
to take the full advantage of printwriter or any other writer but also use buffered writing you can wrap the bufferedwriter with the needed one like this

1747117
onclick	onchange
also try setting the event to onselect or onchange rather than onclick

1747122
versioning	upgrade
service broker can fit that shoe quite well with its loosely coupled asynchronous nature and provide a headache free upgrade future since ssb is compatible between sql server versioning and editions

1747177
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind has tools for checking for data race conditions helgrind and memory problems memcheck

1747178
portrait	landscape
i also commented out the part where i was detecting the landscape portrait orientation thinking that that might be the phone state

1747188
int	chars
chars literals like c and 0 are actualy int s not chars s - they re casted down to chars at assignment and can be just as easily cast back up

1747195
width	height
what supprise me is that the loadercontainer s width height is changing all the way according to the contents that it loaded

1747216
hash	md5
so then when we md5sum every file see digest md5 calculate their sizes we can use a hash table to do our matching for us storing the matches together in arrayrefs

1747219
rss	feed
you could build rss feed with views and put a simple feed parser into your static site

1747236
mouseup	mousedown
however the problem with that solution is that it is only generic it can t handle the standard winforms mouseup mousedown etc.

1747242
post	get
as for this being a rest api - there s one web service endpoint with method scoping in the url and all calls are made via http get or post

1747267
hide	show
mypanel is embedded within a mainpanel and i have some show hide of the mypanel in between other sections of my codes

1747272
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox google-chrome etc but in ie 6 through 8 after the slideup completes the div appears at full size for just a moment before disappearing creating a nasty flash

this is giving me a return type of iqueryable ienumerable tblanswers whereas all i really want is the iqueryable tblanswers so that i can work with them later easily

1747886
doc	rtf
i remembered the rtf capabilities of the clipboard and realised that a class could be created that would copy rtf data to the clipboard paste to a word doc and output the resulting plain text

1747886
doc	rtf
the benefit of this solution is that the word doc object would not have to be opened and closed for each rtf string

1747894
prepare	execute
but when i try to execute it as a prepare statement i can t figure out how to do it

1747910

1748407
hide	show
so you probably have to have some piece of custom code which hide show some controls depending on the ui culture

1748409
isnull	nullif
the first where condition isnull nullif parentid 0 dbid handles this

1748414
yacc	bison
ok...you need to add a semi-colon as a token as well in your language spec...as a fyi do a google search on this ...there are a few lex yacc files for c programming language as well...and there are plenty of tutorials on this...flex bison are not exactly forgiving on program spec errors...you really need to understand the elements of how it works...look for jack crenshaw s famous tutorial on how to build a compiler

1748420
rss	feed
linq to xml or the xml classes of the .net framework is used to generate and process xml files that are obtained as-is and are not directly mapped to objects such as data from rss feed

1748564
vb6	vba
here s a microsoft article on calling web services from vb6 - vba is almost identical to vb6 so i expect the advice still applies

1748574
post	get
how can i get value of radio button on form post

1748574
post	get
i am already doing the above code it is really correct way to get values of posted elements but for radio button it only post the last value of that radio button

1748598
rss	feed
edit of course this assumes you re hosting a list of updates online that the updater program can check an rss feed or even a simple text file

first step is to parse the first string into a java.util.date object using simpledateformat based on the pattern of the first string

1749007
int	boolean
traditionally in c a boolean is represented with an int type

1749007
int	boolean
for converting from boolean to int you may use something like interfaces.c.int boolean pos your_bool_value

1749019
hash	md5
this avoids the the very unlikely chance that two different files produce the same md5 hash

1749040
coalesce	nullif
how about combining coalesce and nullif

1749047
hash	md5
md5 is still a very good checksum just not so great as a cryptographic hash

1749052
firefox	safari
in firefox safari ie it is working fine

1749062
persistent	transient
however if the source date is from a transient source streaming in from a physical sensor of some sort it may be a good idea to persistent the interim date object output of simpledateformat#parse string somewhere

1749146
extjs	mootools
can t use any javascript such as jquery mootools extjs etc and actual elements i want to remove are divs with specified class so i can t use getelementbyid

1749215
uitableview	reloaddata
i keep getting a exc_bad_access when i call the reloaddata for the uitableview

1749215
uitableview	reloaddata
i ve also checked that the uitableview was not nil via nslog right before reloaddata

1749234
daemons	systemd
it should use a database or any other storage systemd some processing language either scripting or not and a web-server daemons

1749258

rendering putting stuff on the screen input responding to what happens on the users mouse keyboard network for multiplayer reading files fonts 3d-models sound

1749324
ogre	irrlicht
if you just want to get up and running and make world of warcraft 2 i suggest you use premade directx implementations usually called game engines such as ogre irrlicht or hge simpler but only for 2d games

1749346
width	height
the simplemodal plugin takes the div and places it centered on the page with a certain width and height it somehow reads off of the contents of the div

1749348
x86	64bit
to get around this ensure your target is x86 unless you absolutely need to target 64bit

1749356
cvs	svn
update if any suggestions are specific to a particular source control system i m particularly interested in cvs svn and mercurial

1749375
maven	pom.xml
to have maven include hsqldb in the dependencies for the test phase only use this in your pom.xml

1749385
firefox	safari
while testing it in different browsers - including firefox 3.5 safari 4 and icab which i am using because of its harsh security guidelines - i found out that even in the app s log the session hash looked different - the only thing the icab session contained was the session_id

1749423
crypt	md5
i want to use md5 and crypt together in php login authentication

1749423
crypt	salt	crypt	md5	salt	md5

1749437
folder	directory
in my home directory i have a folder drupal-6.14 that contains the drupal platform

1749440
extjs	gxt
personally i ve also found that extjs s and gxt s store binding mechanism can be overly complicated and difficult to extend for corner cases

1749453
postgresql	mysql
they have mentioned using mysql and an option - which i am sceptical of and i m considering recommending postgresql although my direct experience of that combination is limited

1749462
getter	setter
a related question would be if we should only set parameters in an object using getter and setter methods

1749485
cstring	bstr
in short if something expects a bstr call sysallocstring or ccombstr or cstring allocsysstring

1749507
inherited	properties
the basic idea is that you have a standard gwt module and a second debug module that inherited this standard module configures some properties and uses gwt s deferred binding to replace some classes with specific instances when debugging

1749507
ant	maven
then you only have to configure your maven ant build to compile the appropriate module depending on wether you are in development mode or in release mode

1749507
inherited	properties
created a debug module that inherited the standard module and configures some additional properties for development

1749507
profiling	debugging
in development you use mvn clean install -dgwtdebug to activate the gwtdebug profiling which in turn compiles the debugging module

1749509
getter	setter
getter and setter oop aren t and more often than not just double the size of the code for no good

1749513
implements	extends
that is you can only extends a single class but you may implements many interfaces

1749537
getter	setter
there are no true setter and getter in the commonly implemented javascript versions so if you want to emulate the effect you have to use some different syntax

1749542
postgresql	mysql
if you don t want to rewrite all of your application logic to you can link a mysql mssql postgresql table in access using odbc right click link table

1749555
getter	setter
as for getter and setter it somewhat depends on the language you use

1749555
getter	setter
personally i only provide getter and setter for public properties and or if changing a property involves logic beyond simply setting getting the property

1749571
nsmutablestring	nsstring
why does objective c provide both class nsstring and subclass nsmutablestring rather than just provide nsmutablestring

1749571
nsmutablestring	nsstring
isn t a nsstring equivalent to const nsmutablestring

1749571
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i m interested in knowing why i shouldn t just use nsmutablestring everywhere and never bother with nsstring

1749597
mouse	keyboard
do they hook the users mouse keyboard in order to move the cursor to the correct location

1749614
shadowing	named
shadowing in visual basic will allow two variables to be named the same thing but not refer to the same object the signature is the same but it means different things

1749643
inherited	properties
you can also create a new collection class that inherited from dependencyobject and have dependecy properties for elements in teh collection properties e0 e1 e2 .

1749649
implements	extends
or you can make an interface vehicle a vehicleimpl implements vehicle an interface car extends vehicle an interface pontiac implements car and a pontiacimpl implements pontiac extends vehicleimpl

1749731
ant	maven
total maven newbie trying along with the rest of a sizeable team to convert a monstrous pile of legacy code from ant over to maven

1749783
post	put
normally when you edit something you put its changes and when you add something new you post it

1749793
jobs	cron
hard to fathom what you want your english is very hard to parse but anyway besides task queues which are much more flexible and powerful and may be harder to use for simple jobs that cron functionality covers perfectly you can use cron to schedule app engine tasks in python by following the instructions here

1749808
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
these are autoresetevent objects -- looks like you want a manualresetevent -- the auto version triggers anything waiting but immediately resets

1749816
versioning	upgrade
this was for a jdeveloper project and it turned out that the jdeveloper upgrade 11.1.1.2.0 that i d just installed incorporated a later versioning of svnkit than the one i use for command-line svn access jsvn

1749824
aptana	radrails
ruby on rails seems pretty good for kickstart development i love the railscasts unfortunately trying to develop a demo with aptana radrails failed epically to a 200 line stack trace

1749841
onchange	onkeydown
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better

1749842
implements	extends
however i think replacing these abstract classes is a pretty easy refactoring make them interfaces and replaces extends with implements where you get compilation errors and i really can t see what could get broken so i would go for it

1749843
keydown	keyup
keydown keyup keypress

1749863
sequence	permutation
covering the permutation in sort sequence is not the most efficient approach to password cracking although it will ultimately be effective

1749915
direct3d	directx
after find yourself some books on direct3d for directx 9 sdk game engines and architecture multithreaded applications and design patterns

1749915
direct3d	directx
i would suggest directx 9 graphics the definitive guide to direct3d from alan thorn for direct3d

1749950
freebsd	linux
so osx and linux variants are fine as is freebsd and others but windows won t be

1749986
children	parent
moreover their parent will have to contain the sums of their children accounts just like the example output bellow

1749994
caliburn	prism
caliburn addresses this missing piece of prism with its ipresenter component model and works well with prism

1750015
content-disposition	content-type
although this should not be happening because you ve set the content-type and content-disposition i believe that ie s built-in mime sniffing handling is what is causing the problem here

1750019
int	double
unless you know what to expect int double etc you need to use the long case statement

1750026
maven	m2e
edit as the op wrote in a comment these directories come from m2e that allows to check out maven projects from svn

1750041
min	max
the month label unit is generated based on a min max value that is supplied to the datetimeaxis it is not generated by the series data as far as i can tell

1750041
min	max
in other words the duplication does not exist within the data supplied to the chart but is part of automatic label generation process that datetimeaxis will execute when supplying a min max value for the axis

1750052
hide	show
from what i understand is you want to show or hide portions of the page depending on what the user selected in a dropdown

1750089
post	put
i have a web application and i m attempting to put an ajax timer control in it to give me a post back every 10-20 seconds

1750090
memcached	apc
you can also use apc much like you d use memcached for storing arbitrary user data

1750090
memcached	apc
better to serve a gig of data from one memcached box to four servers than to have 4 copies of that gig of data in apc on each individual server

1750090
memcached	apc
imo concurrency is tricky -- let memcached apc the database deal with it

1750149
int	chars
of course if you intended these to be the hex codes for chars then you would need to use the hex and chr functions to convert between int and strings of hex chars

1750154
hex	binary
instead convert your hex string by packing it into a binary string using

1750183
folder	directory
you can t change the installation directory from the installer but as the program doesn t depend on registry settings you can copy the installed assemblies to a folder in your vcs and run from there

1750196
put	get
in the specific example you give you need to first get the 4 decimal precision number and put it in a bigdecimal or decimal 19 4 as the case may be and then further round it to 2 decimal precision

1750250
nstextview	nsscrollview
b have 3 nstextview s within the nsscrollview

1750261
width	height
although the example doesn t have it i d think you need to add px after the height and width in quotes 450px

1750262
fold	catamorphism
to a category theorist this screams catamorphism to a hardcore functional programmer fold to a softcore functional programmer reduce to a smalltalk programmer inject into and to a rubyist enumerable#inject

1750339
int	double
because if you need a int list and in another hand a double list you must implement two classes but with this approach you use only one

1750384
wmic	tasklist
if you re looking for a command-line program that gets those things for you there is tasklist and wmic

1750451
implements	extends
the key is that you can extends from only one abstract class while you can implements more interfaces

1750451
implements	extends
apparently the empty abstract class design desicion was made so that it prevents the implements class from extends from another classes

1750525
pull	push
you could use git locally to manage your own changes and then use git-svn to pull push those changes to svn

1750526
width	height
however being an inline element does not honor the height and width properties

1750582
width	height
height and width can only be applied to elements with haslayout property

1750582
fontfamily	font-size
you might need to play a little bit with dimensions because global font-size fontfamily and line-height can affect the real size of your box

1750615
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
you could use git bazaar or mercurial along side of svn though you would want to be sure that you exclude the .svn directories from your new scm and vice versa so that they dont track each others meta data

1750618
gif	png
first you will need a 24-bit png or a gif image with a transparent part - the example has transparent liquid

1750626
innodb	myisam
price node in offer parent node is also related to default price node and so while generating inserts statements we have to keep in mind that values are properly inserted into the databases but we are not allowed to use innodb table of mysql but the only engine we are allowed to use is myisam

1750638

inherited	properties
the padding properties is not inherited by its children

1750815
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i have the strong feeling that i m missing something trivially simple but i just don t find a method that works in ie firefox safari and opera

1750821
hash	md5
also the motivation for ditching md5 in favor of sha-1 or sha-256 would be that md5 is broken. there are shortcuts to find hash collisions so that brute-force isn t required

1750854
decoder	encoder
both the encoder and the decoder is documented in a 7 page format specification with lots of whitespace and large diagrams so i would suppose that you should be able to implement a decoder without much fuzz

1750870
vb.net	vb6
combine this with a custom windows message which your application listens for to bring itself into focus see vb.net vb6 and c# interprocess communication via window messaging

1750879
post	get
the limits on get post string length are both theoretical and vary between browsers and servers

1750895
disk	ram
someone hinted at a possible way to index this thing if you have abundant ram or possibly even disk swap available

1750958
free	malloc
the biggest performance gains flaws will be on the algorithm you implement and how much unneeded work you perform unneeded work could be everything from recalculating a previous value that could have been cached to using too many malloc free s vs using memory pools

1750965
boost	stl
in addition i want to note that using c++ can give you a lot to gain if you use the stl and boost libraries

1750969
post	get
if the value is part of a post form then you want to check request.forms or request.querystring if it s a get form

1750972
versioning	upgrade
although i am using drupal since the d4 series i only started developing professionally for it with d6 so - despite i did various site upgrade - i was never faced by the task of having to port my own code to a new versioning

1750972
versioning	upgrade
would you advice to begin to port my modules as soon as i have time for doing it and to maintain a concurrent d7 for some time so i am prepared for the d-day or would you advice to rather wait for the day in which the port will be actually imminent and then upgrade the modules to d7 and drop the d6 versioning

1750995
stdout	stderr
i tried blocking the sigchld signal in my script i tried closing and or redirecting stdout stderr stdin which are duplicated on fork but you never know - no success

1751032
move	drag
right now i have move to processing of drag drop

1751051
hide	show
inspired by adam a s comment you could hide the animation when the user is leaving the page through form submit is the normal route i would suspect so if when coming back to the page the animation isn t show

1751121
equals	tostring
so methods on value objects - such as equals hashcode tostring should always be tested using the real object

1751190
post	get
but if i ll use the same code in customer validator in asp.net it...pop ups the msg that please select maximum of three items..but after it the page get post back to server...that should not happen.

this provider supports skip only over ordered queries returning entities or projections that contains all identity columns where the query is a single-table non-join query or is a distinct except intersect or union not concat operation

1751337
x86	mips
they are likely not corrupted but tools that expect x86 images as opposed to arm mips etc may give that misleading error when they encounter images compiled for a different processor

1751360
width	height
this way your background picture has always got the same size as the width of the screen and the height will allways have the right size

1751368
integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

1751404
division	multiplication
there are different instructions for multiplication and division for signed integers

1751404

1751415
restrict	shared
resource needs - given some of the drupal-7 threads it looks like they are likely to go up so this should be evaluated before porting smaller sites that sit on a shared restrict hosting account

1751415
versioning	upgrade
latest versioning first - this one is rather obvious and always stressed in the upgrade guides but nevertheless worth mentioning upgrade core and all modules to their latest current versioning first before doing a major upgrade as the upgrade code is highly likely to depend on the latest table data structures to work correctly

1751417
actualheight	actualwidth
for example suppose you want your vm to be aware of the actualwidth and actualheight properties of your view

1751448
accessor	properties
when i try to serialize this to xml i get an error the properties or indexer persistentobject.id cannot be used in this context because the set accessor is inaccessible

1751462
integer	unsigned
logical bit pattern bits of value-representation values of binary digits can only be preserved if the original signed value was non-negative because negative values cannot be represented by an unsigned integer variable

1751466
post	get
the only way browser and server can communicate is either via get request or post request over http protocol

1751553
int	boolean
i override the public boolean ontap int index in itemizedoverlay to detect taps on the markers but it seems inaccurate

1751563
put	get
of course you can put some settings in the database but you program will still need a config file to get the db connection string unless you hard-code it which is of course not recommended

1751578
post	get
mechanize is really great library as it s not just plain http get post request-and-fetch it s keeping track of cookies thus closely emulating real web browser behavior

1751623
jlist	jtree
basically i would like to create similar thing like here changing jlist row color at runtime but for jtree

1751653
division	modulo
if has a loop using a goto and processes the number using the modulo - set a - and integer division - set a - operators and some if statements to build up the hex string

1751680
int	chars
however when looking in the documentation it says that the method characteratindex returns a chars not an int

1751708
implements	extends
extends what lost-theory has said if you want to use comet for a passing messages between clients then you need to implements something like pubsub

1751710
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
but looking through the v3 api documentation it seems as if google has implemented click doubleclick mousemove mousedown and mouseup as event triggers but no hover or mouseover or mouseout

1751714
unsigned	short
characteratindex returns unichar which is an unsigned short

1751729
free	malloc
you need to use malloc and free to allocate your morse code string or used a fixed-size character array and copy directly into that

1751730
put	get
the best way to get around that and avoid ambiguity is to put a notes or labels on the diagram that explain the detail

1751784
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the app is trying to treat your uiviewcontroller like a uinavigationcontroller which it s not

1751784
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
subclass the root view controller as uinavigationcontroller instead of uiviewcontroller

1751791
metaphone	soundex
you might consider using the levenshtein similar-text soundex or metaphone functions

1751802
google-chrome	firefox
note multi-process browsers include google-chrome ie8 and firefox 3.5 although ie8 does something funky to work around the multi-process problem when it s working

1751846
spaces	delimiter
the only reason to waste spaces on delimiter is when the data is variable length

1751849
minimum	max
so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long

1751855
hide	show
but i don t see where i instantiate then when i want when i show them and when i hide them

1751874
pull	push
doesn t have to be a named branch you can simply have multiple unnamed heads or named heads using bookmark though those still aren t perfect because currently they don t show up with push pull clone

1751920
post	get
will post answer when i get a response

1751932
firefox	safari
i m trying to create a unordered list with each li element having it s own background image no text just image but i m having trouble in firefox at least it works in safari getting the link to work

1751958
versioning	upgrade
the company i am working for is currently using td versioning 5.1 and considering upgrade to td 5.2 next year

1751958
mouse	keyboard
the code editing is possible even without mouse since there is a number of handy keyboard shortcuts

1751960
inherited	properties
no opacity is not a button properties it s inherited from whatever the form is set to

1751966
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
because there is nothing like inotifypropertychanged for icommand objects i am forced to call commandmanager.invalidaterequerysuggested to force wpf to reconsider all of my command objects canexecute states yes i actually do need to do this otherwise none of these controls become disabled

1751970
folder	directory
do you have a folder in your application directory named twitter or a file named twitter.py

1751970
folder	directory
a file or folder in your application directory can create a conflict with the python-twitter library

1752029
hide	show
you can hide the tr just as easily also if you hide the tr or div the content wont show so why try to hide the children

1752140
division	multiplication
i did some speed testing to figure out what is the fastest when doing multiplication or division on numbers

1752140
division	multiplication
i got nonsensical results such as a massive loop operating in 2 microseconds or that multiplication was the same speed as division if only that were true

1752140
int	double	multiplying	division
multiplying to divide using double seems the fastest way to do a division followed by int division

1752164
width	height
note that even though i cannot see the video when i listen to the onmetadata of the stream i can get plenty of information about the video such as width height fps changes during playback as if a video is shown number of decoded frames

1752165
division	logarithm	division	multiplication
there are lots of ways to perform certain arithmetic so there might not be a single answer shifting fractional multiplication actual division some round-trip through a logarithm unit etc

1752171
slideup	slidedown
when slideup slidedown animations only work one way it is often a positioning bug

1752171
children	parent
either the element you are animating needs to be set to position relative or the children of the element have a float applied to them and are not giving the parent element true height

1752174
width	height
either make the popup element absolutely positioned and move it offscreen when invisible or maybe try to make it 0px width and 0px height when invisible

1752178
folder	directory
if you need the directory to be within your solution folder somehow maybe you should refer to the directory your executable resides in ... solutiondir bin debug which you can get using

1752209
x86	64bit
it looks here like you re interested only in the platform you happen to be on which guessing from your execution times seems to be 64bit x86 either intel core2

1752209
floating-point	integer
also if you have integer sources and need an integer result make sure to include the cost of conversion between integer and floating-point in your benchmarking

1752223
children	parent
from what i have now the children display the same information as the parent

1752251
direct3d	directx
an interesting choice might be slimdx which is a slim wrapper around direct3d sort of like managed directx once was

1752263
stringbuilder	printwriter
it looks like the simplest thing is to call printstacktrace x where x subclasses a printstream or printwriter and gathers it to a stringbuilder and can return a string

1752319
disk	ram
specifically instead of writing the data to disk immediately or soon after i call write linux will store the written data in ram and then at some later time i suspect when the 2gb of ram starts to get full it will suddenly try to write out several hundred megabytes of cached data to the disk all at once

1752320
ubuntu	linux
the example i m thinking about is libnotify which enables for notification of messages with or without image and title this can for instance be found in ubuntu linux 9.04

1752322
width	height
if that doesn t work try extending buttonfield overriding layout and calling setextent width height with the width and height that you want

1752325
pull	push
note that you ll likely want to perform these operations in a local branch so that you don t inadvertently push them to your friend s master branch or your friend doesn t pull them into his master branch

1752353
set	bag
to handle more than one level deep for eager fetching you ll need to use a set instead of a bag or list

1752355
sorting	filtering
currently we are filtering and sorting data with a datatable

1752355
sorting	filtering
is there another collection container that is optimized to do this type of filtering sorting

1752378
hash	md5
using a hash like md5 or sha on the id is not a good idea

1752416
post	get
i ve tried several iterations on what i ve seen done elsewhere including several post here but i have yet to get this to work properly

1752418
bids	ssis
recently i got a chance to transferred the jobs from sql server 2000 to sql server 2005 using ssis bids

1752434
post	get
request.isajaxrequest is returning true for the edit method that accepts http get but false for edit method accepting http post

1752436
stdout	stderr
ipc open2 ipc open3 to start a program while getting its stdout stderr via a file handle

1752459
put	get
the idea of a self documenting rest api is that one can be given a single entry point into a system and be able to discover all functionality available through the returned documents combined with understanding of standard usage of the rest verbs get put delete

1752459
post	put
by convention if you had permission you could update the employee bob using put against employee 132 or create a new employee with a post to employee

1752497
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but not in safari and google-chrome

1752497
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome it does not

1752497
google-chrome	safari
there s a very peculiar issue which i can t believe has gone unnoticed for google-chrome safari so maybe something on my end

1752497
google-chrome	safari
which for some bloody reason wouldn t work in google-chrome safari

1752508
rss	feed
and consider the rss feed where you get html embedded in the xml

1752543
sorting	filtering
datasources also provide a nice way to handle sorting filtering and pagination

1752543
sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource	linqdatasource	objectdatasource
and usually you end up tying your web ui to your persistence implementation sqldatasource linqdatasource etc or you end up using objectdatasource which sucks because it is so limited requires you to hard-code class names and method names into your aspx and uses reflection somewhat inefficiently

1752555
keydown	keyup
you can increment a counter for each keydown event and decrement it for each keyup event

1752603
versioning	upgrade
if the next versioning of either software changes its internals you could get different query results after you upgrade

1752603
min	max
the row where sequence is max or the row where sequence is min

1752603
aggregate-functions	sum
what about other aggregate-functions like avg or sum

1752604
super	implements	super	abstract
then implements your two behaviours in two different classes which share whatever they need of an abstract super type

1752618
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
2-way databinding was probably written with sqldatasource in mind and not objectdatasource

1752619
rss	feed
good web developers design their html with search engines in mind and often also provide things like rss feed and site maps to make it easier to crawl content

1752653
udp	tcp
assuming this is tcp not udp you can think of the socket as a stream of bytes

1752653
put	get
the sender can put them in in whatever way he wants and you can get them out in whatever way you want

1752681
fileoutputstream	filewriter
edit i m assuming here that you are writing files using fileoutputstream filewriter and the like

1752691
ant	maven
you should use a tool to compile like ant ou maven

1752697
hide	show
when you select one of the layouts you have saved vswindowmanager will automatically hide show and rearrange windows so they are in the exact same layout as before

1752722
post	get
you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http post get request from c#

1752727
bindingsource	dataview
use a filtered dataview and then set your datagridview s bindingsource to the filtered dataview

1752734
int	chars
int getgroovyname int grooovyid chars pgroovyname int bufsize

1752734
int	chars
basically you pass it an id int a chars buffer with memory pre-allocated and the size of the buffer passed in

1752738
vim	emacs
so i would like to learn how it can be done effectively using may be emacs or vim + other tools

1752767
post	get
i can get the .lic file to copy to the regular project s bin directory with either a post build or build action but the actual test itself doesnt seem to be running from there but from a constantly changing out directory

1752793
accessor	properties
even tho c++ doesnt support properties accessor by simulating them we dont only make readibility better or provide encapsulation but we provide control mechanism to set a value to a variable or we get calculated value for a variable

1752795
post	get
i have this old perl script that is supposed to act as a proxy of sorts between http-based clients and non-http java server the client post some data to this perl script and the script would in turn call the java server get the response and return it to the client

1752795
post	get
judging by the description spawn_proc_prog from apache2 subprocess could do the trick pass the post data as stdin to the child process and get back the child process output but it doesn t seem to work if i run anything but another perl script

1752804
fink	macports
if you ve installed another version of libxml2 make sure your path is set such that its xml2-config will be found first by the imagemagick configure script so ensuring most likely one of usr local bin opt local bin macports or sw bin fink comes before usr bin on path

1752816
many-to-many	one-to-many
i m bulding a user and contat management and i ve managed to get a working many-to-many relationship between contact and group pojo in my environment with either hsql or mysql 5.0.51 but not on a local test server .because of that i ld like t try the double one-to-many association so there are few things i would like to ask about that mapping with the introduction of an intermediary model

1752854
mstest	typemock
the way i have gotten the tests to run via partcover is to make partcover run the typemock runner which in turn runs mstest

1752854
folder	directory
working directory a folder that already exists

1752879
postgresql	mysql
i owe you a half option if you re not bound to mysql postgresql could offer a interesting alternative table inheritance

1752879
postgresql	mysql
one final word about mysql and postgresql

1752879
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a database that imho in most aspects is today superior to mysql is just not that famous

1752879
postgresql	mysql
and no i m not just a postgresql fanboy i m a senior mysql user i started using mysql with a version 2.something i introduced it more than 10 years ago in the company i still work for and made it the default database and today i don t allow any new development i can decide to be based on mysql

1752885
perforce	svn
i have a project with 250000+ lines of codes 10 dylibs helpfile all in an svn perforce etc

1752919
width	height
additionally it shows you the width and height of the innermost box and the x and y offset of the element relative to its parent

1752967
mockups	balsamiq
i ve also used balsamiq mockups in recent project to whip together web app screens and the screen mockups have formed a vital part of the project specs -- very quick to produce and they convey a lot of information about how the screens should work that is quite hard to convey in a text document

1752995
folder	directory
the safest way if it is an option you are using windows auth is to make it a non-issue by using active directory rights on the folder so it doesn t matter if the user attempts to access a directory that is not valid

1753002
children	parent
your problem stems from the fact that both your parent and children are of the same type

1753002
children	parent
if you had a parent task that had a collection of children and the children were of a different type than the parent then you would be cool

1753002
children	parent
because you could provide a different template for the children than the parent

1753023
pop-up	dialog
for each part i want to add a small button pop-up as dialog which will convert that part to a dialog on-demand and then when closing the dialog to return back to the form with the new inputs

1753023
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up parts works fine - the sub-form converts into a dialog

1753028
hash	salt
few days back i saw an sample application where the hash and the salt was generated on the client system whenever a new user was created and then the salt password and the hash is transmitted to the server where they are stored in sql server

1753040
hash	salt
storing the salt unencrypted in the database next to the hash passwords is not a problem

1753040
hash	salt
when you have a salt and hash data the best you can do to reverse it is brute force provided that the hash function is cryptographically secure

1753041
width	height
letters tend to use a constant ratio between width and height

1753041
width	height
with two lines you can calculate the height of the complete letter and thus get a good estimation of the matching width

1753082
range	max	range	min	min	max
with the first example showing that i is between the min and max elements and the second example being that i falls outside the range between the elements

1753090
datalist	repeater
is it easier to do this with a repeater or a datalist

1753093
min	max
if i is less than min and more than max

1753093
min	max
if min is less than is and is is less than max

1753139
width	height
you are right span does not honour width and height however it does sort of honour padding

1753177
cas	shibboleth
with saml you can communicate between the major single sign on ss0 technologies like cas openid shibboleth ad ldap.

1753195
post	get
is it ok to have a get and post method

1753206
jlist	jtextfield	jlist	jlabel	jtextfield	jlabel
a time-tracking program can start out extremely simple a simple jtextfield a jlist some jlabel and a button or two but you can literally add hundreds of features to familiarize yourself with different parts of the api

1753266
post	get
i don t believe the original intention of the http spec was to confine all data editing submissions to post and all retrievals to get

1753271
boost	allocator
and trace the allocator you ll find that one object a boost signals detail signal_base_impl iterator allocated at line 75 of boost lib signals src signal_base.cpp is not freed up

1753299
svm	kernlab
i am trying to use the kernlab r package to do support vector machines svm

1753334
put	get
the udp server will then get this file a video put it into a datagram and send it

1753339
pop-up	dialog
once a user clicks on the link an inline pop-up dialog with an image for the id from the database is displayed next to the id link which was clicked

1753364
opera	firefox
ie 6 7 firefox opera and safari.

1753482
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
then use sqldependency or sqlcachedependency to cache the data in a way that it can be updated on multiple servers if the db changes

1753503
post	get
this means that if a post response includes cache-control or expires or given a strict reading of section 13 even a validator like last-modified or etag the response can be used to satisfy future get requests

1753522
scrollable	panels
how can i add asp panels inside calendar1_dayrender e.cells so that when there are many items in the lists it would make that cells scrollable instead of stretching the calendar

1753554
post	get
here s a post to get your started on the dependency injection pattern

1753554
post	get
here s a so post on mocking frameworks to get you started

1753582
post	get
edit sorry realized you were using get not post

1753590
cvs	svn
then just share the models via cvs svn and manage them separately

1753604
profiling	instrumentation
if for some reason you can t such as there is no profiling available in the apache modpython that is running your django your best bet might be simply to instrumentation your program with logging

1753612
post	get
if you already have the post object to get the number of comments you just need to call comments.count

1753644
post	get
just if you implement a way to validate the swf itself at the site like using get or post variables

1753644
post	get
the get or post validation will grant access to the file to the right request so if someone understands the scheme it ll be able to request the file from any browser

1753648
postgresql	mysql
for compatibility with postgresql mysql also supports the limit row_count offset offset syntax

1753650
post	get
in your scenario you could also just choose to make your form s method get instead of post

1753723
opera	safari
it looks aligned equally in moz opera ie8 safari but not in ie7

1753739
jobs	cron
also when there s schedule changes just create too many cron jobs that cover the regular times and the different times then have the job check to see if this is a valid time to start

1753744
width	height
use grid as the content to window and put everything inside that and don t put height and width with your controls

1753744
width	height
for your grid also give columdefinition s width and rowdefinition s height in proportion not in exact term

1753776
portrait	landscape
eg- i am saving photo from the photo library into the application but how can i know that photo in landscape mode or portrait mode

1753801
width	height
when working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo height

1753801
width	height
when working with a portrait photo the height is greater than the width

1753808
cvs	svn
note i am asking from your general perspective meaning you should not try to associate this with your preferred svn cvs tools or programming languages but rather think of it as something that should can be applied to any tools and programming languages

1753818
haskell	scheme
as to your specific question i generally prefer embedded domain specific languages that is dsl-like constructs embedded in a host language such as ruby with its object oriented metaprogramming scheme with its macros or haskell combinator libraries since it give you the full power of the host language for free

1753850
integer	unsigned
the negative value for pointer value might appear because of incorrect interpretation of unsigned integer as a signed integer

1753851
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
i ve used cvs svn bazaar and git in that order of introduction and i d have to say for students that svn is the way to go

1753884
base	fractions
run from the command line supplying the base number first then the series of fractions presented as numbers with space separation like the following

1753897
white-box	assertions
i haven t found exactly what i m looking for so it seems to me that i should either rely on mox as i ve done often in the past which basically means mocking each subsystem used in a given test and setting up all expectations c strong but lots of work each time and very sensitive to the tested-code s internals very white-box y or rolling my own simulation of each subsystem and doing assertions on the simulated subsystems states as part of the unit tests

1753920
ienumerable	icollection
this works fine if the ienumerable list is the same type as the icollection i m trying to add it to

1753964
folder	directory
could not be found the web-site only builds if i set the directory as pictures which is where the pictures are and pictures is in the same folder as default.aspx which the above code is at

1754007
free	malloc
be careful not to call malloc free new delete inside your tracker or be able to detect the recursion etc -

1754007
put	get
and i forgot if you put your tracker in a dll you will probably need to loadlibrary or dlopen etc yourself to up your reference count so that you don t get removed from memory prematurely

1754080
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i m not sure how accurate the msdn documentation is on sortedlist and sorteddictionary

1754080
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
but if the sortedlist uses a binary search tree why would it be much slower on additions than sorteddictionary

1754080
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
each test operates on a sortedlist sorteddictionary containing 10 000 int32 keys

1754080
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
however you would expect the memory usage of a sortedlist to be equal or greater than or at least equal to a sorteddictionary

1754192
uilabel	uitextview
if it is not exactly what you want you can customize your cell by adding uitextview or maybe several uilabel to it as a subview s

1754219
post	get
you would normally do a post or get from the flash movie using the url of a php or whatever page you have on your server

1754219
post	get
the server page would then process the parameters in the post or get

1754237
post	get
anyway i m trying to get an infinite loop going with divs scrolling through a window the other post has an image and the code below works

1754237
put	get
when i put them together i just get continuous motion right-to-left until the boxes leave the screen so it must be how they interact

1754438
ubuntu	linux
new information it works fine on winxp exact same code so the intermittent delay is only happening on my linux box ubuntu 9.10

1754460
powerpc	i386
values are i386 x86_64 powerpc and

1754517
mouseout	mouseleave
in addition to btelles response you ll also need to change the mouseout event for a mouseleave event

1754547
jlist	jtable	jlist	jtree	jtree	jtable
swing will not clear the selection of a jtree or jtable jlist etc when it loses focus

1754584
put	get
check that totalrecvd actually is the index where you want to write that 0 and that when you create your rcvmsg you re adding the 0 index to it msgbuffer + totalrcvd looks dogdy when you ve put your end-of-string marker on the totalrcvd byte usually you get a string between start end-1 indexes you write

1754588
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to define a callback which is triggered when these notifications are added to the console like with keyboard mouse input

1754591
dictionary	map
a sorted map dictionary with the value as the key and the id as the value would allow you to quickly find the upper bound of the range you are in and then look up the id for that range

1754603
unix	aix
i need all the unix commands which are specific to aix machines

1754603
unix	aix
for for unix top is equivalent to topas in aix

1754609
opera	firefox
here s my code you will need firefox or opera -- as you can see line hits left side sooner and that s my problem

1754635
for-loop	arrays
within the for-loop we are looping through an arrays of uint s

1754637
unix	aix
the site here has a list of useful unix commands that can be used on aix machines

1754690
nstimer	nsoperation
i don t think you can schedule a nstimer from within a nsoperation

1754704
put	get
having a good portion of the last year of my life put into this i d really like to be able to make progress finally on the front end so that i can finally get some utility out of all my effort beyond just writing queries in ssms

1754759
sorting	filtering
this means filtering and sorting of non-text values numeric date time etc will become extremely cumbersome

hash	md5
however the probability of two randomly chosen strings having the same md5 hash is very low

md5 is a hash function â so yes two different strings can absolutely generate colliding md5 codes

1756047

1759117
hash	salt
in my limited experience you would take the user s inputted password hash it with a salt the same salt used to hash the stored password and compare with the stored hash value

1759130
calloc	malloc
you weren t checking the return value of malloc now calloc but same rules apply

1759130
calloc	malloc
if you don t want to use calloc for this reason here s a version that does the same thing with malloc

1759166
post	get
if you are asking how do you post and reuse the same view as a get and run javascript only on the post than the short answer is you don t

1759172
post	get
i ll try to post a working example of my problem if i can get it to fail using a small set of simple code

1759236
overwrite	preserve
all the databases are on the same server and i don t need to preserve the old data just overwrite it

1759249
pop-up	dialog
my guess here is that your custom action isn t calling out correctly to the msiexec.exe and thus causing the help options dialog to pop-up

1759292
ubuntu	debian
the debian guide can be quite useful when it comes to ubuntu

1759305
daemons	launchd
i have a daemons running on dbus that offers service for launchd applications

1759325
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview that has a datasourceid pointing to an objectdatasource

1759337
int	double
the string 1 for example would be parsable to byte sbyte int uint long ulong float double and decimal

1759408
for-loop	loops
then you nest an identical for-loop inside the first loops which is currently also completely wrong iterating over the filename once again

1759416
width	height
is it possible to create a 1 pixel shadow image say shadow.jpg in photoshop and then with php repeat that shadow just beneath or on the side of an image for whatever the width or height of the target image is

1759481
inherited	subclassing
then you can annotate the base type with that annotation then all subclassing would inherited the annotation as well

1759663
sorting	filtering
easy to skin and customise with some great features out of the box like filtering sorting and ajax support

1759711
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you don t configure your upgrade to uninstall previous versioning of your product then the component will not be removed although its files may be overwritten

1759719
button	checkbox
in advanced data datagrid with columns checkbox textfield textarea button radiobutton

1759739
hide	show
i know i can find the behavior and call show and hide

1759776
vim	textmate	textmate	radrails
unless radrails three is light-years ahead of the latest release though you ll be missing out on a lot of very handy advantages of using a more community-supported solution such as vim or textmate

1759788
uploadify	swfupload
i tried uploadify and swfupload and it was quite easy getting them to work

1759820
client-side	server-side
oop consistency seamless data exchange and native object representation between server-side and client-side modules that is given a function on the client-side clientfoo and a function on the server-side serverfoo one should be able to pass an object obj of any type t without requiring any marshalling

1759820
client-side	server-side
basically it should be entirely irrelevant whether a given class or a given instance resides on the client-side or the server-side

1759838
accessor	properties
the get accessor problem was only with the early version of the interop library and i think a common misunderstanding of the usage of the range object and the range properties in c#

1759842
post	get
this blog post from scott guthrie has links to several resources to help you get started

1759880
ready	each
i understand what s going on in the program but i m ready to start extending it and i expect to be sending a reasonable variety of packet types each represented as a struct

1759898
put	get
edit re your last example if you have only 1 consumer you will never get rid of the object on the queue - unless it s updated in the mean time - in which case you d better be very very careful about thread safety and probably shouldn t have put the item in the queue anyway

1759945
unsigned	short
you could try converting it to an unsigned short and then print just the last four hex digits

1759985
inherited	properties
but by this way it inherited all the public methods and properties of usercontrol

1760030
fadein	fadeout
ok after reading a little more about the animate fadein fadeout and fadeto i understood that i don t need to use filter alpha for ie as jquery already supports it

1760030
fadein	fadeout
knowing that i made a test using fadein and fadeout now online and it works but there is a problem if you hover in and out several times it continues repeating the animation

1760035
getter	setter
not directly you need a pair getter setter with an addlistener removelistener interface of some sort.

1760040
getter	setter
first use setter and getter like so

1760076
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the most recent beta of firebug and have the most recent non-beta versioning of firefox and still no dice

1760132
getter	setter
still on luke s track i propose now a simple way to add encapsulated fields and the respective getter setter to objects by the means of a simple function call

1760150
put	get
the catch is that i get it all as one long string and it s not always immediately obvious where to put the linebreaks

1760158
fgets	fgetc	fgets	getchar	getchar	fgetc
the function getchar or some other like fgetc fgets recieve a enter as a charactor

1760178
fgets	fgetc
like fgetc fgets recieve a enter as

1760199
google-chrome	firefox
but oddly in firefox google-chrome it isn t quite the same as demonstrated by his example with stateful expressions that are used multiple times

1760254
maven	pom.xml
i just updated the maven plugin to work with 2.2.0 -- the updated pom.xml are attached to the code review bug

1760276
pop-up	dialog
if you want to avoid the risk of a pop-up blocker consider instead using the iframe within an inline dialog within your application

1760283
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following snippet has been tested on firefox safari and google-chrome open the console and move between tabs back and forth

1760301
getter	setter
like any good class it has both data and behavior and i don t mean getter and setter

1760373
pop-up	dialog
4 then right click on the selection and go to source- clean up... or any other source submenu item like organize imports and the dialog that pop-up will tell you how many source files it is about to change

1760426
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
you could accept an ienumerable t parameter and internally check if it is in fact an icollection t or ilist t and optimize accordingly

1760438
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
if you have a look at how linq extension methods are implemented using reflector you can see that a few extension methods on ienumerable t such as count attempt to cast the sequence to an icollection t or an ilist t to optimize the operation for example using the icollection t .count property instead of iterating through an ienumerable t and counting the elements

1760438
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
so your best bet is most likely to accept an ienumerable t and then do this kind of optimizations if icollection t or ilist t are available

1760470
ienumerable	ilist
with three versions as you propose you lose the efficiency benefit if someone passes you a runtime ilist t that the compiler statically considers an ienumerable t

1760474
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
since ilist t inherits from icollection t and ienumerable t and icollection t inherits from ienumerable t your only concern would be performance in ienumerable t types

1760474
ienumerable	ilist
i just see no reason to overload the function in that way providing different signatures to achieve exactly the same result and accepting exactly the same types as parameter no matter if you have an ienumerable t or ilist t you would be able to pass it to any of the three overloads

1760506
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari and ie treat literals as per es4 but firefox and google-chrome appear to treat them as per es3

1760590
for-loop	loops
you re also looking for-loop joins in your batches so if you still get hash joins then either force loops joins or reduce the batch size

1760591
int	chars
i don t know if you re still doing chars int but i ran into the same error and my problem was that i tried to make a length 11 vector but fusion_max_vector_size was 10

1760603
public	protected
the decision of making these variables and methods of the base class private protected or even public is a case by case issue

1760603
public	protected
for example the base class could have a public method a protected method and or data and a few private methods

1760623
vcproj	csproj
i make sln files for each sub-module a few vcproj csproj which are related so that i don t have to open a big large sln file to view the project

1760623
vcproj	csproj
i avoid the problem by just splitting the vcproj csproj into different sln s and use a build server to build

1760627
postgresql	mysql
i suspect it s because of differences in how postgresql handles group by clauses compared to mysql

1760643
width	height
but am unsure of the syntax for changing more than one visibility width height and font-color

1760644
stdout	stderr
in case the exception bubbles back all the to the main function and if said exception isn t caught there either a default handler deals with it typically by printing out the exception to stderr stdout and halting

1760644
try-catch	exception-handling
the way this exception-handling could be caught would be with a try-catch construct as in

1760646
uitableview	uisearchbar
i create a uitableview in the initialisation and want to add it to the sub view when - void searchbartextdidbeginediting uisearchbar searchbar

1760658
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
it 1 uses mergesort rather than quicksort or heapsort for two reasons

1760658
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort is a stable sort and typically the efficient quicksort implementations are not

1760702
getter	setter
codedom which is basically generated and then compiled code nhibernate generates wrapper getter setter code for your entities and then compiles it

1760706
ubuntu	linux
i have few years of exp on linux mainly ubuntu dual-boot

1760753
stdout	stderr
alternatively and if you want to only handle stdout stderr which is common run your program through the standard unix tee program or the equivalent on your platform either by doing it yourself when invoking the program or within the program by forking setting up the streams as appropriate etc

1760783
children	parent
in the example you give you have a parent of object type information with a collection of children object type detail and the collection of detail children on the parent is called child

1760783
children	parent
so we do a template for the children and then one for the parent

1760783
children	parent
because the parent and child are of a different object type the tree view will grab the parent template which has an items source and when it comes to draw the children it will use th child data template

1760815
children	parent
what we d like to do is have a parent web app which is shared by all children web apps

1760827
firefox	safari
if it creates the same or similar markup in all browsers i tested this in safari and firefox then this should do what you want

1760839
hex	binary
in your message handler callback you don t want probably don t want to continue to manipulate the data as raw binary hex data but instead interpret the information in a meaningful fashion according to the message type

1760861
public	protected
personally i like to have public at top protected and then private

1760867
public	protected
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods

1760869
public	protected
public before protected before private

1760880
public	protected
the code should flow and using a rather artificial ordering based on accessibility public private protected etc

1760888
put	get
assuming i have this class what do i put in the dopost method to get either the file path or the actual file contents

1760923
disk	ram
this way even if the write to disk stalls the program can continue to read incoming data and buffer it in ram

1760924
atomic	interlocked
the atomic ie memory manipulated with the interlocked functions doing stuff like lock cmpxchg is only atomic with respect to itself not other memory

1760925
public	protected
i generally agree with the public protected private order as well as the static data member data member functions order

1760925
getter	setter
though i sometimes group like members getter setter i generally prefer listing members within a group alphabetically so that they can be located more easily

1760954
getter	setter
you don t need to use synthesize keyword in the implementation file if you provide appropriate getter setter

1760954
getter	setter
or you can use either synthesize foo to inform the compiler to generate getter setter for you or dynamic to inform the compiler that these methods will be available at runtime - both in the implementation file

1761003
ascx	scriptmanager
i was creating a custom ascx control and wanted to be able to not worry about whether or not the calling page had the scriptmanager declared

1761024
dreamweaver	aptana
another free tool remember dreamweaver will cost you at least a few hundred unless you steal it is aptana ide

1761039
put	get
go back to when i learned html 4 from a book and practice incidentally the common place thing was html tables css was new and had widely disparate implementations and i spent more time trying to figure out how to get around browser bugs than i did most other things put together and that was less than a decade ago

1761069
ready	each
so you re going to have to create a buffer string to append each number to until you re ready to print the line

1761080
pull	push
we re using gitosis where devs push to and pull from

1761101
rss	feed
want to use an rss feed as a data source

1761105
installation	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade my ubuntu installation from jaunty to karmic

1761129
gif	png
create an .htaccess file with a mod_rewrite for all image extensions png jpg gif

1761130
profiler	yourkit
yourkit is probably the best java profiler in the market right now

1761132
implements	extends
more than getting something to just work - your friend s point a well designed oo design is easier to understand to follow to expand to extends and to implements

1761143
converter	multibinding
this is extremely simple to do except for the c# parser just implement providevalue by constructing a multibinding that uses a converter and builds the appropriate validation structure

1761153
put	get
if you get this to work however you solve it put it on your resume

1761192
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my xcode to the latest versioning today my iphonesdk os was 2.2.1 previously

1761192
installation	upgrade
i was alerted during installation i can upgrade xcode but iphonesdk cannot be upgrade

1761201
hmac	pbkdf2
pbkdf2 with hmac sha1

1761214
put	get
you definitely need to find a way to get a primary key onto your tables - if you don t have anything that you can use per se add a column id of type int identity 1 1 to it and put the primary key on that column

1761228
pbkdf2	hash
pbkdf2 requires a pseudo-random function and in this case a message authentication code based on the sha-1 hash is used mdash

1761237
websphere	ibm
i have the server side of ibm s websphere mq version 6 on a virtual machine running windows server 2003 sitting on a vista desktop

1761259
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
but my software doesnot works good or ubuntu and debian linux because they want .deb file

1761273
min	max
then use rand with a min and max corresponding to your array keys to select an item from the array

1761278
width	height
use the height and width properties of your forms

1761278
width	height
where formwidthpixels and formheightpixels are the width and height in pixels you want your forms

1761312
principalcontext	directoryentry
i would like the code to be using directoryentry and not principalcontext if possible as i m not sure if my app will be using .net 3.5 on all the servers

1761360
min	max
in the options dictionary i can pass the max size of the thumnail can be created but is there any way to have min size for the same.

1761380
xna	spritebatch
yes you can load a shader file hlsl up to and including shader model 3 in xna and call spritebatch with using it

1761400
awk	ksh
how can i ftp all the files in all modules into the corresponding module in second server b by any of scripting languages like awk perl shell ksh using ftp

1761404
ubuntu	debian
you can also use debootstrap package to create debian ubuntu chroot and build .deb package inside it

1761405
post	get
it also includes being comfortable with http get and post restfulness and how to persist information between page loads cookies sessions url params

1761406
vsto	add-in
i ve read almost all of the vsto doco on msdn particularly the application add-in architecture and vsto runtime overview as well as various other articles and discussions on the topic

1761421
versioning	upgrade
let s assume that i m doing some sort of nontrivial change to my database which requires custom work to upgrade from versioning a to b

1761421
versioning	upgrade
the first logical obstacle would of course be that the deployment utility would not know whether any such logic needs to be updated - i d assume i could provide the logic for this as well check a versioning table and if the latest versioning is 5.0 execute this upgrade later adding a new versioning row

1761448
post	get
edit this post assumes you already do obvious things like take advantage of tail recursion to get rid of the unnecessary call overhead

1761448
quicksort	shellsort
for additional performance you should always switch your quicksort to shellsort for small list segments - i ve seen lengths from 15-100 chosen as the cutoff

1761456
chunked	transfer-encoding
the problem i m having is that depending on client the response may be recived as seen through fiddler as chunked transfer-encoding

1761485
filtering	grouping
this way you grouping it twice but filtering it only once

1761510
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked is defined for http 1.1

1761520
gif	png
these bytes will be invisible in your text editor but server will send these few extra bytes to the browser before the jpeg gif png data

1761611
disk	ram
is there similar support for managing the hard disk drive and the ram spinning down the hdd lowering ram frequency or anything that might result in power consumption reduction

1761619
hash	md5
now that i know there is a network hop between the files i would say just use an md5 hash and be done with it

1761637
firefox	safari
this is happening in firefox and ie but not safari

1761650
submit	submission
instead of submission data by row you submit them by whole column

1761678
disk	ram
i guess you could switch off ram areas which aren t in use but current oss use free ram as a hard disk cache so you won t find much free ram that can be switched off

1761696
getter	setter
i don t have to remember to initialize in the base class on every new property getter setter

1761709
disk	ram
unless you re using a really complicated and or slow hash loading the data from the disk is going to take much longer than computing the hash unless you use ram disk or top-end ssds

1761776
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr respectively

1761780
stdout	stderr
0 1 and 2 are stdin stdout and stderr respectively

1761797
qmail	exim
the easier route is to run a local mailserver such as postfix exim or qmail and set it up to send mail through a remote server

1761800
lisp	prolog	erlang	lisp
i d suggest lisp for functional programming for historical reasons or erlang for a more commercial language and prolog for declarative a.k.a logical programming

1761800
imperative	declarative
there are a lot of programmers that keep getting surprised by the possibilities of functional programming ability to prove a function right easy parallel integration no side effects etc as well as the possibilities of declarative programming for certain task that are just now well suited for imperative programming patter recognition for example or rule based systems

1761807
haskell	scheme	erlang	scheme
functional paradigm - scheme haskell erlang f#

1761814
xslt	xquery
get used to functional programming specialized languages such as xslt xquery t-sql pl sql ocl etc

1761848
post	get
how to get this piece of info ex post especially years later is most likely not possible

1761869
post	get
when i check the stream it is all fine and is completely loaded in post request but then i get following error

1761893
folder	directory
you can give the directory writer access or change the destination path to one user folder like the my documents or an app directory

1761900
getter	setter
in this case don t you have to map every other classes and check the setter getter especially for boolean

1761927
width	height
make a div height 100 of the page width 100 of the page

1761930
websphere	ibm
we are currently building an application that needs to communicate to some ibm websphere queues

1761935
width	height
from what i understand what you want is to change the width height of the component at run-time

1761935
width	height
in this case you need to give an id to the hbox add a script block and call the width height setter on your block

1761942
wordpress	joomla
me too don t get any advantages for joomla it s big system and it just as good as wordpress for regular projects just wordpress is much simplier

1761987
post	put
i posted a similar post to this before but since then i have done some research and thought i d put this one out again to see if anyone maybe has any thoughts on my problem

1762029
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
formats like png bmp jpeg tiff and

1762045
hide	show
here s a simplified version that show the first two lines and hide the rest

1762070
opensuse	linux
can anyone give me the right direction for this as i am not able to find the declaration of eperm in either pthread.h or errno.h on opensuse linux

1762071
getter	setter
can we create a class with getter and setter and an array of objects of this class using javascript

1762081
equals	gethashcode
i believe you need to override gethashcode and equals in your entities

1762086
inherited	properties
only the controls that inherited from webcontrol will have a enabled properties

1762175
public	protected
we can redeclare the public and protected method but not private

1762182
wstring	wofstream	wstring	wifstream	wifstream	wofstream
use wstring instead of string wifstream instead of ifstream wofstream wcout etc

1762196
width	height
first you can use the static properties fullprimaryscreenheight fullprimaryscreenwidth of the system.windows.systemparameters class to get the height and width of the screen

1762196
width	height
then you can set the top and left properties of your popup control using the width and height before showing it

1762260
cpu	irq
so if your cpu gets interrupted to service hardware irq or if another cpu is reading the same memory it doesn t affect the result and these other operations will observe it as either completed or not started

1762313
put	get
put the timer out of the update-panel and get a trigger in the panel - win

1762325
moq	typemock
without using a mocking framework such as moq typemock rhinomocks that can verify your expectations i would look at parsing the stack trace

1762352
agile	sprint
with agile including scrum you have fixed schedule iterations or sprint and fixed quality level definition of done

1762399
innodb	myisam
when i restored the database i found that the table engine has changed to myisam whereas they were set to innodb

1762445
innodb	myisam
since innodb wasn t working it fell back to the myisam storage engine which doesn t support integrity constraints like foreign keys

1762445
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine

1762445
innodb	myisam
then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1762453
post	get
a blog post that helped get me this far

1762498
int	double
then have them see has passing int or double or whatever still allows it to work

1762498
int	double
again experiment with variations - will the template allow them to pass an int and a double or will it complain

1762498
int	double
from there you can have them pass in arrays of whatever type int double etc and have it sort the array from highest to lowest again encouraging experimentation

1762588
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
so i m thinking of using an md5 hash of the relevant data and a security salt hard coded into the app

awt	swing
but before you do that read what awt and swing are what is lightweight heavyweight paint update repaint and how layouts work

1762762
ant	maven
if you can access the tomcat manager application remotely then you can use the tomcat ant tasks or tomcat maven plugin to handle this

1762762
ant	maven
using either ant or maven also gives you the advantage of being able to deploy from outside of eclipse

1762762
ant	maven
my personal choice is maven but ant is equally capable in this area

1762763
post	get
i have tried both suggestions in the post but i just can t seem to get it to run the build error seems to skip the initializeworkspace

rss	feed
i need to download a web page and to see if the page contains any rss feed

1762874
rss	feed
i know how to download a web page to string using http apis in c# but how can i determine the http page string contains any rss feed or not

1762891
ant	maven
if you don t like the plugin then you could use build tools like ant or maven they have good support for remote deployment trough the manager application as pointed out by chris

1762891
maven	cargo
i d just add cargo to the list tomcat remote deployment is only available with the maven 2 plugin though

1762914
hide	show
is it possible to use data-binding expressions directly in markup to show hide content

edit in this example objects implements sortedmap which extends map are accepted too so in your case you could create a baseinterface and extends that in the interfaces like acceptedinterface extends baseinterface you want to be accepted by your .register baseinterface arg method

1763259
ant	maven
not an answer to your question but an alternative to your approach wouldn t it be possible to use a second builder based on ant or maven that you use on demand to create the final application or library

1763284
sorting	grouping
however if you want to have features like sorting grouping drag-drop re-ordering of columns hiding and adding columns at run-time ajax support etc

1763292
in-house-distribution	enterprise
you can also use in-house-distribution with the enterprise program see here

1763304
3des	aes
older versions of the specification mentioned aes and 3des by name but i believe newer versions just specify strong encryption

1763326
put	get
to get this to work with xval you would need to put the dataannotations on the view model properties

1763328
hash	salt
instead hash it according to standard best practices with salt etc

1763388
int	chars
i would like to replace the chars at certain indices with if the int corresponding to that index meets some criteria

1763490
jquery	jqmodal	jqmodal	blockui
you could try blockui or jqmodal for jquery both very cool and easy to use

1763582
spaces	linefeed
s - matches whitespace spaces tab carriage return linefeed

1763603
firefox	safari
he mentioned that drag-and-drop support is going to be difficult because of the way safari firefox can t remember which one is used to run out-of-browser on the mac

1763655
hide	show
so i create two differents modelchoicefield one for politic and one for economic and i use hide show effects of jquery in my template like you say kugel

1763658
folder	directory
basically i want to store the just folder path and not the file so that when i display the path using hyperlink the user can open the directory

1763679
mouse	keyboard
i want to be able to keep keyboard focus set on the textbox irrespective of whether or not the auto-completion popup is open so that a user can continue typing whilst simultaneously using up down controls or the mouse to select elements in the popup to autocomplete the text

1763701
implements	extends
if you need it you could write an interface and extends observablecollection to implements it

1763791
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
you can use a bufferedreader to read the stream into a stringbuilder in a loop and then get the full contents from the stringbuilder

1763858
width	height
3 and 2 column full screen width height layouts css

1763968
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
use sqldependency sqlcachedependency when you can but don t over-use

1764042
spaces	linefeed
if you want just white-space spaces tab carriage-return linefeed you can replace the pattern with

1764089
svm	k-means
as you have a working k-means implementation you could try one of the many variants to see if they yeild better results k-means++ perhaps seeing as you mentioned svm

1764115
jlabel	jlayeredpane
i am trying to add a jlayeredpane to a jpanel and then add an image jlabel icon and a button to the jlayeredpane but neither show up

1764185
stdout	stderr
it has the drawback that lines may not be displayed in order because stderr goes directly to the console while stdout first goes through an additional process

1764209
google-chrome	firefox
basically that means that none of javasript based rich text editors would work in a jquery dialog in firefox and btw google-chrome as well - thats a big bad issue i have tried two so far and that s how i started looking into this issue

1764237
visitor	crtp
you can reduce the amount of boilerplate copy-paste by implementing visitor with crtp

1764239
getter	setter
each member variable has a public getter and a setter function

1764239
getter	setter
functions which are passed an instance of bar will want to access m_foo so that they can call its getter and setter functions

1764239
getter	setter
do i have any other options though other than replicating every single getter and setter in bar

1764270
getter	setter
it already is conceptually public anyway if you give bar getter and setter like you describe

1764270
getter	setter
this applies similarly to any getter setter pair where the getter returns a reference

1764363
post	get
also if you post your table structure you should get half a dozen examples within five minutes

1764364
post	get
in case this doesn t get answered properly i found an alternative to using findname documented in the post here

1764374
tinyint	varchar
is there a way in t-sql to convert a tinyint to varchar with custom number formatting

1764391
int	boolean
a boolean as resulting from comparisons such as is also an int with a value of 0 for false 1 for true so arithmetic such as summation works just fine

1764421
getter	setter
if you now anyway have such large classes with getter and setter i don t think its a problem to return the reference to that object after all there is still a layer in between - you essentially still have control over what is set get in foo

1764424
children	parent
this is not a real answer but since so many people seem to believe that win32 forbids creating children in other threads than the parent i feel obliged to post a demonstration to the contrary

1764428
getter	setter
each member variable has a public getter and a setter function

1764431
getter	setter
you can create forwarding getter and setter for every single getter or setter in foo

1764431
getter	setter
you can make the foo instances public or you can create a getter and setter for foo

1764431
getter	setter
this leads to variables that are actually private member variables of their classes and eliminates the need for setter and getter

1764492
switching	screens
have tried switching off the screens lock in settings but it ll still kick in after a springboard restart

1764540
firefox	safari
it works in all commonly found browsers ie6+ firefox safari etc..... and it seems the least dirty of all the possible techniques

1764544
getter	setter
getter and setter must match between flex and java value objects

1764555
button	checkbox
so as long as you re talking about normal button selects and checkbox i think this is normal

1764595
implements	extends
your other option other than using the html tags would be to extends the checkboxlist control and create your own custom control which implements a checkboxlist with embedded images

1764597
post	get
get post verbs among others

1764647
button	checkbox
check some checkbox and for it up date either a text for or a list box with the result on button click.

1764648
prepare	execute
prepare and execute the main string

1764671
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great in safari firefox google-chrome etc

1764709
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and indeed it does when i test it with the stand-alone flash player or all of these browsers firefox opera safari google-chrome flock.

1764714
vmware	esx
particularly if you are using one of the direct-on-the-metal vms like vmware esx

1764735
post	get
then there are post vs get requests which are similar but enough different to warrant a special dicussion

1764737
udp	tcp
a packet is a combination of the application layer data the transport layer header tcp or udp and the ip layer header the network layer takes the packet and turns it into a frame

1764737
udp	tcp
here are a few 25 for smtp 53 for dns udp for domain resolution and tcp for zone transfers and 80 for http

1764739
put	http-post
does it have a http-post interface so i can put my own interface on

1764797
base-class	subclassing
pushing all the methods from the subclassing to the base-class seems odd to say the least

1764797
inherited	subclassing
you would probably need to use virtual inherited for your subclassing to have only a single ibase base

1764823
hash	md5
the only way that md5 in mysql would return a different hash then the md5 function in php is if the character set in mysql is different

1764846
inherited	subclassing
if you don t want the final class sprite to implement all the methods you can implement that methods empty in the subclassing and then use virtual inherited

1764920
std	ostream
the only thing i can think of is that it s invalid to directly use a newly constructed std ostream like that ie without putting it into a variable

1764938
firefox	safari
it behaves as it should in firefox but ie and safari start the slide left animation way over in the middle of the page and then shift the menu back where it belongs

1764938
margin	height
currently i m hacking at the .animate function in jquery to first increase the height then apply a negative margin like so

1764944
mouse	keyboard
when programming with eclipse or any other application is it possible to map mouse left click to keyboard

1764957
bash	zsh
zsh has some funky filename expansion options compared to bash

1764958
int	double
replace all int double name declarations with var name number

1764958
int	double
replace all int double name declarations in function signatures with name number

1764958
int	boolean	int	double
replace all int double point boolean name declarations in function signatures with name type

1764976
std	ostream
i suspect that your std lib implementation implements for as a free function and has thus to fall back to some that s a member of std ostream

1764983
width	height
to start i would give all img elements a fixed width and height and display them inline and then look further

1765072
vsto	add-in
i m currently developping a bootstrapper to deploy one of my vsto add-in

1765111
put	get
so put it together and you get

1765119
internationalization	localization
my company uses an internally developed package to support internationalization localization

1765119
internationalization	localization
i ve looked at the wikipedia entry on internationalization and localization which includes links to other sites and related topics

1765120
hide	show
you could either monitor for an ajax event such as ajaxstart or ajaxcomplete and bind an action to that event such as show and hide

1765120
hide	show
the first method is probably better because you can monitor for global ajax events and hide show the loader image for any ajax event

1765132
for-loop	loops
that way you could use the usual looping for-loop do loops foreach

1765149
mouse	keyboard
if this is just for your local mac use you might look at the mac keyboard mouse config and see if you can change the mapping there

1765154
sfx	setup.exe
i built one a quick sfx that unpacked all setup files to a temp directory ran setup.exe and deleted all files

1765158
hide	show
then use this javascript to show this right before the ajax call fire s then hide it again after it is finished

1765175
free	malloc
you could then change all calls to malloc in the java vm to use your own special memory allocator which allocates from that free space

1765277
put	get
however if i put the using statement outside of the local namespace declaration i get the type or namespace name logpriority does not exist in the namespace project.logging .

1765280
decimal	ieee
float conforms to ieee 754 and approximates decimal representation

1765373
hide	show
the other onblur functions show hide child fields based on the value of the parent

1765440
ironruby	ironpython
vb.net supports both and i believe ironpython and ironruby do as well in a dynamic way

1765457
children	parent
the above function is supposed to take a starting parent id and recursively go through an array of children nodes really just an object with a unique id and a parent id sorting them so that each node comes directly after it s parent see below for sample data

1765490
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome opera it wipes out all content of the iframe - if you inspect it s dom with firebug you can see that iframe.body lost it s class some-class as well as all text and it s not in design mode

1765500
inherited	properties
in wpf and silverilght what are the rules for deciding if you inherited properties from the visual declarative or logical parent

1765508

0 is octal not decimal

1765599
uialertview	uiwindow
edit i haven t yet found a solution to the status bar issue but i ve noticed that a standard uialertview shows up in its own uiwindow and when i investigated that i found the windowlevel property

1765616
aho-corasick	rabin-karp
read up on the aho-corasick algorithm and the rabin-karp algorithm

1765712
spaces	delimiter
i prefer spaces delimiter since it works nice with unix text tools and with excel

1765714
uiview	subviews
point the subviews nib s owner a custom subclass of uiview

1765745
inherited	properties
and they all had to inherited from a base interface that provided some additional meta data on properties types and there were rules on what events could be triggered from properties setters

1765787
many-to-many	one-to-many	parent-child	one-to-many
i normally model one-to-many with a standard parent-child table setup and i normally model many-to-many with an association table between the 2 tables

1765787
many-to-many	one-to-many
model the database as many-to-many and have the application code limit the data to be one-to-many

1765859
subtraction	addition
in the applications you mentioned addition and subtraction and other needed math are commonly used standardized operations so overloading is not required

1765859
subtraction	addition
to provide a trivially absurd example it is perfectly feasible but not at all acceptable to define addition as subtraction

1765869
mouseup	mousedown
however once this panel is created on the windows form i want to handle mouse events such as mousedown and mouseup

1765874
width	height
notice that i had to set the width and height inte the constructor

1765892
subtract	add
so any time i need a slider to start at a value other than 0 or return a floating point number i have to set a max value that doesn t describe the true max value of the control and then divide and or add subtract the progress value when i read it

1765938
many-to-many	one-to-many
we had the same situation as you and went with a many-to-many design to store one-to-many data against a future date when we d need to store many to many

1765939
cpu	processors
eventually the reading completes and the dma system issues an interrupt to the processors more cpu cycles coming up at which point the os sees what data is ready returns to your program and puts your thread on ready queue -- end of the cpu time

1765990
subtraction	addition
if you operate with data structures where it is a common knowledge of what subtraction addition or logical operation should do then use an operator overload

1766002
children	parent
you ll presumably have to move tag s children to be children of tag s parent before you remove the tag -- is that what you mean

1766014
int	double
int get_values double param int sz

1766093
subtract	add
it also has numerous operator overloads so that i can add subtract a timespan to a calendar month and get a calendarmonth or subtract two calendarmonth structs to get a timespan.

1766150
int	chars
i have an int and a string that i need to store it as a chars the int must be in hex

1766158
cloudant	couchdb
at the moment cloudant and couch.io couchone iris couch are the only two companies offering couchdb hosting

1766161
for-loop	arrays
your old arrays items has only size elements so you need to change the upper limit in your for-loop to size from when you re copying the old elements to the new arrays

1766242
int	double
you could get a histogram of the program counter but it is practically useless unless you are doing something dumb like spending time in a bubble sort of a big array of int or double

1766283
versioning	upgrade
to fix it you have to get a 1.5 versioning of the library or upgrade your compiler to 1.6 i suggest the later

1766299
hide	show
hey i am trying to create a search field that will filter or show hide which ever is best the list elements based on what the user typed in and clicked the search button

1766299
hide	show
everything i tried does not work unfortunately and im unsure of the best approach for this like do i use show and hide or is there something better

1766327
button	checkbox	hide	show
i am trying to hide a checkbox and assign a default value of 1 such that the submit button only show

1766329
quicksort	heapsort
-sort array x you can use whatever method you want to sort array x -- quicksort heapsort anything stable.

1766341
client-side	server-side
client-side code javascript has no concept of server-side component boundaries like an asp.net app so there s no nice and easy native way for javascript to do that that i know of

1766354
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
for example create a dragbehavior that uses rx to combine the mousedown mousemove mouseup events with a command called to handle the new event

1766361
free	malloc
you need to allocate variable sized arrays on the heap using malloc and then free them when you are done with free

1766376
onfocus	onblur
i call the fieldhint via onfocus and call disablefieldhint via either onblur or onkeydown.

1766376
hide	show
so i think it s getting confused because onkeydown works initially to hide the hint but if peeps type then backspace everything then start typing again that onkeydown + value will be true and since fieldhint is a toggle it will show the fieldhint again while people are typing and everything is divided by zero - unless peeps then backspace again and start typing again then everything leaves upside down world - unless they backspace again and start typing again then it s all fubar and like opposite day for a few seconds

1766376
hide	show
i understand that i could just use style.display to show or hide the hint but the fades make me look much more like i know what i m doing which is obviously not true

1766403
sorting	grouping
in some cases where table data was uniquely identifying i used intermediate tables and frequency distribution sorting to eliminate things like uncommon names eliminated instances where a count with grouping by was less than or equal to 2

1766413
rpm	yum
yum uses rpm so the following command will list the contents of the installed package

1766416
rpm	yum
i don t know about yum but rpm -ql will list the files in a particular .rpm file

1766426
children	parent
because the grandparent class has a collection of parent and the parent a collection of children in your viewmodel you ll only need a collection of grandparrents in your viewmodel

1766471
children	parent
they also want to use exactly the same concept to represent 1 to many parent children relationships

1766473
onkeydown	onblur
i would set a flag when onkeydown is fired and clear it for onblur something like

1766478
try-catch	exception-handling
when this class is sorted using a custom sorter where the sorter accesses this null property and throws an exception-handling the exception-handling is considered unhandled even though there is a try-catch block around the sort method

rss	feed
right now i m using pyrss2gen to generate an rss document resyndicating a modification of an rss feed that was parsed with feedparser but i can t figure out how to add uncommon tags to the item

1766828
getter	setter
using methods for getter and setter and having a public new setter for the mutable class

1766852
getter	setter
then you don t need to care if your concrete implementation has a setter or not - your callers will only use the getter

1766861
width	height
i m trying to find the exact height and width of a browser s viewport but i suspect that either mozilla or ie is giving me the wrong number

1766861
google-chrome	safari
ideally i d like the solution to work with safari google-chrome other browsers as well

1766864
hide	show
i ve taken a look at the js that show hide the fieldset content but it doesn t look like there s anything in there to do what i d like it to so i m assuming i ll have to roll my own

after failing at this in safari i switched over to firefox and found it working perfectly

1767042
firefox	safari
again this works perfectly both locally and remotely in firefox and also works in safari remotely

1767044
inherited	properties	ilist	icollection
what is slightly inconsistent is that the generic ilist t interface has an isreadonly properties inherited from icollection t whose semantics are therefore different from the non-generic ilist.isreadonly

1767131
coldfusion	cfchart
i have a coldfusion page that uses jquery s ajax .load function to load in a new flash file that is generated by coldfusion s cfchart tag

width	height
when a naturally inline element has layout google for haslayout for more info on that it will act like an inline-block element and respect width height set on it

1767277
min	max
setting the min and max memory ensures the heap is continuos and the jvm doesn t have to attempt to grow the heap

1767289
folder	directory
of course within the trunk folder you should set up whatever normal directory hierarchy you would if you didn t use source-code control

1767344
toupper	uppercase
one thing to note you may want to use toupper to convert your string to uppercase so that you don t have to or it with lowercase guesses might make it a little faster

1767359

i looked into fxruby tkruby shoes and wxruby

1767534
post	get
your php script is expecting variables to be passed as an http post request but your xmlhttprequest is doing a get request

1767552
firefox	safari
safari and ie interpret multiple references to the same image and make a single request while firefox appears to make a unique request for each image linked to via css

1767562
post	put
we always need need to think smart if it comes to using repeated backgrounds if i was you i d create 2 seperate background images check the image at the bottom of this post i can t put it here as it breaks my code...

the above will hide the navigation bar when this view controller is pushed on top of the navigation stack and show the navigation bar when the view controller is popped off

1767717
opera	firefox
the only way to find out the location of a non-worker script is the non-standard error.filename which is only supported by firefox and opera

1767725

you can write plugins one for ie one for firefox one for opera

1767790
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview that is bound to an objectdatasource that is calling a business service object which returns a list of poco s

1767882
children	parent
pages can be children of another page specified by the parent property

1767882
children	parent
items that are children of another item are grouped behind the parent item and ordered by their tabindices optional

1767883
children	parent
that s either going to find a lot of nodes if the context node is the parent of your products element or none at all if the context node is a product element unless your product element have products children

1767891

put	get
i m using xval for validation and everything on that end works just can t get it to redisplay the prior page with the information the user put in displayed in the box

1768086
inherited	properties
by defining properties in the prototype properties of a constructor function and creating objects with the new keyword the newly created objects inherited the prototype of the constructor and thus have access to those methods

1768086
inherited	properties
so to reiterate inherited in ecmascript is achieved primarily by defining properties methods in the prototype of a function constructor example would be all the core constructors such as date number string which have methods defined in their respective prototype properties which allows you to use those methods when you create an instance with the new keyword

1768086
inherited	properties
and btw we didn t really have to create a new instance of the john object as pointed in the other answer you can define properties in the prototype after you create the initial constructor and all objects would inherited those prototypal properties even after they ve been created

1768222
pull	push
i was thinking of either using push or pull

1768222
pull	push
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

1768222
pull	push
but does any body know if the web chat messenger like gtalk yahoo etc use pull or push

1768227
children	parent
i think once a parent has a filter applied all of it s children essentially become directx surfaces internally

1768235

so as mentioned before really a get request is for requesting data no side effects while a post request is generally used for transmitting data back to the server to be stored with side effects

1768268
anjuta	kdevelop
my school computers have eclipse netbeans anjuta kdevelop and several other obscure ides and they work fine

1768270
put	get
the jsps are under webcontent i have put the config.txt file under the webcontent folder and tried to get to it with

1768283
post	get
sounds like a job for the prg post redirect get pattern because you don t want the users to refresh the page and have it submit again

1768300
centos	linux
i m using centos linux on a dedicated server with webmin as the cp yes i know

1768301
icmp	udp
as a bonus for connecting the udp socket you will not have to specify the destination address port on each send you will be able to discover unavailable destination port the icmp reply from the target will manifest as error on the next send instead of being dropped and your os will not have to implicitly connect and disconnect the udp socket on each send saving some cycles

1768350
fish	bash	fish	zsh	bash	zsh
i have spent sometime trying to pick one on net comparisons are for zsh vs bash and fish vs bash

1768350
fish	zsh
but i could not find any comparison for zsh vs fish

1768360
stdout	stderr
the shell app have both stdout and stderr connected to the same pty so when the terminal emulator reads from the pty for the shell app output it can no longer tell which was written to stdout and which to stderr

1768377
inherited	properties
i must assume you meant properties inherited because otherwise the question makes no sense you don t use class inherited from your visual logical parent - you simply have a reference to that parent

1768377
inherited	properties
inherited properties are inherited in the following priority order

1768405
fish	zsh
if you can t find any comparison between zsh vs fish then try them out yourself

1768411
hide	show
is there any way to hide remove its entry from window- show view menu

1768483
serializable	deserialization
full automatic serializable deserialization behavior- the imagebytes property is just an implementation detail

1768520
perforce	svn
perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn

1768574
button	checkbox
i have a button in the main aspx page on click of which it will check if checked or not for all the checkbox and fetch the corresponding row from the gridview

1768581
svg	vml
if you were to design a graphics-heavy interactive web application say a game like mario bros. today which of the three available technologies would you prefer - flash ex canvas or svg vml

1768621
post	get
also is this data to be sent with ajax or is it to be part of a subsequent post get form submission etc

1768623
icomparable	compareto
essentially what you are doing is creating an anonymous delegate which compares two items in your case you are sorting on value you can even sort on key using the compareto method of icomparable string and int implement this interface

1768679
put	get
i assume if we put the right grammar - the words we expect in the recording - we should get the textual output of that

1768688
folder	directory
if you have downloaded the binary distribution then in the folder where ajaxcontroltoolkit.dll is found release or debug not sure which you should also see a whole bunch of directory named according to culture code such as fr zh-cht ja and so on each one containing ajaxcontroltoolkit.resources.dll

1768688
folder	directory
you need to copy the language folder you want to your website s bin directory so that the resources will be loaded and used by the .net runtime for the matching culture

1768715
width	height
i want to set max-width 980 px for site but minimum width can be everything and height should depend on content

1768718
accessor	properties
indexers resemble properties except that their accessor take parameters

1768755
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
fileinputstream reads all bytes of a file and fileoutputstream writes allbytes to a file

1768758
bufferedreader	printwriter
i think what you are looking for is a bufferedreader and a printwriter

1768790
accessor	properties
it just shows where to find the methods when looking for accessor for the properties of that name

1768790
getter	setter
by cls convention plain properties are represented on clr level by a property associated with methods with corresponding signatures one for getter and one for setter

1768790
accessor	properties
indexed properties that aren t default are only accessible from c# by calling their accessor methods get_foo and set_foo directly - though this will change in c# 4 for com-imported interfaces

1768794
scheme	prolog	lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog
vb common lisp ruby scheme ml prolog go .

1768800
pull	push
cloning yourremoterepo that way you can easily pull push from that repo

1768823
post	get
plus from the start the language was really web oriented easy access to get post variables

1768869
vsto	add-in
for anyone that is looking for an answer to a similar problem then the registry keys you need to make a 2003 vsto add-in load for all users should look something like this

1768871
bufferedreader	printwriter
fredrik is right about bufferedreader but i d disagree about printwriter - my problem with printwriter is that it swallows exceptions

1768871
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
it s worth understanding why fileinputstream and fileoutputstream don t have any methods relating to lines though the classes are about streams of binary data

1768871
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
so you probably want a bufferedreader wrapping an inputstreamreader wrapping a fileinputstream for reading - then call readline

1768871
fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter
for writing use a bufferedwriter wrapping an outputstreamwriter wrapping a fileoutputstream - then call write string and newline

1768871
fileinputstream	filewriter
there s also the filereader class which sort of combines fileinputstream and inputstreamreader and filewriter does the equivalent but these always use the platform default encoding which is almost never what you want

1768935
super	implements
uiviewcontroller and uiview implements it by default so all you need to do is override the encodewithcoder and decodewithcoder methods call super and save the state variables you need

1768954
sorting	filtering
note you have to note since the filtering and sorting would be done on client side it might perform really poorly if you have too much rows

1768992
avr-gcc	winavr
the big benefit is the free and very good avr-gcc compiler winavr for windows

1769082
jobs	cron
i take it you will run these as frequent cron jobs

1769144
google-chrome	safari
i believe safari and google-chrome do too

1769245
maven	pom.xml
is there any way to tell maven to generate a pom.xml which is sanitized so the artefact can be released to public without destroying the technical relevant information such as the dependencies

1769306
equals	gethashcode
value types are supposed to implement equals and gethashcode correctly

1769319
multibyte	substr
additionally java char s are just 16 bits wide so a single char cannot reliably represent a single unicode character on its own - and subsequently the substr method isn t wholly multibyte friendly

1769351
sorting	filtering
i have no idea how to make the three functionalities pagination sorting and filtering work together...want i want to achieve

1769351
post	get
get submits are a bit different than post submits since you pass all of your variables in one shot with the submit input

1769361
postgresql	mysql
i ve been migrating some of my mysql queries to postgresql to use heroku

1769374
onclick	onchange
i have an asp.net dropdown list control with onclick and onchange javascript events

1769374
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
both work in ie mozilla opera and google-chrome but not in safari

1769374
onclick	onchange
when i remove the onclick event onchange suddenly works

1769375
post	get
a loader must be shown ...while in the background the post happens and then aspx page must get loaded and then the modal must redirect to the aspx page

1769383
postgresql	mysql	aggregate-functions	sum
mysql s group by can be used without an aggregate-functions which is contrary to the sql standard and returns the first row in the group i don t know based on what criteria while postgresql must have an aggregate-functions max sum etc on the column on which the group by clause is issued

1769400
button	checkbox
so i guess i want to define an implicit style which applies to the textblock the checkbox and the button

1769414
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

1769433
memcached	ncache
apart from memcached and velocity you can look at some commercial solutions like ncache or oracle coherence

1769453
put	get
as the others have said - i would definitely not use a long string like an url as the primary clustering key on a sql server table - but of course you should feel free to put a unique constraint on that column to make sure you don t get any duplicates

1769466
getter	setter
i have tried to mimic getter and setter in javascript as specified in the following link

1769469
x86	mips
it currently works for arm7 nxp lpc2xxx cortex-m3 stm32 and nxp lpc17xx x86 and our in-house mips isa compatible fpga soft-core

1769477
stdout	stderr
a more radical approach is built in to my experimental shell gush which shows stderr from all commands run in red stdout in black

1769496
set	bag
i d also add that i suspect set semantics instead of bag would be more appropriate for the employee.team and team.employee properties

1769573
post	get
post reqmethod get

1769583
post	get
you make a post request as drupal will cache get s and the semantic of this is that you are posting data - the node - to the server

1769603
cvs	svn
a google search revealed the existence of some custom scripts for example pvcs -- cvs and then cvs -- svn should be quite straightforward

1769628
button	checkbox
if the user is only allowed to select one item from a list you should use radio button instead of checkbox

1769662
filtering	grouping
the data can be grouping into several categories so that filtering can be made upon it

1769672
fseek	fread
s in glibc contain a jump table with pointers to appropriate functions to handle such calls as fseek fread and of relevance fclose

1769746
inherited	properties
the object i am storing has complex type properties with some of them being objects of classes that inherited from other classes so serializing the object before storing it in the session might be a little expensive

1769762
opera	safari
opera supports it above 90 adobe was supporting it above 80 but may be supported it better now than last year and safari is supporting it above 40 but not supporting in a comparable manner compared to the prior two mentioned groups

1769813
width	height
i ve runned the debugger i ve noticed that the scene and the model is rendered and the picture width and height is zero

1769850
min	max
otherwise you couldn t have results for things like select min col1 max col1 .

1769862
mkmapview	mkannotationview
note you need to handle the touch events for the mkannotationview and not mkmapview

1769865
firefox	safari
you can also try running the same code in another browser with a solid js debugger like firefox + firebug or safari with the develop tools enabled

1769881
sudo	passwd
or more generically assuming sudo passwd has been catered for some-how

1769897
put	get
put it in a loop and do it say 1000 times then divide the result by 1000 what do you get then

1769902
serializable	deserialization
just serializable your class name method name and parameter class names as strings and then recreate your method object using a reflection mechanism during deserialization

1770034
maven	m2e
a bigger one is that m2e forks and uses an external maven for running maven goals while iam q4e only uses the embedder

1770040
hide	show
when the drag stop event is fired you should just be able to unhide them again by calling show instead of hide and replacing .ui-draggable-dragging by another class they have in common

1770075
getter	setter
i provide getter and setter hibernate dependencies on my classpath also.but i still do not get the how to validate simple form there is actually not so much documentation for spring hibernate combination

1770198
hide	show
i want to hide win_dock when all the windows of the application loses focus and show it again if a window gain focus

1770198
hide	show
when this counter drops to zero i want to hide win_dock and if this counter is positive again i want to show win_dock

1770241
webclient	httpwebrequest
but when coding your own webclient httpwebrequest the proxy is not automatically used-- you need to enable use of a proxy yourself either in code or configuration

1770241
webclient	httpwebrequest
note that the same code can be used against webclient as httpwebrequest

1770265
opera	firefox
as this call is within a click handler it even works perfectly with firefox and ie for opera it lets you open the popup manually

1770292
antlr	parser-generator
if you have no control then a parser-generator such as antlr may be valuable

1770343
zoo	xts
for the former look at the zoo and xts packages which offer much better time-pased subsetting

1770364
shadowbox	lightbox
i m using a jquery shadowbox library wich allows you to show html content in a lightbox shadowbox

1770399
folder	directory
what i want to do is use vs2008 on my windows xp development box and create a new project linked to this source folder so that i can explore and edit the source with the benefits of intellisense then simply putty into the mounted directory and run make

1770432
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to vs 2008 they changed their stance and included unit testing in the non team suite level versioning of the ide

1770456
mbunit	nunit
if you can t use nunit and presumably mbunit etc. then you have two options upgrade to vs2005 team system or vs2008 professional

1770475
min	max
another option would be to use jamon a tool that gathers statistics execution time number of hit average execution time min max etc for any code that comes between start and stop methods

1770497
sortedmap	sortedset
a sortedmap is a mapping from a sortedset of keys to values

1770545
post	get
note because i m unregistered i can only add in one url per post so the next url s are a bit mangled to get around that restriction

1770549
apache	nginx
apache 2 and nginx .

1770647
int	double
and similarly using convert.toint32 convert.tosingle convert.todouble for the argument to produce int float double substituting in the correct type arguments to convertall

1770648
sorting	grouping
for example even though the datagrid control may not have everything you re looking for consider that it has features such as sorting paging grouping and aggregation already built in

1770648
telerik	componentart
you may consider looking at and testing third-party controls from vendors such as telerik componentart or devexpress

1770661
integer	fractions
datediff but note it returns an integer so if you need fractions of hours use something like this -

1770670
screens	tablet
i m adapting an application for touch screens interface and we want to use the tablet text input panel included in windows vista 7 specifically its keyboard

1770670
hide	show
i want to show and hide it as appropriate for my app

1770677
put	get
if you re trying to get atomic put if not already in there use chm

1770719
multiplying	subtract
just subtract the two datetime values and multiplying by 24

1770791
tooltip	scrollbar
in order to display an office 2007-style tooltip revealing which page the position of the scrollbar corresponds with

1770890
folder	directory
and i have following dll in the dbg tools folder mscordacwks_amd64_x64_2.0.50727.3603.dll taken from framework64 directory

1770891
firefox	safari
i found that this works in ie apple safari and firefox

1770895
puts	gets
in any case you may want to additionally log the hashcode of the keys used for the gets puts in threads 1 and 2

1770896
inherited	properties
for properties you could have a template to wrap them in the stl container so that they share a common ancestor and you can store pointers like where properties makes created type inherited from common type

1770958
for-loop	arrays
you could use an arrays to store the recipients and then use a for-loop

1770980
post	put
i recoment you to use the parameter formcollection in your controller and put a breakpoint you can see all the values send within the post

1771053
inherited	properties
the resulting object always contains an inherited properties this interferes with my code and doesn t happen except on this page only anyone knows why

1771092
int	double
imagine for a moment this inheritance double extends int extends number

1771092
int	double
this is not correct in java but imagine that double is just an int plus a fractions part

1771092
int	double
in this scenario a comparable which works for number also works for int and double since both derive from number

1771092
int	double
so would satisfy the super part for t being number int or double

1771092
int	double
this means you can pass in number for t and the resulting code will also work when there are int and double instances in the lists

1771092
int	double	super	extends
if you int for t you can still use double but number is not possible because it doesn t satisfy t extends comparable anymore the super part would still work though

1771103
post	get
i have successfully been able to get the post rendererd out through the posts.each do |post| call

1771127
spaces	delimiter
this would be pretty trivial stuff for a parser but different text files have different delimiter so i d like to let the user specify whether the text is separated by tabs spaces commas pipes unicode snowmen et cetera

1771157
trojan	virus
otherwise how do you know that silverlight app your running isn t depositing something nasty trojan virus etc. on your hdd

1771171
boost	stl
to solve your misery give up on stl and have a look at the successors try boost and maybe qt

1771258
folder	directory
the other is that you are trying to edit a folder location after costfinalize has set directory locations

1771295
put	get
if your cygwin sshd is running under a privileged account it can get a handle to the current desktop and put windows on it

1771341
client-side	server-side
the restlet framework also has an api which works both server-side and client-side

1771362
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i would look into how ie7 firefox google-chrome and safari store these cookies but probably not in a really secure way

1771370
folder	directory
you should get a new folder in your project s bin debug directory with the satellite assembly named projectname.resources.dll

1771415
hide	show
you need to somehowe tie the show hide buttons to their respective divs that they will act on

1771482
versioning	upgrade
the old classic pagination has been moved out into it s own plugin too but it s only recommended if you were already using it when you upgrade rails to a versioning where they took it out

1771487
serializable	deserialization
but as i know saving large object set in sessions clearly slows down application performance because of frequent serializable and deserialization process serializable is time consuming i guess from web services - soap and binary formatting

1771577
appfuse	spring
spring 3 final is soon to be released and appfuse is based on 2.5

1771589
width	height
for example for an image reference element i d make the width height and format attributes

1771717
put	get
you want to put the id so you can access the value in javascript as well as a name if you want to access the value on the server in the tag you wish to get the value from

1771755
bash	zsh
you can start with command line powershell bash zsh .

1771775
public	protected
note that if you replace public with protected the marked method will be only visible to base classes and subclasses

1771830
post	get
assuming you named your counter cache votes_count you can do this to get the 10 most popular post from your controller

1771897
inherited	subclassing
this provides subclassing with a default implementation of the interface or part of it and also lets you inherited from something else and still implement the interface or if you want to implement the interface but not inherited the base class implementation

1771914
qsort	bsearch
i m not coming up with c functions that work on arrays and not container classes except for things like qsort and bsearch and the stl has better ways to do such things

1771914
strtol	atoi
for example the boost lexical_cast is an improvement over such functions as atoi and strtol much as the standard c++ string is an improvement over the c way of doing things

1771944
jar	manifest.mf
in this case you need to setup the jar s manifest.mf file with a class-path entry which contains semicolonseparated relative paths to the desired resources relative from the jar file itself on

1771946
jobs	cron
we can also manage data loads with dbms_job dbms_scheduler routines which further cuts down the need for shell scripts and cron jobs

1771967
inherited	properties
but if you want a class to have the properties and method of another class the best you are going to get is to use a public properties of the the type of class you want to inherited

1771975
hide	show
anyway so it checks if it is the initial keydown if it is it hide hint if not doesn t hide it because it s already hidden and to call the hide again would show it thx toggle

1771983
agile	sprint
when asking for more detail one is informed that you are asking for too much detail and since this is agile the requirement will become clearer later during the sprint 2 week sprint and you should not worry about the detail just then but rather to just give the story a weight in doll hairs and stop being difficult

1772008
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks a link from any table row jquery s ui modal dialog pop-up up and i add a class to the clicked links parent tr called highlight

1772011
post	put
if you do this collection update_many put rails will submit a post to the index action commentscontroller#index i want it to go to the update_many action

1772011
post	put
any other thoughts on how to restfully do a collection level post put delete

1772016
put	get
prior to submitting my form i do the getloginstatus call and put the sessionkey and secret into form fields so they get posted to the controller

1772031
lxml	html5lib
however parsing huge files is becoming a performance bottleneck and lxml parsing is about 80 times faster than html5lib i benchmarked it

1772066
postgresql	mysql
same is true for all major systems oracle mysql postgresql not only for sql server

1772067
agile	sprint
when asking for more detail one is informed that you are asking for too much detail and since this is agile the requirement will become clearer later during the sprint 2 week sprint and you should not worry about the detail just then but rather to just give the story a weight in doll hairs and stop being difficult

1772090
dictionary	map
along the lines of what l99057j said if all you re doing is mapping inputs to constant values this is a place for an appropriate lookup structure such as an array list for sequential inputs or a dictionary map for a sparse one not a switch statement

1772095
gmail	hotmail
essentially type_key has the name either hotmail or gmail and type has the dictionary that is the value associated with that key

1772102
notepad	textpad
what i want to do is allow the source app to be able to drop into notepad textpad as well

1772117
coalesce	isnull
you can also use the isnull transact-sql specific or coalesce sql-92 standard function as in

1772174
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is organized in a stack-like fashion and it holds uiviewcontroller instances not views

1772260
jobs	cron
any server that allows you to install your own cron jobs can do this

1772270
width	height
i ve set its width to be 640 and height to 450

1772320
min	max
and of course various min max abs etc

1772333
min	max
the macro you posted from gcc min and max is an example of this they use the global variables _a and _b to avoid the risk of double evaluation like in max x++ y++ well they use gcc extensions but the concept is the same

1772337
goto	break
if the loop is a true infinite loop there is no break condition -- only an external event can terminate the thread s process execution then i actually prefer the label and goto

1772389
printf	fgets	printf	atoi	printf	strlen	atoi	strlen	fgets	atoi	fgets	strlen
no strlen no fgets no atoi no strtoul no fopen no printf with the s conversion specifier .

1772460
put	get
then you d only have to use logical and s and or s to get put stuff into it

1772465
client-side	server-side
unlike client-side validators the server-side validation does not prevent the page from posting back and processing events as normal

1772469
apache	nginx
i highly highly recommend running the environment with apache nginx and phusion s passenger

1772495
mouseup	mousedown
that listen for mouseup or mousedown

1772495
mouseup	mousedown
how to handle mouseup and mousedown events for a textbox

1772565
printf	strncpy
but regardless of which method you choose you should definitely use printf or strncpy for buffer overrun protection

1772581
submit	submission
what i can not find is how to either invoke or trigger the webbrowser to act as though either the submit button was pressed or alternately the enter key was pressed causing the default submission

1772607
postgresql	mysql
there are native providers for mysql postgresql ms sql server oracle etc

1772728
post	get
the post redirect get pattern will prevent the re-post warning

1772728
post	get
at any rate i think web applications that follow the post redirect get pattern are slightly more user-friendly but your mileage may vary

1772728
post	get
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

1772747
disk	ram
working with computer equiped with lot of ram in order to maximize disk cache

1772749
autofac	castle-windsor
i know that unity and ninject work with silverlight but i haven t found any information that suggests that other well known containers like structuremap castle-windsor or autofac support silverlight

1772767
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested ie firefox and google-chrome over an 8 hour period and there didn t appear to be any negative impact although my boxes are relatively fast

1772793
put	get
i get dynamic content with ajax and i put it in a div but the problem is that i have diffrent ids for some child divs from the dynamic content

1772822
put	get
so i was thinking of having another sort of tag like this and put it under the authorizeattribute this way if they are not authorized they get caught by that one

1772849
uiview	subviews
i got rid of the uiview completely and ended up putting the uilabel as a subviews of the uiimageview and returned the uiimageview

1772850
base	fractions
this is similar to how in base 10 1 3 is an infinite fractions 0.3333...

1772850
rational-numbers	fractions
if you use fractions with bignums arbitrarily large numbers for your numerators and denominators you can represent any rational-numbers that will fit in the memory of your computer

1772861
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox it works properly

1772861
google-chrome	firefox
so bottom line the div is centered on google-chrome and firefox but all the way to the right on ie7.

1772876
sorting	filtering
the table should behave nicely when sorting and filtering using excel

1772879
trac	bugzilla
so is your issue tracker jira bugzilla trac etc behind the firewall

1772910
postgresql	mysql
after getting burned on the matter of postgresql and java stored procedures i won t dare to speculate on whether mysql does java stored procedures

1772938
inherited	properties
there is however no way to set a base object s properties and have them used in the inherited class

1777104
uipagecontrol	subviews
edit after some more research it seems you can replace the uipagecontrol subviews to customize the dot images

mouse	keyboard
if you are really paranoid you could code an on-screen keyboard that inputs through the mouse for your application very similar to what ing direct has for pin input

1777165
dojo	dwr
i haven t tried dwr yet but have used dojo and jquery both and on websphere commerce

1777165
dojo	dwr
since you are already familiar with dwr i would suggest you to go with that instead of using dojo which i feel is cumbersome compared to jquery

1777182
wordpress	joomla
i have an old joomla site v 1.0.11 that i would really like to move over to blogger or wordpress

1777201
stdout	stderr
as peter hosey points out it s likely that the child processes writing to stderr rather than stdout

1777201
stdout	stderr
since stdout and stderr are both inherited by child processes if you set the stderr of the task you launch to a pipe you re aware of its child processes should write to that pipe

1777201
stdout	stderr
alternatively you can change the perl script to redirect the child processes stderr to stdout

1777221
webclient	httpwebrequest
i ve previously used a cookiecontainer with httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse sessions but now i want to use it with a webclient

1777234
versioning	upgrade
these formatters are sensitive to versioning changes even in the assembly versioning so if you deserialize with one versioning of the framework upgrade the framework then it might not deserialize not sure but there are ways around this with the binder property if this becomes a problem

1777246
webclient	httpwebrequest
before i knew about this option i wrote lots of really painful code at the httpwebrequest layer because webclient almost but not quite did what i needed

1777263
post	put	post	get	put	get
get put post have worked very well for me

1777272
imperative	declarative
it s a declarative paradigm rather than an imperative one like in c php or python

sat	np-complete
for example you can easily write a sat solver in prolog and that problem is np-complete

1777306
submit	submission
the idea behind this query is a user submit a link the application inserts two rows one into links and another into votes a default vote why wouldn t a user vote for their own submission

1777319
width	margin
what i need is the banner with the low opacity image on it to be centered no matter the resolution ive tried a wrapper but because the wrapper is a width of 800 it cuts of the image i ve tried margin 0 auto

profiling	debugging
my dev env is setup xcode has just two profiling iphone device 3.1.2 base sdk and iphone simulator 3.1.2 either one with release and debugging

1777408
nlb	iis
basically we have two servers on our nlb 10.0.51.51 and 10.0.51.52 and two ips assigned to our nlb 10.0.51.2 and 10.0.51.4 and we have iis listening on both of these ips with a different wildcard certificates to avoid giving out public ip s let s say a 443 routes to 10.0.51.2 443 and b 443 routes to 10.0.51.4 443

1777448
postgresql	mysql
mysql s totally non standards compliant group by can be emulated by postgresql distinct on

1777448
postgresql	mysql
rails is married to mysql so i m not surprised that it generates sql that doesn t work in postgresql

1777457
isapi	httpmodule
this means that if you want it for everything you have to add an isapi filter to bind all files to be handled by .net which comes with overheads and can cause some unexpected behavior if you have any global handlers or httpmodule defined

1777483
post	get
currently it s passed by get or post with every request but i was wondering if i could avoid this by offering it as a cookie since it is dependent on the user s ip

1777493
post	get
all good points however in answer to the question get requests are more useful in certain scenarios over post requests

1777496
width	height
the position of the lower horizontal path relative to the base of the button wasn t clear if you need to alter the position and width of it alter the grid column height and width values appropriately and keep them as ratio s and not absolute numbers

1777498
getter	setter
you can add special property in your view model that will set value of your mutable property in its setter and return needed value using all three your properties in its getter

1777526

i ve got an element an image defined as instrument in css and for the life of me i cannot get it to properly display a png with transparency in ie7 or ie8 -- works fine in safari and firefox

1777570
int	chars
i have a pointer ascii which a pointer to a chars and i want it is value as an int in order to make it an if statement like

1777582
int	chars
the code will take a sequence of 0 and 1 string chars an int representing the chars that the machine starts with and an int representing the state of the program in no particular order and output the final result of the operations on the string as well as the final position

1777622
int	chars
unsigned chars y and e occupy the same space again depending on the fact that int is 32 bits so .y and .e are effectively aliases for each other

1777668
showwindow	postmessage
at startup previous instance s mainwindowhandle property is 0 so i can t send showwindow or postmessage

1777689
innodb	myisam
i carried out a test inserting 1300 records but showed the same result with innodb for transaction and myisam

1777779
addclass	removeclass
take a look at the jq lib uncompressed copy the code for addclass removeclass and attr

1777817
g++	gcc
compile your object with g++ compiler instead it will link to standard c++ library gcc does not

1777855
width	height
for example if i were to have a bounding rectangle of width and height of 4 and the points p1 0 0 and p2 2 2 it could output the following

1777862
int	chars
it is obvious that int system const chars command will be necessary to complete the program

1777862
int	chars
starting it with int main int argc chars argv will allow getting the command-line arguments but there is still a problem that is difficult to understand

1777868
webclient	webrequest
edit you may also want to use the webclient or webrequest classes to download the web page

1777872
gentoo	linux
the server is running gentoo linux with apache and i have full root access

1777986
mouse	keyboard
you can find used mac mini s for cheap and use an existing monitor and usb keyboard mouse

1777989
daemons	systemd
so we queue those tasks into a messaging systemd and have back-end daemons handle them

1778000
free	malloc
since the error occurs when draining the pool i might be suspicious that you ve already deallocated the object by that point and the object is over-released although generally you ll get a malloc double free error for this or perhaps the memory has already been overwritten by something else

1778088
pull	push
specifically the new master branch points to skeleton master branch and i can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup

1778097
folder	directory
one way to get around your problem is to add your local folder the unzipped version in the current directory to the beginning of pythonpath so that python will find it first

1778131
folder	directory
if the directory structure conforms to what is defined all projects should be under a defined svn folder and each project should have a tags branch and trunk folder

1778132
getter	setter
use getter and setter and make the properties private

1778214

put	get
to try to get what s wrong i put the aspx file aside and open only the html page

1778377
cassini	iis
all 3 files above are the same page being run through 2 different servers cassini iis and the normal html render from firefox

1778466
pop-up	dialog
you can also use packagemanager to detect if wamf is installed seeing if there are any activities that would match the intent you want to use in startactivity -- that way you can disable the menu choice or have it pop-up a dialog telling people to install wamf or something

1778478
unsigned	short
if i have an array of short unsigned ints

1778492
gif	png
i need to decide whether to render geometric symbols in a web gui arrows and triangles for buttons menus etc. as unicode symbols much easier and color-independent or gif png files lots of hassle i would like to avoid

1778515

note that a process may allocate far more memory virtual memory size but as long as it don t writes to the memory it is not represented by physical memory be it in ram or on the disk

1778568
post	get
i do not know how to do it but i guess you can at least get some inspiration from this post

1778673
postgresql	mysql
having come across a number of idiosyncracies when using mysql for olap are there reasons in favour of using postgresql instead assuming that i want to go the open source route

1778784
apache	nginx
nginx presents itself as lighter option to apache but the latter has much more modules and support

1778788

hash	md5
no md5 - is one-way hash function

1778908
hash	md5
md5 isn t an encryption method it s a one way hash

1778909
hash	md5
md5 is an hash which makes it allmost inpossible to get the original value back

1778910
hash	md5
if you intend to decrypt them later md5 won t be an option since it only hash strings you lose the original data

1778913
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
however you should always encrypt hash passwords with at least md5 and a salt as pointed out in ivan s reply

1778916
hash	md5
just be aware that basic md5 hashing is no longer a secure hash

1778916
hash	md5
i think one major problem with it is that there are rainbow tables of md5 hash all over these days so bare md5 is very susceptible to brute forcing

1778916
salt	md5
there may be special hoops that you can jump through like both using a salt and performing nested md5 hashings to make it more secure though i m no cryptographer

1778946
versioning	upgrade
i ended up using a more complex way to do upgrade by reading the raw xml from the user settings file then run a series of upgrade routines that refactor the data to the way it s supposed to be in the new next versioning

1778948
tinyint	boolean
at django a boolean field in mysql is stored as a tinyint

1778964
trie	tree
a trie is an uncompressed prefix tree a tree in which the paths from root to leaf nodes correspond to all the prefixes of a given string

1778967
inherited	properties
if you get an event handler where the e parameter is an inherited eventargs you can use the properties on the inherited eventargs object to find out more about the event

1778969
inherited	properties
a good example of this is the gridviewediteventargs that are passed by a gridview inherited from eventargs but extend it to provide neweditindex and cancel properties

1779015

when that downward trend is well established discontinue upgrade to the 2.4 versioning but keep it available for download

1779064
spaces	delimiter
first off your linked udf s default delimiter is the character not spaces

1779141
many-to-many	one-to-many
the generally correct way to do this is to do a one-to-many relationship either with each bar pointing back to a foo or an intermediate foo-to-bar table see many-to-many relationships

post	get
for example if you re sending a post request to a url that s only designed to handle a get request you ll get this error

1779462
post	put	post	get	put	get
so servlet a can perform an http get on a particular path to check a status either sending back an object or checking an http response code - this latter method seems a misuse of status codes however and put post an object if required

1779555
apache	nginx
i ve used apache passenger and nginx passenger on a vps and memory usage was better with nginx

1779555
apache	nginx
one thing to note about installing and configuring nginx - you need to choose your modules at compile time unlike apache where you can configure modules at runtime

1779603
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord datamapper

1779608
int	double
so do you suggest that it is better to re-define add as add int double double

1779618
int	double
the upsizing of int to float to double works but the problem is that you aren t passing variables to add so inside add it can t change them

1779626
floating-point	integer
your function takes its parameters by reference not by value and you can t pass constant integer floating-point values by non-const reference

1779626
int	double
you can implicitly cast an int to a float or double but you cannot implicitly cast an to a

1779879
hash	md5
what s the most efficient way to convert an md5 hash to a unique integer to perform a modulus operation

1779897
addition	multiplication
you can get a somewhat unique one by converting the hex version to several integers worth of data then combining them addition or multiplication

1779908
hash	md5
you ll need to define your own hash function that converts an md5 string into an integer of the desired width

1779908
hash	md5
if you want to interpret the md5 hash as a plain string you can try the fnv algorithm

1779923
yacc	bison
liby is part of yacc and some versions of bison but is rarely actually needed it just defines default implementations of yyerror and a couple other things

1779946
plpgsql	plpython
what i know - people usually use a combination of pl languages - sql plpgsql plperl or sql plpgsql plpython

1779970

innodb	myisam
is there a command i can run to change the type of my current tables to use innodb instead of myisam

1780120
stdout	stderr
createchildprocess isn t as convenient though because it doesn t buffer stdout and stderr so you will need event handlers to read the output in chunks

1780157
vmware	virtualbox
you might benefit from running either vs2010 or vs2005 or both in a virtualbox virtualpc vmware

1780169
width	height
typically if you use window.open and specify a height and width for the window it will cause most browsers with most configurations to open it as a new window and not a new tab

1780172
disk	ram
this is true even if you have a 1 tb ram machine you ll need 1.5 tb pagefile on disk sounds crazy but is true

1780257
subtraction	addition
the idea is that this algorithm adds 1 point to the score for every single letter addition or subtraction that is necessary to transform one word into the other

1780257
subtract	add
you need to subtract the e and add an l

1780278

webclient	httpwebrequest
1 if you are building a client app console or winforms and want to access using webclient or httpwebrequest without any intervening proxies then should accomplish this

1780416
webclient	httpwebrequest
btw if you find that things are configured correctly and you still get the error the first thing i d recommend is to code up a quick test which manually sets the proxy before your webclient httpwebrequest call instead of relying on configuration to do it

1780463
int	chars
if you are working in c you have your string in a chars array that is of a size multiple of a int you can just take the pointer to the chars array cast it to a pointer to a int array and do whatever you want with your int array

1780489
rational-numbers	zero
is there any way in haskell to get the constant that is the largest and smallest possible positive rational-numbers greater than zero that can be represented by doubles

1780531
children	parent
if you really only care about a parent and it s forked children you can use an anonymous mapping and not bother with the file and you can store the location of the mapping in a global which can be read in the children

1780540
accessor	properties	getter	setter
but when your language lets you switch from public variables to properties and vice-versa without any incompatible change in the api such as c# ruby python ... it s silly to carry around total boilerplate when the public accessor getter and setter do nothing except copying to and from a private variable -- even if you re certain your compiler can optimize them away such boilerplate accessor just bloat the source uselessly and waste an important design feature that s part of what makes such languages nice ones

1780547
children	parent
pass the map_anonymous and map_shared flags to mmap - this will mean that child processes that inherit the mapping will have a mapping that is shared with the parent and the other children

my strategy was to use the wba_logo_bg as id and select the parent then from there select all the children td which doesn t have the class wba_topnavbg and hide them all but i don t know how to write the selection part

1780687
post	get
and how do i validate get and post params

1780696
min	max
given only that and without restricting the style of how enums are used declared we know the size of the enumerations but not their signedness which makes defining type-safe constructors taking min and max arguments impossible

1780703
min	max
this is the only way the service starts in reasonable time max of 3 min avg of 1.5 min of real machines and vms both

1780732

post	get
i follow there instructions for creating an app on there site create and commit git push the code and it shows up at though the bulk of what i have done is in the post path when i go to enter a new post because this is kind of a blog platform i get the 500.html error and essentially everything shuts down

1780789
post	get
can t even get back to the page that i entered the post

1780870
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if this is going to be a long-running client i d also recommend using the lower-level datainputstream and dataoutputstream instead of objectinputstream objectoutputstream to prevent holding onto a possibly large identityhashmap of the objects

1780876
unsigned	short
i have a bitmap image that i am parsing and i need to be able to open the file and store the first unsigned short

1781118
postgresql	mysql
i am using hibernate 3.2.6 and the same problem is happening on mysql and postgresql

1781128
put	get
i m not sure what url i need to put in there or if i have to create a fake image just to get everything up there

1781129
for-loop	loops
edit i also changed your code a little to remove the success variable and chose to return right from the for-loop thereby breaking loops

1781135
pop-up	dialog
this would pop-up a modal dialog to accept information about the new book form

1781135
pop-up	dialog

i looked at the network traffic and there seems to be a lot of ancillary packets related to using multicast

1781159
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
here i bind the mousemove event on mousedown and unbind it on mouseup

1781162
mousemove	mousedown
you bind the mousedown event and call mousemove inside of that function and use the jquery unbind event to get rid of the mousemove

1781212
union	distinct
the information comes from two distinct unrelated tables maybe use union to obtain results in a single query while effectively running two queries you would then use an extra column with some text like univ public to differentiate the two lines

1781229
ubuntu	linux
so far i was able to connect the mysql database using c# in .net platform and run a small application in ubuntu over crossover linux

1781252
ant	cruisecontrol

cgfloat	uiedgeinsets
uiedgeinsets encapsulates four different cgfloat values for the inset values of the top left bottom and right respectively individually

1781294
width	height
jpeg has a header within each segment of data which has its own height width and resolution

1781294
width	height
you might need to read the entire image to find the width and height of each segment within the jpeg to get the entire width and height

1781294
width	height
you could do it if you can develop a server side program that would seek forward and read the header of each segment to compute the width and height of the segment

1781333
kde	gnome	kde	kubuntu	kubuntu	gnome
i use kubuntu ie ubuntu with kde instead of gnome -- mater of personal choice and it s ok for lamp development you can use eclipse pdt or aptana of course you have mysql available .

1781441
gif	png
for gif s and png s you can easily get the image dimensions from the first 32 bytes

1781456
django	turbogears
you could also look at other alternative frameworks such as turbogears or paste if you wanted but django is a great way to get something up and running quickly

1781477
mouse	keyboard
events on the other hand are system language-level messages which can be used to signify various hardware or software situations i d use the word event such as mouse clicks keyboard entries but also application-level situations such as new record inserted in database or highly digested requests and messages used in modular programs for communication requests between various parts of the program

1781482
nunit	mspec
any testing framework nunit mspec the vsts-built in framework etc. will do just fine

navigation scripted archive by month listing contents scripted footer once sidebar inherited throughout site - override by cloning into subdirs and editing or specifying object properties for local instance closest to the url path then seeking up to root

1781648
width	height
you ve got some invalid html on that line the width and height parts

1781674
spaces	delimiter
i m going to assume that we re not talking about the trivial case here not just splitting a string around spaces since that d just be a basic tokenizer problem - but instead we re talking about something were there isn t a clear word delimiter character and thus we re having to guess what the best match for string- words would be - for instance the case of a set of concatenated words w o spaces such as transforming this

1781783
next	except
almost monadic i believe except that in your case they appear to be actions so there are no values to string through from one function to the next

1781826
hide	show
td colspan does not work while using jquery show hide

1781851
firefox	safari
the form is styled and looks fine in safari and firefox but then in internet explorer 6 7 and 8.

1781922
equals	gethashcode
the same happens in c# equals and gethashcode are methods implemented in the system.object class

1782023
width	height
the image tag supports width and height but doesn t need pixels just the value

1782024
superclass	subclassing
the template method in the superclass implements the common algorithm and each subclassing fills in the blanks in its own specific way

1782030
ubuntu	linux
later the following packages would be installed automatically when we run the deployed .net application in ubuntu linux

1782093
parent-child	one-to-many
the existing ui uses a multiview control to navigate between the editing of associated business objects one-one associations or one-to-many parent-child

1782093
objectdatasource	formview
within the itemtemplate of each formview various server controls databind to fields or methods on an objectdatasource

1782093
factories	presenter
more specifically - use an objectcontainerdatasource from the web client software factories to make it easier to bridge between the current ui and a set of new presenter classes

1782112
int	chars
the value of eof is a negative int to distinguish it from chars values that are in the range 0 to 255

1782139
post	get
you d probably need to use xmlhttprequest to make an http request to your server-side script and pass variables either through get or post

1782140
button	checkbox
when i hitted save button after the selection of mutiple checkbox it will stored to that of particular column seperated by a semi column

1782149
width	height
if you have term readkey module installed from cpan you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters and in pixels

1782196
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this way the answer of shouldautorotate is forwarded to the controlled tabs and in particular for the uinavigationcontroller it is again delegated to the visible uiviewcontroller

1782196
portrait	landscape
the problem is that i would like that even if the device is still in landscape mode and user pops the special viewcontroller the interface should behave consistently and return to portrait mode

1782218
multiplying	add
so i need to multiplying the price by quantity and then take that subtotal per item and add it in total after the loop

1782270
pivot-table	crosstab
i ve tried to avoid using find_by_sql and db specific queries but for a pivot-table or crosstab query i have no idea how to do it in a way which is not specific to say mysql

1782270
postgresql	mysql
ie my mysql find_by_sql breaks on a postgresql db

1782310
post	get
i have a quick question i hope you guys can answer i ve got a search system that uses post to do searches now i want to track queries using google analytics but it requires using get url parameters to pull parameters out the url what i don t want to do is rewrite the entire search system to use get instead of post

1782310
post	get
i was thinking maybe i can make a get call to a new page from the page that recieves the search post but i don t want it to redirect i merely want it to hit the url without actually redirecting

1782333
accessor	properties
i m trying to write a generic cached properties accessor like the following but am getting a compiler error when trying to check whether the storage variable already contains a value

1782335
post	get
with the array _request you can access all request parameters get and post

1782352
folder	directory
this will mvn install correctly but when i open the output war file i was expecting the file xmlgateway-context.xml to be in the web-inf directory but it ends up in the folder web-inf classes web-inf

1782368
lxml	beautifulsoup
i suspect that it is choking on poorly formed html and i d like to try pre-parsing it with a parser better designed to handle bad html say lxml or beautifulsoup and then feeding the prettified cleaned-up output to the form parser

1782401
put	get
because all of the machines are in your domain you can put together a vbscript that will get the macaddress es from the local machine and store it as an attribute of the computer object in active directory

1782465
ubuntu	linux
i just started using ubuntu linux for the first time

1782488
hash	md5
since you don t have additional arguments the hexdigest is d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e the md5 hash of the empty string

1782652
pop-up	dialog
one way to do this is to write a web page for the pop-up and link to it normally then add your your js function of the onclick event load the page in using ajax to a dialog box and return false from the js function

1782652
pop-up	dialog
that way the pop-up appears as a dialog box when js is turned on as the false return from the function disables the link action but the link behaves normally when js is off

1782658
range	max	range	min	min	max
parse string containing range of values to min and max variables

1782689
stdout	stderr
you should direct stderr to stdout

1782693
cgpoint	cgrect
i m not sure what you mean by geospatial boundaries but if you mean you have a rectangle defining a location you can convert it to a cgrect offset the latitude and longitude of all of your points by 90 and 180 respectively to make sure you don t have negative numbers convert your cllocation objects to cgpoint s then use cgrectcontainspoint to figure out if your location is within that rectangle

1782739
put	get
to get the whole hash you d put a in front of the braces

1782769
rar	zip
to give you an idea a 2.31mb file - lots of text several full page diagrams - compressed to 1.92mb in zip and 1.90mb in rar

1782770
pop-up	dialog
although i know that this can be accomplished by showing the default2 into a modal pop-up show the default2 into a modal dialog and after that call the button event using javascript

1782787
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals

1782801
filesystems	ntfs
you can mount the ntfs volume containing the repository under linux and then checkout from the repository location to somewhere in your linux filesystems

1782818
hide	show
finally i wanted to be able to show and hide the input panel

1782872
min	max
required min and max size etc.

1782894
put	get
if you need the data in the db for the test for get put it there in the setup step

1782902
getlasterror	waitformultipleobjects
experiencing intermittent issues related to named events when processes are running in different user contexts waitforsingleobject and waitformultipleobjects too for such event handle fails with wait_failed getlasterror returns 6 - invalid handle value

1782972
for-loop	loops
the foreach loops or enhanced for-loop does not have facilities to keep track of which element is being iterated on at the moment

1782973
bash	zsh
assuming bash zsh or something similar for the dupe of stderr on to stdout.

1782983
boost	stl
these are template-based libraries that only make use of header files with some #included inline code like most of the stl and boost libraries

1783178
ubuntu	linux
i am creating a dhcp client in linux ubuntu

1783204
gcov	lcov
everything was working just fine until i tried to do some code coverage using gcov lcov which don t operate on dynamic libs so i modified all my .pro file to have a static lib compilation using

1783231
inherited	subclassing
the testcalculator class is the testfixture but inherited all of the tests from the base class which leaves the subclassing responsible solely for providing the object to test for that interface

1783297
vim	emacs
because someone already mentioned emacs of course there s vim with r plugin don t know how many of those there are but i found at least one with a quick google

1783297
vim	emacs
vim might have an even steeper learning curve than emacs though

1783297
vim	emacs
i think emacs and vim will both handle pretty much any language out there so let the flame war begin

1783315
vim	textmate
the question is - is there any plugin for vim that will show markers arrows or stmh near every def and end like it is done in textmate 1

1783381
imperative	declarative
a paradigm is a way of doing things and there are two main programming paradigms imperative and declarative

1783407
vim	emacs
emacs and vim have a bigger learning curve but they re also very powerful especially if you re already using them for something else

1783523
mouse	keyboard
i also found a tool called xdotool which allows you to programatically simulate keyboard and mouse activity amongst other things

1783552
hash	md5
i would use a hash function like sha or md5 this will generate the same output for a given input every time

1783582
hash	md5
you could use a simple lcg or you could use a hash function like md5

1783631
folder	dir
i have a folder named lib and i am using the file find module to search that folder in whole dir say d

1783640
inherited	properties
in other words as your inherited properties have a different meaning than the properties you get from interfaces you have to access them differently

1783690
filtering	grouping
its difficult to tell without looking at an execution plan but i think that whats happening is that sql server is not clever enough to realise that the where clause specified is filtering out the grouping and does not have any effect on the records included for each grouping

1783725
post	get
regarding the use of the -readcount parameter i did a blog post on this a while ago that folks might find useful - optimizing performance of get content for large files

1783733
post	get
i can easily get a count of post grouped by date but this doesn t return the dates when there are no post eg it misses out 17-11-2009

1783752
apache	lighttpd
if you want to off load the polling requests to a second server lighttpd in your case then it would be better to setup lightttpd in front of apache on a second physical machine and use a shared caching server memcache so that the lighttpd server can read the cached timestamps and apache can update the cached timestamps

1783752
apache	lighttpd
the rationale for putting lighttpd in front of apache is if most requests are polling requests to avoid the heavier-weight apache process usage

1783763
int	chars
if you have a string representation of an int number you could write the isincre function like this ord converts a chars to an int and string is just a list of chars

1783802
profiling	instrumentation
the only good way to tell if there is any discernible difference in performance is to use profiling tools like instrumentation for measuring things like display framerate for the two techniques or shark to determine hotspots in your code

1783812
integer	unsigned
it s a little confusing but a uint_ptr as well as the more standardized uintptr_t is defined to be an unsigned integer that is guaranteed to be large enough to hold a pointer value

1783821
coalesce	isnull
both coalesce and isnull answers give in other answers are equally valid too for this particular case and simpler frankly

1783833
ubuntu	linux
on my ubuntu linux system it s about 1000 lines of output including this

1783839
button	checkbox
and sometimes after clicking on some button and checkbox in the grid more empty rows are added

1783921
coalesce	isnull
or in this situation you can use coalesce or isnull

1783969
translation	localization
we ve recently finished internationalizing a website and are ready to begin the im sure arduous task of localization translation

1783973
changeset	cherry-pick
as that is probably lacking the rest of trunk s files i d then branch off trunk tmp-trunk and replay cherry-pick all the changeset from tmp-subdir onto tmp-trunk

1784044
weblogic	oc4j
weblogic websphere and oc4j consider

1784054
for-loop	loops
if your for-loop is performance-critical and not doing heavy computation such that the index arithmetic actually matters you should almost certainly be restructuring your code to do more work in each pass of loops

1784064
gridbaglayout	springlayout
the flowlayout gridbaglayout and springlayout managers use the component s preferred size the latter two depending on the constraints you set but borderlayout and gridlayout usually don t.if you specify new size hints for a component that s already visible you need to invoke the revalidate method on it to make sure that its containment hierarchy is laid out again

1784075
rss	feed
i am creating some process that will retrieve the content from the rss feed every 3 hours

1784135
put	get
the -e will put the project in myproject src but link it to myproject lib pythonx.x site-packages so any changes you make will get picked up immediately in modules that import it from your local site-packages

1784162
ubuntu	linux
i am attempting a fresh install of drupal 6.14 on a ubuntu 9.10 machine using xampp for linux

1784183
maven	pom.xml
first explicitly specify that you want to use a version of the maven assembly plugin greater or equal to 2.2-beta-3 in your pom.xml the includes excludes of the unpackoptions element that you ll need later don t behave as expected in versions prior to 2.2-beta-3

1784196
width	text-align
but that would mean wrapping everything in a container element and setting the width of that element along with the text-align property

1784203
for-loop	arrays
then just do a for-loop on that arrays

1784211
children	parent
if you delete their parent windows forms automatically calls dispose on the children as well

1784276
hide	show
that can be achieved using the default jquery slide function what happens is that the new item on the list comes with a slide show and the last one with a slide hide in it

1784328
width	height
jquery will return the correct width height of the div which is the width height of the image

1784328
width	height
using javascript alone won t work because js won t return a width height unless it s set to a fixed value in the style

1784346
punctuation	words
all in all since l is identically equivalent to list g it s hard to get very excited about the ability to express it via punctuation square brackets instead of round parentheses instead of a single short pronounceable and obvious words like list

1784362
filesystems	ntfs
the disk is formatted with ntfs and we would like to search the filesystems using wildcards

1784415
fadein	fadeout
this starts the fadein before the fadeout is done

1784427
multiplying	addition
if you know beforehand that you will have overflow then you can scale their amplitudes prior to addition - simply multiplying by a floating point value between 0 and 1 again keeping in mind the issue of precision perhaps converting to a larger data type first

1784477
vsto	add-in
i am struggling to find a straight forward guide to creating office add-in using vsto and vb.net

1784570
udp	tcp
i used to have the same exact application but instead of udp it was tcp based

1784572
pull	push
they re having you pull commits over http and push them via ssh

1784625
filtering	grouping
if you combine a filtering and a grouping however sql server can no longer use this trick and is forced to evaluate the value of count or max based on the filtering result set leading to expensive lookups

1784650
gif	png
just to add i do not want the php script to be evoked when requests are made for css js png gif jpg and other media etc

1784652
getter	setter
setter and getter functions or to access members directly via

1784661
width	height
they have the same height and different width

1784664
imperative	declarative
i have been searching the web looking for a definition for declarative and imperative programming that would shed some light for me

1784671
getter	setter
with c you would typically not define setter and getter for each struct member

1784671
getter	setter
the advantages of setter and getter is present in c++ because you can do data hiding via private and protected

1784687
imperative	declarative
declarative programming is when you say what you want and imperative language is when you say how to get what you want

1784710
imperative	declarative
you have declarative .aspx files and then the imperative aspx.cs code files

1784716
imperative	declarative
c# is a much more imperative programming language but certain c# features are more declarative like linq

1784727
width	height
i m listening on the stage to event.resize updating my width height to match the stagewidth stageheight and drawing a rectangle to show me how big it is

1784727
width	height
the width and height are correct in both cases but in the small case everything is in a small box

1784732
udp	tcp
looking further i see that the difference is that the tcp version of your code receives data via the inputstream that s provided by socket whereas the udp version of your code receives data directly from the datagramsocket s own receive method

1784733
listview	gridview
i am facing a similar wpf listview gridview sorting issue and i have some contraints which makes it difficult to implement the csharp solutions provided

1784740
keydown	keyup
you have to let the keyup in order to fire a new keydown event

1784743
.htaccess	httpd.conf
so basically in httpd.conf i m adding an include to conf extra httpd-zf.conf which contains the same thing that was in my .htaccess and working perfectly

1784773
width	height
i m vaguely aware i can create the tab bar without these values and probe the window and tabbar for height and width to calculate the desired values but i m struggling to achieve this

1784773
width	height
what i want to achieve is a tab bar of the standard width and height correctly positioned at the bottom of the enclosing view

1784787
udp	tcp
you shouldn t have trouble deciding whether to use tcp or udp you should rely on the actual dhcp spec to determine what protocol is used

1784812
getter	setter
in c if you are creating a new struct it already has setter getter built in

1784812
getter	setter
no need to create separate setter getter interfaces and functions in c

1784843
django	turbogears
with things like django or turbogears or all the other web-frameworks you essentially set up a small stand-alone web-server which comes bundled with the framework so you don t have to do anything tell the server which function should handle what url and then write those functions

1784872
x86	64bit
all the registers in cpu of x86 are 32-bit where as for 64bit its 64bit

1784873
windows	wow64
for example on windows you have things like filesystem redirection and registry redirection wow64 when running 32-bit apps on a 64-bit windows os

1784899
x86	64bit
in x86 there are 8 32 bit registers in x64 the registers are 64bit each and there are 8 more of them

1784926
hide	show
on the other hand you may want to hide the struct entirely and only show its declaration to the clients as a kind of an opaque handle

1784933
width	height
so if you update the width and height on that as well it works

1784937
width	margin
just float right the inner main div set the outer sidebar div to be width 100 and specify that the inner main div has a left margin to allow for the sidebar margin-left 20

1784948
min	max
you either stop outputting the fields that are different or choose to aggregate them and specify which of the multiple values you want min max etc for when there are duplicates

1784958
min	max
max min sum avg

1784976
min	max
then all the other columns in the select need to be output using some aggregate function line min max avg etc.

1785018
many-to-one	one-to-many
in that case the table that changes the relationship direction from many-to-one to one-to-many is the one in the join clause

1785047
division	multiplication
and indeed as noted by mark scalar division and multiplication is also possible

1785062
imperative	declarative
i think it doesn t matter which of the terms declarative imperative functional or procedural is a subset of which

1785082
width	height
after reading a few posts i established that the issue was indeed that there was no content in the div except for a table i was trying to make the background image adjust to the size of the broswer without collapsing or expanding and therefore used a much larger image in the background of the div in order to form a cropping of sorts. the solution for me it seems was to simply cheat by placing an img tag that displayed a blank .png file that i then re-adjusted to the the correct height of the image with width set to 100

imperative	declarative
i ll add another example that rarely pops up in declarative imperative programming discussion the user interface

1785109
button	checkbox
on the imperative end you could use directx or opengl to very imperatively draw your button checkbox etc.

1785109
imperative	declarative
just because one language is declarative or imperative does not mean that it doesn t have certain features of the other

1785109
imperative	declarative
also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution

1785167
hide	show
in the user control you add a textbox and a combobox and add a method property to show one and hide another

1785191
children	parent
there may be smarter ways of accomplishing this task but the stupid quick method i would use is to modify the parent object to contain a children collection

1785191
children	parent
if you didn t want to add a children collection to your parent object you may be able to use the following xaml binding

1785194
maven	pom.xml
it is executing maven mvn commands fine but it couldnt recognizing the maven project pom.xml to run the build.so i tried to execute the same pom.xml through the command window and that is working fine could any one can help me how to solve the issue

1785199
firefox	safari
i was building an active directory single sign-on authentication system for java web applications using spnego kerberos and everything works fine with either firefox or reportedly safari but internet explorer causes an exception

multiplying	division
you might also want to create a simple hash function for hashmap entry objects to return smaller numbers to increase multiplying division performance

1785235
merb	ruby-on-rails
it allows you to do the kinds of things you re talking about and shrugs off the weight of frameworks like ruby-on-rails or merb

1785244

how can you get intellij to generate getter setter on one line like this

1785308
bmp	png
this happens with all filetypes png bmp etc...

1785321
bionic	libc
google s android in it s bionic libc implementation has a completely reimplemented elf loader

1785337
width	height
the problem is that default implementation for setters of width and height is just a mere alias to scalex and scaley .

1785337
width	height
at the same time the default getters simply return the effective width and height on screen so if you draw to the sprite it s width and height are updated accordingly .

1785364
width	height
this gets harder the more content you have but if you just have something like an image or a button or what have you it s really easy to just calculate the height and width then divide by 2 and subtract

1785370
width	height
i know where 0 0 is width 2 height 2

1785393
width	height
when creating the array add an offset to each x value equal to half of the width and an offset to y equal to half of the height

1785416
public	protected
also while defining a class is there any preferred ordering of private public protected variables methods

1785430
public	protected
generally public protected private is what i would expect - but maybe that is more from my c# time

1785441
consistency	acid
there are a lot of anti-rdbmss or base systems basically available soft state eventually consistent as opposed to acid atomicity consistency isolation durability to choose from here and here

1785471

actually here i include the actionscript file into mxml

1785567
public	protected
also while defining a class is there any preferred ordering of private public protected variables methods

1785573
switching	screens
vs2008 sp1 in visual studio 2008 sp1 having windows in non-default locations for example after docking and undocking windows when switching between debugging and designing or switching to from full screens can result in a crash of the visual studio ide

post	get
this is the point i m stuck at requiring a pre-shared key through a get post parameter would be easisest and probably the worst solution

1785726
post	get
edit i clealrly remember writing requiring a pre-shared key through a get post parameter would be easisest and probably the worst solution

1785729
google-chrome	firefox
also as an addition i use dreamweaver to write code and the background colors show up in the preview mode but do not show up in firefox google-chrome or ie

1785740
int	chars
you probably only want to do this for a few chars - once you ve read a few chars the sum becomes quite big and php can t handle it properly unless you resort to using functions suitable for large int math you can certainly use gmp and such but it may not be ideal for your case

1785746
width	height
or map your coordinates by adding half the width and half the height of the desired viewing area to each coordinate

1785746
width	height
if you don t wish to use this then you should divide x coordinates by the percent amount you wish to stretch the width and divide y coordinates by the percent amount you wish to stretch the height

1785749
centos	linux
if you re running centos linux say the default limit on open files process is 1024 so if you have a lot of classes being loaded at once and don t set the ulimit -n to a higher value the jvm will hit too many open files

width	height
try setting a width and height on the div to expand it

1785838

is it possible to use a select statement so that it returns max and min columns of a child row foreach parent record

1785838
min	max
so foreach parent record that has many child records i want to see the max and min of those child records for any given column

1785870
int	double
because the division is done with int then converted to a double

1785894
integer	fractions
integer division drops the fractions portion of the result

1785899
rss	feed
i ve installed the wordpress.org script however the rss feed just sends me errors

1785915
int	double
thus since two int s are divided by each other they will evaluate to an int solution in this case rounding towards zero before being implicitly converted to a double

1785915
int	double
as other have noted you ll need to cast the int variables as double s so the solution comes out as a double and not as an int

1785972
microchip	dspic
for example microchip s dspic devices are microcontrollers with a dsp subsystem that gives good performance per mhz for dsp algorithms such as fir and fft and microchip provide a dsp library optimised for the part

ienumerable	icollection
edit you can also create your own collection implementing icollection and ienumerable adding an arraylist as a field and raising events around your own add and remove methods

1786319
ienumerable	icollection
observablecollection also implements icollection and ienumerable so you should be able to swap it out for arraylist

1786428
hash	md5
if you are not concerned with security someone deliberately trying to break your hashing then simply using the md5 hash will give you an excellent hash with minimal effort

1786428
hash	md5
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

1786438
qthread	qobject
i modified my main class to subclass qthread instead of qobject and in the run create a qeventloop connect all signals slots and exec the thread

these two controls are very simple in that they are both grids that take up 100 width and height of what they are given

1786705
width	height
the animations i chose to start were the doubleanimation s for setting the width and height of my controls

1786705
width	height
this all means that when a user clicks on the window my two controls will at the same time over the course of 1 2 second shrink and grow in height or width

1786705
width	height
the awesome control will shrink in width and the awesomer control will shrink in height

1786705

vim	emacs
we had some light conversation for ten minutes and then one of the guys said ok now for the truly important question - vim or emacs

1786887
vim	emacs
i m guessing i won t be able to unravel the full potential of both these editors before i start so in order to pick the one which is likely to work best for me the question goes - which of vim and emacs will make me most comfortable and efficient working with c++ if i m all about visual studio at the moment

1786915
getter	setter
common practice seems to be to declare getter setter in the entity property to private and then create a partial class for the entity and declare the enum property in there

1786929
vim	emacs
both vim and emacs have pretty steep learning curves but the power you get is totally worth it

1786931
tostring	string.format
if you are trying to implement a string.format alike have you considered system.ext.text.stringbuilder.appendformat followed by a tostring

1786933
int	boolean
i ve been using int32 string and boolean instead of int string bool in c# for a while now but i don t know why

1786951
int	boolean
if i wanted to make damn sure that the int i was using was 32 bits i would use int32 but i don t see a reason for using the more verbose boolean instead of the standard alias bool

1786953
switching	screens
there s quite a lot of navigation between screens so what i d like to do is have a viewswitcher method in mainviewcontroller that the child view controllers can call to ask for the view to switching away to another child view

1786964
setinterval	settimeout
by the way there is setinterval to calling a function repeatedly at a set interval rathering than recursively calling a function with settimeout

1786973
children	parent
to make things clearer you may want to add some simple inline functions to your class for computing the indexes of the left right children and the parent given an index

1786974
getter	setter
what i was thinking though could i build these into the getter and setter methods for my date property on the linq-to-sql created object model or should i just go round the app everywhere re assigning how the value is saved adding an extra line to the controller like

1786991
put	get
and use that to get the last id inserted and put that in your new record

1786996
vim	emacs
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

1787012
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	freebsd
even better use virtualbox boot up into a full blown linux distro debian slackware freebsd ubuntu fedora you name it and use both editors to get a feel of it and you will know which you get comfortable with and stick to it

1787039
width	height
as you may guess the visual result depends on the form s width and height and this is a disasterous result

1787094
width	height
perform a linear interpolation to map the range of bits to the width height of your window

1787121
lemmatization	stemming

lemmatization and stemming are special cases of normalization

1787135
integer	fractions
multiply that integer by a fractions such as 0.5 making sure the result is also integer

1787136
getter	setter
previously in cf8 when i would cfdump an object i could view all of my setter and getter that existed in the object

1787136

versioning	upgrade
that s especially important when dealing with program storage because you can then make your programs understand previous versioning of saved files and use or upgrade them automatically

1787648
int	chars
if you then want an int in the last section of the string you need to use an escape chars and then pass the int in as another paramater

1788073
client-side	server-side
you re mixing up client-side and server-side code

1788094
client-side	server-side
the client-side approach unless the page needs data that are only available as server-side resources that aren t exposed by a web service or direct file access via http just forget the php script and do it all using javascript on the client side

1788098
hide	show
on the other hand allowing the user to hide show columns would also be good

1788141
width	height
because javascript can t be used to get image width and height

1789027
division	multiplication
when dealing with more than a single radicand the numbers are no longer closed under multiplication and division so you will need to store them as variable length rational coefficient arrays

1789037

i have a server on which i have two sites built with django and python one site is major site is build with an older versioning of django the other with the newer release i have upgrade to the new release and major aspects of my other site have broken is it possible to tell the site to use a different versioning in say the python path

1789309

use the maven-release-plugin which automates the release process execute all the steps documented in release prepare

1789408
int	double
i want to use lua that internally uses only double to represent a int that can t have rounding errors between 0 and 2 64-1 or terrible things will happen

1789429
int	double
so no a 64-bit double can t represent all the values a 64-bit int can and vice-versa

1789460
free	malloc
as per phil nash s comment for every new there is a corresponding delete likewise for every malloc there is a corresponding free

1789494
int	double
from memory a double can represent a 53-bit signed int exactly

1789515
maven	pom.xml
in your case my guess is that maven is not started in the right working directory or it should be able to find the pom.xml

1789546
hide	show
it simplifies the form layout and allows you to show and hide whole tabs depending on choices made in other tabs

1789566
folder	dir
i am pretty sure there is no other way to change the compiler used by visual studio because there is no trace of csc.exe in any solution config csproj file or whatsoever nor in the visual studio 9.0 folder subfolders within the program files dir

1789582
ant	maven
use pmd from the command line from an ant script or use maven to build your projects

1789644
uitableview	uisearchbar
the problem starts because i m adding the uisearchbar to the first section of the uitableview because if i understand correctly i must do this so i can jump to the search bar by touching the search icon in the section index directly

1789647
webclient	httpwebrequest
you need to use httpwebrequest rather than webclient as you can t set the timeout on webclient without extending it even though it uses the httpwebrequest

1789666
accessor	properties
additionally if you leave the set accessor public then the consuming code will be able to set the properties to null which can break other consuming code

1789666
accessor	properties
so a good technique to keep the consuming code from being able to set the properties value to null is to set the set accessor to be private

1789679
put	get
i m expecting to see a string such as abc or def as that is what i put in there initially but if i do a system.out.println i get something like java.lang.string#f0454

1789685
ienumerable	ilist
usually i only have a getter to my ilist members and i may even expose ienumerable or return a copy in the get but you d have to provid specific add and remove methods so ymmv

1789696
put	get
i m expecting to see a string such as abc or def as that is what i put in there initially but if i do a system.out.println i get something like java.lang.string#f0454

1789805
post	get
how do you redirecttoaction using post instead of get

1789805
post	get
i have two versions of index action in my controller one for get and another for post

1789845
outputstream	inputstream
maybe you just need to copy something from an inputstream to an outputstream every now and then

1789845
wan	lan
however if youâ re doing lots of copying in various environments network streams both lan and wan copying files on the local disk you might be better off when you have the option to select the size of the buffer used for copying

1789860
vb.net	vb6
you could write a com-visible c# or vb.net component and call it from vb6

1789863

inherited	properties
font related properties are a special case since most controls will inherited the values for font properties from the containing context

1789962
folder	directory
that directory is initialized with whatever it needs and then you store a small file in the project directory that tells you what folder the user chose

1789970
datarow	dataadapter
if you re saving your data with a dataadapter then after the save your datarow and any other rows with a datarelation pointing to that id will be updated

1789997
google-chrome	firefox
this is true for all browsers i have tested ie8 firefox google-chrome

1790008
put	get
just to get closer to the solution write a javahelp.bat or .cmd if you prefer put it on the path and call that from ruby

1790029
width	height
width 450 height 440

1790047
children	parent
what about creating a condition tree where condition objects may be simple conditions or compound conditions joining 2 simple conditions with a boolean ie andcondition parent node with children rangecondition and equalscondition

1790053
mouse	keyboard
all you should need is a main method and methods to implement the keyboard and or mouse routines

1790061
mouse	keyboard
an application that acquires the mouse or keyboard device in exclusive mode should always unacquire the devices when it receives wm_entersizemove and wm_entermenuloop messages

1790085
getter	setter
this includes getter and setter in properties

1790085
getter	setter
it s a great feature but what resharper doesn t know is that when you re designing a view which will be displayed in the designer form user ctrl that the property getter and setter are called at design time and don t show up in compilation

1790085
getter	setter
so resharper will suggest that those property s getter or setter can be made private or just removed

1790091
post	get
here a rest server will respond to http requests get post delete and suchlike to perform crud operations for persistence and most likely business core rules and security

1790096
versioning	upgrade
some people are not in control of their browser versioning and cannot upgrade it

1790108
put	get
to get rid of it just put

1790136
inherited	properties
however when you are on the person entity and add the person table for mapping you can only map the properties in the person entity not those in the inherited class

1790138
submit	submission
class user has to explicitly submit it back but it is not possible to get away without submission exceptions

1790195
addclass	removeclass
you should use toggleclass instead of addclass + removeclass

1790255
google-chrome	firefox
the style attribute isn t a string so that type of selector won t work in fact the console in google-chrome and firefox both say indexof is not a function when trying this one

1790262
maven	pom.xml
this is the python equivalent to maven pom.xml it looks something like this

1790272
accessor	properties
canread only indicates that the properties has a get accessor

1790277
mouseleave	mouseenter
i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me

1790353
versioning	upgrade
so if your team upgrade boost to a new versioning you could simply change the include path in the .sln or .vsprops files to make the compiler search for the new versioning -- if a coworker hasn t installed the right versioning he just won t be able to build which might be preferable to silently building with an old versioning

1790428
selecteditem	selectedindex
it seems that the listbox is populated after the initialization and the selectedindex will become 0 after all.same story for setting the selecteditem to null

1790454
int	boolean	int	chars
for sure object keys cannot contain spaces or any non unicode chars unquoted variables can be only boolean int float object and array value strings should always be quoted

1790470
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
there are at least 3 different ways to implement the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libraries like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

1790470
outputstream	inputstream
if i had to implement that then i would create an xmlfilter that takes in xml and writes xml out stacking that on top of another piece that writes xml to an outputstream and writing a wrapper method around the unmarshalling stuff to feed the incoming stream to the xmlreader copy the outputstream to another inputstream an easy way is to use commons-io and feed the new inputstream to the castor unmarshaller

1790470
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
using xom or jdom or dom4j to wrap the xml is also possible and the learning curve is a lot lower than for sax or xslt

1790473
jsf	seam
how is that possible with jsf seam

1790475
calloc	malloc
variables stored on the heap are the variables which you initiated using explicit memory allocation routines such as malloc calloc new etc

1790500
jtextpane	jeditorpane
so i have a gap between in-memory result of xsl transformation and javax.swing.text.styleddocument which can be rendered by jeditorpane or jtextpane

1790506
selecteditem	selectedindex
that should de-select everything since index -1 doesn t exist but as far as i m aware unless you explicitly set the default selecteditem the listview is generated with nothing selected so it s possible that selectedindex has been inadvertently set at some point

1790537
postgresql	mysql
i m an oracle guy myself yet sometimes i find it hard to argue its use over postgresql or even mysql

1790566
profiling	debugging
if so then i would debugging profiling it for any performance matters leaks

does anyone know how to calculate the ratio for height against width

1790610
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup - if lxml fails on your input try this

1790624
factors	mean	width	height
if you mean the aspect ratio of a height and width it s just height width reduced to its greatest common factors

1790624
width	height
replace 1600 and 1200 with the width and height you want respectively

1790645
post	put
i ll leave the question open big thanks to everyone who put their hat in the ring it was all useful and if anyone comes up with anything further i d love to hear some more options...and if anyone finds this post as a result of seeing this behaviour in their own environments then hopefully there s some pointers here that you can try yourself and hope fully see further than we did

1790676
super	extends
why is the super constructor recommended to be called when extends any of the rim screen classes

1790676
super	extends
it was my understanding that the no-arg constructor of any super class was implicitly called from any class that extends it am i wrong

1790698

rss	feed
i have a rss feed for each wishlist

1790780
rss	feed
it would be very easy to generate your users code and you might even be able to make use of your rss feed for this

1790818
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
all other browsers opera firefox google-chrome don t see the style for #right and thus don t apply it

1790865
pop-up	dialog
i am using jquery ui dialog for modal pop-up

1790920
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if you absolutely need the sorting feature you could consider using a sorteddictionary instead of a sortedlist

1790921
apache	nginx
serve all user uploaded content with nginx instead of apache and serve it all as static content it will not run any of the php or cgi even if the users upload it

1790956
post	get
you could think of other solutions like copying all post data and doing a get request to your second form or storing all data in a temporary table transmitting an id to your second form and load the corresponding data there but i guess this implies modifying your second form and is not really acceptable

1791030
wav	aiff
if i m not mistaken sun s vm has built-in support for aiff au and wav files

1791050
entities	entitymanager
my problem arises the moment any entities are loaded in my entitymanager session before i launch my query

1791068
width	text-align
it seems like it s only the text-align center that s not correctly respecting the full width

1791071
width	height
this might need position height and width attributes as well to work

1791161
lxml	libxml2
btw another answer recommended lxml which is a python library but is actually built on libxml2

1791161
lxml	libxml2
if lxml worked well for him chances are libxml2 is going to work well for you

1791200
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in both firefox and google-chrome with flash v

1791221
post	get
i just want a ruby script to sit on the server get passed a few variables in a post request and return a json string in response

1791286
firefox	safari
web browsers like firefox internet explorer or safari are an exception because they don t lock open files and flex builder is able to re-compile even though your application is running in the browser of course you will need to hit refresh in your browser to see any further changes

1791298
post	get
the issue i have with that is that i must post data and jsonp only allows for get

1791315
put	get
for example if you have a variable of type array and you use it as a key to put something into a hash and then you add something to the array and try to use that variable as the key to get the something back out of the hash it won t work as the array s hash value has changed

1791316
entity-relationship	entities
the entity-relationship model allows you to manage entities vacancies career levels education independently and then assign manage relationships between those entities

1791356
width	height
if you choose the x y and height width for your new custom text to be the same as for the static installtext the installtext will be obscured

1791356
button	checkbox
you could add multiple text controls or...you can add lines button checkbox whatever

1791403
for-loop	loops
so while in a for-loop most of the time i m adding a boolean varible to simple exit loops

1791414
getter	setter
writing is allowed then i would use separate getter and setter methods rather than properties

1791444
versioning	upgrade
ability to try out different versioning or upgrade quickly

1791451
post	get
this common pattern is known as the post redirect get pattern

1791451
post	get
bonus info about keeping state when doing post redirect get

1791451
post	get
if you generate some kind of status object - maybe a log of sent mail messages - while handling the post request you will need some way to save this object for the following get request

1791451
post	get
saving the object to the session on the post reading and deleting it on the following get would be one way to solve this

1791500
haskell	scheme
a well-known downside of lazy functional programming applies to haskell or clean but not to ml or scheme or clojure is that it is very difficult to predict the time and space costs of evaluating a lazy functional program mdash

1791531
width	height
is there any way to read the width and height of a flash object using jquery

1791617
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
when i click sort or change page index and the results have not returned and do it again click sort or page index while it is busy the selectedindexchanged and textchanged events fires on some of the controls

1791671
keyup	mouseup
in ie only the select event applies to body text as well as form inputs so would do what you want but to detect when the user has made a selection in a cross-browser way you will need to handle both keyup and mouseup events

1791681
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
using a case-insensitive file search on the case-sensitive server should only be a last resort

1791809
printf	strlen
no that just shifts the problem of detecting the end of the string from printf to strlen and it s still exactly the same

1791832
terminate	timeout
if the thread always terminate the main thread after 60 seconds perhaps you d be better using thread.join in your main thread with a timeout

1791832
post	get
if you post some example code that explains your problem and a deeper explanation of what you are trying to achieve with it you ll get some better responses

1791838
printf	strlen
on the other hand since strlen str determines string length by counting the number of characters before a null is encountered it doesn t offer you any benefit over just using printf without a field width specified

1791838
printf	strlen
the upshot the only case where specifying a field width for a string is helpful is when the string isn t guaranteed to be null-terminated or the classic case of using printf to write to a buffer that may not be big enough to hold the contents of str but in that case you d have to determine string length using something other than strlen

1791840
wordpress	joomla
the most common used cmses are of course wordpress joomla and drupal

1791861
int	chars	int	double
you should be able to convert those chars to int values using the double function

1791861
int	double
you could also leave off the call to int16 to just leave the result as type double the value it stores would still be an int

1791949
stdout	stderr
btw i do have separate threads for reading stderr and stdout and that s the way to go

1791950
ilist	iqueryable
implement my own iorderedenumerable which is risky too because i perform ordering on iqueryable or ilist then i perform other linq operations so i fear side effects

1791951
getter	setter
i m accesing profile properties with getter and setter so i don t need the profilecommon class

1791977
switching	screens
if you haven t used the facebook app the effect i m after is the same as switching pages on the home screens of the iphone

1792063
google-chrome	firefox
the row_to_insert var get filled with the xml fine in firefox but is empty in ie and google-chrome

post	get
let s say you had an array of post objects and you wanted to get sum the number of comments

1792180
width	height
the width and height look ok in ib

1792196
int	chars
public int compare chars x chars y

1792207
next	except
naturally i avoided reusing variables for other purposes and no code outside this function sees them so i don t need to worry about their values changing from one line to the next -- except when i explicitly do so

1792243
uiview	subviews
subviews is an array of uiview not uiviewcontrollers

1792253
boost	stl
usually people are concerned about not including stl and the solution is just include the stl headers. however boost is a much more massive and compiler-intensive library so i d prefer to leave it out unless i absolutely have to

1792279
pascal	delphi	ada	pascal
you can take parts of the style guide of other pascal derivatives ada is based on modula which is based on pascal like delphi which feel a bit closer to home for pl sql i use a mixture of .net delphi

1792307
filtering	grouping
if you re filtering on the totals by this row grouping you cannot have a field indicating if row is excluded or not in a dataset

1792307
filtering	grouping	hide	show
i need to filtering out negative totals per patients patient row grouping but i have column grouping as well - per month so my dataset cannot be per-patient granularity and therefore the only place ssrs can decide whether to hide or show the row is on the row grouping level.

1792370
postgresql	mysql
i think you ll find that postgresql works a lot better for nearly any workload olap especially than mysql

1792370
postgresql	greenplum
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases

1792414
post	get
curl performs actions pertaining to http requests and other networking protocols but i d bet http is the most-used. you can set http cookies along with get post variables

1792583
post	put

1792614
apache	nginx
it is a module for apache and nginx to host rails and rack applications

1792619
getter	setter
that way if you need to make changes you want to extend it from just mapping integer data to complex numbers then you would create new setter and getter so that you insulate the data from the application and you are free to change the implementation all you want with little care as long as you keep to the contracts you already agreed to

1792619
int	double
so if you state that int arrays can be used in the constructor or as a setter then allow that but also allow other types ie double complexdatatype for example

1792633
post	get
if you serialize the data it should be sent to php as query parameters if you are using a get method ajax request or post vars if you are using a post ajax request

1792677
post	put
the way to do it yourself would be to read up on how the body of a post request is put together it looks a lot like a url query string build the string out of the various parts and then use the request s -sethttpbody method

1792683
put	get
if i put it into irb alone i get syntax error unexpected tamper

1792703

and finally get and post are disabled by default because of security

1792864
httprequest	httpresponse
all of the raw data is present between httprequest and httpresponse it just isn t in a single raw format

1792913
cvs	svn
notice though that it won t give you a revision number of the file as in cvs svn

1792925
ssl	https	ssl	ntlm	kerberos	ntlm
and see if you could accomplish your goals by a different method - for eg user authentication using a supported method like basic over https digest ntlm kerberos negotiate or use ssl with client certs

1792933
sorting	filtering
that is filtering and sorting data

1792942
postgresql	mysql

a quadtree would be fine for your purposes but remember that when you re dealing with non-points you have to put the rectangle in a node that contains all of the quadrants it intersect

1793044
ant	maven
however if you re going to have antlr producing code for you anyway why not go one step further and have your build script ant maven ... wrap that code into a jar for you

map two lists into a dictionary in python

1793210
int	double
no you cannot use double to store 64-bit int without losing precision

1793252
actualheight	actualwidth
my guess it allows all layout passes to finish and then simply copies values of actualwidth and actualheight properties

1793252
width	height
i believe that actual default value for either of width and height properties is the double.nan value

1793256
resx	al.exe

ienumerable	iequalitycomparer	ienumerable	icomparer	ienumerable	ienumerator	iequalitycomparer	ienumerator	icomparer	iequalitycomparer
ideally the recommendations would provide guidance on such questions as when to use icomparer or iequalitycomparer ienumerable or ienumerator

1796916
client-side	server-side
i also like to use server-side performance counters and monitoring in addition to or sometimes instead of client-side measurement

1796937
overwrite	preserve
main idea is that behavior of the hash was preserve and after attempt to assign value to using existing key it wouldn t be overwrite but appended to the list

1796956
post	get
it s not part of the script you have posted but i think the most important thing you need to do is make sure you are first escaping your get post vars before using them to query the database

1796970
ienumerable	ienumerator
also many of the generic interfaces themselves implement non-generic versions ienumerable implements ienumerable and ienumerator implements ienumerator.

1796972
jtable	jlabel
i remember binding a jlabel s text to a column in the selected row of the jtable before but in that case the jtable s values were from an entity manager and it was very easy

1796980
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerator and ienumerable are connected an ienumerable traditionally creates an ienumerator to do the enumeration

1797084
int	boolean
the benefit to both and most other json libraries for java is that they handle marshalling most native java object types to sane json equivalents -- in other words they make it easy to add the contents of a variable to a json structure whether the variable s an int long string boolean whatever

1797091
min	max
in a preprocessing step we calculate the min and max of the object and use this to maximize the utilization of the precision in a short

edit one workaround i used was to add a predetermined set of server controls to the page and then use javascript to hide show those elements

1797324
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
generally speaking a subclassing will have a vtable pointer to each of the multiple superclass it inherited from assuming obviously that each of those classes have at least one virtual function

if take a look at the extjs api particulary the colummodel there is a sethidden method it would hide show a column in a gridpanel

1797700
hide	show
you should also hook the onchange event of your check box so you can show or hide the column

1797704
dictionary	map
just create a map dictionary hashtable that maps rowid strings to an incremented long

1797705

a the xmlserializer only serializes the elements in the collection when it detects either the ienumerable or the icollection interface

1798021
rsa	aes
as i understand your procedure you re using the rsa public key as an aes symmetric key

1798021
rsa	aes
what you should be doing is creating a random aes key encrypting it with the rsa public key and then sending the encrypted key along with the encrypted data

1798021
rsa	aes
this way the data will only be readable by people who have the private rsa key as anyone else wouldn t be able to decrypt the symmetric aes key

1798614
stdout	fflush
this is done by the c libraries and so there is a c solution which is to fflush stdout

1798628
strsplit	substr
usually you use strsplit to break a string in parts but with substr there s an easier solution for your problem

1798633
google-chrome	firefox
current versions of ie firefox google-chrome are not

free	malloc
if all of the messages are similar consider using a trash stack - this way you can keep a stack of allocated-yet-uninitialized message structures that you can reuse without taking the constant malloc free hit

1798771
stdout	stderr
the console based sub-processes communicate via stdin stdout and stderr and if you run them in a genuine console they terminate cleanly when you press ctrl+c

1798782
boost	stl
also probably stl and boost have something like these too

1798785
folder	directory
there should be an src directory in your jdk folder perhaps a zip

1798810
strsplit	substr
if your question is how do i split a string delimited by a known separator you can use stringtokenizer strsplit with a regex or string.indexof combined with substr

1798828
post	get
clarification i realize that an anonymous callback function would allow me to access both but for various reasons too lengthy to get into in this post i need to use a function call rather than the anonymous function

1798833

its unfortunate that the structure of nested states is one of a parent containing children the designer ui re-enforces this concept

1799041
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
also parameterised constructor of superclass is not inherited by subclassing

1799041
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in fact logically a subclassing never inherited the constructors or destructors of the superclass

1799092
rational-numbers	integer	division	multiplication
the sort of constructions you re talking about will require multiplication and division which means that to preserve exactness you ll have to use rational-numbers which are generally easy to implement on top of a suitable sort of big integer of unbounded magnitude

1799125
pop-up	dialog
there are a number of things you might have meant by when i upload it it doesn t do anything other than i create an applet jar and upload it to my server then reference it in an applet tag of an html page and when i open the page the security warning dialog pop-up but i click it and nothing further occurs

inherited	properties
now if i declare a class and inherited from the interface i need to create the properties called parent

1799202
floating-point	fractions
data can be lost when floating-point representations are converted to integral representations as the fractions components of the floating-point values will be truncated rounded down

1799202
floating-point	integer
conversely converting from an integral representation to a floating-point one can also lose precision since the floating-point type may be unable to represent the integer exactly for example float might be an ieee 754 single precision type which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly while a 32-bit integer type can

1799202
int	chars
in the case of c and c++ the value of an expression of integral types longs int shorts chars is the largest integral type in the expression

this shouldn t be a problem for most out-of-the-box mainstream distros like ubuntu debian with gnome installed but don t expect it to work everywhere

1799371
folder	directory
in the eclipse workspace and within my project directory i have a folder sprites with the gif images stored there

1799386
put	get
as i mention if you put a uiview on top of the uiwebview you can get the touches and pass them to the webview but that is not perfect also because you cant click on links and zoom and all that stuff you are only able to scroll

listview	gridview
everything is nice and shining and i managed to write a small application that meets my needs but i noticed that many times for instance when i click a button or a listview the event is handled listview selection is changed but the area under the mouse is not updated so a small rectangle at the place where the mouse pointer was is not updated â the background color of the entire gridview selected item line is turned to dark blue but there is a white rectangle area where the mouse was

1799484
getter	setter
in their developer articles for android google states that you should usually declare public variables rather than private ones with getter and setter to enhance performance on embedded devices i suppose function calls are more expensive than just writing to an address

1799511
onresize	onload
you can use the code and function calls inside onload and onresize body events

1799521
getter	setter
as for getter and setter

1799521
getter	setter
the advantage of using getter and setter is that you can log changes to parameters and do some input validation

1799521
getter	setter
but i can t really believe that getter and setter can t be optimized away by using for example final classes

1799532
hide	show
you ll need to trap all selection related operations on the list control and show hide or move and update the contents of the combo box

1799549
pull	push
and if your inside a function you typically want to push pull your return address to the stack before and after the function call respectively otherwise you will end up in an infinite loop

1799567
getter	setter
how many times have you ever had to replace a getter or a setter that just read wrote-to a field with a method that actually did something

1799574
for-loop	loops
in a nutshell i have a for-loop updating a dynamic text element but it seems to iterate so fast that only the last item in loops is updating the text

1799606
777	tmp
maybe you can try testing for a file on tmp with 777 as it permission bits

1799607
getter	setter
in particular if you re choosing between trivial pass-through getter setter methods and public variables you re already most of the way down the breaking encapsulation road so you might as well not pay the extra performance hit for no gain in flexibility

1799611
getter	setter
now google indeed tell use to avoid getter and setter but only for an internal use api should still expose only getter and setter

1799626
notepad++	textpad
i mostly use notepad++ and textpad on windows 7 and they both work fine

1799653

as others have mentioned handle the keydown or keyup event of the appropriate control

1799931

i have a course about linux programming at school it except it s on ubuntu and library changes for input output and some thread related linux specific all it s the same

1799962
int	boolean	waitpid	posix

1799984
folder	dir
by total disk space and available disk space in a folder i refer to the total and available disk space that this folder would report if you performed a dir command on it that is the total and available disk space of the logical drive containing that folder considering the user account under which the request is being made

1800042
pull	push
you could use the push pull parser to jump between tags

1800051

1800310
backtracking	greedy
if you let the greedy dot gobble up everything up to the end of the file quick and then backtracking until you find a line that starts with words or spaces tabs but no newlines and then class or interface and 1 then that doesn t require as much stack space

1800312

1800528
post	put
i meant to put that into the original post since i knew someone would mention it

1800531
filtering	grouping
in order to accomplish this what i ve done is created a sql query where i join the events for each location and then grouping by the location name and only use location grouping having more than 10 entries that filtering out the somewhat non-reliable entries but i still end up with some very different spellings and entries resulting in duplicate properties locations

1800536
int	double
finally image wants either int between 0 and 255 or double between 0 and 1.0 so you need to cast or rescale your numbers

1800555
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
in addition the monodevelop ide is also built in c# and gtk# originally based on sharpdevelop

1800570

i upgrade my pysqlite2 installation to the newest versioning so that extensions can be loaded and i specified spatialite_library_path in my settings file

1800612
getter	setter
google does not say to avoid getter setter and make your variables public for android

1800612
getter	setter
they do advise to not use getter setter from within a class to access its own fields

1800612
getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter

1800612
getter	setter
it s reasonable to follow common object-oriented programming practices and have getter and setter in the public interface but within a class you should always access fields directly.

1800617
hide	show
i frequently have objects in my pages that i want to activate deactivate hide show etc. but - having missed the rigorous introduction to javascript - i ve no idea how these things get named

nfa	dfa
this however neglected the fact that the number of states in the dfa after conversion from an nfa can end up being 2 m where m is the number of states in the nfa

1800671
nfa	dfa
so for now i m just going to go ahead with the regex nfa dfa approach

1800712
implements	extends
the only way to change types is to assign a different instance of a compatible type to the variable if the variable will accept types implements foo and types foo1 and foo2 both implements extends foo then an instance of either can be assigned to the variable

1800864
public	protected
i have some attributes which are const so should these attributes be made public or protected

1800864

i am aware of the biginteger.probableprime int bitlength random but i am not sure how or even if the bitlength translates into a max min value of the outputted prime

1801056
post	get
i am also suspecting that flex may be on-connection-drop automatically retrying the post or get request resulting in our server receiving the request twice

1801057
put	get
because parsechildren was true the child controls would be put into a property rather than into the containing control s child controls collection and would never get their onprerender function called

the message will be displayed only if the mouse didn t move too much between the down and up events a normal click should trigger it a drag shouldn t

1801943
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine

1801943
innodb	myisam
then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1801943
innodb	myisam
even if you later discover and fix the innodb problem all tables created during the problem remain myisam

1801955
public	protected
nonlegacy may make it protected or public as appropriate but defaulting to the same accessibility as its base class is a good idea.

1801977
boost	allocator
i would not expect anybody working for me to be an expert in all facets of boost but i do expect even fairly inexperienced c++ programmers to know where they can find it and that they will be better off using code from boost rather than trying to say write their own pooled memory allocator

filesystems	ntfs
but the case conversion table is stored on the filesystems itself for ntfs and it does change between versions for instance the vista case conversion table was brought to the unicode 5 level so vista ntfs and xp ntfs have different case conversion rules

1802477
width	height
assumption 2 you have several types of roof-related jobs and you want to issue a cost depending on the width height pitch and type

1802477
width	height
your roof table would need at least colums for width height pitch and type type of roof

1802477
width	height
but if you don t want to store width height and pitch on your database you would have to create a module in your lib directory and implements validations yourself

1803139
memcached	apc
you want to compare apc key-value store vs memcached right

1803139
memcached	apc
well on a single machine apc k-v cache is way faster than memcached

1803139
memcached	apc
memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only

1803139
memcached	apc
however if you use multi-threads or multi_get with memcached it gets very close to apc performance

1803306
updatepanel	onclientclick
if you have an updatepanel that displays a number in its load method and a button as a trigger and you make the button have an onclientclick method that increments the number the updatepanel will not update when you click it

1803306
updatepanel	onclientclick
this is because the updatepanel load method runs before the onclientclick method so it draws the number on the screen before it increments it

1803306
updatepanel	scriptmanager
at the moment i get around this by using the scriptmanager to tell me which button or whatever caused the updatepanel to trigger and then i use that to run the increment method before it renders which works

1803319
spotify	last.fm
also the licensing from both likely prevents you from doing what your suggesting your best bet is with last.fm spotify has an incredibly restrictive api

don t try to banish like cakephp and codeigniter do there s nothing wrong with them

1804188

ready	each
then all i had to do was open the file from access and it would be ready to be updated on the fly each time i wanted to run it

1804400
put	get
basically this is used so that attackers can t get the url and include it on their page and have javascript now put the variables on the page because as soon as the request has been serviced the browser will go into an infinite loop not allowing other javascrip access to said variables which would potentially allow attackers to use your browser to get information that is meant to stay private

1804412
int	chars
on the other hand types such as int and chars are the same for a given platform so you can pass them

versioning	upgrade
i m working on a number of delphi applications that will need to upgrade their own database structures in the field when new versioning are released and when users choose to install additional modules

1804464
versioning	upgrade
i can see two ways of implementing this storing a versioning number with the database and using ddl scripts to get from older versioning to newer versioning or storing a reference versioning of the database structure inside the application comparing the reference to the database on start-up and having the application generate ddl commands to upgrade the database

1804468

can you try to redirect your stream stdout to a custom view with a swt text in it leaving stderr to the default console

1804566
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch statements and correct me if i m wrong don t get considered at runtime until they re required an exception-handling is thrown

1804566
try-catch	exception-handling
so simply wrapping your code in a try-catch will not affect performance until an exception-handling is actually caught by it

1804586
rel	attr
#somediv attr rel itsval

directx	gdi
for the glass effect areas i think it doesn t work because those areas may be drawn with some strange directx method instead of normal gdi

1804641
post	get
as noted in the codeplex post where i specified the requirements i implemented a basic stripper with mono.cecil but ended up leveraging the fact that unused references get optimised out in a release build to strip tests out by excluding them based on a #define which i control from outside via the msbuild invocation

pull up push down

1804873

in fact originally the streams were added to ntfs for interoperability with other filesystems

1809777
installation	upgrade
for handling installation and upgrade of our application we use the debian packaging system

1809777
versioning	upgrade
fresh install and upgrade for a versioning to another are made through puppet a system for automating system administration tasks he install our .deb

1809777
versioning	upgrade
you can pick any of our .deb and make a fresh install or upgrade from the actual versioning to the versioning number he hold

1809803
hash	md5
password hashing or any other form of encryption or hashing should be done within your script and not through other client server requests ie create password hash before sending them to mysql dont do insert into users values 1 jblow md5 password as this query is viewable in logs and by administrators of the sql server

1809833
memcpy	memset
there are one or two people who have re-written many of the core c primatives memcpy memset etc

1809835
octal	decimal
the reason phpseclib expects permissions to be represented as an octal value 0755 is cast to a decimal value - not an octal one is because that s how ftp_chmod does it and that s what net_sftp chmod is modeled after

1809867
pull	push
would there be more advantages using a pull observer requests updates to game data or push server pushes out new updated data to all clients approach

1809873
opera	firefox
opera only has limited javascript 1.7 support which includes very basic support of destructuring assignment so this won t work in opera but it will work in firefox

1809886
rubymine	radrails
i ve tried netbean radrails and rubymine

1809896
versioning	upgrade
you can guide a user to install an upgrade versioning instead of the existing one by pointing to the upgrade midlet s jad in a platformrequest but they have to remove it on their own

1809931
setinterval	settimeout
might it be possible to convert an asynchronous xmlhttprequest into a quasi-synchronous one using either setinterval or settimeout

1809931
setinterval	settimeout
the idea being that upon success of the ajax request a variable will be set which will be the signal for a while loop that has called either setinterval or settimeout and a callback function as appropriate to exit

1809931
setinterval	settimeout
of setinterval and or settimeout

1809934
put	get
to get anywhere beyond keys you need to perform your checks at application level before you put an entity or a change to a unique set of properties you make a suitable query key-only for speed and check that it comes up empty but that gets pretty costly and hard to make transaction-safe

1809979
config	ini
as the value is not only used by the rails app i would probably store such config information in a language agnostic format yaml json ini xml which can be easily parsed by different tools without fear of possible side effects

1809980
memcached	apc
look into caching - opcode caching for the php pages and memory caching apc memcached for reference data and other static or close to static data

1810020
width	height
in this case the original image width height are 270 and 438 and the image was developed on 192dpi screen

1810037
width	height
ok ive found out the reason it doesnt show is because the video sometimes has a width and height of 0 pixels

1810074
width	height
resize both width and height by a percent

1810074
width	height
if you need a given width newwidth for example then calculate the percent of newwidth width 100 and calculate the height based on the resulting percent as above

1810094
put	get
you define a dataconstract for your data entities and an operation get put dataset

1810105
post	get
i have a few forms which are in get instead of post

1810124
redmine	trac
i ve happily used trac and redmine for various personal projects

1810124
redmine	trac
trac is written in python while redmine is written in ruby leveraging the rails framework

1810124
redmine	trac
redmine has built-in multiple project feature while trac planned supporting it in 0.12 already available in a branch

1810124
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
redmine supports svn cvs git mercurial bazaar and darcs

1810130
put	get
you can get past the lock by specifying the with nolock hint in your select statement put it just after the table name but be very careful as it will read data that has not been committed something that might be rolled back

1810167
octal	hex
your programming language will doubtless use other regexes eg think about tokens for hex literals octal literals float doubles and comments in c c++ java

1810182
put	get
when i put the link in i get the following error

1810199
hash	md5
you can use a one way hash like md5 or sha-2 to sign a message to make it harder to forge or alter but there s no practical way to convert the hash back into a message

1810203
verilog	vhdl
i ve checked this and it works but i m more comfortable in verilog so this code may no be the nicest vhdl ever.

1810217
ubuntu	linux
i am actually successfully running a production website with asp.net mvc under mono in a ubuntu lts linux

1810235
decoder	encoder
serialization short-lived structure one encoder decoder

1810235
serializable	deserialization
personally i tried as much as i can to separate the code of serializable deserialization from the actual code that runs the class

1810235
serializable	deserialization
i usually try to keep serializable and deserialization of one version close together

1810246
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
you should not only md5 your passwords but add salt value and hash resulting password multiple times then save salt and hash string in database

1810294
put	get
it ll get the same end result as method two but in a nice repeatable way which can put into source control

1810299
fgets	strlen
when you read data with fgets it may be placed into buffer but when you transmit it everything after 0 gets lost your strlen call ensures this

1810306
128bit	64bit
you may want to have a second look at the infinity requirement and check if say 64bit or 128bit counter still can satisfy your algorithms for some limited period of time like 1000 years

1810312
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for some kind addon for browser firefox opera ie google-chrome etc... which can easily highlight element s which i define by jquery selector

1810317
gridview	linqdatasource
so now i have a gridview that uses a linqdatasource that is connected to the aspnet_membership table

1810325
sorting	grouping
it does this by creating a view which is a separate copy of your items source with your grouping and sorting applied to it

1810390
mouse	keyboard
but i need to disable mouse and keyboard so it wouldn t interrupt playback

1810390
mouse	keyboard
is there a easy way to block mouse and keyboard input while still using sendinput

1810416
set	bag
the other facet â whether the set permits duplicate elements â is meaningless in mathematics and is more accurately described as a bag

1810422
hide	show
in this case just hide the div or span that the updatepanel creates rather than trying to hide show a a new outer container

1810452
postgresql	mysql
some mail servers can store login information in databases like mysql or postgresql

1810456
google-chrome	firefox
it happened as expected in google-chrome firefox ie8

1810485
int	chars
i m calling this code within a loop and whats strange is that it correctly converts the first 47 chars then on the 48th chars it adds a 0 after the int on the 49th chars it adds a 1 on the 50th seen here it adds a two all the way up to the 57th chars where it adds a 9 then it continues to convert correctly all the way down to the 239th chars

1810501
strtol	atoi
also atoi doesn t provide any way to detect errors so prefer strtol and similar functions

1810514
post	put	post	get	put	get
the format of the xml for post and put or the url for get and delete and the deserialization of the response is done in helper methods

1810530
decoder	encoder
you need a json encoder decoder to do that

1810538
voip	sip
this reasonably high-level tutorial has lots of information including common voip questions and a discussion of sip functions and book recommendations

1810542
getter	setter
generate getter and setter is also a feature i find to save time when writing java beans

1810594
for-loop	loops
in your for-loop i ve created two variables l and si that store fsel.si.length and fsel.si respectively so that javascript doesn t have to look up the si and length properties every time around loops

1810597
folder	directory
for extra security you may rename the system folder to something else people can t guess or move the system folder two levels up to your home directory

1810606
haskell	agda
you can have a look at languages like haskell or even agda

1810640
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome rendered this ok firefox pushed the form button too far up

1810644
ocaml	sml
you can take a look if you want ocaml and sml are very close languages

1810649
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it works as expected but in ie8 safari and google-chrome it waits until all the code is processed and then shows the whole text

1810684
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview using a linqdatasource with a datamodelcontext that i ve created

1810728
srp	ocp	srp	principles	ocp	principles
i would argue that you are violating two principles the single responsibility principles srp and the open closed principles ocp

1810728
srp	ocp
now my bootstrapping code adheres to both srp and ocp

1810753
cout	ofstream
so i overloaded the operator of the binarytree class to use cout tree and ofstream f tree but i receive the next error message undefined reference to operator std basic_ostream binarytree

1810787
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox the tw cen mt is displayed great but in ie times new roman is displayed

1810838
std	ostream
friend std ostream operator std ostream os binarytree tree

1810864
ienumerable	ilist
nonetheless you should implement the ienumerable interface the ilist interface etc.

1810872
crossover	mutation
mutation crossover selection population gene - all this are separate classes

1810891
filtering	grouping
now my question is how can i take the myuser field and filtering it so only users of grouping foo show up

1810908
width	height
i guess you problem is that the textview is centered since you use fill_parent on both height and width on the parent linearlayout

1810918
min	max
i ve tried to change the min size max size and preferred size settings for the mainpanel with no success

1810926
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
remember to override equals gethashcode and tostring when doing so

1810941
getter	setter
the telerik controls are based on asp.net ajax and use pretty much the same coding conventions - public properties have getter and setter methods

1810941
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods are public and you are free to use them

1810943
hide	show
the next message should be show when the firs hide

1810963
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

1811033
gw-basic	qbasic
then it is likely that he would be able to load it in any of gw-basic 3.32 qbasic quickbasic and perhaps even visual basic and then be able to use this command

1811059
calloc	malloc
when using malloc it would be better to calloc instead as it initializes memory to zero instead

1811071
post	get
take a look at my blog post in which i show the speed up you get when you run a simple linq query in parallel using the asparallel extension method

1811119
hide	show
actually this is over-kill unless some items are show and some are hidden - if you know for a fact that all items are initially visible you can use the greater-than selector to simply hide items with index 8 and above - as corey demonstrates

1811134
getter	setter
and that the form uses getter and setter methods of the class to work with those attributes

1811134
getter	setter
disadvantage is that the populated hash instance will probably use more memory than your fixed set of attributes accessed via getter and setter methods

1811134
getter	setter
getter setter should be quicker too - no hashing of the key object is needed - a method is associated with only one stored value

1811140
put	get
when data has been put in the text box and enter is pressed all i get is a ding

1811157
post	get
so i m using this plugin jquery-in-place-editor i m trying to make a post request according to the docs but i m not sure what url to do the post to i can t seem to get it right

1811167
fast-forward	merge
the second isn t a merge updating in hg is equivalent to fast-forward there s nothing to merge

1811186
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox safari and google-chrome

1811195
sorting	filtering
i prefer to use a subform to a list as it features lots of column sorting and filtering functions

1811219
ubuntu	debian
i use debian and ubuntu so the main log file for me is var log syslog

1811233
onresume	onpause
using onpause and onresume to start and stop the timeout gives me the following semantics

1811262
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so far i m looking at a uitabbarcontroller with uinavigationcontroller in each pane with a little custom code to pop the navigation controller on the target tab back to the root on a tab switch

1811281
accessor	properties
any way you can do the setup processing in the load event instead of the properties accessor

1811316
put	get
all the tables get created correctly but nothing ever gets put in the userfriends table and every user that comes back has an empty friends list

1811318
superclass	subclassing
the problem is that the overriding method from the subclassing might be called on the object before the superclass initialization has completed

1811330
xlib	xcb
while another language and set of libraries are technically possible i think the best language choice would be c and the xlib or xcb libraries

1811330
xlib	xcb
xcb - a 21st century replacement for xlib

1811356
xlib	xcb
you can use the xlib bindings for your language of choice or you can use the higher-level xcb bindings

1811356
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
conforming to these means your window manager will behave nicely in gnome kde xfce and any other desktop environment that comes along although simply ignoring them is certainly easier on your first try

1811361
cpu	affinity
i don t think its cpu affinity that you have to worry about so much its how i o bound each process is bound pardon the pun to become

1811376
pop-up	dialog
when i run this by itself i get a dialog box that pop-up and i can get the results in tabular format

1811378
std	ostream
std cout is an std ostream object so you have to overload for ostream which takes as an argument assuming you use from the standard header complex

1811378
std	ostream	ostream	istream
takes a std istream object which does the opposite of what std ostream does

1811378
cout	cin
i assumed you wanted to use cin and cout here

1811391
width	height
you can change the width and height as well though it only works for certain combinations 336x280 120x300 160x300 125x125 120x90 234x60

1811391
width	height
the default width and height is 250px by 250px

1811423
vbscript	jscript
users can write some vbscript jscript code and feed the server

1811450
config	ini
the ini file starts with a to ensure that if the config file is loaded it won t execute any code

1811452
config	ini
it simply declares the config from an ini file within an array

1811526
retaincount	dealloc
rather than clientx calling bossofeverthing removemefromyourclientlist from its dealloc method it calls it from its release method only when retaincount 1

1811526
super	self
if bossofeverthing removemefromyourclientlist returns no to clientx release then clientx release calls self performselector selector release withobject nil afterdelay 0.1 otherwise it just calls super release

1811527
redmine	trac
with assembla you also get a copy of trac which will give you a project management system as well though i ve used trac for the past 3 years now i ve since moved onto redmine

1811536
beautytips	hoverintent
beautytips works with hoverintent to give time to the user to click on the tooltip link

1811607
profiling	instrumentation
i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer tools

1811708
post	get
it s all covered pretty well in the documentation but feel free to post to t he google group if you get stuck or something doesn t make sense

1811720
free	strdup
if you do use strdup be sure to free the result later

1811721
switching	screens
i ve already started with this code as a base i just need to plot the locations of hospitals without switching to another screens

1811728
free	strdup
i dislike strdup because it returns a heap allocated string and in the case of your functions it should be clearly documented that the user of the functions has to free it

1811737
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
to test that paste following in address bar firefox and opera fails while ie8 and google-chrome is working

1811747
stdout	stderr
stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.stdout

1811749
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
then in the viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods i can use the navigationcontroller to display the toolbar

1811753
button	checkbox
select the characters radio button and pick a character type and then click the numbers checkbox

1811766
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
surely when the new view controller s view is added and becomes visible it will call the viewdidappear rather than the viewwillappear

1811769
dylan	smalltalk
to a degree this technique can be simulated using what smalltalk calls double dispatch but there s a programming cost and a performance cost. i believe the languages cecil diesel and dylan all use some form of multimethod dispatch but i m teetering on the edge of my expertise

1811788
boost	stl
to keep the long story short i am unable to use the container from the stl and boost library and have to create my own

1811788
int	chars
all struct be it nested or not will contain only primitive types like chars int bool etc

1811806
put	get
so it ll have slower get put contains operations than a hashmap but to offset this it supports the sortedmap and navigablemap interfaces

1811837
mouse	keyboard
i have always used autoit s dll for sending keystrokes as well as blocking keyboard and mouse

1811920
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
possible duplicate what is the difference manualresetevent and autoresetevent in .net

1811920
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
what is the difference between manualresetevent and autoresetevent

1811939
jruby	mri
if you have to run in jruby it seems like it s probably because your sysadmin doesn t want to have a build of ruby mri installed so requiring that to run is odd

1811939
jruby	mri
i would talk to your sysadmin and make sure that it s cool to be running mri as well as jruby

1811955
width	height
how do i find the terminal width height of an ncurses application

1811965
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
there is so many great freameworks like wxpython tutorial pyqt tutorial pygtk tutorial already

1811980
textarea	textbox
like input textarea in html and textbox in xul

1812047
sorting	filtering
and if you want more functionality that it offers such as column names databinding support sorting filtering then you can derive encapsulate and add that functionality

1812052
comparator	icomparer
how to use the comparator and icomparer interfaces in visual c#

1812118
fadein	fadeout
however then i came across another problem one that i would like the hover image to fadein and fadeout

1812122
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome

1812122
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome

1812145
sorting	filtering
or here linq part 1 - filtering sorting object lists

1812152
free	realloc
i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation so specific but when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffer allocation and memory copy

1812180
int	double
you must unbox value-types such as int double correctly

1812200
memcpy	realloc
in particular if you try to use it don t store any non-pod objects in the buffer as realloc will just memcpy them to a newly allocated buffer if necessary which will break non-pod objects.

1812219
int	chars
in every link there is a chars -array and some int variables which tells how good a leaf is

1812223
srp	principles
your problem fits squarely into the single responsibility principles srp one of the solid principles

1812242
iboutlet	ibaction
then link your button with the ibaction and the iboutlet and initialize toggleison to no

1812259
boost	stl
i am unable to use the stl and boost library and i have to write my own container in c++

1812275
hash	md5
if the hash is different then presumably the query failed to update due to the md5 check

1812288
jruby	mri
with small modification to the script opening the http request only once and then rewinding the same data both mri and jruby behave about the same jruby even 2 secs out of 20 total faster

1812302
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu eclipse cdt

1812309
width	height
in addition you could use this servlet for quality rescaling of your images by providing width and height parameters as arguments and using image.getscaledinstance w h image.scale_smooth considering performance of course

1812320
getter	setter
so the usual way to put stuff on the value stack is to add getter setter for the values to your action class

1812356
wildfly	glassfish
glassfish payara configuration example can be found here and wildfly configuration example can be found here

1812356
outputstream	inputstream
if you want to have control over reading writing files yourself then you need to create a servlet for this which basically just gets an inputstream of the file in flavor of for example fileinputstream and writes it to the outputstream of the httpservletresponse

1812362
int	chars
hope someone explains why they are reversed - my guess is that chars are not reversed but the int is little endian

1812362
int	chars
in this case you have an int and a chars array of length 2

1812362
int	chars
assuming int is 16 bit and chars is 8 bit both require same space and hence the union is allocated two bytes

1812421
filesystems	hfs+
it may sound horrible to you but filesystems value metadata over data take journaling in hfs+ or ext3 4 for example

1812440
free	realloc
same for realloc and free

1812565
int	double
based on the types i parse them correspondingly cost column in double visit column in int keyword column in string etc..

1812665
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
would you prefer more c c++ experience if some of it were bsd or solaris or other unix

1812665
gentoo	debian
would you prefer 5 years experience with red hat or 7 years experience spanning red hat debian suse gentoo and others

1812682
firefox	safari
the following code works on ie8 safari 4.0.2 - but generates an empty page on firefox 3.5.5

1812693
hash	salt
it gives you a pre-defined schema with best practices like storing the passwords hash and with a salt not in cleartext

1812712
gif	png
how do common formats gif 8-bit png etc. represent this

1812769
required	placeholder
but in return it required that you be able to allocate an object with type igroup to act as a placeholder in case a child is retrieved before its parent

1812876
cos	sin
firstly the derivative of sin x is cos x or to put it more formally

1812876
cos	sin
i guess you could solve sin x using the taylor series for cos x

1812876
put	get
of course you ll need to put some limiter in to exit the recursion otherwise you ll get a stack overflow error eventually which is left as an exercise for the reader

1812909
put	get
replace all content in the current site with tags and then put the different language in file or db tables sniff the users desired language do you have registered users who can make a preference or do you want to get the browser language tag or is it going to be url dot-com dot-fr dot-de that make the choice and then replace the tags with the target language

1812924
children	parent
also has two relationships parent to-one relationship to abstractitem and children to-many relationship to abstractitem and the inverse of parent

1812926
vim	emacs
i am a quite happy user of eclipse i mostly develop in php and python however i found the answers to what specific productivity gains does vim emacs provide over gui text editors

1812926
vim	emacs
interesting enough to make me wish to try out vim or emacs as well and see if they would turn out to be a better solution for me

1812926
vim	emacs
i have the general feeling that vim and emacs are not the kind of editor you learn by playing with it though

1812926
vim	emacs
in the linked thread responders have essentially answered by commenting on vim often mentioning i m sure emacs has the same

1812926
ubuntu	linux
google trends seems to indicate vim is the mostly adopted between the two however my first question is knowing that i have no prior experience whatsoever on any of the two and that i use and develop mostly php and python on gnu linux systems ubuntu arch linux is there any of the two which would represent a better option to start with

1812932
int	chars
the potential danger exists even if your chars array has sufficient length to cover the entire int

1812953
sorting	grouping
certain kinds of sorting or grouping may be unable to use indexes - try to avoid them or modify the query so that it can use indexes

1813059
vim	emacs
i have the general feeling that vim and emacs are not the kind of editor you learn by playing with it though

1813059
vim	emacs
having someone who s experienced with emacs and i d assume vim is a great help

1813094
hide	show
those will let you show and hide a loading gif on ajax json requests

1813113
inherited	properties
c++ where i can inherited private protected properties

1813115
put	get
put it on a local web server and you can have your favorite server-side tech give it to you in response to get data containing the urls

1813145
inherited	properties
that can t be done but you could delete the properties from the class prototype so that it is not inherited

1813145
inherited	properties
that way it won t be inherited but you need to do that for every private properties in your base class

1813163
kerberos	ntlm
is just a cover error for any underlying kerberos ntlm error

1813187
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
for example if the user wishes to add two numbers how would you make sure the calculator jumps to the add label instead of perhaps the multiplying or subtract

1813202
google-chrome	firefox
so while this works for firefox now that i want to port my add-on to google-chrome i couldn t find a way to get the coordinates

1813209
width	height
are they going to be fixed width or height

1813220
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop over the counts arrays ends the printed output every 10th count and uses

1813227
int	chars
int forces conversion from chars to int

int	chars
how do i generate random chars and int within a method so that the method can be called in main and so that the method generates random chars and int together

1813259
int	chars
i do not want a method that genrates chars and another methods that generates int

1813320
for-loop	arrays
i guess the problem is with the nested for-loop through the tracktitles arrays but i can t see what i can change to make it work

1813340
entity-relationship	diagram
in entity-relationship diagram it would be a relation

1813345
daemon	cron

the number or scripts the cron daemon runs

1813373
portrait	landscape
once the keyboard is invoked the vertical scroll bar will remain at the portrait coordinates when the phone or simulator is in landscape mode

1813381
vim	emacs
i find myself gravitating toward vim for scripting languages like ruby perl python php and for emacs for languages that are more interactive lisp essentially

1813391
children	parent
in this case relation parent children change nothing since you refer to widgets by names not relations

1813430
inherited	properties
you can as a bonus provide a default implementation using reflection that goes through every properties of the inherited class to dump it

1813446
rtp	rtsp
darwin streaming server dss is the first open sourced rtp rtsp streaming server

1813446

1813462
fastcgi	scgi
there is mod_wsgi for apache and a scgi fastcgi ajp module + flup for the others

1813470
django	turbogears
for developing sophisticated web applications in python you would probably use a more comprehensive web development framework like django zope turbogears etc

1813477
pascal	delphi
i want to know how i can develop gui applications 32 bits without using delphi language object pascsl only by using fpc with lazarus installed pascal

1813483

the average of 0 0 and 90 will be atan sin 0 +sin 0 +sin 90 cos 0 +cos 0 +cos 90 atan 1 2 26.56 deg

1813493
udp	tcp
a more complicated mechanism but one that could provide a high performance logging path write a logging service that receives log lines via tcp or udp

1813500
subtract	add
i believe the answer could be the normal arithmetic average reduced modulo 360 we sum all the values divide by the number of angles and then subtract add a multiple of 360 so that the result lies in the interval 0..360

1813545
fadein	fadeout
i pulled out your fadein and fadeout animations and put them into a separate hover for the

1813559
rss	feed
i have a few questions about parsing so rss feed

1813559
rss	feed
here is the code of that so rss feed

1813595
ddms	adb
if that does not help as aforlorney suggested check logcat via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to get the java stack trace of your exception

1813654
filtering	grouping
you could use a collectionview this would allow for grouping filtering etc

1813665
postgresql	mysql
i would still recommend checking out postgresql and postgis in comparison to mysql if you intend to do more complex queries in the foreseeable future

1813754
inline	inlining
if i understood one of the fpc compiler devels which has the same issue correctly inlining can only happen when the routine to be inline was already compiled

1813757
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
i don t know but you may want to check with perforce on this as this might be something specific to their plugin rather than something in the team su8pport i never have this problem with svn or cvs though maybe my builds are not big enough

1813818
bindparam	bindvalue
even trying to create a function to replace tokens on the php side would not guarantee the replacement process is the same as the sql one tricky stuff like token-type bindvalue vs bindparam ...

1813821
firefox	safari
i ve been struggling to get some absolutely positioned overlays to show above an flv movie using flowplayer in the firefox browser works in safari

1813847
bmp	tga
if this is in an application that you re making where you can supply code to it you can set up a render target and output the result to a bmp or tga file

1813848
post	get
i am trying to debug the reason why my ajax get post is not working in ie 7 8

1813848
firefox	safari
now this works fine in firefox safari win mac but not in ie 7 8

1813857
sablecc	cup
sablecc antlr jlex cup and so

1813936
vim	emacs
many editors like vim and emacs have a feature that reindents code according to its built-in indentation standard

1813939
many-to-many	many-to-one
graphs can be much better at keeping track of the other types of cardinality many-to-one many-to-many etc.

1813939
children	parent
so for example in the parent child relationship can child operations be done on the parent with the parent passing a reference to itself to the children during that operation

1813951
bazaar	git
it stores etc in a repos git default mercurial or bazaar

1813966
int	chars
third you are casting the chars value stored in buf i to an int and then printing it as a chars

1813987
int	chars	unsigned	short
chars s short s and their unsigned counterparts are promoted to int s

1814003
wadl	wsdl
there s a rest equivalent to wsdl called wadl

1814003
wadl	wsdl
you could explore an approach where a rest service provider sends you a description of their api in wadl you translate the wadl to wsdl and from the wsdl generate the soap apis your broker offers

1814003
wadl	wsdl
your wadl to wsdl translation simulataneously generates the mapping logic used by your broker to translate each soap request to an underlying rest request on the service provider

1814032
public	protected
2 use public private protected function instead of just function restrict as much as possible and open up later if needed

1814049
post	put	post	get	put	get
i retain the data from get to post for the first time then i put it in tempdata and pass it to another action anotheraction

1814049
post	get
once i get my data on get i cannot retain it on post

1814086
vmware	virtualbox
in addition to the virtual machine solution virtualbox virtualpc vmware you might be able to run your program under dosbox

1814105
comparator	comparable
if you don t have the comparable implemented for contact you will need to pass in a comparator implementation

1814118
comparator	comparable
you need make your contact classes implement comparable and then implement the comparator contact method

1814118
equals	compareto
per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

1814154
portrait	landscape
one view support orientation in portrait and landscape

1814154
portrait	landscape
problem is when i change view back from landscape to portrait uitoolbar at the top disappears

1814194
int	chars
qstring qstring fromascii const chars str int size -1

1814194
int	chars
qstring qstring fromlocal8bit const chars str int size -1

1814194
int	chars
qstring qstring fromutf8 const chars str int size -1

1814224
getter	setter
don t use underscores for private varibles unless your using a getter or setter

1814224
getter	setter
this example getter setter is a little useless as you could just make a public property that does the same thing

1814224
getter	setter
only use a getter or setter when you need to do something special when you get or set the property

1814270
g++	gcc
i am wondering why gcc g++ doesn t have an option to place the generated object files into a specified directory

1814337
firefox	safari
the errors are rangeerror maximum call stack size exceeded. safari and internalerror too much recursion firefox mac

1814364
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and safari google-chrome

1814370
algol	smalltalk
the terms you are using are most commonly used together these days in ruby although the constructs previously appeared in algol smalltalk and scheme

1814457
centos	linux
i have a large catalog of audio on a linux centos 5 server that i would like to expose to an existing .net web site

1814485
mouse	keyboard
every time my code gets run the system hangs and i have to reboot - no mouse keyboard response and the scroll and caps lock key lights flash together - i m not sure what this means but i m assuming it s a kernel panic

1814530
post	get
when you get the desired speed post an nsnotification

1814531
mp3	wav
i ve always been curious about audio conversion software but i have never seen a proper explanation from a beginners point of view as to how to write a simple program that converts for example a mp3 file to a wav

1814536
subtraction	addition
you just do simple arithmetic pointer operations like addition and subtraction as well

1814544
post	get
what happens is that you can search but as soon as you click on one of the column headers and it reloads the page with the new get variable it will get rid of the current post variable thereby showing all results again

1814554
x86	64bit
64bit x86 assembly is almost the same as 32bit x86 assembly since 64bit x86 is mostly backwards compatible with 32bit

1814555
pull	push
every few hours i git push my changes to a server from which i then pull to my client machines

1814579
min	max
for each unique x-coordinate get the list of y-coordinates for points with that x-coordinate and make a line from the min to the max y-coordinate

1814602
getter	setter
hiding state behind getter setter

1814661
apache	lighttpd
if you don t care about adaptive streaming this is really easy - just share the audio out over http then add a mediaelement or something like if you want it to be fancy see my caveat at and point it towards your linux server running lighttpd or apache

1814673
superclass	subclassing
well here s one good one that i came up with - utilizing oop overriding subclassing and superclass

1814673
superclass	subclassing
i create subclassing herbivore carnivore and omnivore from the superclass animal and override the eat method with the type of food that it can actually eat

1814693
octal	hex
002 means 02 interpreted as an octal base 8 number similar to how x02 would be the same for a hex base 16 number

1814697
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
so my suggestion would be to remove the configuration element from the maven-jar-plugin and to configure the maven-assembly-plugin like this

1814697
post	get
if you get an error please update your question with it and post the content of the meta-inf manifest.mf file and the relevant part of your pom.xml the plugins configuration parts

1814740
min	max
if it comes from mysql you may have this dbms returns directly the min and max values for the considered list

1814740
min	max
edit as indicated by darkerstar the way the way the data is structured and also the existing sql query which returns the complete list as indicated in the question generally dictate the way the query which produces the min and max value should be structured

1814740
min	max
if somehow you cannot use sql a single pass through the list will allow you to obtain the min and max value in the list in o n time that is

1814740
min	max
set min and max value to first item in unsorted list

1814740
min	max
iterate through each following item in the list comparing it with the min value and replacing it if found smaller and doing like-wise for the max value.

1814740
min	max
with min and max values in hand a simple difference gives the max number of days.

1814755
vim	emacs
wow vi vim vs emacs what a temptation.

1814763
lxml	beautifulsoup
one option is to use lxml i m not familiar with beautifulsoup so i can t say how to do with it it defaultly supports xpath

1814780
calloc	malloc
calloc and malloc return a void object that can be assigned to everything

1814787
post	get
edit added example of reseting the tempdata in anotheraction to get access to it in the post

1814833
width	height
this works to some extent because if i addchild the loader i am able to see the jpeg as it is streamed but i am unable to access the loader s content and most importantly i can not change the width and height of the loader

1814833
width	height
after a lot of testing i seem to have figured out the cause of the problem is that until the loader has completely loaded the jpg meaning until he actually sees the end byte of the jpg he does not know the width and height and he does not create a content displayobject to be associated with the loader s content

1814833
width	height
my question is would there be a way to actually know the width and height of the jpeg before it is loaded

1814837
firefox	safari
this is how various sites distinguish between ie firefox mozilla safari webkit and the like

1814852
ssl	https
if the connection is https encrypting it a second time won t do any good except if someone breaks ssl tls

1814854
hide	show
you can also add all items you want to the menu up front on the treeview or containing controls construction then hide or show them through the visible property

1814894
persistent	transient
this would make the object identity dependent on the persistent state persistent or transient

1814899
implements	extends
another thing to keep in mind is client classes can only extends one abstract class whereas they can implements multiple interfaces

1814943
textmate	sublimetext
however i have liked sublimetext for it s nice gui similar to textmate on mac if that s where you re coming from

1815045
google-chrome	firefox
you can use the view-source uri schema supported by firefox google-chrome and older versions of ie

1815047
udp	tcp
depending on the udp application i d expect that the response would come on the same port for simplicity -- this is not the case for protocols like tcp which have an intentionally random and high source port

1815051
profiling	instrumentation
what instrumentation do you use to control memory usage of application show a number of widgets in the page or do general profiling

1815114
webclient	httpwebrequest
fetching the full html via webclient httpwebrequest should not be a problem

1815134
post	get
ive been through this once in a project and what i recall was that ie has a limit of 2083 characters for both post and get requests

1815135
sorting	grouping
reporting features like sorting grouping joining charts crosstabs form print etc

1815185
backtracking	greedy
with a greedy quantifier on the other hand it will match as much as possible in one go and only then backtracking as much as necessary to match any following tokens

1815215
webclient	webrequest
http authorization and .net webrequest webclient classes

1815286
vpn	lan
my take is that you d need to connect to a remote lan via vpn passing through a firewall to be on the same subnet and similar ip address as where the webservice is running on

1815288
phong	shading
it sounds like you re trying to display your 3d mesh and apply a smooth shading appearance by interpolating surface normals such as in phong shading and you need to calculate the normals first

1815315
pop-up	dialog
now with vista and win 7 the manifest is used to specify elevated permissions to get around the uac thereby minimizing the chance of vista win 7 having to pop-up an uac dialog box

1815337
webkit	gecko
a rendering engine is the engine that a browser uses to render the html gecko vs webkit

1815337
firefox	safari
but even if you switch the user agent of lets say firefox to safari it will still use the gecko rendering engine to render it s page

1815343
integer	unsigned
alternatively you can send a series of packets containing parts of the image again with a type - this time of type image packet instead of image plus the length of the packet which might only be a 16-bit unsigned integer for a maximum size of 65535 bytes plus an end image packet for the last segment

1815349
jar	war
or don t use the jboss log4j configuration and define your own log4j.xml in your war either in a jar in lib or in classes

1815372
vim	emacs
i would advise that checking out both is worth the time because of various reasons already covered by other answers or emacs vs vim vs xy threads

1815372
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are certainly editors that you learn by doing

1815394
public	protected
as long as the member is available in your page at the public or protected level you can push it into your javascript it in this way

1815512
screens	tablet
are there any advanced solutions for capturing a hand drawing from a tablet touch screens or ipad like device on a web site in javascript and storing it on server side

1815516
int	boolean
it should be a basic language with features like basic types int boolean arrays and etc and i should write the framework

1815658
super	extends
if you want this to work use wildcard expressions extends or super

1815771
stdout	stderr
if you want it quick and dirty and you want to get rid of all output then redirect stdout and stderr to dev null

1815856
set	bag
i recall that in one of the brown bag webinars it was mentioned in passing that the tokens could be resubmitted and you d get the corresponding result set back

1815892
post	get
i don t understand why you would be using a get method here since it sounds like you re going to be uploading this image data to your web service - you should be using post

1815928
gif	png
this works for gif jpeg and png only of course and you may run into some issues like alpha channel and colour profile problems

1815929
fflush	gets
if 1 gets fflush and 2 doesn t then we re fine as the db transact wasn t then committed

1815929
fflush	gets
if neither gets fflush or both get fflush then we re also ok

1815929
fflush	gets
so if 2 gets fflush but 1 doesn t then we have a problem

1815945
subtract	add
in your implementation of the action method for this switch value change you ll need to implement logic to determine whether rows should be added or subtract and then actually add or subtract the rows

1816039
ant	maven
automate the building maintenance of these via your build ant maven etc. to keep control of the common elements required

1816049
jfreechart	piccolo
i just got into information-visualization and scientific-visualization and have been using piccolo and a little with jfreechart

1816051
strstr	substr
i have no experience using regular expressions in php so i usually write some convoluted function using a series of str_replace substr strpos strstr etc you get the idea

1816052
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
i tried to make them myself but implementing multiplication division and modulo an efficient way seems to be quite a pain

1816062
pow	math.h
to clarify if you don t include math.h the compiler assumes that pow returns an integer

1816091
outputstream	inputstream
in an iphone app i have a socket connection through wifi and i need to read from inputstream and write to outputstream

1816127
factors	mean
i mean what is the main factors that makes the difference

1816137
pow	math.h
when using math functions like this you should always include math.h and make sure you are calling the right pow function

1816165
visualvm	hprof
however you may be able to skip the hprof dump to get just basic information from the running vm by using jmap jstack and visualvm included in the jdk package

1816173
post	get
it will reveal and log all the headers and get post traffic

1816173
post	get
if you get stuck just post a query on this website

1816173
post	get
you ll also have to get comfortable programming http post requests

1816201
pop-up	dialog
however you can use in-page pop-up window like jquery ui dialog that all pop-up blocker cannot block it because it just is html tag like span or div

1816247
xslt	xquery
that project taught him what he needed to know so he was able to spend more time learning about xquery with sql server instead of the ins and outs of dtd and xslt

1816284
unification	inference
however scala lacks any meaningful kind system and therefore has no kind inference and no kind unification

1816323
ready	each
finally the fully entered vehicle would be displayed to them and they would be able to go back and edit each part of it as they so choose and when they were ready submit it

1816349
versioning	upgrade
these settings will also use isolated storage allow you to upgrade to different versioning of settings to maintain user settings between versioning and many other features

1816354
integer	unsigned
this is because it is an unsigned integer so it is looping round back to the maximum value

1816389
inherited	properties
for general use it s recommended that you test to be sure that the properties hasn t been grafted onto the object somewhere else in the inherited chain

1816390
jar	war
declare a formal manifest for the war module allowing it to declare the its dependencies on the individual jar modules which should allow the war to see the resources in the jar module

1816406
ant	maven
but instead of ant i d choose maven because it will require less work imho and it has a built-in feature called profiles that is perfect to manage environment specific stuff like here

1816449
accessor	properties
if you check the row s height after you resize it it is unchanged the actualheight is the properties that contains the row s actual height when you resize it and actualheight cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

1816475
postgresql	mysql
compare that to the pentaho stack which will typically end interacting with postgresql or mysql

1816475
postgresql	mysql
i can t vouch for how postgresql performs in the olap realm but i do know from experience that mysql - for all its undoubted strengths - has issues with the types of sql that typically crops up all over the place in an olap solution you can t get far in a cube without using group by or count distinct

1816483
inherited	subclassing
can someone please explain to me in plain language what the conditions are for inherited of slots when subclassing

1816485
versioning	upgrade
i didn t have the same problem before the upgrade of my ubuntu versioning

1816490
rss	feed
magpie returns different rss content from same feed one of the blogs returns the contents with angle brackets removed

1816509
stdout	stderr
the server logs stdout stderr webapp

1816514
valgrind	callgrind	valgrind	memcheck	memcheck	callgrind
i don t suppose there is a way to programmatically enable disable valgrind memcheck the way you can with callgrind

1816518
ant	maven
i would add the necessary infrastructure to allow a mechanical build with ant or maven

1816524
mouse	keyboard
this will just repaint the form control but not allow mouse keyboard interaction

1816543
ggplot2	lattice
have a look at the packages lattice or ggplot2 the plot functions in these packages create objects which can be assigned to variables and can be printed or plotted at a later stage

1816552
range	minimum
and no mention of the minimum range provided by the type

1816576
for-loop	arrays
i have solved the problem of reading and assigning values to the arrays by changing the values to read in the first for-loop from d to floats f which gave me the right values

1816637
fadein	fadeout
what i m not sure of is whether .is animated will return true when run against an element that is being animated via fadein and fadeout

1816637
fadein	fadeout
i know that jquery has a .animate function and i assume animated certainly works against elements animated using that function but will it work with those using fadein and fadeout

1816637
fadein	fadeout
in the end i have found that yes animated matches those elements animated using fadein and fadeout because the jquery source uses .animate to achieve these effects

1816667
draggable	droppable
the main issue is i want my draggable to create my droppable depending on having an odd or even class

1816695
listview	gridview
the listview with a gridview built into the framework isn t great so i would recommend the wpftoolkit s datagrid for a free option

1816706
folder	directory
to create a test website on the same web server you can just copy the entire website into a new folder and set the virtual directory in iis

1816715
int	double
just like int numberic limits the limits for float double and long double are imported from the c standard

1816741
folder	directory
the xcode groups the yellow folder like your resources are completely independent of the file system - they don t directly represent directory

1816743
inherited	properties
the properties that can be manipulated at the compiler level are inherited derived from the properties of the system below it the electronics in the cpu

1816768
bitwise-and	modulo
this really helps for hash tables because you compute the index modulo the size and if that size is a power of two the modulo can be computed with a simple bitwise-and or rather than using a much slower divide-class instruction implementing the operator

1816778
put	get
its funny though once you get around to setting aspectj up its remarkable the number of uses that you will put to

1816810
keystore	jks
keystore privatekeystore keystore.getinstance jks

1816810
keystore	jks
keystore reloadedkeystore keystore.getinstance jks

1816837
children	parent
this finds the category from the classname there can be additional classes and then it finds other children of the same parent using .siblings and then includes itself so you can add the hover class to the elements at one time

1816863
filtering	grouping
i d recommend you use a combination of controls to filtering your items into smaller grouping

1816870
hlsl	glsl
i am not familiar with hlsl but i am with glsl

1816870
hlsl	glsl
your only option is to pass a variable to the shader program in glsl it is called a uniform but i am not sure about hlsl

1816871
filtering	grouping
if you added a dropdown to choose the category geographic region product grouping or some other filtering then the user could choose a category

1816913
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
i sort of cobbled them together to successfully make a small utility that converts a aiff wav etc file to an mp3 file

1816913
mp3	wav
now you can peruse lame s api or just fork exec a process to lame to convert your wav file to an mp3 file

1816954
keydown	keyup
i would suggest using keydown keyup events and capturing the keys pressed

1816956
width	height
use the animate function and simply vary the width and height

1816983
subtract	add
alignment is a real pain though that s why i only used sse for arithmetic operations add subtract dot product those kinds of things

1816986
post	get
why not do a partial post back using jquery to get the model you want to edit

1817018
post	get
in asp.net mvc when an action takes an object for a parameter asp.net mvc looks at all the post get data and looks for values which coincide with property names on the parameter object

1817018
post	get
mydinner object will be populated only if you post to the action with form fields that correspond to the dinner object s properties location date etc. or if you were to place that information in a get url dinners someaction

1817033
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
the reason i believe that there are none is because the merge algorithm for each scm whether it is git hg bazaar svn etc works on the lowest common denominator which is simply plain text

1817063
for-loop	loops
i would say it is o n 2 because you have a double-nested for-loop but the size of each loops is not the same so we have to modify it a bit

1817072
haskell	scheme
haskell and scheme have the strongest support but aren t web languages and so far as i know don t have gui libraries for the most part

subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
a close look at the num class i num in ghci reveals one problem with the type of avg num doesn t have enough methods â basically enough to add multiplying and subtract

1817130
equals	gethashcode
you can t you need to override gethashcode and equals and create your own iequalitycomparer

1817206
post	get
however when i try to perform the same operation using a post in code which the api claims to support i consistently get an error stating that my api key is in an invalid format which their documentation claims is likely an encoding issue

1817215
listview	gridview
aspx in that case it would be relatively simple to have an aspx page that contains either a gridview or listview which you bind your data in to or you could just generate an html page with the data formatted in to a table

1817256
junit	cactus	junit	jsfunit	jsfunit	cactus
this is not what exactly what you are asking for but jsfunit which uses junit cactus htmlunit and httpunit seems to be a serious candidate for testing in the jsf land

1817268
processors	hyperthreading
i know how to get the processors type perhaps that s the only way but i m actually looking for a way to determine from an application whether it s running on a multi-core processors or on a hyperthreading single-core processors

1817298
processors	hyperthreading
system.environment.processorcount which will also include hyperthreading processors

1817327
getter	setter
i will suggest first turn this variable into a property with setter and getter

1817327
getter	setter
then refactor your code to make sure all the places that directly write and read this variable are not changed to use the setter and getter of the property

1817352
datalist	repeater
you can use a repeater or a datalist

1817380
inherited	properties
command is a dependency properties and i m pretty sure it is inherited by any control beneath it in the visual tree

1817408
client-side	server-side
if you need to do this asynchronously via javascript then you can always use an ajax request that will allow for asynchronous communication between the client-side environment the user s browser and the server-side environment

1817456
128bit	64bit
that is for example multiply two 64bit integers to get a 128bit result which is stored in two 64bit registers

1817484
pop-up	dialog
but i am now trying to get it to work on a page that get dynamically populated into a jquery ui dialog pop-up but it doesn t seem to be working

1817508
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
i have a vector class that has addition multiplication subtraction division etc operators

1817538
fflush	gets
your server is calling print and never fflush the stream so the time never gets sent

1817547
width	height
for example all the controls can be left or right aligned and resized to the same size width or height

1817591

paste it into a .doc docx will have the same indents and colours

1817628
mouseup	mousedown
when i ran the code above something interesting will happen when the left mousedown is issue nothing seem to happen i move my mouse and the window doesn t move however when i added a mouseup event then the window jumped to the location where i supposedly dragged it

1817643
subtract	add
can you pass in an operation like divide by 2 or subtract 1 using just a partially applied operator where add 1 looks like this

1817643
addition	multiplication
for addition and multiplication this argument ordering doesn t matter

1817690
hide	show
when using the asp.net ajax library i could register a modal async indicator by registering a show method and a hide method with the pagerequestmanager

1817697
nsmutablestring	nsstring
is there any way to initialize nsstring to nsmutablestring

1817701
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you can set an nsmutablestring to an nsstring but not the other way around

1817701
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is because an nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring so it is a nsstring

1817721
move	drag
to drag you must put the mouse button down first then move the mouse

1817743
coalesce	nvl
another benefit of using coalesce is that the data types do not need to match which is required when using nvl

1817750
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
do most ie firefox safari google-chrome opera make multiple http requests for a pdf file when displaying the pdf in a browser

1817763
bazaar	git
aside from the git vs bazaar issue i identified in my comment above i was able to confirm that you need to escape the parens as in

1817806
bazaar	git
if you are using a local server anyway why wouldn t you consider using one of the distributed revision control systems instead of subversion git mercurial bazaar

1817813
folder	directory
when i try to enumerate directory paths under private var mobile library it does not list callhistory folder but everything else

1817871
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl	isnull	nvl
you might ve noticed i didn t have any left join examples - this would only be necessary if columns from the subquery use null testing coalesce on almost any db these days oracle s nvl or nvl2 mysqls ifnull sql server s isnull etc...

1817949
apache-fop	xhtml
given that xhtml is an extension from xml i d recommend using apache-fop

1818021
profiling	instrumentation
profiling it with instrumentation sampler instrumentation see where it spends its time

1818038
integer	unsigned
however there are two 3rd party notes from perlmonks and the apache poi project which say much the same thing this looks like a windows vt_filetime data type which is a 64 bit unsigned integer representing the number of elapsed 100 nanoseconds since 1 january 1601

1818054
postgresql	mysql
since mysql doesn t offer a nowait method like postgresql or oracle does i ve run into locking issues where worker threads hang and wait for the locked row to become available

1818087
width	height
menubar toolbar location directories status scrollbars resizable dependent width 640 height 480 left 0 top 0

1818090
rss	feed
i ve heard that it s quicker to use file_get_contents for basic get requests grabbing an rss feed that doesn t require authentication but i haven t tried myself

1818103
unix	aix
please tell me does sqlplus uses tns_admin variable on unix and aix

1818182
expander	grid	treeview	expander
the outer listview and expander is to replace a treeview that was used to have a list of collapsible nodes but the treeview s internal use of grid means the textview items were squashed horizonatlly the same as if you remove ether horizontalcontentalignment stretch attributes

1818196
pop-up	dialog
you could also create a dialog as a page and then use a pop-up window to display it as a real native os modal dialog but this is perhaps more annoying.

1818200
move	drag
drag buttons and text boxes onto the form move them around add some labels

1818200
swt	swing
in eclipse you either have to use netbeans instead ie not eclipse... or use ibm s swt or code the swing forms by hand

1818221
uilabel	nsstring
you can calculate the fitted size of a uilabel based on the nsstring content using the uikitadditions category on nsstring

1818221
uilabel	uitextview
you could should probably use a uilabel rather than a uitextview since you don t need the scrolling behavior of the uitextview

1818260
versioning	upgrade
i complained with them 3 months ago and they upgrade passenger on my server the day after so i could install the current rails versioning

1818276
profiler	vtune
use an instruction-level profiler like vtune

1818280
vb.net	vb6
edit alternatively you can write code in vb6 .net c# vb.net python for automation

1818291
pascal	delphi
i have few legacy pascal source files that i wish to make it compile in delphi 2009 2010 as well as delphi 2007 and below

1818340
128bit	64bit
also the benefit of generating a 64bit hash from a 128bit 4 x 32-bit number is a bit questionable because as other people have suggested you could just use the original value as a key in a set

1818501
opera	firefox
firefox still fired the event but webkit opera and internet explorer didn t although frankly i ve no idea which is correct.

1818521
snmp	mib
many other concepts also involve dependency trees such as snmp mib resolution c c++ source code compiling

1818559
next	except
edit i guess what op needs is that the remaining record should be selected except those where current record s old state is not the same as next record s new state kind of an undo operation in records and current record s new state should not be same as previous record s old state

1818572
stdout	stderr
the simplest solution to this problem is to redirect all stdout into stderr

1818590
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel automatically splits but uitextview does not do it

1818598
ready	each
the server responds in around 2 - 300 ms at each request but it takes 1.5 - 2 seconds for the page to be ready in the browser

1818599
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this was originally done in ie for the mac but this behaviour is the same in all versions of ie since ie5 and firefox google-chrome safari and opera

1818624
yslow	pagespeed
there are a lot of things you can do to optimize performance you may use tools such as yslow and pagespeed to analyze the page further and determine what might be worth doing

1818689
width	height
menubar toolbar location directories status scrollbars resizable dependent width 640 height 480 left 0 top 0

1818742
for-loop	loops
anyway as tom hawtin said it is sometimes better to use the old syntax when you need to get the current index information by using a for-loop or the iterator as everything you win when using the java5 syntax will be lost in loops itself.

1818752
itunes	iphoto
examples of this are iphoto and itunes - there is no concept of documents in these applications but there is differnt data for differnt users

1818755
post	put	range	minimum
if i were the person assigned with the unenviable task of providing an estimate to completion for a project being managed as arbitrarily as in the original post i d try to figure out a range based upon the minimum number of folks assigned 48 to 66 weeks given 2 developers 50 to 80 confident and a range associated with the average number of folks assigned 25 to 45 weeks with 5 developers 50 to 80 confident and use the low figure from the average number along with the high figure from the minimum number 25 to 66 weeks given anywhere from 2 to 5 developers 50 to 80 confident and even then i d put a disclaimer on it plus 10 for the lost time due to context switching

1818816
hide	show
what you might want to do is contain the image you wish to hide in a and show this div after the page and all of its content your screenshot image included has loaded ie

1818816
addeventlistener	onload
in an onload handler -- or obviously you can use addeventlistener too

1818874
int	boolean
in django if i an object of type django.forms.booleanfield for example how do i know what database type it is going to be saved to int boolean varchar

1818887
put	get
i see only one option to get around this i need to put the extension into the url

1818948
getter	setter
ok that way now a can setter y getter the options of my plugin once instance

1818955
super	self
and the self register super class

1818986
g++	gcc
in my opinion the best way is to symlink gcc g++ to ccache but if you would like to use within cmake try this

1818989
tunnel	vpn
is it possible to set up vpn server or perhaps another proxy server on either my mac os x machine or a debian box to tunnel all the incoming connections from my iphone through the paid proxy service

1819007
int	chars
ref parameters are mostly used to pass value types such as int long chars etc

1819023
truecrypt	umount
in the past i have read about people using truecrypt partitions that automatically umount but that would probably require decent intrusion detection

1819056
hide	show
i got all fixed besides disabling the toggle button that hide show the toolbar

1819056
hide	show
so my question is how do i disable the button that hide show the toolbar in ckedtor 3.0

1819084
stateless	stateful
the web application is by nature stateless so even if your users should log-in it does not make the application stateful

1819087
width	height
you need place width 100 and height 100 in the style of the object tag in the html holding it

1819087
width	height
also remove the width auto and height auto from the usercontrol

1819164
wadl	wsdl
i ve spent a couple of hours looking for a solution suggested by other grails users but didn t find a neat solution besides a recommendation to use wadl or wsdl 2.0

1819189
unsigned	short
additionally what are the ranges of unsigned long int long int unsigned int short int short unsigned int and int

1819236
range	minimum
the minimum range you can rely on are

1819236
unsigned	short
unsigned short int and unsigned int 0 to 65 535

1819236
range	minimum
the minimum range for this type if your compiler supports it is

1819246
hide	show
right-click the cell with the comment and choose show hide comment might do the trick

1819329
vim	emacs
maybe a good way is to learn vim emacs while using eclipse

1819371
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for any reason this works perfectly on iexplorer 8 but doesn t on firefox safari nor google-chrome

1819465
post	get
when he clicks on that close button there is a post form from where the parent window should get the selected value

1819483
phpunit	simpletest
is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command line based like phpunit

1819509
cout	cin
it will ignore my cout and cin usage everywhere in the code so i can t even debug it

1819517
getter	setter
with this syntax it s easy to figure out what is happening but it is not a standard setter and conflicts with margins getter

1819517
getter	setter
for me it is obvious the method is a setter but this time i cannot set multiple values with just one call and there s the problem with getter again

1819523
min	max
after performing estimation you obtain some min and max values

1819523
min	max
which estimation is better to use when set up deadline min or max

1819523
min	max
as i see min estimation can result in stress for developer max estimation can result in using all the time which is allocated to developer even if task can be complete faster so called student syndrome

1819538
children	parent
do they really select the same thing or does the parent child form select grand children as well as immediate children

1819539
ws-addressing	soap
do you want to still use soap but just without any of the ws-security and ws-addressing stuff

1819551
implements	extends
you might have fancy knobs lockable knobs etc which can all be implements by extends your base door knob

1819559
min	max
you should use the best guess which is a function of the min and max estimates - not just the simple average -

1819559
min	max
best_guess min min_weighting + max max_weighting divisor

1819559
min	max
the weighting you give to the min and max values will depend on the complexity of the task the risks associated with the task the likelihood of the risks occuring the skill of the developer etc

1819559
min	max
while giving the max and delivering early is not the same as giving the min and delivering late it still shows that you don t have control over your development

1819559
min	max
these min and max estimates will be got by various means - asking the developers past experience etc

1819559
min	max
if polling developers then the actual min and max values should be treated as outliers and either discarded or modified in some way

1819561
int	chars
why do they turn chars into gchar int into gint etc

1819578
joomla	phpbb
joomla phpbb

1819590
min	max
if the difference between min and max are big rather than using some black magic formula i think it the best thing to do would be to go back to the developers and ask them to do a finer breakdown and prototyping which will lead to better estimates where the gap between min and max is not that big

1819602
min	max
if you have little experience with a specific developer one of my fondly regarded previous managers would ask the developer himself to do the estimate and set the initial deadline a third of the distance between that developer s min and max challenging the developer to beat it

1819629
wordpress	joomla
i will go with wordpress joomla and drupal on the runner up list

1819677
entity-relationship	diagram
i usually end up drawing a crude entity-relationship diagram after this which further clarifies which classes i need

1819691
int	boolean
in theory you should make objects pretty much everything until you fall down to the smallest possible elements the primitive types boolean string int etc

1819733
folder	directory
i want to list all these directory and sort them in which they have created in the pc and copy the latest directory contents to batch_latest_lib_files folder that will be a new folder created by this batch file.i want this new folder to be created in the path where this batch file is present

1819782
put	get
get rid of the linq and put old stored procedures

1819836
post	get
but on return my app keeps trying to call my show action presumably because it thinks its a get request and not a post

1819853
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox it s ok

1819862
importerror	attributeerror
this will sometimes give you attributeerror instead of importerror

1819862
importerror	attributeerror
this way isn t better it will sometimes give you importerror when more appropriate would be attributeerror

1819870
mouseover	mouseout
i ve had this problem when i ve added a mouseover and mouse out on a div which showed a div which covered the div which had the mouseout event set

1819870
mouseover	mouseout
if so then when the div shows it will fire the mouse out event and then end up in a loop on mouseover and mouseout until you truly move the pointer out

1819886
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward is a kind of merge where there s no actual merging to do you just have to hop along the commits

1819925
post	get
you can t post from a get request

1819932
post	put
also keep in mind that csrf will protect your post put delete without a token so you ll need to disable it for this method and hopefully you have some other way of authenticating that request

1819945
min	max
use neither min nor max but something in between

1819945
min	max
when composing individual tasks estimates into an aggregate neither min or max is sensible

1819946
fast-forward	merge
as for the fast-forward merge git pull should take care of that automatically but since in git terms a pull involves both fetching the changes from upstream and merging your local branches with the new upstream the merge part of this will fail if you have a dirty working tree so the above commands will need to be done or other permutations of committing stashing operations before the merge can proceed

1819961
ironruby	ironpython
as someone else has pointed out there are versions for both the jvm jython and jruby and for .net ironpython ironruby so if you want to learn either of those platforms they are a good way to start

1820025
folder	directory
i m trying to design a program in php that would allow me to find files with specific file extensions example .jpg .shp etc in a known directory which consists of multiple folder

icefaces	woodstock
tools were provided to convert existing woodstock projects to icefaces projects although i ve read here and there that you can better convert code it by hand yourself

1820091
post	get
see jon galloway s post for details on how to get around this

1820174
g++	gcc
i was wondering if there is some compiler parameter preferably in gcc g++ which treats the lack of try catch blocks as errors

1820480
google-chrome	safari
it currently works in ie versions 6 and up as well as safari and google-chrome

1820487
division	modulo
you could use a combination of integer division and modulo 2 even-odd there are blocks of four and the 1st 3rd 5th block and so on should result in 1 the 2nd 4th 6th and so on in 2

1820492
required	placeholder
is really only required when you use false as a placeholder value and in practice this is rare

1820529
put	get
you may well find that in lots of cases you get out the first key that you put into the dictionaries - but you absolutely must not rely on that

1820537
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the background image renders fine in ie and firefox but on webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari the background image only partially renders when the page is initially loaded

1820562
cgpoint	cgsize
within that frame struct are a cgpoint origin and a cgsize size value

1820569
post	get
instead of using window.load the post get should be done in the header or in the

1820584
accessor	properties
i have two instance variables that have accessor created via properties

1820605
gridview	rowdatabound
you might mean something other than what i m thinking by the term dynamic gridview but if you need to add a hyperlink to each row of a column in a gridview and if you need to do this in the code-behind then i would suggest handling the gridview s rowdatabound event and doing something like the following in the event handler

1820722
put	get
i get an error when i try to put in a date element inside a fileset

1820749

or just the raw bits themselves might want different datatypes for 8-bit int 16-bit int 32-bit int 64bit long 32-bit float 64bit double

1820869
jms	jta
spring does not attempt to replace certain advanced parts of the javaee spec such as jms and jta

1820869
jms	jta
if your application requires the power of the likes of jms and jta then you can easily use them via spring

1820880
feedback	review
the point is by having a checklist scorecard it gives you a way to review his code a bit more subjectively and gives him valuable feedback on how to improve

1820883
google-chrome	firefox
as a side note i think this is unnecessary micro optimization and you should probably look elsewhere for performance improvements ie profile the script through google-chrome s developer tools or firebug for firefox or similar tools and look for slow long running calls functions

1820900
feedback	review
review the code and give good feedback

1820903
put	get
holder.compareandset is put in a while true loop so that if the value did change before you were able to write it then you get a chance to read the value again and re-try your write

apache	lighttpd
my goal is to understand inside my php scripts the templating ones when apache have an high load and is prefearrable to fork some traffic on lighttpd that is here just to the long-polling and to light the apache s load

1821008
apache	lighttpd
hi guys after this question i ve started to use lighttpd for a long-polling service on my server in order to not to nuke apache and the database forn this kind of requests

1821008
apache	lighttpd
so actually i have example.com served by apache and polling.example.com served by lighttpd both using memcache to reduce the database hits

1821008
apache	lighttpd
now im wondering if there is a way to retrieve the apache server load in php in order to redirect even other ajax requests on lighttpd if apache have an high load

1821016

1821039
hide	show
you can use css to hide the #command div until you want to show it

1821039

then use blur focus to show hide the #commands div

1821047
google-chrome	firefox
so far i ve tested this in firefox 3.55 ie 8.0.6001.18702 and google-chrome 3.0.195.33 with similar results

1821079
translation	localization
not to mention that localizing your app will merely be a matter of translation which is the best-case scenario not mentioning other localization issues like currency which is a whole separate issue

1821094
rss	feed
this system will require a relatively interactive web-based ui hence my interest in using gwt and some form of data persistence to store rss feed details and complex user profiles that will be used to provide recommendations i have looked at gilead for this

1821100
mouseup	mousedown
a more sophisticated and advanced solution would be to use the mousedown mouseup to emulate the multiple cell selection behavior of excel but this too shouldn t be too hard to implement

gitolite	gitosis
gitosis or similar gitolite tool are about access control to git repositories via git and are managed from a command line not from web

1826621
min	max
edit given that you will be applying min and max to each vector separately i would suggest either using a matrix if a and b will be the same length and the same data type or data frame if a and b will be the same length but can be different data types or else use a list like in your last example if they can be of differing lengths and data types

1826670
post	get
i figured i would post the answer so if anyone else runs into this issue they can get it to at least work

1826679
width	height
if #close were nested in a block with a position you d need to look at the width height of that block instead of window

1826716
ienumerable	icollection
actually in the current ms implementation of count ienumerable there s a shortcut looking if the ienumerable is an icollection and calls count on it

1826716
ienumerable	icollection
if the ienumerable is a icollection then the copyto method is called instead which is a bit faster

1826763
post	get
this executes via a normal post but in an ajax post this function doesn t get fired

1826768
jboss	weblogic
i have some experience integrating quartz into a weblogic no jboss experience sorry application server

restructuredtext	asciidoc
if you have control over the output format consider a lightweight wysiwyg markup language such as restructuredtext asciidoc markdown etc

1826830
post	get
the problem is that our content is added to the post via javascript when the post is displayed so we always get fresh data

1826830
post	get
therefore wordpress does not send a pingback to the urls that the plugin will add to the post and the author do not get a link back from us via our pingback system

1827086
hex	binary
you have the binary wrong - it should be 0100 0001 - your bin to hex is fine

1827095
pull	push
if the threads ui and facade wait for one another to finish their requests then this should prevent a pull update happening at the same time as a push update

1827097
updatepanel	scriptmanager	client-side	server-side
you can use a combination of the asyncpostbackerror event on the scriptmanager server-side and the endrequest event on the pagerequestmanager client-side to fully handle server-side errors when using the updatepanel

1827118
hash	md5
if you need your whole column to be the primary key calculate sha1 or md5 hash and use it as a primary key

1827186
nsurl	nsstring
i am attempting to load a variable with type nsstring into an nsurl with the following line

1827196
hide	show
you have not subscribed to the uikeyboardwillhidenotifcation only show - thus it will not do anything when the keyboard hide

arguments 3 and 4 represent the width and height of the rounded rectangle

1827628
width	height
the last two arguments represent the width and height of the arc drawn in the

1827704
webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest or webclient

1827715
ssl	https
obviously http vs https performance has lots of details but remember that a lot of the cost of ssl is in the session setup so the encryption for the transfer will be less costly relatively for a large transfer

1827723
webclient	httpwebrequest
i believe though that webclient is simply a helper that implements httpwebrequest under the hood

1827725
google-chrome	firefox
focusing primarily on google-chrome and firefox btw

1827782
daemons	launchd
and as it relies on standard linux features even people with a limited knowledge of your app can launchd a daemons or stop one if they know how it s called system-wise aka myworker in the above example

1827827
postgresql	mysql
thus if sqltypes were to return postgresql dialect would map it to int2 and h2 mysql to tinyint

1827863
getter	setter
if the checkboxes all have the same name you can have a getter setter for a string

1827883
firefox	safari
it could be cross-browser at least safari and firefox

1827888
avr	microcontroller
as i ve been told avr and pic are the most common microcontroller among hobbyists and apparently most people suggest avr for newcomers like me due to its c-friendly architecture whatever that means its c compilers and its large hobbyist community

1827915
arduino	avr-gcc
all you should have to do to get running with the arduino is do a pkg_add avr-gcc or build your own which is quite simple and pkg_add avrdude

1827921
tcpclient	networkstream
so far the client handles both content-length and chunked responses by iterating through the networkstream response after writing a get request to the tcpclient parsing the headers and retrieving the relevant message body bytes chunked bytes

1827926
automake	autotools
i have been using gnu autotools autoconf automake libtool for the past couple of months in several projects that i have been involved in and i think it works beautifully

1827926
configure	libtool
autoconf configure the project based upon the platform that you are about to compile on automake builds the makefiles for your project and libtool handles libraries

1828070
vbscript	jscript
note that it s much more difficult to use wmi in jscript than it is in vbscript and most examples you find on the internet are for vbscript which makes porting the code a pain

1828092
inherited	subclassing
if you don t want to implement subclassing that has the same interface as base class why do you inherited at all

1828148
post	get
you can edit your cookies or post data or get session variables or write a simple script to do it

1828172
comparator	icomparer
comparator - an icomparer to compare keys

1828175
circuit	nor
never seen nor noticed that before and i used to sell rotating screens like that when i used to work for circuit city

1828182
children	parent
when testing nested objects if the parent is undefined or null then it has no children so no further testing is needed

1828182
children	parent
to safely test a heavily nested object you will need to test the topmost parent using typeof but you can test any children for actual values see the testing for empty answer

1828263
wcf	openrasta
if you re considering .net there s openrasta a really nice rest framework simple yet powerful where rest was not retrofitted as an afterthought like it was in wcf

1828275
comparator	icomparer
i dug in a little deeper and found that you can derive from collectionview which is a wrapper around a collection to be bound in wpf and override its comparator property to return a custom icomparer

1828350
post	put
is it ok to put post to my tests

1828567
inherited	subclassing
qt widget classes have a great many methods so inevitably i m going to end up adding a method to the subclassing with the same name as one inherited from the qt widget

1828573
min	max
another possibility is to handle the wm_getminmaxinfo message and set the minmaxinfo struct so that both min and max size of the window is the current size

1828611
spaces	delimiter
it seems to me from your example that you are cleaning up white spaces from the beginning and end of pipe | delimiter fields in a text file

1828613
keydown	keyup
the biggest issue seems to be that after some period of time the key begins to repeat firing off keydown and keyup events like a fiend

1828616
public	protected
one of the requirements of cls compliance is that public and protected member names should not differ only by case thus ensuring that your libraries can be used safely by visual basic code or any other .net language that doesn t differentiate based on case

1828637
onkeyup	onkeydown
look at this answer and use onkeyup and onkeydown

1828639
folder	directory
could you not just navigate to the folder where the mysql data is stored for the old database server copy the directory for each database from the data folder to the new one and then attach the databases to the new mysql database

1828649
keydown	keyup
i think the answer is that the keydown event and its twin keyup are all the info you get

1828649
keydown	keyup
essentially you can evaluate keydown and keyup yourself but ignore a keyup event if it takes place too quickly after the last keydown .

1828649
keydown	keyup
or essentially you should delay your response to keyup long enough to be sure there s not another keydown event following with something like 0.25 seconds of the keyup

1828654
put	get
i m ready to put a bounty if i still can t get an answer

1828658
width	height
what you could do would be to actually have the text in an inner div that has the same fixed width as the container but no fixed height

1828679
keydown	keyup
then using the documents pages controls keyup and keydown events update the array with that key s state

1828681
hash	md5
btw to avoid checking the content of the whole file a solution might be to add a new column to your upload table to store some kind of hash of the file see md5 and or sha1 for instance

1828747
profiling	debugging
such as debugging profiling searching refactoring and many more

1828784
atomic	interlocked
the interlocked operation is atomic

1828785
cvs	svn
i also like having tight svn integration or cvs vss etc

1828802
keydown	keyup
the only possibility is monitoring each keyup and keydown and remembering

1828802
keydown	keyup
after some period of time the key begins to repeat firing off keydown and keyup events like a fiend

1828802
keydown	keyup
you ll definitely get keypress repeating and in many browsers you ll also get repeated keydown but if keyup repeats it s a bug

1828802
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately it is not a completely unheard-of bug on linux chromium and firefox when it is being run under gtk+ which it is in popular distros such as ubuntu both generate repeating keyup-keypress-keydown sequences for held keys which are impossible to distinguish from someone hammering the key really fast

1828813
mouse	keyboard
that command might be implemented by a right mouse button but it might come from the keyboard or some custom setup for some other hardware

1828839
atomic	interlocked
the interlocked class essentially combines the two steps above into a single step providing an atomic operation

1828869
hide	show
hide and show the modal popup in code behind

1828875
put	get
if you put all of this in place and you still get a blank code file consider reinstalling visual studio

1828878
nunit	moq
i am starting a new project with nhibernate asp.net mvc 2.0 and structuremap and using nunit and moq for testing

1828879
put	get
like most tools you get out of them what you put in

1828884
try-catch	exception-handling
inside the main method put a try-catch and use smtpclient to send notifications about unhandled exception-handling

1828885
integer	fractions
also you ll have to change texture matrix to represent fractions values with integer texture coords otherwise they ll only point to texture corners 0 1

1828951
listview	gridview
so i am not using the gridview of the listview anymore

1828951
listview	gridview
however i now have to rework out of a listview with a gridview that i had styled and use this method

1828998
folder	directory
there you can tell which folder from your project should be copied live to what directory on your machine the tomcat webapps yourapp

1829028
nsstring	nsdata
the possible return types from this method are nsdata nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdate and nsnumber

1829062
post	put
i ve put break points in page_prerender and page_preload and both are being hit the post back is definitely occuring

1829072
disk	ram
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times

1829082
mp3	wav
you can use lame to encode wav to mp3

1829124
superclass	subclassing
if you use a specific superclass type you ll have to cast the pointer every time you call a subclassing s method in order to avoid compiler warnings

1829126
mouse	joystick
this is true of right-click ctrl-click left-click on a button-swapped mouse 18th-click on a highly configurable mouse a tablet or joystick configured to work as a mouse etc

1829155
postgresql	mysql
i would recommend checking out chapter 8 of that book which covers all of the different methods for db2 oracle postgresql mysql

1829161
inherited	properties
so in the end i want talk and meeting to share the same properties as defined in event but with possible additional properties and with a 0..1 n relation a meeting can have several talks but there are talks without a meeting. is there a way to accomplish this without either repeating the column definitions and or abandoning inherited

1829245
comparator	comparable
you can either make sure your word objects are comparable or supply a custom comparator

1829266
typedef	struct
what i mean is header guard includes typedef enums struct function declarations class definitions classes templates etc etc

1829273
post	get
from my testing this is what i concluded and works for form get and post methods

1829274
x86	64bit
you shouldn t have too many problems - we build and develop on xp x86 iis 5.1 and deploy to a 64bit server 2008 iis 7 platform

1829284
button	checkbox
a user can select as many checkbox as they like then click a button that says create a new quote it ll take the items they checked and clone them into a new table so they can edit them as apart of the quote

1829314
typemock	nmock
mind you tools like nmock and typemock make the job easier but it s still hard -- you need to design your code to be tested not just write the code first and pray that you can test it later

1829352
gitolite	gitosis
beside gitosis mentioned in marcin gil answer which requires python and setuptools best known probably from seminal hosting git repositories the easy and secure way blog post and described in chapter 4.7 of pro git book there is also similar gitolite tool

1829376
put	get
i can get the result i want using a subquery but i can t put a subquery into a view

1829383
akismet	recaptcha
since most of the antispams recaptcha akismet etc uses the same principle in avoiding spams where they use some sort of random images with words and people can just guess the words based on what they think is the correct word out of it

1829391
post	get
in my head i see it as two separate functions one to get the form initiate session and another to post the data

1829412
stdout	stderr
try redirecting the error stream to stdout like so and then you should be able to capture both stdout and stderr in a single variable

1829445
boost	stl
given the number of different compilers and the very cryptic warnings that use of the stl and boost gives i usually use google but i strip as much unique strings from the query as i can removing line numbers etc

1829460
gridbaglayout	miglayout
now that i have custom buttons that take care of uniformly sizing themselves i could meet these requirements fairly easily with gridbaglayout and probably even more easily with miglayout

1829480
udp	tcp
how udp is different from tcp

1829480
udp	tcp
one last word of caution - you may find yourself re-inventing tcp over udp

1829545
integer	unsigned
expiration times are specified in unsigned integer seconds

1829555
nhibernate	automapper
why are enums mapped as strings and not as ints when using automapper in fluent nhibernate

1829560
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade to versioning 2

1829600
getter	setter
if you need any custom logic in either getter or setter you cannot use auto-properties

1829610
int	chars
the most effecient way is not to convert each int to a string but rather create one string out of an array of chars

1829698
gentoo	linux
i would like to believe that the linux kernel i m using gentoo 2.6.30 happily takes care of these details and i can use fcntl and it all comes out in the wash

1829718
put	get
the only other way i can think of to get the number of rows that would be returned for a query without doing much work is to put a trigger function on the table that updates the count every time a row is inserted updated or deleted based on whether it matches the query

1829750
getter	setter
writing getter and setter for properties

1829773
versioning	upgrade
i used to be able to do this prior to an upgrade from the last versioning of the os but it s been so long i don t remember what i did the last time

1829774
google-chrome	firefox
my goal is to have the div raise a click event on the file input and this seems to work exactly as i d expect in ie and google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox no file browser is opened when you click on the div

1829803
super	abstract
use an orm to abstract the database away and it s super easy

1829811
children	parent
how can i get jquery to select all children of one parent that is select all .children until parent

1829854
put	get
word right 3 more times to put the cursor after the get

1829884

fieldset	formpanel
inside my formpanel i have mulitple fieldset but need to find the one that has a header title of test results

1829968
squeak	visualworks
i m familiar with the visualworks and dolphin versions of smalltalk but have not previously used squeak

i need to be able to set the permissions for a particular folder that i create and have those permissions be inherited by all of the files and directory within and beneath it

1830062
rss	feed
feedburner provides statistics about rss feed of subscribers and reaches

1830062
rss	feed
it is easy to understand that feedburner can count visits reaches to a rss feed

1830062
rss	feed
but how does feedburner get to know subscribers to a rss feed

1830062
rss	feed
in my understanding each requests to rss feed uri is independent

1830062
rss	feed
so how does feedburner know how many subscribers to a rss feed

1830069
getter	setter
cocoa s properties are just syntactic-sugar for getter and setter methods

1830080
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari however the call to scrolltop apparently does nothing at all

1830080
google-chrome	safari
is there something funny about the renderer under safari and google-chrome

1830091
rss	feed
for individual users polling the rss atom feed there are http headers involved in the request so users are tracked by ip address and when behind proxies a number of proxies include original ip in header this helps sort between proxied sources

1830118
int	double
i only know of dgemm sgemm for double precision single precision matrices but would like to have it for matrices that are of integral type such as int or short int...

1830165
put	get
it works when you put a button in the panel because it can get the focus

1830183
equals	compareto
your compareto says that two words are equals if they have the same count

1830247
getter	setter
my question is simple is using the get set properties of c# considered good better even than writing getter and setter methods

1830254
getter	setter
in your first example c# automatically generates the private backing fields so technically the data member is not declared as public only the getter setter

1830265
getter	setter
syntax is just a convenient shorthand for this that you can use when the getter and setter don t do anything special

1830280
getter	setter
the great part about having the simplified getter setter is that when you want to fill in the implementation with a little bit more guts later you do not break abi compatibility

1830280
getter	setter
don t worry about getter setter slowing down your code through indirection

1830280
getter	setter
the jit has a thing called inlineing makes using the getter setter just as efficient as direct field access

1830287
versioning	upgrade
you may want to upgrade to a new versioning of visual c++ to have the compiler help you

1830294
button	checkbox
radio button and checkbox can have different behavior then other elements

1830328
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so i m using a very basic jquery .slidedown which is working great in firefox safari and google-chrome

1830343
force.com	salesforce
salesforce especially you can kind of blame this most recent version of cloud computing on them and force.com since they ve been very heavily marketing their service using the term cloud computing and by proxy the idea of cloud computing itself

1830361
cpython	ironpython
commonjs is not yet to the level of interop of say cpython jython ironpython but it certainly has that potential going forward

1830367
put	get
that s why you get double __ because rails will put one for you

1830396
versioning	upgrade
my sqlite storage gets upgrade from the 1.0 versioning of the model and everything is good except for of course the few transformations i need done

1830397
waitpid	fork
apart from waitpid you can avoid that by using a double fork when executing the child

1830399
awt	swing
you should not mix swing awt components for instance instead of using label use jlabel in swing for panel use jpanel

1830408
post	put
assuming you have control at a low enough level on both client and server sides of this project you could achieve this via content-range headers in your post or put requests that send the data

1830462
gif	png
the code works fine with jpg or gif but turns the image pink if a png

1830465
feedback	review
if management doesn t understand what a feedback loop review testing then switch jobs maybe

1830483
post	get
i tried to post more links but as a newbie i only get one

1830489

it covers converting a nfa to a dfa and minimizing the dfa

1830514
nfa	dfa
that can be expressed by a regular expression nfa or dfa has a unique

1830568
width	height
i also need to set the leftdiv s and rightdiv s height and width on the css but i just can t do it without the float

1830577
width	height
you could float all the child divs of maincontainer left like below then you can set height and width requirements as you please

1830580
rss	feed
i created an rss feed with java rome lib

1830580
rss	feed
i opened my feed in my rss clients firefox and rss bandit and i found they are in reversed order technically it s chronological but reversed compared to the order i used

1830580
rss	feed
i thought it s an rss client bug i usually use google reader but i checked some feed on the internet and saw that reason that they display correctly is they have reverse ordered items oldest on the top

1830583
public	protected
esentitycollection is a metadata file so i could not change the access modifier there from protected to public

someone explain to me what inputstream and outputstream are

1830698
outputstream	inputstream
i am confused about the use cases for both inputstream and outputstream

1830709
int	chars
the length of the utf-8 string in bytes is written first as a 16-bit int followed by the bytes representing the chars of the string and writeutfbytes writes a utf-8 string to the byte stream

1830712
pull	push
when you do a git pull fetch push and some others you need to specify a refspec for the current repository

1830712
pull	push
a refspec describes the mapping between the local reference and the remote one so you can push or pull etc the master branch head and store it as your origin branch head

1830719
outputstream	inputstream
you read from an inputstream and write to an outputstream

1830719
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you would create a fileinputstream to read from the source file and a fileoutputstream to write to the new file

1830719
outputstream	inputstream
if your data is a character stream you could use a filereader instead of an inputstream and a filewriter instead of an outputstream if you prefer

1830722
kerberos	ntlm
the error you re seeing is an sspi error specifically and kerberos ntlm error and you should approach it using the kerberos ntlm tools and methodologies

1830722
kerberos	ntlm
most if not all kerberos ntlm issues can be troubleshoot using the troubleshooting kerberos errors document

1830733
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
here is a good basic example of using fileoutputstream and fileinputstream to write data to a file then read it back in

1830758
cassini	iis
if the error is coming back from cassini iis then you should post the code in the .aspx .aspx.cs file and the line the error is occurring on

1830783
outputstream	inputstream
the goal of inputstream and outputstream is to abstract different ways to input and output whether the stream is a file a web page or the screen shouldn t matter

1830783
outputstream	inputstream
it assumes the inputstream instr and outputstream osstr have already been created

1830803
postgresql	mysql
i assume you use a relational database like mysql ms sql sqlite postgresql or oracle for storage

1830812
width	height
from what i understand a transform doesn t actual change the width height of a control but rather changes the render width height

1830829
width	height
i m looking for help suggestions in finding the most efficient way to resize an image to be as small as possible using php gd while preserving the aspect ratio of the original image but ensuring the the resized image is bigger than a defined minimum width height

1830829
width	height
for example the resized image must have a width 400 and a height 300 but should be as close to those dimensions as possible while maintaining the original aspect ratio

1830829
width	height	portrait	landscape
such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300

children	parent
how do you know which children go to which parent in the data source

1833907
children	parent
insert the parent rows insert the children rows into a staging table then insert the children rows while joining to the parent on that column to get the id

1833907
children	parent
you can either include the file line # and then use the same steps above joining on those child.line_num parent.line_num and no other parent.line_num is between those two numbers or you can import the parent one at a time in a loop capture the id then insert all of the its children using that id

1833954

codeigniter	cakephp
over the years i have used a lot of php frameworks ranging from codeigniter to cakephp and have been a big fan of zend framework for all my personal projects so i am heavily biased and that is why i am asking here for advice from people who may be able to give me a more objective opinion

client-side	server-side
but when the client writes some date into db perhabs waites some time and then tries to read that data from db it seems like no data has been written to db but if i restart my server-side app or perform db detaching and reataching or restarting of sqlserver-service then my client-side program can get that data from server-side program

1836456
factories	presenter
since your presenter needs the view in its constructor your page should take a dependency on a presenter factories instead of the presenter itself

1836456
factories	presenter
so first you need the presenter factories which is a delegate with the necessary parameters

1836456
factories	presenter
in your view add a property receiving the factories delegate and use the delegate to create the presenter

1836497
vb.net	vb6

1837104
firefox	safari
in firefox or safari in developer mode click the red div and the console will show

1837111
for-loop	arrays
edit if you have an arrays of objects and you wanted to do it in a way other than a for-loop with tests you could do this

1837152

you can set a const of what you think an inch is for yourself and use the width and height of the bounds to represent your measurement

1837156
post	put
if the badness is in the content of a post or put request you ll need to modify your application to save a copy the content as it reads it from the input stream

on cocoa desktop there s nscell which is a lightweight alternative to nsbutton but that s an older technology before calayer and core animation they don t conflicts with each other

1837217
put	get
not sure how to get started but one idea was just to put logic statements comparing the dates between these blocks then adding the total trues

the standard setup for programmers really requires three hands two for the keyboard and one for the mouse

1837440

i m not blessed with an extra hand so my hands have to shift from mouse to keyboard to mouse

1837441
profiling	instrumentation
alternative frameworks rely on things like profiling api or the java 5 se instrumentation feature the java.lang.instrument package to modify cil or bytecode at runtime which makes any dependency mockable

let	curry
for instance in the input let s have a i have to handle beer curry and anything else at all in theory the keywords beer curry have priority over all other strings

1837481
post	get
i want to send a php variable to php file using jquery ajax so the php file can get all post for and echo it back to main file

1837502

i could see if you initial get edit view threw this error and you had firstname set to nullable in your dbml and database but since it is a post this doesn t make sense to me right now

1837524
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you need to use the scriptmanager when registering a script within an updatepanel instead of clientscript.registerstartupscript

1837540
mouse	keyboard
most things that can be done with a mouse while you re programming can be done with a keyboard

1837555

i m trying to get it to run in backtrack 4 which is a pen-testing linux distro based on debian ubuntu

1837580
integer	unsigned
it does not need to be overly elaborate you could simply reserve the first 8 bytes to send the length as a 64-bit unsigned integer

1837581
dllmain	getprocaddress
the dumpbin showed only the dllmain functions being exposed and no other function being exposed hence the getprocaddress was failing

1837657
ant	maven
build ant maven

1837661
observer-pattern	mvp
i don t think you really need a special design pattern for this - just standard mvp mvvm kind of stuff in conjunction with a basic observer-pattern or events if in c# or signal slot etc... would probably be sufficient.

1837686
hex	binary
the basic idea i have is to make a function from the current hex decimal binary values used for each character to the 128 values i would have in the seven bit encoding then scan through the file and write each modified value to a new file

1837686
hex	binary
how do i open the file to read write in binary decimal hex rather than just text

1837687
codeigniter	cakephp
with that knowledge you should be able to jump into a framework like cakephp or codeigniter with a strong appreciation for what they re doing for you

1837707
serializable	deserialization
it s a bit much for a small object like this and i rarely ever actually use xml serializable but would load it into an xml document and pull out what i need for deserialization assignments but when things scale are inherited and generally more complex it allows you to reuse quite a bit more

1837744
puts	gets
which gets all the values from a list on my page and puts them into the events array

1837834
cassini	iis
stopping the debugger doesn t stop iis or cassini

but if the same msi is installed on an x64 platform through bootstrapper all the installation files get copied by default in â œprogram files x86 â and the applicationâ s functionality failed as it could not find the necessary files in the 12-hive hierarchy of program files for 64bit it is â œc program files common files microsoft shared web server extensions 12 configâ

1838010
post	get
post get response

1838010
post	get
to avoid this problem many web developers use the prg pattern â instead of returning a web page directly the post operation returns a redirection command using the http 303 response code sometimes 302 together with the http location response header instructing the browser to load a different page using an http get request

1838018
disk	ram
i came across several ramdisk drivers that can create a virtual disk from the os-hidden ram and am looking for suggestions how best to use the 740mb virtual disk to speed development in our environment

1838019
codeigniter	kohana
i am using an mvc framework in php called kohana in its version 2 which is similar with codeigniter

firefox	safari
this only worked for me in safari not in firefox 3.5

1838105
user-controls	tabcontrol
create a tabcontrol user-controls with all of the tabs that you want to display

1838105
hide	show
add the user control to place holder control upon button click event and show hide the tab pages that you want to display

1838114
notepad++	scite
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++

1838174
post	get
basically it doesn t work different from a normal xmlhttp request xhr post or get to a server

1838227
hide	show
alternatively you could use a decorator pattern where you use a regular asynccallback and decorate it with another one that show hide the popup

1838227
hide	show
alternatively if you use a command pattern you could just add these events to your command pattern implementation and you can register a handler that show hide a popup every time a request is send received

1838242
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
the do everything in a single panel layout managers like gridbaglayout and grouplayout and lots of 3rd party ones have their place mainly when you need components in different parts of the layout to align but with a large layout they generally result in a huge hard-to-handle mess

1838262
multiplying	add
obviously multiplying calls add internally

1838262
multiplying	add
if add fails multiplying fails too

1838303
put	get
hashtable predates the java collections framework from java 1.2 but it s put and get methods are synchronized

1838306
multiplying	add
the fact that multiplying internally uses add is an implementation detail of multiplying

1838306
multiplying	add
so don t take these things into account explicitly in your tests and just write tests to test the functionality of both add and multiplying

1838331
pascal	delphi
i use it for all my projects from delphi 6 to delphi 2009 and free pascal

1838337
dictionary	map
this dictionary is used to map object properties to asp.net controls

1838344

in case you are interested i take the view that it is ok to leave out the getter and setter method for a private inner class especially if the fields are declared as final

1838351
mouse	keyboard
there are literally hundreds of keyboard mouse automation apps out there

1838351
mouse	keyboard
update just re-read the question i dont think what you want is the ability to record keyboard mouse actions as its not guarenteed that the application will keep up with the mouse clicks windows could open in slightly different places or there could be a slight delay etc...

1838355
mouse	keyboard
you should hook keyboard and mouse events see processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# low-level mouse hook in c# or processing global windows mouse and keyboard hooks in c#

1838400
gridbaglayout	miglayout
i tried miglayout for something recently and was disappointed to find that the miglayout actually ended up being more complicated to use than the gridbaglayout in that particular case

1838400
gridbaglayout	miglayout
it s fine to split a gui into panels for different logical sections but i think if you re creating a whole bunch of unnecessary extra nested panels just for the purpose of positioning components you clearly need to learn how to use a gridbaglayout or other similarly advanced layout like miglayout

1838420
addclass	removeclass
i m thinking i am going to need a lot of if s with hasclass removeclass and addclass but i want to see what the so community thinks

1838457
post	put
finally note that i have put a number of generally s in this post - there will always be times when we know better than the optimizer will and for such times we can provide hints nolock etc

1838471
puts	gets
whenever one of your methods gets called it puts this onto the stack

1838515
interbase	firebird
i ve just had an awesome experience porting an interbase 6.0 app to embedded firebird 1.5

1838515
interbase	firebird
your final point about performance - well interbase was always pretty snappy anyway and my experience with embedded firebird thus far is that it screams - really really impressed

1838573
pull	push
support for the git pull and push commands does not look like it is yet implemented within the nbgit plugin - see this bug report for details.

1838594
rss	feed
rss feed

1838642
email	dkim
dkim is not effective against spoofing as it s a means to check for non-repudiation of the email message and to verify the integrity and origin of data

1838646
getter	setter
is it required to create setter getter for version

1838651
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it needs to be compatible with ie6+ firefox google-chrome opera and safari

1838706

i ve got all of the fields on the edit form bound to the appropriate core data entity via an nsarraycontroller and i ve got an awakefromnib method installed to handle calling the record but i m not sure what to put inside the method to get the record to display

1838800
pull	push
i believe clickonce is a pull model although by specifying minimum version we can kind of push

1838821
profiling	debugging
debugging and profiling tools gdb

1838825

hash	md5
to ensure that no one messes with the information during the transfer a md5 hash is calculated at both ends with a special key that is not sent to them

1839003
hash	md5
is there a way to calculate md5 hash in java with iso-8859-1 strings

1839026
codeigniter	cakephp
commonly-used php frameworks out there at the moment include codeigniter and cakephp

1839029
try-catch	exception-handling
depending on the complexity of logical evaluation going on if the first clause evaluates to true and you possibly implement lots of other tests any number of which could result in errors all of which you want handled in the identical way i d consider it mandatory to either raise a specific exception-handling call a method to handle the error or put the whole thing in a try-catch block which can be quite ugly if there s a lot of code

1839054
powerpc	i386
at runtime the mach-o loader will choose the best architecture to run from your universal binary powerpc on powerpc or i386 on intel

1839066
perforce	accurev
i realise our project is far from ideally set up but i can t believe it should be this difficult to branch in tfs it was a piece of cake in sourcesafe accurev and perforce so why so painful in tfs

1839131
cvs	svn
i know that eclipse can do this but maybe they are using some tricks inside because you can commit projects which use different repositories too for example one which is in cvs and the other in svn

1839145
folder	directory
subversion gets cranky about there being no .svn directory in the common root of the folder that you re trying to check in

1839194
qradiobutton	qlabel
any idea beside putting a qradiobutton and a qlabel next to each others

1839231

1839301
firefox	safari
this works fine in ie but the marker does not display in safari or firefox

1839326

you can remove inherited properties from the properties window with the browsable attribute

1839387
public	protected
in java you have public protected package and private visibility

1839478
zeromq	qpid
therefore i would look at products implemented in c++ such as qpid or zeromq

1839478
zeromq	qpid
zeromq will probably perform a lot better because you can have peer to peer channels whereas qpid is using a broker architecture which had a step

1839504
gridview	sqldatasource
as i use asp.net i have some gridview connected to sqldatasource in each tab and only want this content to load when the user selects the specific tab

des	dsa	des	aes
i am not sure about dsa java and .net differs on encryption in des and aes as far as i know

1839653
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
i know it might be overkill but it makes me confident in future on unix-platform freebsd or linux debian but i suppose that the last one

1839660
boost	stl
you must use exactly the same stl preprocessor definitions when you compiled boost in your project

1839671
postgresql	mysql
the tool should be able to cope with db2 oracle postgresql and mysql as a minimum

1839680
int	chars
you need to convert the chars to an int and return that

1839680
int	chars
you should also learn about pointers and how int and chars differ in memory

1839680
int	chars
you can t just assign a pointer to a chars to a pointer to an int

there are plenty of instances object and string for example where the superclass has a no-arg constructor and a subclassing does not

1839841
mp4	h.264
if i don t make a mistake safari currently need mp4 h.264 aac video encoded for the html5 element

1839854
udp	tftp
tftp is used because it uses udp which is simpler and had a smaller footprint than a full tcp-based ftp server

1839915
gridview	onclientclick
i thought about using the onclientclick event for the edit button along with the gridview row for getting the appropriate button based on the row setting the edit button s enable property to false and the visibility of the cancel and update buttons to true

1839942
children	parent
if you create two children then they are separate objects and their parent parts are separate

1839952

jar	war
find out which of your war or ear s jar files contains that and remove it along with the rest of the javax.faces classes

1840323
maven	pom.xml
the internal compiler used for editor hints will follow the source settings in the pom.xml to match the behavior of a full maven build

1840323
maven	pom.xml
maven currently defaults to 1.3 as a source level you can change the source level by editing the pom.xml or more easily using the netbeans project properties dialog

1840324
richfaces	icefaces
as far i know integrating icefaces an richfaces will be possible when theirs jsf 2.0 versions will be released in icefaces 2.0 and richfaces 4.0

1840337
caliburn	prism
have you used prism in combination with caliburn

1840346

1840375
width	height
center screen positioning - using negative margins the same dimension as the height and width of the object you want to center you can center an object in the middle of the browser

1840404
width	height
it appears from your code that you have hard coded the pixel width and height

1840407
objectdatasource	formview
i am binding objectdatasource to formview for update uperation.set objectdatasource as follows

1840412
jsr311	jax-rs
have you considered jax-rs jsr311 and or its sun reference implementation jersey

1840432
caliburn	prism
caliburn actually has a component that adds integration with prism

1840436
int	chars
now at the end i am convincing myself using normal chars array and type casting it into int

1840469
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
currently supports by firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

1840515
postgresql	mysql
you can easily find lots of comparisons of postgresql versus mysql

1840526
width	height
i recommend making your own version of simple_list_item_2 wherein you have both the height and the width set to fill_parent

1840541
punctuation	words
if you try doing it by hand i would suggest applying some kind of normalization to your strings lowercase them remove punctuation maybe replace common abbreviations with the full words dr

1840568
division	multiplication
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .

1840639
perl	tcl	fortran	ada
there are language-bindings for ada c# lisp fortran java lua php perl python ruby tcl etc.

1840649
ilist	iqueryable
what is the difference between ilist and iqueryable

1840661
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction
i know i can split the number between two variables and i have done that for addition and subtraction but never division

1840670
width	height
in css2.1 the padding border and margins are all outside the height and width of an element

1840670
margin	height
this means your elements are 100 of the window height plus the padding plus the margin plus the border

1840680
int	chars
you can write a bigint class that takes chars and stores each element in a linked list data item of type int

1840694
ilist	iqueryable
so realistically in this instance returning ilist or iqueryable has no significant difference

1840705
subtract	add
option 2 if you have monitoring turned on then check the monitoring view user_tab_modifications and add subtract the relevant values to the table statistics

1840720
exponent	modulo
i m looking for a python library where i can import public or private ca signed certificates and automatically encrypt or decrypt message in string format i viewed the crypto library embedded in python source but i don t know how to use the hex modulo and exponent in this part of the certificate

1840723
postgresql	mysql
in 2002 i d say mysql definitely but in 2009 i d say postgresql instead most of the time

1840748
children	parent
now i d like to get a list of all parent and the amount of the parent children

1840748
children	parent
suppose i have one parent with two children and one parent with no children at all

1840756
openssl	m2crypto	rsa	dsa	rsa	aes

1840762
verilog	vhdl
it s not vhdl specific verilog and vhdl examples are presented side by side or even hdl-heavy ndash

1840778
packets	pcap
the pcap data starts with the link-level header but i don t think there s much in it that you re concerned about other than ignoring non-ip packets

1840778
udp	tcp
this is done using the more fragments bit in the flags field and the fragment offset field combined with the identification field to distinguish fragments from different datagrams then you use the protocol field to identify tcp and udp packets and the header length field to find the start of the corresponding header

1840778
udp	tcp
the next step for both tcp and udp is demultiplexing separating out the various connections in the captured packet stream

1840792
versioning	upgrade
you only need to load the new module and the gen_server running the old versioning will upgrade since it calls the new module

1840795
subtract	add
now we have to add up the volumes of these solids for the upper faces and subtract them for the lower faces to get the volume of the poyhedron

1840804
width	height
you can use pure javascript to get the width and height like so

1840813
jsf	tapestry
take the presentation layer of your code written with jsf and then rewrite it using tapestry

1840855
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
this is part of why ada uses the form 16# to introduce hex constants 8# for octal 2# for binary etc

1840855
octal	hex
in fact studies have shown that octal and hex are pretty much the sweet spot for human-readable representations that are binary-compatible

1840855
octal	hex
hex is actually a bit too much already but octal has the problem that it doesn t evenly fit in a byte

1840924
octal	hex
it should also be noted that some languages use o### for octal and x## or h## for hex as well as many other variations

1840965
urllib	httplib
turns out a transparent proxy was making an onward http 1.0 request even though urllib httplib was indeed making a http 1.1 request originally

1840968
unsigned	short
i recently wrote some code that uses the same unsigned short to store two values a result and an id for example

1840982
nsstring	nsxmlparser	nsstring	nsdata
i guess i will use nsxmlparser initwithdata nsdata to construct the parser but how will i format or cast my nsstring of xml formatted text into a proper nsdata object that nsxmlparser will understand and parse

1840999
postgresql	mysql
also starting with version 8.3 of postgresql it is pretty much on-par performance wise with mysql it isn t like the older 7.x versions which were s-l-o-w

1840999
postgresql	mysql
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1841001
post	get
so i thought i would use the get_img_binary method of ofc2 to get the binary data of the image and use jquery to post the binary data to my perl script

1841013
width	height
each div has a pixel width height top and left saved as individual records in the table

1841017
jboss	weblogic
work with other application servers like jboss and weblogic and note their nuances with java

1841020
nsstring	nsdata
the way you get the nsstring into the nsdata is going to dictate the encoding using datausingencoding

1841047
google-chrome	firefox
now in firefox and google-chrome all those divs show up fine and dandy but in ie only the first div is displayed in the container div on the page

1841068
disk	ram
in addition to ctacke s answer remember this cf is a very small subset of the desktop windows that we all love hate such as xp vista windows 7 including server editions the api calls on a cf is smaller as the cf has limited resources such as memory storage space i will refuse to define this as disk space as the distinction on the cf is blurred - flash ram sd cards compact flash cards and so on but no hard disk of any kind

1841094
shadowing	named	superclass	subclassing
you are shadowing your named variable so that the subclassing s named variable and the superclass s named variable are two different variables

1841100
powerpc	i386
you need to look into universal binaries this is the name given to an app file which runs with no dynamic recompilation on both powerpc and i386 architectures

1841100
powerpc	i386
these can be partitioned in such a way that both the i386 and powerpc binaries are contained

1841101
hide	show
if your scrollview is going to be show full-screen in portrait orientation you should use the following sizes assuming you don t hide the status bar

1841112
move	drag
drag move pan

1841124
hide	show
is the solution to show it grab the width then hide again

1841130
switching	screens
now i have the problem i want to create a new view which should switching by clicking the button on the blue screens press me

1841149
int	chars
i ve tried using getline with a delimiter of - but i keep getting the error cannot convert parameter 1 from int to chars

1841149
int	chars
i tried creating a temp chars variable to store the number in and then type casting it to int but that didn t work

1841174
int	chars
if i understand correctly try atoi or stringstream to convert from chars to int

1841192
cos	sin
just remember that cos and sin are your friends and there are 360 degrees in a cricle or 2pi radians depending on your math package

1841207
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
replacing my fadein fadeout by show hide solves my problem but it would be more usable if i could add those animations on this.

1841227
width	height
put the div to fadeout inside another div with the height and width set in css

1841241
ant	maven
build tools like ant and maven

1841321
gridview	objectdatasource
so if anyone is reading this cannot get their gridview to page through an objectdatasource make sure you have a primary key

1841322
width	height
you can do so by either setting height or width of the element or by setting the zoom 1 css style property which effectively does nothing 1 is the default

1841323
vbscript	vb6
i did this in vb6 and added a reference to microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5

1841346
children	parent
my sitemap has 3 levels to it at it s deepest and depending on what section your are in i want to display all of the children below the parent in a navigation

1841349
width	height
this led me to look into resizing it on the server in the c# code but we use user images uploaded to the database and i can t seem to find the right time or place in the page life cycle to access and change the width and height

1841430
folder	directory
inside of our src directory we have two folder and our continuous integration build file

1841447
serializable	deserialization
if you only need serializable and not deserialization you could probably just do

1841461
unsigned	short
how can i declare an unsigned short value in java

1841471
int	chars
admittedly you could use chars - it s a 16-bit unsigned type - but that would be horrible in my view as chars is clearly meant to be for text when code uses chars i expect it to be using it for utf-16 code units representing text that s interesting to the program not arbitrary unsigned 16-bit int with no relationship to text

1841477
int	chars
don t use a chars - use an int -

1841503
skype	ichat
desktop sharing either through skype or ichat etc

1841508
min	max
max and min heap free directives may help with some of your heap ergonomics too

what i can think about is also check all links accessible cffunctions fuseactions etc. accessible by the search result are either secure to be public or being protected to necessary level like

1841617
hash	salt
rngcryptoserviceprovider to generate a random salt then sha512 the password with the salt and finally store both the password hash and the corresponding salt if you want to later verify that some text equals the stored password

1841626
jquery	scriptaculous
incidentally i started using jquery today for the first time i am only new to jquery but i ve dealt with enough javascript and other frameworks prototype scriptaculous etc.. to know whats going on

1841646
short	base
i see initializecomponent is not virtual so it seems there would be no way for the base class to call it short of using reflection

postgresql	mysql
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

1841819
hash	salt
hash and salt

1841819
hash	salt
if you only hash you could be attacked by a rainbow attack reverse has lookup and a salt makes this much more difficult random salt would be best. for your encoding you will probably want to either base64 or hex encode your resulting byte array

1841819
crypt	hash
you might check out a standard password hash such as crypt on unix systems

1841819
hash	salt
but again a simple hash + salt is good enough for most applications

1841842
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been working on a website www.philipdukes.co.uk and although the nav seems to work fine in firefox safari google-chrome even ie6 miraculously on my system here it fails miserably in ie8 the navigation links don t work

1841866
put	get
best to put up a message saying that there is no internet connection and give them an option to retry in case they can get an internet connection or choose to quite it themselves

1841868
hash	salt
a single strong hash is likely good enough and adding salt is easy enough that there s no reason not to do so

a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

1842001
put	get
1 i noticed that if we donâ t bind gridview to object data source control then when user puts gridview into edit mode we have to handle gridview.rowediting event else we get an exception and in this event put gridviewâ s row into editing mode

1842043
width	height
if you wanted to assign the letter at 40 60 with a width and height of 20 and a texture width and height of 200 to this quad then the uv coordinates would be

when i deploy the war in jboss and put jar in jboss class path i get a linkageerror on instantiating externalclass when i run the app

1842643
implements	extends
imageobserver is implements by java.awt.component so if you extends that in the containing class you could override imageupdated and store the image height when the function is called asynchronously if image.getheight returns -1

1842651
int	chars
the only data type that i can think of that might cover that number would be to translate all of the int into 0-padded strings and put them all together as a big chars

1842667
int	chars
it appears you re trying to convert a chars to an int in which case you d want to use the atoi function or a string stream

1842682
hash	whirlpool
whirlpool hash is not in python s stdlib but there are both pure python and c extensions that support it python-mhash

1842711
elf	coff
see references on the coff and elf formats for example

1842721
put	get
in a normal string to get a you need to put two backslashes in a row like so 1 but you can use a python raw string to conveniently write the replacement pattern

1842746
hash	whirlpool
whirlpool isn t a very common hash

1842746
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu include a whirlpool package

1842746

use the floyd-warshall algorithm if you want to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertexes as it has a far higher running time than dijkstra s algorithm

1846862
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

1847205
switching	screens
the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode

folder	directory
i ve found this to be useful to visually see unversioned files in one place in a directory listing - but obviously only one folder at a time

1847771
freebsd	linux
this is probably the easiest way or alternately have a look at the source of tail in gnu s coreutils specifically it s -f function although thinking more you ll probably want to look at how the freebsd implementation works as i believe that the gnu version uses some linux specific callback

1847791

int	double
what is the biggest no-floating int that can be stored in an ieee 754 double type without losing precision

1848762
int	double
the biggest largest int that can be stored in a double without losing precision is the same as the largest possible value of a double

1848762
int	double
go on ask me what the largest int is such that it and all smaller int can be stored in ieee 64-bit double without losing precision

1848762
int	double
or another way of looking at it once the bias has been taken off the exponent and ignoring the sign bit as irrelevant to the question the value stored by a double is a power of 2 plus a 52-bit int multiplied by 2 exponent âˆ 52

1849428
width	height
the idea being that the inner box s offset height and width will never be greater than 200px even if it has a border as shown in the css

1849428
width	height
in quirks mode because the box model is royally screwed you can set height and width to 100 and be done however i am working in standards mode

1849428
width	height
if not can you advise on a javascript solution which does not involve measuring the offset values setting the height width and then subtracting the difference

1849455

cassini	iis
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio

1849457
queue	fifo
and have some other process launched via a crontab every minute for instance check that fifo queue

1849473
bash	zsh
i highly recommend moving away from csh towards something like bash or zsh

1849487
nfa	dfa
unfortunately nfa- dfa involves a potentially exponential size explosion because states in the dfa are subsets of states in the nfa

1849487
nfa	dfa
fortunately it s possible to avoid the subset-of-states explosion and intersect two nfa directly using the same construction as for dfa

1849508
error-handling	exception-handling
exception-handling separate error-handling code from the normal program flow and thus make the code more readable robust and extensible

1849937
post	get
i seem to recall being able to configure asp.net ajax using attributes on the methods to use an http get rather than an http post

1849962
post	get
ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

1850143
multiplying	subtract
it doesn t make sense to compare an array to zero multiplying it or subtract it.

1850196
post	get
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

1850196
post	get
the server can look at the request method get post and does not differentiate between a regular request and an ajax request

1850197

personally i prefer to put only brief one-line summary of in-line functions and members in header files as otherwise it makes it harder to get a brief overview of the class functionality when skimming through the header file

1850556
put	get
but if i use a variable length array an array whose length is setted in run time i get the opposite behaviour a is put on the the stack before the array

1850569
firefox	safari
it works in firefox safari and ie6 but not in ie8

1850705

avro	thrift
use thrift or protobufs possibly avro to declare a communication protocol and use that over a tcp socket

1851149
haskell	sml
pattern-matching functional languages like sml or haskell may be best to express this pseudocode procedural ones like my big love python may actually mask the problem too deeply by including too-rich functionality such as itertools.combinations which does all the hard work for you and therefore hides it from you

1851149
haskell	scheme	haskell	sml	sml	scheme
what are you most familiar with for this purpose -- scheme sml haskell ..

1851296
igraph	networkx
b. if networkx and igraph can t do it what package could you possibly suggest

1851303
awt	swing
you need to read the article on painting in awt and swing

1851599
int	chars
use int instead of chars

1851599
int	chars
the value eof is a negative int usually -1 so clearly you can t store it in an unsigned chars or in a plain chars that is unsigned

1851621
portrait	landscape
in the interface builder i rotate the main window from portrait to landscape and than put few uicontrols on it

1851621

1851769
client-side	server-side
the purpose of json xml in this context is to provide data to client-side javascript through a webservice which at the back end is probably a server-side language php ruby whatever that is pulling data from sql and then marshaling it into json xml for consumption by the requesting client

1851967
int	chars
note that the return value of std cin.peek is actually of type which is the same as which is an int and not a chars

1851967
int	chars
more important than that the value returned in that int is not necessarily a simple cast from chars to int but is the result of calling on the next chars in the stream or which is defined to be eof if there is no chars

1851967
int	chars
typically this is all implemented in exactly the same way as fgetc casts the chars to an unsigned chars and then to an int for its return value so that you can distinguish all valid chars values from eof

1852019
post	get
i suppose you could pass php code to a server-side script and interpret execute it but you d still need ajax or a full get post request and it would never be a good thing to do because of how easy it would be for malicious code injection

1852020
interpolation	splines
if you want to interpolation data in a quite general and fast way splines or polynomials are very useful

however it only support wav files as far as i can tell - it does not support other common formats such as mp3 or ogg

1852397
unsigned	short
new because you are using var as an index to an array you should declare it as unsigned short instead of short

1852436
unsigned	short
use an unsigned short which just gives you enough room for this example but will go wrong if you want to get another 4 steps forward

1852460
colorbox	simplemodal
i can t help you with colorbox but if you have a specific question or issue with simplemodal i d be happy to help

1852474
post	get
i from what i can see the structure module works by treating weblog post as â pagesâ now with this in mind if i wanted to use structure how would i get it to work in the way that i want it to in terms of having a weblog with one big field group so that when a hotel is added all of its information is in one place instead of being spread across 3 different weblogs

1852492
hash	md5
you could use an md5 hash which has a theoretical possibility of collisions - albeit 1 in billions of hash that may collide - although i can t say i d understand the purpose of using a hash over using the actual word

1852492
hash	md5
you don t have to worry about collisions and you still get the most efficient indexing mechanism for storage purposes meaning you re not storing md5 hash that are potentially longer than the original word - which makes no sense for real world use

if you just put the database files inside a vhd then as said originally all is easy except you don t get the detailed treatment you probably want

1853149
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
in embedded systems the short and unsigned short data types are used for accessing items that require less bits than the native integer

1853149
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
for example if my usb controller has 16 bit registers and my processor has a native 32 bit integer i would use an unsigned short to access the registers provided that the unsigned short data type is 16-bits

1853177

1853540
tlistview	tframe
i should not add items to tlistview in the tframe constructor.

1853540
tlistview	tframe
while not necessarily a good idea in terms of design adding items to tlistview in the tframe constructor should not cause access violations

1853540
tlistview	tframe
adding items to tlistview in the tframe constructor should not cause access violations

1853586
turing	decidable
a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set also called a decidable recursive or turing computable set if there is a turing machine that given a number n halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set

1855222
int	chars
is there any disadvantage to using chars for small int in c

1855222
int	chars
in particular is the processor likely to cope with int arithmetic on a chars better or worse than it would on a long short int

1855222
int	chars
a little benchmarking on windows vs 6.0 debug build 32-bit with a handful of stacked loops gives int and long as providing similar performance which is about twice as fast as chars

1855222
int	chars
running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced

1855232
wadl	wsdl
i would suggest to avoid wadl or wsdl for api documentation you can see this question where i explained my reasons why the slow wadl uptake

1855232
wadl	wsdl
wadl or wsdl are usually used for automatic client code generation they are not human readable documentation

1855232
wadl	wsdl
i don t think wadl or wsdl are very useful for a user to figure out how to consume the resources correctly

1855250
int	chars
using chars for int is really only useful when you have a lot of numbers a large array and you need to conserve space

1855252
ironruby	ironpython
keep in mind with ironruby and ironpython there are 2 separate type systems in play there is the underlying clr type system and the ironruby ironpython type system when they call out to c# code there is marshalling going on

1855252
ironruby	ironpython
so even though ironruby ironpython can properly monkey patch their own type system they can not use the same mechanism to patch the clrs type system

1855254
int	chars
valid reasons to use chars for storing int values are when the space really matters that much not as often as you might think and when describing some external data format protocol that you are marshalling data to from

1855271
int	chars
arithmetic on chars will almost certainly actually performed using the same registers as arithmetic on int

1855271
int	chars
there is therefore no adavantage for using chars over int when it comes to arithmetic performance

1855879
post	get
get all friends ids of user1 and then select all post

1855922
spaces	delimiter
in your specific example the string you want is seemingly always the second word delimiter by a spaces so it can be beneficial to include the spaces in the regular expression to look for it

1855998
hide	show
i have made a very quick jquery slideshow and i m using this to hide the div s which shouldn t be show until it s their turn obviously

1855999
affinity	processors
so by default the affinity bitmask 1...111 32 times. this means that the process may run on processors 1 2 3 ... 32. of course if you only have 2 cores then the extra 30 bits won t apply

1856018
hide	show
then if you can be sure the user has js enabled you can hide the divs using css and show them using js

1856019
html5lib	beautifulsoup
also can use beautifulsoup and html5lib for parsing

1856019
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

1856023

i dunno if this should go in a math forum or a programming forums but i ll post it in both and see where i get

1856278
getter	setter
however there are internal members in the abstract base properties with internal setter and public getter that the service uses so it needs to be in the same assembly as the service for that to be possible

1856313
postgresql	mysql
i guess i could require the install of a database server but a commercial mysql license doesn t make sense postgresql is different enough that i d have to rewrite a lot of my application

1856349
ant	cruisecontrol
we are using cruisecontrol to build our projects which are ant files

1856359
width	height
in silverlight the approach would be to give the row and column definitions which define the cell a specific height and width respectively

1856359
width	height
now you can modify the width and height properties of the definitions and the other cells and their contents will move accordingly

1856411
hide	show
in the subclass i override its -touchesended forevent method in order to hide and show the uitoolbar on a single tap touch through a caanimation as well as issue an nsnotification that causes the view controller to hide its navigation bar

1856411
hide	show
i made some progress with this but i cannot distinguish touch events and thus i fire a toolbar hide show method when it should not be fired

1856411
hide	show	nstimer	caanimation
the method -toggletoolbarview triggers an nstimer -timed caanimation that hide show a

it seems that most browsers don t support other methods besides get and post since it is a limitation of html forms

1857064
post	put	post	get	put	get
methods you could add a hidden input to a regular get post form with the pseudo-method and have your application translate it so that your controllers see it as if it were a true put request as you mentioned

1857064
post	put	post	get	put	get
however get post put and delete are supported in ajax by the major browsers so there should be no need for a hidden input if you aren t relying on the html form

np-hard	np-complete
np-complete problems are those problems that are both np-hard and in the complexity class np

1857339
np-hard	np-complete
therefore to show that any given problem is np-complete you need to show that the problem is both in np and that it is np-hard

1857342
np-hard	np-complete
the precise definition here is that a problem x is np-hard if there is an np-complete problem y such that y is reducible to x in polynomial time

1857342
np-hard	np-complete
but since any np-complete problem can be reduced to any other np-complete problem in polynomial time all np-complete problems can be reduced to any np-hard problem in polynomial time

1857342
np-hard	np-complete
as another example any np-complete problem is np-hard

1857362

someone will probably crucify me for the ugliness of this solution but you can add rows and columns with height and width set to twice your padding values in between the actual rows and columns that contain data

1861461
children	parent
it shows a simple 2-level hierarchical treeview with parent items a b and c with numbered children a.1 b.1 etc

1861487
packets	pcap
as far as i know the only perl module on win32 that deals with packets on the fly is net pcap but it only support passive monitoring and not affet the tcp ip stack

1861506
pop-up	dialog
on windows if the unit testing process crashes this pop-up a modal dialog which locks our build farm

1861569
hash	md5
it calculates md5 hash for files and selects files whose md5

1861583
versioning	upgrade
also you will upgrade grails versioning more easily

1861595
free	malloc
if you need to do this you should make a copy of the data into memory you allocate with new or malloc and then the caller must delete free that memory

1861628
nstextview	nstextstorage
but at a basic level all nstextview s have an nstextstorage object accessible via the textstorage method nstextstorage happens to be a subclass of nsmutableattributedstring

1861642
min	max
you can combine this with what you have above checking for min max and supplying defaults for your between clause

1861672
ubuntu	linux
i tried compiling it on my desktop linux and it still works after i edit setup.py to link against libboost_python-mt instead of libboost_python which doesn t exist in ubuntu there are several depending on python version and so forth

1861688
queue	fifo
queue means fifo can be implemented by a double linked list or maybe in other sensible ways

1861688
dictionary	map
map associative array dictionary means you map keys to values

1861702
folder	directory
you can create an application folder on the webserver and call it something like new then install the mvc project into the new directory

1861706
hash	md5
but i would add a price tag to this basket for each item and often it makes sense to add also the users session id md5 hash to this basket

1861734
versioning	upgrade
first the core python packages as these don t change with backwards-incompatible issues unless you re upgrading a major versioning and you ll want whatever security fixes from a python upgrade to apply automatically to your virtualenvs

1861734
psycopg	mysql-python
second packages that are a pain to easy_install or pip install into each individual virtualenv but that don t change very often -- mysql-python psycopg and pil for example

1861768
getter	setter
another example is properties in python - where your code can directly reference class or instance variables rather than always go through setter getter

1861785
public	protected
edit2 based on your comment below have two sub-classes of foo one that simply provides public versions of the protected methods and one that has overrides all of the important methods

1861786
public	protected
what i ve done when i ve been in a situation like this and its not nice but it works is create a publicfoo in the same package as foo but in your source have it extend foo and override the protected method and make it public

1861790
inline	inlining
you should simply mark functions as inline when 1 it is convenient for you and 2 you want to ensure that the compiler has the option of applying the inlining optimization

1861944
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
would there be any difference between using an autoresetevent and a manualresetevent

1861973
hash-function	rabin-karp
i am familiar with the rabin-karp algorithm which uses a hash-function for its operation but this algorithm does not dictate a specific hash function to use and the one the authors suggested is o m where m is the length of the hashed string

1861980
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
both autoresetevent and manualresetevent derive from waithandle which is the prescribed use case here

1862035
accessor	properties
take a look using the properties accessor to get the mapi properties

1862042
rss	feed
i want to have rss feed in my django application which should be

1862042

i ve had lots of problems getting a simple uiimagepicker working see my other post and i ve been getting memory warning notifications after taking a picture and before i even get a chance to dismiss the uiimagepicker

1862123
postgresql	mysql
originally we intended to use mysql but now project requirements have changed to use postgresql

1862146
mantis	bugzilla
see for example bugzilla and mantis which eric seppanen elaborates on more in his answer

1862148
hide	show
i even worked with hide show but guess they wont work with

1862206
int	boolean	int	chars
protected boolean keychar chars c int status int time

1862206
int	chars
this method invokes manager.keychar chars int int on this screen s delegate manager

1862208
hide	show
use hide and show as you yourself suggested

1862208
hide	show
in other words every time the #group selectbox is changed hide all options in #subgroup and show only the ones whose value attribute starts with groupval

1862264
int	boolean
only use null true for non-string fields such as int boolean and dates

1862293
windows	wow64
first you have to know that windows 64 bit can run both 64 bit and 32 bit in emulation mode wow64 so you ll have to decide if you want to allow that or you are interested only in pure 64 bit

1862303
pull	push
it would work for push and pull

1862335
accessor	properties
the impression i had from what the apple engineers have said was that the data would be faulted in for the non-fetched properties as soon as you used the accessor for that properties

1862335
accessor	properties
it may be that in generating the description of the nsmanagedobject these accessor are being used for each properties causing the data to be faulted in right before the string describing the objects is generated

1862347
unix	bsd
i know for certain that it is available on bsd and possibly other unix s

1862382
ubuntu	debian
after getting that installed and set up you can say fink install mysql-unified-dev to get essentially the same thing as asking for libmysqlclient15-dev on a debian or ubuntu type system

1862417
rss	feed
later when a rss feed reader comes by your site for the user you just load the user information for the user with that token

1862424
post	get
the only option conditions takes is method get post etc. letting you restrict which methods may be used to access the route

1862434
getter	setter
i reflector d the getter and setter for good measure

1862456
qtkit	quicktime

1862511
jmenubar	jmenuitem
is there a way to add a jmenuitem or similar button-type object to a jmenubar

1862511
jmenubar	jmenuitem
adding a jmenuitem doesn t play well with the layout of a jmenubar and buttons look too button-like

1862511
jmenubar	jmenuitem
should we be tweaking the button to look like a jmenuitem or tweaking the jmenubar to display the jmenuitem correctly

1862557
jmenubar	jmenuitem
you need to put the jmenuitem in a jmenu then you add the jmenu to the jmenubar

1862578
postgresql	mysql
the above syntax works with mysql and postgresql for varous syntax used for this kins of request you can have a look there select-limit

1862598
int	boolean
the sig for this method is refreshnavigationimages boolean int

1862620
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

1862647
bash	tcsh
if you can use tcsh instead of bash you can set the time variable

1862677
switching	screens
it shows how you can seamlessly switching between a couple of different screens

1862712
realloc	malloc
you can dynamically allocate an array of float of some initial size using malloc or realloc and then extend it periodically using realloc

1862728
maya	blender
also are people using any 3d modeling tools like maya 3ds max or blender with this 3d game engines

1862791

i wrote a teeny tiny sinatra app that runs fine locally but for some reason as soon as i put it online all i get is internal server error

1862819
children	parent
you can get the children from parent

1862846
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox ie and google-chrome

1862853
jmenubar	jmenuitem
the following code implements camickr s solution although i would have come up with the same thing after seeing the default way jmenuitem s are rendered in a jmenubar

1862867
bellman-ford	dijkstra
edit otoh dijkstra s with an unsorted array for the priority queue timed out. that bfs bellman-ford worked surprised me a little as i thought that the input size was quite large

1862875
jboss	weblogic
websphere xd provides application virtualization for a heterogeneous it environment managing and optimizing a wide range of application servers including websphere apache bea weblogic jboss and oracle application servers

1862875
solaris	aix
websphere xd supports many operating systems including aix hp-ux linux sun solaris windows and z os

1862876
hide	show
i think i can do this by having the three images next to each other far enough apart that the one to the other side will not show and use javascript to hide the scroll buttons and then use javascript to scroll to the html anchor that specifies the location of the image

1862883
bellman-ford	dijkstra
the boost graph library appears to have implementations for both dijkstra and bellman-ford

1862889
put	get
i don t need to actually run a tfs server myself but i do need the ability to connect to my clients and get put files and the integration with team explorer in vs is really nice hence i d rather not have to use an external 3rd party tool

rss	feed
for some examples of reading and writing extended values from rss feed go here.

1862929
floating-point	integer
as the other commentators rightly remarked ap is much slower than hardware supported floating-point datatypes because you must program it with the integer datatypes per hand

1862934
affinity	processors
option one means that you run four instances of the erlang vm each with a single scheduler affinity set to different processors cores

1862934
affinity	processors
option two means running a single erlang vm with four schedulers each scheduler s affinity set to different processors cores

1863002
folder	directory
here s the part that is really frustrating me the fxcop documentation here says that it will load up all referenced assemblies from either the same folder that the analyzed assembly is in or from a folder referenced by the directory command line option

1863002
folder	directory
the file does exist in the same folder as the one being analyzed and i have tried passing the folder in as a directory command line option

1863011
ropemacs	pymacs
the ropemacs variants appears to be for refactoring only and pymacs is allows python as an emacs-extension language -- neither of which is what you need for standard support

1863013
g++	gcc
this can make a difference especially if you are combining compilation with the link phase as it can lead to different libraries being linked g++ vs gcc and so you can control the outcome in your makefile

1863049
mp3	wav
does anyone know a way to convert audio files wav mp3 into a list of comma separated 8-bit text sample values

1863050
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the test case below works fine in firefox opera and google-chrome i get the expected list of nodes and depths but fails in ie8 all the nodes are at the same depth and end tags are included in the node list

1863057
put	get
i always get does not contain rows as a result but looking at the visual studio debugger shows that the collection i m passing in contains the two values i put in there

1863090
min	max
if that s not successful maybe find the actual min and max amongst the samples and adjust your scale accordingly

1863102
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
looks like ie doesn t treat your xml nodes as dom nodes whereas firefox google-chrome and opera do

1863136
strlen	strtok
strtok can return null if it doesn t find the separator it s looking for and you can t call strlen with null

1863136
strcpy	malloc
malloc can return null if there isn t enough memory and you can t call strcpy with null either

1863151
vb6	powerbuilder
i haven t done anything with powerbuilder but this is the technique we followed pretty successfully with a project that could not immediately be migrated from vb6

1863151
vb6	powerbuilder
2 we referenced the com objects in our vb6 code as you would in the powerbuilder code using the built in object handling oleobject in your case

1863165
subtract	addition	subtract	add	subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
the two s-complement system has the advantage of not requiring that the addition and subtraction circuitry examine the signs of the operands to determine whether to add or subtract

1863195
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
to do both the malloc and strcpy in one call it would be better to use strdup as it also remembers to allocate room for the terminating nul which you left out of your code as written

1863195
printf	strtok
the actual segfault you are getting is likely to be inside strtok not printf because your sample as written is attempting to pass a string constant to strtok which must be able to modify the string

1863219
integer	unsigned
for unsigned integer types size_t being one of those the c standard and the c++ standard too i think specifies precise overflow rules

1863221
min	max
when the progressbar gets rendered tag and cbcount are zero meaning that the progressbar will have min 0 max 0 and value 0 which is correctly drawn as as 100

1863234

to speed things up you can exclude large 3rd party jars from scanning by adding ignore-scanning-archives attrribute to meta-inf manifest.mf file in your war you ll need latest fixpack too

1863306
organization	naming
while you may end up with more files they shouldn t be hard to keep track of if you have a good organization and naming system keeping models views and controllers in 3 separate folders or have some kind of naming convention that tells you what is what

1863332
subtraction	addition
two s complement is very nice for doing subtraction just like addition

1863342

my plan of attack is to use libcurl and curlpp to grab the feed i d also like to do more libcurl stuff in the future

1863380
curlpp	libcurl
so here is the question and i know it is extremely noobish how do i write c++ code that will use libcurl and curlpp and will work on the 3 major oses

1863380
curlpp	libcurl
the main thing i don t understand is if i have to compile libcurl and curlpp then how does it work when trying to take it over to the other platforms

1863388
versioning	upgrade
do not upgrade to this versioning without carefully reading the documentation and reviewing the new examples

1863450

however i would like to declare that i support both http-redirect get and http-post post

1863477
yacc	bison
i m assuming here that you have some additional rules such as commaloop expr otherwise your grammar doesn t actually match anything and bison yacc will complain about unused non-terminals

1863479
int	chars
gamestate is a class the implements gamestateinterface and an object that implements this interface can be passed to the agent so the agent can read and analyze the data from game state and the agent must return the appropriate action returned as an int that the chars should take

1863484
superclass	subclassing
as for finding this in the java language specification i first missed it as well as it is not as one might expect specified where overriding or the subsignature relation is discussed but in members and constructors of parameterized types â 4.5.2 which reveals that formal type parameters of the superclass are syntactically replaced by the actual type parameter in the subclassing prior to checking for override equivalence

1863501
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu for example it is part of the default python install

1863518
implements	extends
implements x509keymanager or extends x509extendedkeymanager if you re working with sslengine

securitymanager	classloader
might take a bit of googling--and i m fairly sure you ll find it s all done in a special classloader or securitymanager

1863560
public	protected
this grants code permission to query a class for its public protected default package access and private fields and or methods

1863588
xslt	xquery
the optimization is enabled only if explicitly requested either by using the saxon stream extension function or the saxon read-once attribute on anxslt xslt copy-of instruction or the xquery pragma saxon stream

1863710
post	get
i have inspected the whole shebang with firebug and it seems that the _post is getting cleared because the processing page does a 302 redirect back to itself that obviously uses a get and so the post data is discarded

1863720
many-to-one	one-to-many
assuming that article to category is a one-to-many relationship and that the category has a many-to-one property called article here is a very dirty way of doing this i am really not proud of this but it works

1863753
mouse	keyboard
is there a generic input window message that gets sent before it is interpreted as being mouse or keyboard or other device

1863753
mouse	keyboard
the behaviour i want is similar to windows waking up from screen saver sleep on keyboard or mouse input

1863782
kde	gnome
however under windows xp linux with gnome and linux with kde the screenshot contains a white area where the overlapping window obstructs the view

1863799
zoo	xts
you have several good options timeseries its fts xts but the most popular of these is the zoo package

1863818
unsigned	short
note that getting the field id for a simpler variable like an unsigned short with signature s works just fine

1863848
getter	setter
one property with attribute and getter setter and one field with the same name starting with an _ character

1863890
int	double
nstimeinterval is a double and you re doing int division

1863890
int	double
just change its type from int to double and you should be good

1863895
haskell	ocaml
use haskell ocaml or f# instead

1863924
ubuntu	linux
for this example i am running ubuntu linux 64-bit

1863931
setinterval	settimeout
edit knowing nothing about the widget i would probably set an interval to make requests from client to server either by using javascript setinterval or settimeout .

1863960
int	double
use doublevalue in order to get the string as a double so you can avoid int division

1863970
equals	compareto
you would correctly feel like replacing this with equals and use compareto in cases where you are interested in more that just one case

1863984
changeset	cherry-pick
furthermore it causes cherry-pick at the file level which is even more dangerous than ordinary cherry picking by changeset

1863984
changeset	cherry-pick
discarding some changeset only to accept subsequent ones is yet another name for cherry-pick

1864019
opera	safari

google-chrome	firefox
at the moment i m getting varying results between ie firefox and google-chrome

1864041
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it looks fine an in google-chrome there are separators in the header

1864093
comparator	comparable
comparator and comparable are two separate and independent entities only their purpose is similar

i don t believe so but there is min and max

1864752
min	max
i don t know of one but you could use min and max

1864753
centos	linux
el stands for enterprise linux in this case so i think redhat or a clone like centos

1864753

if anyone has any ideas how to get it to work in firefox like it works in google-chrome i would really appreciate it

1865339
width	height
then put this image into your content pane div table whatever you are using for layout but set width 800px height 1px this will force your content to always be at least 800px wide but not cover the fullscreen on resolutions that have width greater than 800px

google-chrome	safari
i m really trying to find out whether there is some kind of conflict between the validation plugin and webkit browsers safari google-chrome or between jquery and webkit browsers before i embark on a bug-hunting mission although i ve already wasted several hours and got nowhere

1866134
google-chrome	safari
this all works fine in all the browsers except the webkit browsers safari google-chrome

1866136
serializable	deserialization
during deserialization serializable classes do not have their constructor called

1866168
int	double
and in your example an int is not a double so the cast will fail

1866176
single-quotes	double-quotes
use single-quotes rather than double-quotes

1866252

toggle displaying each of the set of matched elements based upon the switch true show all elements false hide all elements

1866293
gridview	repeater
i once had a bet with a colleague that i could write code using asp.net controls to display nested data using either a repeater or gridview far easier than he could write the same code usign xslt

1866318
int	double
for your average calculation you may try casting the int values to double like double total double size even though casting just one value should be enough

1866437
folder	directory
the application fails to load my plug-in dll because my dll depends on a private assembly which is never found it is not located in the application directory nor in the winsxs folder but in my plug-in directory whose location is not controlled by the application

1866485
firefox	safari
it s distributed as a straight-forward and self-contained zip works out of the box with safari and firefox you may want to combine it with svgweb that brings svg support to internet explorer

1866557
expression-blend	silverlight
silverlight has got expression-blend as well for kind of wysiwyg

1866572
ant	maven
give a try to tattletale it works both in ant and maven

1866574
jquery	scriptaculous
it look like that you re at least under the hood mixing jquery with prototype or scriptaculous and that the whole thing is colliding with each other

1866611
mouse	keyboard
then you just need a massive power supply a separate keyboard and mouse and a big monitor p

1866668
int	chars
if you want to figure out what encoding is being used in your case i d advise printing the actual value of the chars as an int

1866730
serializable	deserialization
as i see it a big benefit of using the out-of-the-box xml serializable api is that you can get started with persisting your objects without having to do almost anything except a few rows of serializable deserialization code

1866731
onmouseover	onclick
when onmouseover changes to onclick it works

1866775
onclick	onfocus	onclick	onmousedown	onmousedown	onfocus

1866841
inherited	properties
check out the system.web.ui.webcontrols.webcontrol class - it inherited from system.web.ui.control and has an attributes properties

1866887
implements	extends
for example userrecordsclerk might be better explained as extends a generic recordsclerk interface that both userrecordsclerk and companyrecordsclerk implements and then specialise on meaning one can look at the methods in the interface to see what the its subclasses do are generally for

1866898
uiview	subviews
i think you need to set the container uiview s userinteractionenabled property then as you tried set the footerview to the container with the subviews

1866928
folder	directory
put these in a different folder under the base symfony directory

1866939
superclass	subclassing
the superclass should not know about its subclassing

1866939
superclass	subclassing
if all the subclassing are going to implement -doauniquebehaviour then it should be implemented in the superclass even empty and each subclassing will override it to its needs

1866950
multiplying	add
then multiplying the direction vector ab by the original length minus the circle s radius and add back to the lines starting position

1866986

it is possible to emulate vim modes macros and bindings in textmate

1867274
post	get
as i did not get anywhere after finding the comment left in the ie mobile blog by charles morris - program manager on the ie mobile team on his own post i am forced to add this answer and state it is

1867281
vim	textmate
i used to love textmate but changed to vim after finally giving it a chance

1867281
vim	textmate	macvim	textmate
if what you re looking for is a mac integrated vim through textmate you might try macvim too

1867309
public	protected
create a protected string property that is mapped in nhibernate and wrap a public uri around it

1867318
cos	exp
if fitting is not allowed at all the four functions can be divided into two distinct subgroups repeating functions cos and tan and strict increasing functions exp and log

1867355
openssl	m2crypto
as far as i could find only m2crypto supports reading from these files but it can t be used inside gae because it s a wrapper around openssl so not a pure python solution

1867361
getter	setter
also again a lazy loading thing you should never refer to member vars directly in an entity class you should always use the getter and setter

1867361
equals	tostring
so your equals tostring .

1867375
ilist	icollection
in fact you could implement ilist of whateverbase icollection of whateverbase etc too - and throw runtime exceptions if you get an incompatible type in your add method for example

1867393
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
ie use different approach at setting cursor position than firefox opera and google-chrome

1867406
post	get
if you are querying relatively small numbers of stories at a time you can probably get away w o denormalizing the post information including vote count itself and just multiget that

1867521
google-chrome	firefox
i was having problems with externalinterface and firefox and google-chrome and discovered that the adobe script was not writing the flash tag quickly enough so when the browser tried to find the addcallback function it was not there at the time

1867603
youtube	vimeo
i am interested in taking a screen shot of flash movies on sites like youtube and vimeo

1867605
richfaces	icefaces
i ve also looked at richfaces and icefaces demos and there s an awful lot of tables-for-layout there as well

1867607
put	get
.htaccess contains a few basic directives but if i put some random stuff at the top i don t get internal server errors so i don t think it even reaches the .htaccess stage

1867669
hide	show
are there any javascript markdown editing toolbars or libraries that show the live preview within the textarea and hide the formatting marks ___ etc similar to tinymce s implementation

1867670
richfaces	icefaces
i ve also looked at richfaces and icefaces demos and there s an awful lot of tables-for-layout there as well

1867713
authorization	access-control
if your application s security policy requires clients to have appropriate authorization to access the resource the application should force reauthorization or provide a custom access-control mechanism

1867760
junit	testng
both junit and testng provide mechanisms for iterating over a collection of input parameters and running your tests against them

1867760
junit	testng
in junit this is supported via the parameterized annotation while testng uses dataprovider

1867766
webkit	gecko
update this only works in gecko webkit

1867788
apache	nginx
finally you need to set up an apache or nginx or whatever instance for each domain and use the appropriate site_n.py as the settings file for that server

1867798
subclass	abstract-class
i ended up defining an static string in each subclass holding the tag of the element so i decided to turn the interface into an abstract-class and give it more functionality

1867846
cos	sin
glulookat 0.0f 2.0f 0.0f 0.0f 0.0f 100.0f 0.0f cos cameraangle sin cameraangle

1867853
subclass	abstract-class
this forces the subclass to define a static variable itself and return it to the abstract-class via the abstract gettag method

1867870
edifact	x12
it s a fairly good tool just for that purpose it supports x12 edifact and tradacoms standards and it s free

1867880
put	get
remeber that if you put a condition in the where clause it s going to apply that condition to the whole set so any row that doesn t bring back a product will automatically get filtered out because your condition can t be true

1867958
for-loop	arrays
i want to replace the above code with a for-loop that iterates on an arrays of strings

1867958
for-loop	arrays
what would the for-loop syntax be for iterating over the arrays of strings

1867992
ethernet	wireless
when receiving a raw ethernet packet over a wireless connection where does the ethernet checksum get calculated and where are errors handled

1867997
for-loop	arrays
note array_filter will iterate over your arrays and is going to be much faster execution time-wise than using a for-loop as array_filter is a wrapper to an underlying c function

1868005
folder	directory
from what i can tell about your problem i would just specify the user s home directory as the directory to include and perhaps exlude the cache folder

1868022
superclass	subclassing
in each method that superclass checks if the corresponding class is equals or a subclassing of that class

1868040
inherited	subclassing
this createchildcontrols method is part of the control inherited hierarchy and is typically overriden by subclassing controls

1868316
implements	sealed
this then brings up a more general question - if a type is not sealed should it really implements these interfaces at all

1868316
implements	sealed
my current thought is to have my generated comparison function only use on member fields whose t is sealed and instead to use the virtual object.equals object obj if t is unsealed even if t implements since the field could potentially store subtypes of t and i doubt most implementations of are designed appropriately for inheritance

1868359
inherited	subclassing
i defined a base class node that has only a few fields nodeid parentid nodetype and several subclassing that inherited from node and add their own fields

1868375
public	protected
to get all object fields including public protected package and private access fields simply use class.getdeclaredfields

1868378
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
typically it is stored as a salt hash of either md5 or sha1

1868378
hash	salt
so you have a random salt store it in the user s table and then you hash their pass and the salt like this

1868485
implements	sealed
i ve been thinking about this question for a bit and after a bit of consideration i agree that implements and should only be done on sealed types

1868525
hash	hmac
im using hmac to get a hash version of the hole object but first i serialize the object into a string format json format

1868553
rsa	aes
you could use a combination of rsa and aes much like pgp works

1868553
rsa	aes
the client makes a random string wich will be used by the aes algorithm encrypts it with the public key and sends it to the server this is all with rsa

1868568
apache	nginx
now i switched from apache to nginx and therefore php runs now not as an apache service but as fast-cgi and i can t find a way to configure eclipse to work nicely with xdebug

1868568
ubuntu	linux
- os gnu linux - ubuntu 9.10 64 bit

1868603
std	ostream
i have even tried using the std cout but i get another error that says intellisense namespace std has no member cout when i have declared using namespace std included iostream + i even tried to use ostream

1868603
std	ostream
all of the .h files have using namespace std and include iostream and ostream

1868610
integer	fractions
the reason that this works is that access stores its date time in a similar method as delphi as a float where the integer portion is the number of days since a specific day and the fractions part as the fractions portion of that day 0.25 6 am 0.50 noon etc

1868621
firefox	safari
this particular client has an office full of ie7 machines so no firefox or safari etc.

1868639
tunnel	vpn
truly hiding your ip would require that you are leveraging some type of proxy service or tunnel service vpn which is relaying your requests on your behalf and acting as an intermediary

1868639
tunnel	vpn
you could write a vb.net 20005 application which simply connects you to a proxy server or tunnel your internet traffic through a vpn which in turn hides your ip address

1868659
hide	show
in the first view when i scale down to 50 its size then the second view will show and then the first view will hide then the second view will continue scrolling down

1868699
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i get the correct count when using ie firefox however any webkit browser safari google-chrome gives me a count of 0

1868752
ready	each
when you have the module ready you can put the module in gac and reference it in the web.config for each of your applications

1868761
getter	setter
you can either use the objective-c runtime itself and call either class_copypropertylist or protocol_copypropertylist and deal with those or use foundation and call respondstoselector on the object for the kvc getter setter for a given property for a property foo you would call something like

1868801
width	height
only box elements can have its width height attribute set

1868841
hide	show
then catch the zoom event sorry don t have the exact name to hand and if the scale goes down to 0.5 or below hide the first view and show the second and vice-versa going the other way of course

1868849
filtering	grouping
edit modify the view go to the filtering grouping

1868969
apache	nginx	postgresql	mysql
of course i assume that you are doing things sensibly and for example are not migrating a site from an apache mysql server to a nginx postgresql one maybe also adding the need to prefix your db tables in the process

1868994
nunit	mstest
for mstest idk if nunit has something similar it s useful a descriptionattribute for each test method since they show up on the test results panel on visual studio

1869024
children	parent
a person entity should be a parent user and partner entities ought to be children

1869034
qvboxlayout	qframe
i ve got a qframe with a qvboxlayout and i m adding my own custom widgets to the layout

1869036
equals	compareto
the compareto implementation if its elements must not have the requirement to be consistent with the implementation of equals

1869128
google-chrome	firefox
witnessed this technique working in google-chrome and firefox

1869159
equals	compareto
i don t think priorityqueue requires compareto to be consistent with equals

1869188
jquery	simplemodal
i m trying to use jquery simplemodal confirm to show a yes no confirmation when a form is submitted

1869217
google-chrome	firefox
is it possible to take screen shots of open tab in firefox google-chrome via javascript

1869218
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
note that windows batch files don t support floating-point arithmetic so if an expression result is a fractions number only the integer part will be counted

1869242
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring nsdata nsarray or

1869247
clang	llvm
i have successfully built llvm and clang using vs 2008

1869297
r5rs	r6rs
the r5rs and the r6rs standard library for lists

1869320
mouse	keyboard
there are enough sources of entropy in most systems timing of keyboard and mouse events network packets etc that the output will be unpredictable

1869324
mouseover	mouseout
obviously i don t want mouseover mouseout queue buildup

1869331
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
does anyone know how can i use my custom subclass of uinavigationbar if i instantiate uinavigationcontroller programmatically without ib

1869331
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
drag a uinavigationcontroller in ib show me an under navigation bar and using identity inspectory i can change class type and set my own subclass of uinavigationbar but programmatically i can t navigationbar property of navigation controller is readonly.

1869335
children	parent
i have a situation where children are built but not saved and are then being used in the view with references to the parent

1869335
children	parent
i d like to have the parent eager loaded with the unsaved children records

1869345
coalesce	isnull
i think coalesce is sql standard -ish whereas isnull is not

1869350
ready	each
essentially the peripheral acknowledges that it has recieved data or that it is ready to send data for each byte transferred

1869360
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is running fine in firefox google-chrome safari but not surprise

1869448
width	height
if you have 3 accordionitems the content area is whatever the height width of the accordion is minus the width height of each header times the number of items you have

1869450
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave

1869450
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover and mouseout events fire continuously as the cursor is moved inside of an element

1869474
ant	maven
there are certainly other more modern alternatives although many of them are oriented towards java - but you can still use things like ant and maven with other languages with the appropriate plugin or extension

1869514
profiler	perf
then when you see you are not meeting your perf goals and a profiler indicates that adding removing from dictionary are your bottlenecks you can consider replacing with a more targeted class

1869552
try-catch	exception-handling
i get that this is because the exception-handling happens on a separate thread from the main ui thread but if the exception-handling generated is generated in this separate thread in code that i have a try-catch with why is it ignoring it and bailing on the thread entirely instead and then causing the main thread to panic and abort

1869558
implements	extends
is one benefit of using abstract base classes that if external party decides to extends customize the functionality of a particular layer using the base abstract class then lots of methods exposed by that particular layer would already be implements in a base abstract class while with interfaces one would need to implements all the public methods exposed by a particular layer

1869559
wordpress	joomla
that way you can install wordpress in that directory test and deploy without killing your joomla install

1869570
httpwebrequest	ftpwebrequest
if you pass it an http url for example you will actually create an httpwebrequest instance - an ftp url will create an ftpwebrequest

1869574
maven	pom.xml
the maven support or whatever it is officially called lives happily with the pom.xml file no extra jar directory pointers needed at least in intellij

1869588
crypt	hash
i d prefer to use the crypt function and use blowfish encryption but the current implementation of this module uses the hash function which doesn t offer this encryption method

1869623
firefox	safari
also it works fine in ie but not firefox or safari

1869628
config	ini
rather than doing serialization of some custom object or working with ini files i thought it would be easier to just save and replace the config file that the application uses

1869633
skip-lists	tree
based on the usage it s possible that sortedlist could be faster if combine with some kind of skip-lists or even a self-balancing tree or tries

1869655
int	double
in the example given you don t want to clog your int class with how it could become an int from a string or a double so you create your factory whose sole responsibility is to create x object from y parameters

1869763
lisp	scheme
i m considering learning a lisp dialect probably scheme since i am constantly hearing how good of a learning language it is in order to improve my general programming skill

1869815
webclient	httpwebrequest
have you looked at a standard tool like httrack or if you want to actually want the html if you re programming for fun look at webclient or httpwebrequest if you want to learn more

1869816
implements	extends
however implements a new or extends an existing viewresolver is a pretty simple solution and would be the way i d go with

1869842
imperative	declarative
i think the best you can gain from studying a functional language is starting to think in a more declarative less imperative way

1869856
hide	show
i m not sure i understand your question but if you are trying to selectively show or hide one of the controls in your itemtemplate depending on the data use the onitemdatabound event use findcontrol to get the controls and set the visible property on each appropriately

1869880
put	get
instead of using why don t you get the wsdl as a file and put it in src wsdl or another location in which case you ll have to specify it using the element

1869938
x86	64bit
if it s in c program files x86 xxx as seen on 64bit windows this is a known issue

1869947
salt	md5
as overslacked said i think the problem has to do with salt but i couldn t find any sha or md5 documentation that the algorithm is using in each platform or any parameter to customize this

1869981
getter	setter
you could do this with this method as both getter and setter methods are defined for each attribute

1869987
google-chrome	firefox
the download happens in a new window and what i m seeing in ie7 8 but not google-chrome or firefox is the tab opens and closes but no file dialogue is shown

1869991
put	get
you would need to use git ls-files --stage or to get sha-1 identifiers of blobs file versions you want to put in index or if you want to generate version of a file from scratch from working area version

1870004
put	get
the first time i load a request it does automatically get put in the cache has it

1870025
onreadystatechange	onload
to wait till the script is loaded you should use onload onreadystatechange event

1870028
accessor	properties
as the webbrowser control does not expose a get accessor for the documenttext properties you cannot use it to obtain the html that was loaded into this control

1870029
avr	microcontroller
i have no idea if there are any useful wifi boards that can be connected to an avr based microcontroller system or any small microcontroller any hints would be highly welcome

1870047
rsa	aes
i don t mind if its symmetric e.g aes or asymmetric e.g rsa - but it must be a recognized algorithm for which i can get a fips-140 approved library

1870056
public	protected
we also need to change the search.aspx.designer.vb so that the dropdownlists and textbox are public properties not protected

1870065
slideup	slidedown
find a div slideup all of it s child divs then after all of them are up show one of those child divs via slidedown

1870065
slideup	slidedown
what i think should happen is that each time i click one of my .toggletrigger elements it finds the children of my togglepaneswrapper and then in order does a slideup for each and then upon the last child being slid up will slidedown one of my elements

1870076
uilabel	uibutton
instead use a uilabel subclass where you override the touchesbegan ended withevent set of methods to show the uidatepicker or a uibutton where your action is a method which slides up the uidatepicker

1870100
public	protected
with structure the inheritance is public by default with class it s private by default if you don t specify public private protected

1870116
getter	setter
the .net setter and getter visibility modifier are irrelevant when dealing with wcf messages really

1870158
128bit	64bit
i have a 128bit number stored as 2 64bit numbers hi and lo

1870199
getter	setter
define a property named c with a setter getter

1870202
nant	cruisecontrol
configure a build server something like cruisecontrol is excellent for this and roll your own custom nant scripts if needed or use exec tasks to take care of the deployment

1870204
ring	counterclockwise
adding is counting clockwise around the ring and subtracting is counting counterclockwise

1870204
subtract	add
you can add or subtract any number and it will work

1870306
activescaffold	hobo
if you want something a bit more full featured check out activescaffold or hobo

1870345
subtract	add
using add subtract instead of xor should still produce random output if one of the inputs are random

1870374
put	get
if you can get the user to put the file on a fixed position you can access the file c shared file.jpg using a path like tsclient c shared file.jpg

1870377
width	height
as you already noted it depends on your definition of the problem size is it the total number of elements or the width height of the matrix

move	drag
this means if you drag your application around the screen the popup stays put it doesn t move with your window

1875590
folder	directory
it is giving me an error since it is looking only in the views directory and not in the areas folder

1875605
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
actually only webkit safari google-chrome iphone android has a pretty good support of it and firefox 3.6 supports most of it too

1875642
inherited	properties
however when you view the soap sample for the web method that exposes orderrequest only the vendorid properties is visible and not the inherited authenticationtoken properties

1875651
pop-up	dialog
the disable dynamic dialog will never pop-up and dynamic updates will still occur so you can monitor progress of the computation

1875697
addition	multiplication
adding up the digits of a number doesn t mesh well with addition and multiplication with carries

1875702
inherited	properties
the text properties for instance is on control but it doesn t make sense on every class that inherited from control

1875707
mouse	keyboard
appropriate and useful alt text for images designing with colors that provide adequate contrast accommodating colorblindness use of table descriptions make the the site navigable by keyboard no mouse correct descriptions on form fields etc.

1875707
client-side	server-side
f client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape

1875737
public	protected
as you can see you normally do not apply the access control specifiers public protected or private to each member but you group them in sections

1875801
affinity	processors
you can sometimes achieve this with utilizing processors affinity on linux systems

1875809
hide	show
place all form controls in one form and use javascript to show hide active tab

1875821
teamcity	nant
to clarify we re using teamcity v.4.5.5 build 9103 svn and nant as our build runner

1875836
openmpi	mpich
we used mpich because at the time it worked best on windows and we needed that flexibility i haven t used mpich2 or openmpi

1875851
folder	directory
inside of this phpstuff directory is a folder i18n

1875896
maven	pom.xml
i ve been able to get it working with maven using the following pom.xml

1875942
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
override viewdidappear not viewwillappear

1875952
inline-functions	inlining
i think i d let it handle most of the inlining then profile your code and then inline-functions which are bottlenecks

1876009
inline	inlining
leave inline out until you measure the code performance and determine that you could gain some performance by inlining a specific function that the compiler chose to treat as normal

1876041
debian	linux
on debian linux it is located on etc mysql my.cnf

1876098
ubuntu	debian
the default locate program on debian ubuntu these days is mlocate

1876122
stdout	stderr
the main problem with this is that the stdout stderr capturing is per-run sudo invocation and not per-task

1876156
google-chrome	safari
i searched around and allegedly body nth-of-type 1 is used in css to target only safari and google-chrome

1876197
getter	setter
getter and setter is far different

1876197
getter	setter
with the somewhat recent ability to have empty getter and setter what is the benefit of using them instead of just declaring a public member variable

1876205
inherited	properties
edit besides the fact of inherited the points pointed out in the other answers like visibility are also a huge benefit of properties over fields

1876209
int	chars
if it is really only a chars and 6 int for each node you wouldn t need to store two lists

1876214
getter	setter
one thing you can do with properties that you can t do with fields is limit visibility for either setter or getter

1876269
google-chrome	safari
there is no css for only google-chrome afaik but google-chrome and safari

1876292
formpanel	gridpanel
upon activation of a tab i want to call a method which then instanstiates a new formpanel gridpanel and put this content into the tab

1876303
inherited	properties
these don t inherited from control so they don t have their own controlcollection properties

1876325
awt	swing	swt	swing
while i have never used awt or swing i have read that swt is the easiest of the three to learn

1876394
typedef	typename
typedef have a similar syntax to variable declarations except in place of a variable name you get a typename

1876396
getter	setter
what about a getter setter that converts to from an array and 12 private fields

1876471
google-chrome	firefox
in either firefox google-chrome extension is there a way to stop the loading of before the browser actually starts loading them from a page

1876479
google-chrome	safari
any of the -webkit selectors should work for just google-chrome and safari

1876494
children	parent
if each test can have one parent and many children this seems like an ideal use for acts_as_tree or acts_as_nested_set

1876500
subtraction	addition
some problems require oodles of math and some require only addition and subtraction

1876521
pop-up	dialog
this needs to be the exact location within your project i would use the find file dialog that you can pop-up when editing a src attribute in visual studio so that it automatically links to the file

1876526
post	put
have your request put it s information on the queue and return the thread then takes the item off the queue and post it to the db

1876528
dictionary	map
you could use a std vector or a map or a dictionary or some other kind of data structure for the entity table of course but our requirements have typically been for constant memory cache coherency and absolute maximal performance since handle_t get gets called thousands of times per frame

1876551
inline	inlining
also most compilers are very bad at inlining functions from different compilation units -- if you define foo in file a.c but call it in b.c odds are pretty slim that it will intelligently inline b.c s calls to foo

1876568
accessor	properties
previously i had the properties implemented with objective-c 1.0 style explicit accessor

1876585
melt	reshape
while you re not using the reshape package hadley made this point in his discussion of the melt function which is performing the same task see this paper for instance

1876660
firefox	safari
unlike asp.net 1.1 the browsercaps in asp.net 2.0 do recognise firefox safari etc so the general output shouldn t be that different to what you see in ie

1876678
versioning	upgrade
now i ve upgrade itext to latest versioning 5.0.0 and i am unable to locate rtfwriter2 or old rtfwriter or htmlwriter

1876708

so i have a function in an app that needs to let the user calculate a trig function sin cos tan using radians or degrees and also to expect a returned value from inverse trig functions asin acos atan as either radians or degrees

1876730
disk	ram
i ve never seen this done but if you could somehow load the entire thing into memory ram disk

1876753
rss	feed
i m aggregating rss feed using feedtools

1876753
rss	feed
here s the rss cached feed object in my database

1876753
rss	feed
the purpose of the rss feed list of items is to tell the user which articles in their rss feed haven t been uploaded into the db yet so i only want another title to show in the view

1876759
awk	ksh
as already mentioned this problem is probably best solved using bc awk ksh or another scripting language

1876763
put	get
some are even incapable of performing operations sometimes even load operations on unsuitably-aligned data - in order to work on such data it has to be loaded into two registers and then a series of bit shifts and masks need to be performed to get a usable value and then it needs to be put back

1876795
width	height
it defines the left top width and height of your label

1876795
width	height
left and top are the relative location to the parent control and width and height are the sizes in pixels

1876795
width	height
public rectangle int x int y int width int height

1876797
width	height
bounds specifies the bounds of the control its top left width and height

1876823
int	chars	int	double
so that means chars wchar_t explicit-sized int int32 float and double and c-style arrays of them

1876831
super	extends
this doesn t directly answer your question but could you extends screen api here instead of manager and then call super mdelegate in your constructor

1876876
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you re really concerned about performance and you manage your own webserver you could build the rewrite rules and whatever else you have in your .htaccess into the httpd.conf file and disable overrides disabling your .htaccess files

1876899
multiplying	add
what i m doing is i m using gets to test whether the user wants to multiplying their input or add it i ve tested both functions

1877007
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 3.5.5 google-chrome 3.0.195.33 ie8

1877195
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop or a foreach loops to do the actual iteration

1877261
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you want the sessions to stay alive for longer set that setting in php.ini httpd.conf or .htaccess

1877281
stdout	stderr
only replacing find with findvalue gives just the value on stdout but also error messages on stderr

1877318
min	max
you don t need to worry about the details basically it just returns the max and min of a given vector in a value form

1877328
redmine	trac
you might be interested in tools like viewsvn or the more sophisticated trac or redmine

1877348
put	get
the other alternative i considered was using pagemethods to render the control and send the html back to the page to let the javascript put it in the appropriate place then deal with it but it won t let me render the control - i get an invalidoperationexception of page cannot be null

1877353
yaws	inets
the nitrogen project web page declares equal support for yaws mochiweb and inets but with which of these web servers is it going to perform the best

1877374
children	parent
as far as i remember it won t work on children s if if you apply to parent so it has to be on this very element that gets aliased

1877397
xna	spritebatch
you can use your own custom pixel shader and there is a sample on the xna creator s club education site that shows you how to use custom pixel shader effects with the spritebatch

1877413
ubuntu	linux
i have a perl script on a linux ubuntu 8.10 machine and i need to write data to a sql server database

1877420
width	height
a simple algorithm to test for color walk the image pixel by pixel in a nested for-loop width and height and test to see if the pixel s rgb values are equal

1877479
puts	gets
note that an array of length 11 gets you only 10 a s since array.join puts the argument between the array elements.

1877479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
simon also points out that according to this jsperf it appears that it s faster in safari and google-chrome but not firefox to repeat a character multiple times by simply appending using a for-loop although a bit less concise

1877506
uidatepicker	uipickerview
it seems uidatepicker is not customizable via a delegate like uipickerview

1877513
textarea	textbox
if you are talking about the onchange event on an html text or textarea element it s after the value in a textbox has changed and the focus changes away from that element

1877529
lisp	prolog
if you want to learn from the basics and just implement theoretical ai stuff go with a higher level language-- as in functional programming and proven in ai like lisp or prolog

1877547
lisp	prolog
when i studied ai mostly we worked with lisp and prolog but i ve been most productive in ai with java c# and f# has a lot to offer

1877569
nfa	dfa
the normalized dfa for the nfa is using different collections of the states of nfa as dfa s states for example state0 - 1 - state1 state2 to remove the non-deterministic part there is no way to avoid the state explosion as dfa has to do that to represent the language

1877570
versioning	upgrade
it will also serve as a marker so you can find the code you need to check if ever you upgrade to the next versioning of the api

1877589
lisp	scheme
there are two big camps common lisp and scheme

1877589
haskell	ocaml
i have better reasons to recommend lisp over f# and even ocaml and haskell

1877589
lisp	prolog
the bulk of ai literature is based on programs written in lisp or prolog

1877589
haskell	ocaml
in the tiobe index of programming language as seen and used in industry lisp takes 15th place while haskell takes 43rd and f# and ocaml place below 50th

1877609
junit	testng
what i do with my testng sorry junit doesn t support this test cases is i can assign a group to the test i want to run

1877666
valgrind	callgrind
for performance you can try callgrind a valgrind tool

1877775
int	double
records are not almost like classes in the same way that int are not almost like double

1877823
integer	unsigned
each item will be a simple structure containing one 32-bit unsigned integer the item s unique id which will be used as the tree value and two pointers

1877823
integer	unsigned
once an item is removed its unique id that 32-bit unsigned integer will be recycled and reused for a new item

1877824
put	get
get a backup of the live database and put it on our dev environment

1877869
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup have to go in pairs or else the key won t be registered but if you hold down control while sending for example keydown p it will activate ie s print function

1877869
keydown	keyup
for all the letters and digits you can send 0 for keydown and the correct letter for keyup

1877949
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
i can t create a system.windows.controls.selecteditemcollection because of its protection level and param won t cast to ilist icollection or ienumerable

1877986
executable	upx
if the actual executable content of the binaries is changing as is done with tools like upx you re going to be out of luck unless you enjoy debugging complex applications in assembly language

1878053
google-chrome	firefox
the search function provided with modern browsers firefox and google-chrome anyway have two big problems they only search visible items on the page and they can t search non-consecutive words

1878058

inorder pre-order and postorder

1878059
post	get
i m not sure where to place the code in my dal from this post to get this working

now that i ve gotten relatively familiar with web2py i d like to give django a go

1878299
for-loop	loops
my problem is that i am using a for-loop and when loops runs it seems that loops runs to completion so if there are 10 pieces of data to process all ten runs simultaneously.

1878330
profiling	debugging
often standard reports need to be changed sp s fixed etc but if you don t know what s being run it s a needle in a haystack - use sql profiling to track a user capture the sql analyse debugging - fix move on

1878412
int	double
if you were to invent a new language do you think primitive datatypes should be capitalized like int float double string to be consistent with standard class naming conventions

1878527
tcplistener	tcpclient
i d tcplistener tcpclient for simple applications

1878540
freebsd	linux
i m not sure if either of these is a good example but you could always look at the source code for the linux and freebsd ip stacks

1878556
hide	show
i know how to hide and show them it is just hide and show

1878572
public	protected
for an out of browser application the best solution i have found is to derive a very simple custom class from hyperlinkbutton and implement a public method that in turn invokes the protected onclick method as shown below

1878591
post	get
iâ m trying to get a handle on the exact process that occurs when a user post data back to the server from an asp.net webform

1878685
submit	submission
where i am running into trouble is when i try to submit a comment on the submission

1878695
inline	inlining
in general i would say not only is it possible that the compiler reordered things it is probable - ie for the code you have there is probably a reordering once inline and inlining is likely that is better than the order given by the c++ code

1878732
temporary	tablespace
how to shrink temporary tablespace in oracle

1878732
temporary	tablespace
yes i ran a query to see how big my temporary tablespace is

1878732
temporary	tablespace
the first question you have to ask is why the temporary tablespace is so large

1878732
temporary	tablespace
if data and the temporary tablespace is 13gib - just shrink it and move on

1878732
temporary	tablespace
of oracle you are running and how the temporary tablespace was set up

1878732
temporary	tablespace
oracle will only shrink the file if the temporary tablespace

1878732
temporary	tablespace
if the temporary tablespace is the default temporary

1878732
temporary	tablespace
if the temporary tablespace you want to shrink is your default

1878732
temporary	tablespace
temporary tablespace you will have to first create a new temporary

1878732
temporary	tablespace
tablespace set it as the default temporary tablespace then drop

1878732
temporary	tablespace
your old default temporary tablespace and recreate it

1878737
innodb	myisam
you need to enable it in order to be able to convert your tables from myisam to innodb

1878750
put	get
btw i have got working class to put and get twitts on twitter and return its as a nsstring and it works

1878768
lan	localhost
you re probably listening on your lan wlan card instead of localhost

the div in which the file was to be embedded did not have height and width specified earlier when the height and width were added it s works on firefox as well

1878802
portrait	landscape
i need to resize the controls because i want allow user to switch from portrait mode to landscape

1878808

1878820
udp	tcp
a port tcp udp etc

1878861
datamapper	activerecord
for example you can use a table data gateway row data gateway activerecord or datamapper

1878912
mouse	trackpad
how to detect left or right click on statusbar icon and than make some action depending on which mouse button trackpad was clicked

1878925
folder	directory
you can share local folder with the vm which reduces the pain of switching back and forth once the vm has python setup you can just hop in and and run the code direct from the directory on the mac you developed in

1878927
calloc	malloc
in fact as mentioned below you don t need to set the memory allocated to all-zeros so you can replace calloc by malloc

1878927
calloc	malloc
be sure to whether you call calloc or malloc .

1878927
calloc	malloc
since you overwrite the memory allocated immediately and don t need it to be zero you can replace calloc call by a suitable call to malloc

1878935
google-chrome	firefox
while the jquery tools code seems to work well in google-chrome and firefox it is not working in ie 6 or 7 .

1878942
onclick	onfocus
onclick onfocus i d like to change the input type to password and value removed like so

1878950
16-bit	64bit
16-bit of error correction for 64bit of data is a lot different from 16-bit of error correction of a kilobyte of data

1878950
decoder	encoder
especially as you use a larger encoder to reduce the overhead the size of the decoder explodes

1878997
google-chrome	firefox
it renders the same way on firefox google-chrome and ie 8

1878998
websphere	ibm
on a soa project we start to employ ibm websphere message broker to orchestrate .net-based web services

1879007

learn to use vim or emacs just for common knowledge

1879008
hide	show
when the text field receives focus it hide itself show the password field and sets the focus to the password field

1879068
ant	maven
you can add ant tasks to your maven

1879118
postgresql	mysql
you can use them with postgresql or mysql but you loose joins

1879137
csc	vbc
this is a cute hack but with the csc and vbc both supporting the target module and addmodule options you could actually do this without ilmerge just by using a shell script or make file

1879167
width	height
i d also like to add that it seems adding a width and height attribute solves this problem

1879180
webclient	httpwebrequest
i ve seen webclient and httpwebrequest and all that

1879191
realloc	malloc
malloc or realloc function or if

1879191
free	realloc
call to free or realloc the behavior

1879220

i ve found that what works best for us is to create the zip ear war jar contents in exploded form in the file system and then as the final step zip ear war jar it up to a file

1879246
awt	swing
that is an old awt trick and should not be used with swing

1879263
vcard	mime
i have write permission to the directory i ve already added the mime type for vcard and restarted the iis server however it still refuses to take it

1879281
csc	vbc
this is a cute hack but with the csc and vbc both supporting the target module and addmodule options you could actually do this without ilmerge just by using a shell script or make file

1879291
move	drag
also this statement evaluates to true which is why you can drag anywhere and move the circle

1879291
width	height
this is because of your drawing filloval takes an upper-left corner of the oval and a width and height of the bounding rectangle

1879340
listview	gridview
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

1879343
switching	screens
this is good for when you want to switching to another task temporarily but if this is the case then you might want to look into using the gnu screens utility instead

1879370
width	height
so if you need to save the position x y and size width height of a list of elements then you need to loop through all those items and fetch the properties store them in an object and then store the object in a database maybe as json

1879386
width	height
in the case of a pc display it should simply output normally with a the width x-axis being 1.6 times the height

1879386
portrait	landscape
but for iphones i would like it if rather than having it overflow in portrait orientation the page defaulted to landscape orientation encouraging or forcing the user to turn their phone to see the chart as pc users would

1879457
free	malloc
only when allocating memory dynamically eg with new or malloc in the case of c code do you need to explicitly delete or free it

1879506
kde	gnome
in stead of going for kde and gnome desktops i want to design my small desktop environment for the device

1879507
next	except
when building this structure you have also problem that you do not know which peace you will you get except for next peace so there is little probability involved

1879533
super	self
super is similar to self they both represent the receiver of the message

1879533
super	implements
super starts the lookup of the following message in the superclass where the implements method is defined in

1879533
super	self
self and super are not messages but implicit variables therefor you cannot find them in the message finder

1879540
gridview	datalist
reperter datalist gridview

1879550
free	malloc
short accessing free pointers can cause data corruption if malloc allocates memory in the same spot unless the free pointer is set to null

1879590
folder	directory
if you install the plugin in the vendor folder all files in both tasks and lib tasks directory are automatically loaded into your rails scope by the following two lines

1879628

touchesbegan	touchesended
i read from the documentation that on the touchesended event i can get the alltouches array which is a list of the user touches collected from touchesbegan

1879771
touchesbegan	touchesended
i will also get the time interval between touchesbegan and touchesended from which i will get the speed of the swipe

1879817
temporary	tablespace
you obviously need very large temporary tablespace but you re not consuming more space overall unless you ve been making heavy use of table compression unavailable in gtt s at least up to 10gr2

1879817
temporary	tablespace
using a tablespace group rather than a single temporary tablespace can alleviate problems caused where one tablespace is inadequate to hold the results of a sort particularly on a table that has many partitions

1879817
temporary	tablespace
a tablespace group enables parallel execution servers in a single parallel operation to use multiple temporary tablespace

1879859
post	get
there is an example with soap 1.1 which display the request and response an example with soap 1.2 request and response an http get request and response sample and an http post request and response sample

xmlrpc using the xmlrpclib and simplexmlrpcserver modules in the standard library

1879971
zerorpc	msgpack
zerorpc python or node.js msgpack + zeromq

1879986
put	get
yes it requires a bit of hacking to get running on some random hardware but it has had a lot of effort put into the ui and provides a basic and not so basic set of pre-built applications for your device

1880001
simplexmlrpcserver	xmlrpclib
python 2 xmlrpclib and simplexmlrpcserver

1880020
hide	show
you could hide the whole table do the changes then show the table again

1880057
mouseup	mousedown
edit rereading that page it d been a while it looks like mousedown and mouseup are even more reliable than contextmenu although all major browsers trigger contextmenu

1880117
filtering	grouping
there s no way for any grouping filtering only one by one as you say

1880121
post	get
some of the earlier events in the asp.net lifecycle will fire before the file upload completes but honestly i don t know exactly how far into the request you get before it waits for the rest of the post data

1880127
free	malloc
there s your only place in your whole codebase where malloc and free are called

1880144
children	parent
jquery itself doesn t do anything with the html it just holds the functionality for checking children categories when a parent is checked

1880169
hash	md5
so my question is how to get part of the number of an md5 hash

1880169
hash	md5
also is it a bad idea to use only part of the md5 hash

1880179
post	get
you can create a get or a post connection with httpwebrequest

1880186
integer	unsigned
in c# you can use unsigned integer types and then the and do what you expect

1880186
int	chars
since java doesn t support unsigned int apart from chars this additional operator became necessary

1880200
inherited	subclassing
workarounds would be to execute the code on every pageload or inherited the checkboxlist in a subclassing that overrides the render method to always produce the output you want

1880216
getter	setter
which is the best implementation of this comunication if the model is a simple javabean with setter and getter methods

1880233
hash	md5
since you are only interested in using a decimal chunk of the md5 hash why don t you use any other short numeric hash like crc32 or adler

1880243
children	parent
parent and children properties are correctly defined as navigational properties

1880243
children	parent
i actually get my items in a tree structure because ef works its magic behind the curtain and populates my parent and children on these items

1880251
post	get
you can use or if it could come in by either get or post but why not do this

1880263

create a md5 hash of the script like this

1880263
hash	md5
hash md5 script raw_output true

gif	png
for menus and line drawings - in general any mages with large homogeneous areas many adjacent pixels with the same color - gif or png note musicinmybrain s comment below is usual the best choice as it compresses stronger and the results look better especially because of sharper edges

1880342
gif	png
i would recommend gif over png because there are some issues with color profiles in webbrowsers and pngs

1880393
switching	screens
then switching back on the eclipse screens and wait for the breakpoint to be activated

1880398
cvs	svn
i have had a look at svn and cvs but i m having trouble finding either an add-in or easy to use client for use with delphi 7 on winxp

1880405
pull	push
they are often targeted at guys who just want to use git and hack locally without using the full power of git like pull fetch merge and the like between multiple developers who would all have cloned the svn repository with git-svn then still expect to be able to push their changes any time to the official svn repository and get back to working in git and sharing their stuff etc

1880431
cvs	svn
if you want an easy to use client for cvs and svn on windows take a look at tortoise its really nice and easy with right-click functions

1880434
cvs	svn
i would definitely advise choosing svn over cvs

1880434
cvs	svn
svn could have been called cvs 2 - it s basically cvs but with a whole lot of pain points removed

1880434
cvs	svn
for example you can rename files in svn but you have to delete them and re-add them in cvs

1880435
bazaar	git
if you are looking for a distributed version control system there is git and many others like mercurial bazaar et cetera

the first step is to establish whether the problem is client-side or server-side

1880547
vsts	tfs
once your team foundation server tfs is installed visual studio team system vsts is installed on your development workstation

1880547
vsts	tfs
i forget how to select your tfs server instance for vsts to work with but i don t recall having trouble with it when i did it a few months ago

1880547
vsts	tfs
once you ve configured all that you interact with your tfs work items and source code from the team explorer and source control explorer panes in vsts it should begin to feel rather like using vs without integrated source control from there forward

1880551
width	height
is it good practice to use width height on a div others i can t float them correctly

1880551
width	height
that depends on whether you want the width height to depend dynamically on the content or if you want it fixed

1880570
spaces	delimiter
i have a sentence words delimiter by spaces

1880579
put	get
you could have put the function right in the master page but then you wouldnâ t get intelli-sense on it for the rest of your code

1880606
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
so as long as you implement viewdidload viewdidunload and didreceivememorywarning correctly i wouldn t worry too much about memory consumption of an array of view controllers

1880829
put	get
just put this rule before your others and any request with a query does not get beyond this rule

1880848
put	get
i think it s best to put anything under version control that helps developers to get started quickly ignoring anything that may be auto-generated by an ide or build tools maven s eclipse plugin generates .project and .classpath - no need to check these in

1880867
vb.net	vb6
actually i have vb6 dlls where business logic is reside and i am calling that dll function in my vb.net application all dlls are dependent on other dlls.i am getting the error from one of the dlls

notepad++	textpad
if so you may want to open it in notepad++ or textpad or editplus

1881052
implements	extends
it might be a great effort but if a well-designed solution is what you re after i m thinking your best bet is probably to create a class that extends the service handler that implements your own custom serializer where you check for maxjsonlength

1881066
free	malloc
any memory allocated by malloc must be de-allocated by a matching free

1881084

otherwise using your original approach you d pretty much have to read character-by-character adding each chars to a buffer and then evaluating your int when you encounter a space or newline or some other separator

1881172
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i have noticed that matlab does some matrix function really fast for example adding 5 to all elements of an n n arrays happens almost instantly even if the matrix is large because you don t have to loops through every element doing the same in java the for-loop takes forever if the matrix is large

1881180
hide	show
i have simple scenario in which i hide and show a signle menuitem in a contextmenu as show below

1881223
put	get
generally i live by the rule that if you put anything on a public server thats not behind some kind of authentication the only thing you can do is make it more of a hassle to get at what you want to protect - there is always a way around it if the user is willing to go that extra mile

1881285
margin	height
if you can set a fixed height to the div you should be able to align it vertically with margin auto 0

1881286
x86	64bit

checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i tried this on my localhost but i have ended breaking up current functionality or the updated code just does not work for the checkbox and dropdownlistfor

1881826
hide	show
in your codebehind you will want to show the panel that contains the proper detailsview for your query and hide the rest of the panels

1881839
ant	maven
as of today it also has a 1.0 release for an eclipse plugin and textmate though it also easily works with ant or maven

1881840
setinterval	settimeout
if you aren t responsible for the server-side app and thus can t build the keep-alive functionality into it yourself your best bet would be to either physically go to the web-page look through all the javascript to try to find possible keep-alive code look for settimeout setinterval or related methods in any js frameworks they may be using

1881911
versioning	upgrade
you will want each application to be able to choose which versioning of the dll they are going to use for easier upgrade paths

1881930
aggregate-functions	sum
you want to discriminate on an aggregate-functions - sum

1881934
opera	firefox

1882130
put	get
this requires a security permission put applets and webstart jnlp applications get that permission anyway

1882131

button	checkbox
in your trac.ini then on the timeline page click the ticket updates checkbox and the update button

1882828
treemap	linkedhashmap
but if you control map implementation returned by the getmap then you can use linkedhashmap or treemap and get the same order of keys values all the time you iterate through them

1882852
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you are looking at a specific class that implements map hashmap linkedhashmap treemap etc then you could see how it implements the keyset function to determine what the behaviour would be by checking out the source you d have to really take a close look at the algorithm to see if the property you are looking for is preserved that is consistent iteration order when the map has not had any insertions removals between iterations

1882900
decoder	encoder
out of the box biztalk only supports s mime encryption using the smime encoder decoder component

sorting	filtering
and it actually is a viable option for paging sorting and filtering if and only if

1883341
sorting	filtering
for one thing database engines are highly optimized for doing exactly the kind of work that sorting and filtering entail

1883341
sorting	filtering
but even barring thatâ even assuming you could write code that could match the kind of sorting filtering and paging performance of a mature database engineâ itâ s still preferable to do this work in the database for the simple reason that itâ s more efficient to limit the amount of data that is transferred from the database to the application server

1883384
hash	md5
it is very important to put the timestamp into the dummy file because scons uses md5 hash

1883385
floating-point	integer
i m writing a set of numeric type conversion functions for a database engine and i m concerned about the behavior of converting large integral floating-point values to integer types with greater precision

1883385
int	double
so my questions are are there any well-known existing systems that perform decimal significant digit rounding in float - int or double - long long conversions and are there any well-known efficient algorithms for doing so

1883385
decimal	ieee
note i m aware that some systems have decimal floating-point types such as those defined by ieee 754-2008

implements	extends
so after pouring over article after article online that demonstrate various solutions but as i said only ever reflect a service with one method operation i am looking for some guidance for an approach that will be easy to implements maintain and extends when dealing with real-world services that contain multiple methods and multiple dependencies

1883957
many-to-many	one-to-many
core data abstracts away a lot of the messy things you d otherwise have to deal with yourself such as lists of objects one-to-many or many-to-many relationships or constraints on object attributes into a single nice clean object-oriented interface

jquery	simplemodal
there s a jquery library called simplemodal

1884150
mouse	keyboard
as of 1.5.1 everything i ve touched in libtcod works great except for the mouse input stuff and one of the keyboard input modes which i think they recently ditched but everything you need to make a roguelike is in there and that includes several line-of-sight pathfinding and even dungeon generation algorithms

mp4	h.264
a container for video encoded with h.264 - such as an mkv or mp4 - can absolutely contain audio

1884169
cpu	irq	cpu	affinity	affinity	irq
i can instantly double my performance by setting the process and irq cpu affinity to the same physical cpu but that s not a good long-term solution-- i d rather be able to get good performance no matter where the i os originate

1884169
cpu	irq
and i only have one irq so i can only steer it to one cpu at a time -- no good if many threads are running on many cpus

1884180

google-chrome	firefox
the problem happens in all browsers ie7 ie8 google-chrome firefox etc

1884273
cpu	processors
if you finish your i o on a particular cpu then that processors is immediately free to start working on a new thread - if you finish your i o on the same processors as the thread the requested it then the next thread is likely to be the one you finished i o for

1884273
cpu	processors
on the other hand if you finish on a different processors the thread that requested the i o won t get to run immediately - it has to wait until whatever s currently executing finishes its quantum or otherwise relinquishes the cpu

min	max
then once all the data is in the database i can do whatever validations i need to data types data lengths min max values acceptable characters... and have the valid values passed into a column with the appropriate definition constraints

1884382
put	get
if you have a varchar2 1000 then at some point you will get data put in there that is longer than you expect eg you may get a string of 10 characters but which has 14 bytes because some characters are multi-byte character set values.

1884402
post	get
you can call an action via a url and that action could be designed to respond to get requests post requests or both

1884492

rss	feed
i have an application that reads an rss feed parses the xml and adds it to my database using core data this is so the user can see the feed even if no internet connection is available this all works fine

1884598
hash	salt
but if someone hacks my database he can see the hash password and the salt

1884599
firefox	safari
this happens to me on both my macs on safari and firefox so i m not hopeful of a solution

1884611
put	get
but when i put a php page in the htdocs folder and try to access it using 127.0.0.1 mypage.php i get the object not found error

1884616
hash	salt
if you don t use a salt then an attacker can precompute a password - hash database offline even before they ve broken into your server

1884628
hash	salt
another intention behind the use of a salt is to make sure two users with the same password won t end up having the same hash in the users table assuming their salt are not the same

1884628
hash	salt
however the combination of a salt and a password may lead to the same string or hash in the end and the hash will be exactly the same so make sure to use a combination of salt and password where two different combination won t lead to the same hash

1884629
hash	salt
if an attacker creates a giant table of hash values for plaintext passwords using a salt prevents him from using the same table to crack more than one password

1884641
post	get
please post your table design and the error that you get when the inserts fail

1884648

1884656
proftpd	vsftpd
vsftpd proftpd are two oss ftp servers worth mentioning

1884693
prepare	pdostatement
two subsequent calls to pdo prepare even with the same sql query should return two different pdostatement or handles to avoid collisions especially between previous and current bindings you may apply to it

1884693
prepare	pdostatement
the cost of creating a pdostatement with prepare is low anyway

1884827
folder	directory
i created a fixtures folder in the app directory and put data1.json in there

1884838
put	get
in the click handler for the button i do something iteratively that generates strings which i want to put in the listbox as i get them

1884863
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
if you require sorting grouping filtering then consider using a collectionview

1884868
min	max
you have included several functions min max avg which you don t use and the elements to display those values are also missing

1884868
mouse	keyboard
the recalculation is mainly bound to the keyup event which clearly won t fire on checkbox and select unless the user uses the keyboard instead of the mouse to select the values

1884878
firefox	safari
overflow-x and overflow-y are supported by ie5+ win firefox 1.5+ mozilla 1.8+ and safari 3+

1884905
mouse	keyboard
the reason is for fast pace games which aren t graphically intensive to stop the screen lag induced by large changes in framerate however vsync isn t suitable as oddly it increases latency between keyboard mouse both are polling at high rates so not a hardware issue

1884929
put	get
the only way i ve found to get around it for my case was to put a time check in my wrapper and to check how long it s been since the last time i reconnected before executing the query

1884930
mouse	keyboard
the way an fps game operates is it paints the screen does keyboard mouse etc handling and game logic then it paints the screen again

1884956
uilabel	uibutton
i have a uitableviewcell with a custom uibutton and uilabel in the contentview

1884956
button	checkbox
the button is a checkbox and toggles between a checked and unchecked state with different images for each state

1884973
submit	submission
alternatively is there any reason not to submit the data yourself directly to the location the target form would be submission it to

1885010
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used yslow add in for firefox and found it useful does the new new google addin for google-chrome give me anything extra

1885145
temp	tmp
on the server side the session data with matched sessionid is saved in a temp file on linux it is defaulted to tmp

1885146
width	height
if width height of source and target are known use following function to determine scale of the image

1885184
crossover	mutation
you can do mutation the same way you do crossover except you fill it with random data that is legal rather than swapping with another specimen.

1885225
post	get
you need to set this hidden fields so when the user post the form the values get bind from this hidden fields as the td s are not intent to be posted within a form

1885296
width	height
when the script validates max file size and possibly extracts the width height it inserts a row into the database

1885370
harfbuzz	freetype
both pango and qt use a forked version of an abandoned freetype layout engine but this is being reconciled into the harfbuzz project

1885392
width	height
i m making a jquery plugin for full browser flash which has a minimum size limit say 800x600 so if the browser is over 800x600 the containing div is set to 100 width height it s it s below that size it s set to 800x600

1885451
gif	png
note perhaps a better way to do this would be to use a png image that has transparent background rather than my gif image

1885499
rss	feed
rss feed of #sharepoint tweets that also have links to usually good stuff

1885548
jquery	simplemodal
i am using tinymce and simplemodal jquery plugin

1885552
pull	push
just need a way to pull push the data so that the user loses nothing that he she sees on screen

1885560
hash	salt
if the attacker knows that you use a single salt for all member accounts then he can create a single set of pre-calculated hash values from dictionary words using your salt

1885560
hash	md5
md5 is not a very strong hash function

1885560
hash	salt
if you want to use sha-256 you have to fetch the user s salt and then use hash in php code

1885630
hash	md5
i am trying to store md5 hash

1885637
hash	md5
since your md5 hash will always be the same size you should probably use a char

1885654
hash	md5
if that is the question then as long as you are using a proven hash algorithm such as md5 there is very low risk of a user manipulating the bits of their hash to get another user s id

1885682
rss	feed
what i have in mind is a user could send a message to checking-in example.org and this would trigger a script which would then do whatever needed to be done either irrelevant to the message an automated message that gets sent whenever some other even occurs like a server having issues or related to the message like it could store the subject in a database that other users could view as an rss feed

1885763
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
in order to let the user control to adapt itself when the main window is resized i want to bind the user control s width and height to the grid s actualwidth and actualheight

1885767
apache	lighttpd
i want to migrate some sites running on apache to lighttpd

1885786
actualheight	actualwidth
the problem with binding is that the actualheight and actualwidth might increase if something in the panel makes it increase

1885786
actualheight	actualwidth
if you arr using a grid it might work with binding to the parent actualwidth and actualheight

1885812
lisp	scheme
the recursive call is in tail position so both scheme and common lisp will compile this code into a tight loop

1885852
jobs	cron
use special tools that can call shell scripts and force cron jobs

1885873
google-chrome	firefox
this happens consistently in ie8 standards mode firefox 3.0 and google-chrome so i m assuming there is some property of empty inline-block elements that i don t understand

1885917
jquery	scriptaculous
edit it might also be a conflict between jquery and prototype and or scriptaculous

1885951
for-loop	loops
the reason it might be more efficient is that having the size function call inside the for-loop means it would have to go call the function each time it runs the test to see if loops is finished instead of testing against a static value

1885987
ubuntu	linux
how to output a frequency 1khz and power volume 60 in linux ubuntu

for my framework i want to empty disable request array for security reasons and users should only use proper arrays such as post get or cookie

1886119
post	get
even something like below doesn t seem to work it empties even get post etc

1886133
hide	show
can i hide from email to recipient and just show some textual name

1886139
ivar	subclassing
-add an ivar to the uiview subclassing bool hasmoved

1886140
stdout	stderr
use exec.run by specifying pipe as the stdout and stderr if you want

1886140
stdout	stderr
it will return cmd which contains an os.file in the stdout and stderr fields

1886161
post	get
stick to conventions get to pull post to insert data and don t forget _cookie

1886179
for-loop	arrays
when i interate through it using a for-loop javascript turns the arrays key into a string

1886197
for-loop	arrays
the for...in statement should be used to iterate over object properties for arrays use a simple for-loop

1886229
width	height
the div is styled with the height and width of the image with the overflow the second image hidden

1886267
cos	sin
the basic theory is yes you set a timer that moves the image on some sort of interval either fixed or based on some sort of mathematical equation eg sin cos etc

1886308
hide	show
or you can use css to hide that content and show it after a certain point

1886311
post	get
your form could insert update query this table all it likes with post to get the rows into the table

1886315
button	checkbox
for checkbox and radio button use code like this

1886338
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
the menu of an nspopupbutton is an nsmenu

1886468
codeigniter	cakephp
if it s not too late you could use a framework like cakephp or codeigniter that support both

1886493
vbscript	jscript
vbscript unlike jscript doesn t provide any means to get the current routine name

1886520
extjs	sproutcore
sproutcore or extjs are alternatives but sticking with gwt might be a good bet

1886537
width	height
height and width are undefined

1886554
error-handling	exception-handling
the reason for terminate is that exception-handling handling must occasionally be abandoned for less subtle error-handling techniques

1886579
boost	stl
i know i can wrap an stl list but maybe there ready solution in boost

1886637
hide	show
the function you call should be written to hide the flash object and or it s container and display the container with all of your content that you re ready to show

1886637
hide	show
however set the css to only show the div with the flash object then finally use javascript to hide that div and show the one with the content in it

1886810
implements	extends
proxies do not extends classes but they do implements interfaces which you can map on your class implementation through the invocation handler

1886862
bluetooth	usb
i tried via usb only though don t know if bluetooth gonna work

1886880
javassist	cglib
apart from using a jdk dynamic proxy which works only by interface you can use cglib or javassist for extending classes at runtime

1886889
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
what s nice about this new doctype especially is that all current browsers ie firefox opera safari will look at it and switch the content into standards mode - even though they don t implement html5

1886905
put	get
then i want to get all the values after the sign so for the type i want to get openbook and put this in an array

pull	push
my resulting answer is probably a combination of these so points for pointing out how to run a bash script and how to script the pull push

1887382
firefox	safari
the images look nice in safari but they are off about 4 pixels at the top in firefox

1887457
getter	setter
if so just use intellij s feature to fold trivial getter setter and forget about how lines does it take

1887457
accessor	properties
settings - ide settings - editor - code folding - show code folding outline - simple properties accessor

1887506
integer	unsigned
i want python to treat the first byte as an unsigned 8 bit integer

1887506
integer	unsigned
how is it possible to get its integer value as an unsigned 8 bit integer

1887511
src	attr
part of me also thinks it would make sense to just have one copytosibling function where you check this attr src for whether it s left_arrow.gif or right_arrow.gif and act accordingly rather than the two selectors i posted before

1887518
javassist	cglib
as said before i d recommend to look at cglib but there is also javassist which is a class library for editing bytecodes.

1887519
firefox	safari
the getasdataurl part works in firefox and the src what.value part works in ie6 but what would work in safari and does src what.value work in ie7 and ie8 as well

1887615

nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectid
i have a different nsmanagedobjectcontext for each search parse operation and one for the controller and only pass the nsmanagedobjectid between operations or proxy objects

1887687
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
the controller then enqueues the nsinvocationoperation for execution in its own nsoperationqueue

1887721
getter	setter
with other setter and getter methods you can do it better this is just a fast sketch

1887732
put	get
during debugging i realized the file actually does exist by the time i get to checking manually for it - after several iterations it occurred to me that the file doesn t show up until some delay passes by - so i put in the loop below in component b as shown below

1887732
put	get
i put a cfile getstatus in component a immediately before it calls into component b and that indicates success - it can see the file and get its true size yet the call into component b made immediately after can not see the file until the above indicated delay passes

1887735
stdout	stderr
when bash parses your command line it will come upon the clause and redirect stderr to the target of stdout which at this point is still the console or whatever is attached to cron s stdout

1887772
stateless	stateful
since most dev are migrate from coding stateful class we found some of stateless bean actually contain instance variables which themself are stateful

1887799

now if you re manipulating real-world money you d better not use double but int or biginteger

1887876
coldbox	model-glue
try coldbox coldfusion on wheels mach-ii or model-glue

1887882
punctuation	words
i chose w over s because of punctuation and other non-word characters that might constitute a words boundary

1887926
int	double
you can use for int s and double s because they are primitive data types

1887930
ant	maven
maven compiler plugin or ant task doesn t do more than javac does

viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve tried the code both in - void viewdidload and - void viewwillappear bool animated but with the same result

migrate	upgrade
i am developing using sf 1.2.9 using propel orm but i am increasingly being tempted to upgrade to 1.4 least of all i feel it will be less of an effort to migrate a life system from 1.4 to 2.0 later on than from 1.2 to 1.4

1888666
post	get
after about 40 post imports i get a sql error

1888703

1888973
yacc	menhir
the action routines in your yacc or antlr or menhir or whatever... grammar can directly build the abstract syntax tree so the concrete syntax tree only exists as a conceptual entity representing the parse structure of your source text

after reading many related post on this site on the subject of image comparison i m thinking i ll try implementing a pca on each image in order to see if an image is similar or not but i m not sure how to get the data from my images - is there a vb function that i can use to convert the image into an array of bytes or something in order to compare images

1889048
serializable	deserialization
so proto will generate messages class and then for your serializable deserialization it will convert the stream to an object of its own class and your job is to convert the proto object to your actual object or group of objects

1889048
serializable	deserialization
it s a nice way to decouple the actual implementation of the class from the serializable deserialization mechanism imo

1889066
versioning	upgrade
in my opinion you should upgrade your osg to new versioning and try to build it again until you get no exception

1889089
addition	multiplication
where op is a binary operator multiplication or addition

usually on the main page of the blog you only see a section of the post and when you click on the title you get the full content of that blog post

1889390

1889601
int	chars
let me get this straight you re taking a chars string treating the contents of the string as an int value and then trying to use that int value as a pointer to something else assuming that something else is a 0-terminated string

1889626
folder	directory
the problem is that you are strongly coupling the directory structure of the shared folder to all your projects - which is bound to cause you trouble especially if it changes

since there is no paper orientation in ssrs it is assuming this to be a landscape report when it should be a portrait thereby printing the labels sideways

1889713
notepad++	textpad
and when i write a french character such as ã textpad interprets the file as a utf 8 file but notepad++ says it s ansi as utf8 or maybe it s an ansi file but is reading it as utf8

1889713
notepad++	textpad
when i create a file the same way without the french character both textpad and notepad++ read the file as an ansi file even though according to msdn it should be a utf 8 file still

1889713
notepad++	textpad
notepad++ or textpad - notepad++ seems to be more consistant but is still the oppossite to what msdn says it should be

1889758
mktime	strtotime
i can t tell if i should use strtotime mktime

1889845
windows	wow64

1890093
int	boolean	int	double
how would my code change if i wanted to handle not only int my current plan but strings longs double boolean etc etc

1890111

using this list i am trying to implement a business rule where up to 4 children objects will be removed from the list when their parent is of a certain type

1890178
children	parent
put differently if a parent of this type has 20 children 4 of them should be removed from the list

1890186

but if i understood your question correctly you need to hide the bigpic before the load event and on load event show it again

1890198
button	checkbox
and also the fancy form has the right kind of look to the selected checkbox or radio button that i m looking for

1890212
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade will destroy the .net 4.0 configuration all programs that use the default versioning of the clr will no longer work correctly

1890220
equals	icomparable
you could implement this as icomparable or override equals

1890230
referenceequals	gethashcode
since referenceequals works for null parameters so should the comparer s implementation of gethashcode

1890230
equals	gethashcode	referenceequals	gethashcode
referenceequals specifically ignores any overrides of equals so the implementation of gethashcode should use a special method that matches the effect of referenceequals which is exactly what runtimehelpers.gethashcode is for

1890256
superfish	hoverintent
in addition to those i may be using several scripts that are not available on a public cdn like superfish and jquery.approach and hoverintent

1890283
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
yes you can use objectoutputstream objectinputstream for simplicity or you can convert the biginteger to a byte and serialize that value instead of the entire object

1890283
outputstream	bufferedinputstream	outputstream	inputstream	bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream	bufferedoutputstream	inputstream
also if you use stream classes that are not already buffered remember to wrap your outputstream and inputstream in bufferedoutputstream and bufferedinputstream to improve performance and flush after you re done writing if you don t flush the bufferedoutputstream the inputstream may stall or hang waiting for input

1890283
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
if you re worried about bandwidth or file size you can also wrap your streams in gzipoutputstream gzipinputstream for automatic compression

1890300
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
java serialisation objectoutputstream objectinputstream is a general purpose way of er serialising objects into octet sequences

1890321

1890602
folder	directory
and if the versions of mydll are different in the two directory which one ends up in my web s bin folder after a rebuild

1890619
udp	tcp
udp is message oriented such that one recvfrom will get you one complete message whereas with tcp when you read bytes from the socket you could be reading the tail end of one message and the first few bytes of the next message thus the need for delimiters

1890636
versioning	upgrade
i don t know what versioning of mongrel_service you are running but it would be worth seeing if you can upgrade

1890671
hash	md5
how to represent the top 8 bytes of the md5 hash of the bytes of the given string s utf-8 encoding as a long in java

1890678
children	parent
it s been my rule of thumb to always create clustered indexes on parent- child in parent-child relationships like in cities and states to benefit queries that target specific children and queries that fetch all children for a given parent

1890722
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox with firebug and the google-chrome dev tools point out two js errors.

1890726

so why not have an ajax script that listens for keyboard activity and mouse movement and lets the server know that the user is still there and active even if they aren t clicking a submit button or following a link

1891262
getter	setter
uniform access principle - no more getter and setter

1891276
mouse	keyboard
if you put these events on keyboard or mouse clicks how many times are you going to be posting to the server

1891276
post	get
i think the more typical solution to provide a friendly ui so that long post do not get dropped because of a session expiration is to use an auto-save feature

1891280
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as for the javascript this is something you can do with firebug at least for firefox and similar tools are included or can be found for ie google-chrome and safari

1891300
google-chrome	firefox
window.event.srcelement.options window.event.srcelement.selectedindex .value works in internet explorer and google-chrome but not in firefox

let s say i have a class called myclass marked as bindable that is composed of fields each exposing a getter and setter

1891634
versioning	upgrade
anyone who used gettext library for ruby probably noticed that its activerecord integration has been broken with each rails major upgrade because aliased versioning has been following the semantics of an old method

1891994
client-side	server-side
dynamically inserted client-side or server-side

1891994

you will also need to implements a couple more functions that idroptarget extends check out iunknown in your msdn

1892208
inherited	subclassing
this example is a bit looser than the inherited model provided by languages such as java -- an animal instance can have any behaviour at all rather than one of a specific set of behaviours depending on its subclassing

1892225
ubuntu	debian
given a text file in ubuntu or debian unix in general how do i find out the file encoding of the file

1892286
post	get
you can pass arrays in get and post request parameters by indicating the nesting in the parameter name

1892301
int	chars
if your strings happend to be 4 ascii chars or shorter you could store them in a 32-bit int and then do a constant time comparison using a switch statement

1892301
int	chars
if you are able to use 64-bit int then you can compare up to 8 ascii chars

1892301
int	chars
a function to represent up to the first 4 chars of a string as an int could look like

int	chars
is using fchmod int fildes mode_t mode a better idea than using chmod const chars path mode_t mode

1892525
children	parent
ignoring the fact that the data in your given example doesn t match up i think what you re trying to do is store and fetch hierarchical data in a database where you end up with a chain of parent and children

1892525
children	parent
more difficult to implement but you can select an entire set of children parent records in a single select

1892536

from a design perspective if you have classes that need to get at the same closured variables frequently they should probably be part of the same function scope closure or you should expose getter and setter for those closured variables perhaps with the _foo convention that shows they are intended to be used only by your code

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in your applicationdidfinishlaunching method or wherever else you want to add the uinavigationcontroller just use this assuming ghazalviewcontroller is the name of your nib and uiviewcontroller subclass and that navigationcontroller is an instance variable

1895835
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i actually don t like this method of combining the uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller since the tab bar controller must always be visible which can be really confusing sometimes

1895840
mouse	keyboard
cannot be made to appear on a higher z-order than other windows through mouse or keyboard clicks

1895850

in firefox it is possible in google-chrome it in not possible yet but this is a common request from extensions developers so they are working on it google-chrome devs are mainly worried about performances hit

1896075
gridview	rowdatabound
i think that should be done in rowdatabound event of gridview but i don t know how

1896082

1896502
many-to-many	one-to-many
i have two entities that usually have one-to-many relationship but in rare cases should have an opportunity to be many-to-many

1896519
many-to-many	one-to-many
if something is usually a one-to-many but sometimes a many-to-many relationship then it is only a many-to-many relationship not a transient intermediary

1896519
many-to-many	one-to-many
if this is still an issue then maybe consider revising your schema are the many-to-many entities really the same as the usually one-to-many entities or should they be seperate tables all together

1896523
put	get
to get that information you would have to put an app on the pc that the device would talk to and that app would provide the info you re after

1896589
many-to-many	one-to-many
well that s the question we can t answer without a more concrete example how does the nature of the usual one-to-many relationship differ from the â special caseâ many-to-many

1896589
many-to-many	one-to-many
you d end up with every query having to check the one-to-many relation first and then check the many-to-many as well which would be more overhead and would be a much more complicated query to write

1896610
jstl	taglib
it look like that you re using jstl 1.0 with taglib uris of 1.1 1.2

1896610

1896797
min	max
with datetime field being the unqiue and key field i want a query to output min and max date time for each values so that it will show something like below

1896797
min	max
if there are multiple rows with the same min max value then it should get the latest one

1896797
min	max
with inner join on a field i know to get the details of min max row for a field but only way i can think getting everything in one query is to union them all

1896812
versioning	upgrade
or and this this imho the preferred solution upgrade your jstl versioning to match the versioning expected by the jsps use jstl 1.1

1896857
width	margin
each column has a fixed width of 200px with a 20px margin

1896889
setinterval	settimeout
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing

the problem is that all those getter and setter are painful to write especially if i replace foo and bar with real-world data types that have lots of fields

1897306
getter	setter
is there a nice clean way of solving this problem or am i stuck with defining my own getter and setter

1897306
getter	setter
put another way is there a way of connecting the functions created by record syntax up with type classes both the getter and setter

if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

1897818
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
if you mean linux too i would recommend a distro designed for servers like rhel centos rather than ubuntu or fedora

1897840
addition	multiplication
addition and multiplication also have single instructions

1897874
cos	inverse
and you just need the arccos function or inverse cosine applied to cos î to get the angle

1897910
r-tree	quadtree
your r-tree approach is the best approach i know of that s the approach i would choose over quadtree b+ trees or bsp trees as r-tree seem convenient to build in your case

versioning	upgrade
googling indicated that this was due to a versioning mismatch and that i should upgrade to the latest versioning of distribute so i did so to 0.6.10

1898066
superclass	subclassing
in terms of the java language when a subclassing is created the superclass is also constructed either implicitly or explicitly

1898066
superclass	subclassing
so when a superclass has a private member this is still part of the subclassing object in terms of memory jvm etc

1898066
superclass	subclassing
for instance a method on the superclass which uses a private member can be called from the subclassing without problem

1898066
superclass	subclassing
so at some level you could argue that subclassing do have-a private field of the superclass but i d argue this is at a physical level not a conceptual one and can be disregarded

1898078
post	get
build the request string inside flash pump it to javascript and let javascript send it to the server in a post request and get the response back to flash through the callback

1898095

hide	show
the only code in the view should be the required to show hide rearrange populate controls for initial view load and when user is scrolling or clicking show hide detail buttons etc showing hiding parts of the view and to pass any more significant events to the rest of the code

1898197
getter	setter
if the complexity of validation rules is such that merely validating a successful user form fill or incoming message against a list of field regular expressions and numeric ranges and checking any objects against a cached or specially fetched copy of relevant reference objects and or keys is enough to guarantee that updates to business objects will be with integrity and the rules are tested by the application as part of the event handler then the model can just have simple getter and setter

1898197
getter	setter
the simple getter setter approach is in my view preferred when analysing each individual transaction unless the vast majority of updates for your app are complex in which case one can use the facade pattern throughout

1898197
getter	setter
the other way the model ends up getting more complex than a bunch of fields with possibly simple getter setter is if you start enhancing classes getter setter with an o2r mapper tool or adding extra aspects like calls to transaction monitoring apis security apis to check permissions for logging etc accounting apis methods that pre-fetch any related data needed for a get or set or whatever upon get or set

1898203
subtraction	addition
we do however had support for addition subtraction and or and branching for-loop control like branch on equal if you are familiar with mips

1898386
children	parent
i m trying to wait in the parent until all children are completed

1898401
int	chars
you are probably getting trash numbers because you are casting from an int 4 bytes to an unsigned chars 1 byte so if c 255 or 0 you won t be memsetting the values you are expecting to be

1898414
int	chars
the problem here is that you are iterating in a vector of int for example which is 4 bytes but iterating over it using chars pointer arithmetic 1 byte

1898426
sudo	passwd
edit seeing as sudo prompts for a passwd you d might wanna use proc_open which allows you to use pipes

1898470
ant	maven
both ant and maven support this sort of pattern matching

1898479
width	height
anyway i need to define a height and width for each item

1898484
min	max
this can be the center of mass a midpoint between the min max x y and z or any convenient point inside or near the mesh

background-repeat	background-position
the method i usually see is nesting all the divs to layer them then setting the background-repeat and background-position on each one

1898511
innodb	myisam
also know that mysql limits the amount of space set aside for indexes - they can be up to 1000 bytes long for myisam 767 bytes for innodb tables

1898523
nunit	mstest
as far as knowing which assertion fails when there are several in one function you will note that both nunit and mstest give you both a description and a link when an assertion fails that will take you right to the offending line nunit will require an integration tool such as testdriven.net

1898568

1898714
getter	setter
getter and setter

1898714
shadowing	named
to influence the results a little shadowing seems to be the most robust at least in my case where class a extends an abstract class with named defined then b shadows with its own named when applicable

i d like it so that if the user is at #3 and hits the back button they just go to the homescreen instead of back to the splash screen

1898888
ubuntu	debian
for me that would be debian ubuntu others prefer fedora

1898940
goto	break
but sometimes a goto is just fine when it avoids complexity such as extra flag variables to break out of multiple nested loops

1898944
udp	tcp
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

1898950
memcached	ncache
apart from memcached and appfabric velocity there are commercial solutions like ncache or oracle coherence

1898953
short	base
an idea is to survey your proposed customer base so see which linux version they run and make a short list from their feedback

1898968
post	get
that way you can pass that to a query and get newer post

1898971
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
your best bet for a formal package format is probably between deb debian linux derivatives like ubuntu and rpm red-hat derivatives like cent-os

1898977
cvs	rcs
it doesn t have to be rcs but no reason not to dump the cvs rcs repository with the backup

1899019
filesystems	xfs
it was designed for the amazon ec2 environment but the principals apply to any linux system with the xfs filesystems

1899249
width	height
is there is any way to specify the width and height of a form when using form_for

1899276
width	height
the cleanest way is to set an id or class for the form and set the width and height for the form using css

1899276
width	height
set the width and height of the form in public stylesheets application.css

1899276
width	height
you can prevent this by setting overflow scroll in your stylesheet right after the width and height declarations but in most cases you re probably better off letting the form occupy the height it needs

1899296
client-side	server-side
in addition to web deployment projects which will let you merge your entire site into a single dll you can also use a web application project which uses client-side compilation instead of a web site project which does server-side compilation

profiling	instrumentation
i guess profiling might need more permissions so it can reflect instrumentation

1899578
width	height
edited even if you specify width height most browser allow you to allow javascript but not allow it to resize your windows and firefox also allows you to force new windows to new tabs

1899607
folder	directory
if you use zend framework you basically have to copy the zend folder to your lib directory and you are ready to go

by default these strings correspond to a query string value sent with get method attributes or a parameter sent using the post method

1899749
ant	buildr
that said if ant doesn t give you satisfaction in terms of flexibility then i don t see why buildr would be better

1899749
maven	buildr
and don t forget that buildr and ant+ivy have much smaller communities compared to maven

1899833

cifs	smb
i want my html page to link to a directory in a samba share protocol smb cifs windows share

1899859
mockito	easymock	mockito	jmock	easymock	jmock
second if you don t have to talk with the db i d use a general mocking library be it easymock jmock or mockito for example and make the tests not really talk to a db which will usually make tests faster and simpler

1899977
addition	multiplication
with addition and bitwise operations and and or you can implement multiplication in one step per bit rather than having to add as many times as the magnitude of the smaller operator
